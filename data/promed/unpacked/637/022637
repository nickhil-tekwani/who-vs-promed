In Zaporizhzhya, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Lviv and Kharkiv regions [of Ukraine] physicians recorded new cases of botulism, a deadly disease that occurs after consuming substandard products. This was reported in the Hospitible Zaporizhia region.

Patients were reportedly diagnosed with botulism after eating pate, canned meat, and dried fish. Fatal cases have been recorded. Experts also noted that the causative agent of botulism can be contained in home products and advised the public to reduce or avoid the use of dried, smoked, or poorly salted fish, sausages, ham, meat, fish, vegetables, and mushroom preserves.

It should be noted that in 2017, the Zaporozhye region recorded 11 outbreaks of botulism with 14 victims, including 8 cases associated with fish preparation at home and 3 cases of fish purchased in retail chains.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (2). In Ukraine, many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish.
