Re: Bluetongue - Europe (13): BTV-8, fetal viremia
--------------------------------------------------
The observation of what is apparently persistent
fetal infection with bluetongue virus (BTV) is a
very disturbing development which adds to the
enigma of the new BTV-8 syndrome in cattle and
sheep in northern Europe. The subject of
transplacental infection and possible resulting
persistent infection in cattle was a major issue
at the Second International Symposium on
Bluetongue, African Horse Sickness and Related
Orbiviruses held in Paris in June 1991, in part
because the belief that it was possible has been
a major constraint on trade in live animals and
germplasm. The Working Team Report on Germplasm
(by N.J. MacLachlan, G.P. Gard and team, page
994) is worth reading as a summary of understanding at that time.

The Third International Symposium on Bluetongue
held in Taormina, Sicily, in October 2003
revisited the subject. The consensus of opinion
over these 17 years was that manipulation of BTV
by passage in embryonated eggs induces
undesirable attributes in the viruses by
conferring on them the ability to achieve
transplacental infection of the fetus and cause
fetal damage. This is in direct contrast to the
lack of transplacental transmission capability of
'wild' BTV (at least possibly until now).

Therefore the BTV-8 present in northern Europe is
not only unusual in its transmission by novel
vectors and ability to cause frank disease and
mortality in cattle but it seems also to have
acquired another new characteristic -- that of
transplacental infection -- which one would
normally only associate with vaccine viruses.
Could this be taken to suggest that the BTV-8
virus involved is a vaccine strain after all?
Surely urgent attention needs to be given to
defining the determinants of this new situation.

I am attaching some references related to the
matter of BTV transplacental infection in cattle
and changes in virus behavior induced by the
processes involved in laboratory manipulation of BTV viruses.

[Dr. Roeder's reminder of accumulated scientific
evidence that it is the manipulation of BTV by
passage in embryonated eggs which may confer on
the virus the ability to achieve transplacental
infection of the fetus is timely and appreciated.
Roeder's comment on the "lack of transplacental
transmission capability of 'wild' BTV (at least
possibly until now)" is also supported by field
and laboratory observations in Israeli Holstein
heifers during 1971/2, relating to 'wild' BTV
serotypes 4 and 16 (Barzilai et al, 1975. Natural
infection of pregnant cattle with the virus of
bluetongue -- the effect on their progeny. Refuah Veterinarith, 32,1: 1-6).

The following factors deserve attention as well.

1. In the interpretation of the results of sheep
experiments at Pirbright during the 70's (Gibbs
et al, 1970, Res.Vet.Sci., 27: 118-120) -- where
transplacental infection was said to be
demonstrated -- the (albeit few) passages which
the manipulated virus had gone through in the
laboratory previous to its experimental
application in pregnant sheep, deserve to be taken into consideration.

2. Other sources, including the 2007 update of
the Bluetongue data sheet of CFSPH (an OIE
Collaborating Center at the Iowa State
University) claim (probably based upon US-sourced
observations) that BTV infected cows can give
birth to calves with hydranencephaly or cerebral cysts
(<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bluetongue.pdf>).

3. The recent observations in Holland and the UK
that PCR-positive (as well as weak, still-born)
ruminant offspring are now being born to dams
that were infected with bluetongue virus last
year, prompting the proclaimed IAH
investigations, deserve also some clarification.
PCR-based diagnostics should be interpreted with
caution. The PCR procedure will detect
virus-specific nucleic acid, but this does not
necessarily indicate the presence of infectious
virus. According to MacLachlan et al (1994), BTV
nucleic acid can be detected by PCR from the
blood of infected calves and sheep at least 30
days, and sometimes over 90 days, after the virus
can be isolated. When blood that was positive for
virus isolation (infectious) and blood that was
negative for virus isolation but positive by PCR
(PCR-detectable only) were inoculated into or fed
to the vector, _Culicoides sonorensis_, it was
shown that the virus was amplified and
transmitted only by vectors exposed to infectious
blood. Vectors exposed to PCR-detectable only
blood did not amplify or transmit the BTV
(MacLachlan N.J., Nunamaker R.A., Katz J.B.,
Sawyer M.M., Akita G.Y., Osburn B.I. and
Taberchnick W.J. (1994). Detection of bluetongue
virus in the blood of inoculated calves:
comparison of virus isolation, PCR assay, and in
vitro feeding of _Culicoides variipennis_. Arch. Virol., 136: 1-8.).

While keeping the above topics in mind, the
announced IAH research project, addressing the
issue of possible BTV-8 fetal viremia in
ruminants, is essential for decisions on future
bluetongue control policy and its results
anticipated with great interest. - Mod. AS].

Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,
France, Press release [trans. from French by Susan Baekeland, edited]
<http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sections/presse/communiques/michel-barnier-ministre>

Michel Barnier, Minister of Agriculture and
Fisheries has given an assurance that vaccines
against BTV-8 will be made available for animals
intended for Italy. The Italian authorities have
decided upon a clause safeguarding against the
entry into their territory, from France, of
unvaccinated animals from BTV regulated zones.
The safeguard clause came into effect on 4 Mar 2008.

To minimise the impediments arising from this
Italian decision, which affects economically
French parties such as farmers, dealers and
others, the Minister has obtained from the Merial
Laboratory an advanced supply of BTV-8 vaccine
doses with a view to urgently vaccinate the
animals intended for the Italian market during the next months.

Based on statistical information, received at
Departmental levels, 25 000 doses will be
distributed from tomorrow (5 Mar 2008) for 16
Departments in the North East of France infected
with BTV-8 since 2006. A supplementary quantity
of 25 000 doses will be made available within 3
weeks to insure the 2nd injection within the
prescribed intermission of 3 weeks.

For other departments, the needs for each
department are currently being evaluated
precisely to allow for a distribution of 175 000
doses available early next week. Similarly, they
will revaccinate after 3 weeks.

The breakdown by department doses for the
following months will be the subject of
consultations with business leaders on the basis
of statistics to be discussed at the next
follow-up Bluetongue committee. Negotiations have
also continued with the Italian authorities in
order to obtain an alleviation of the measures taken by Italy.

[As communicated in another press release, dated
5 Mar 2008, the BTV-1 mass vaccination campaign
in (southern) France will commence in March 2008.
The mass vaccination with the BTV-8 vaccine is
planned to commence on 8 Apr 2008 in most
regions. This has been become feasible due to the
tender launched at the end of 2007.

According to an AP newswire kindly forwarded by
rapporteur Mary Marshall, the EU veterinary panel
approved on Wed 5 Mar 2008, 72.5 million euro
(110 million USD) for an emergency BTV
vaccination plan in certain European countries;
see
<http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8V7EBK01.htm>.
The commencement and scope of the mass
vaccinations in the BTV-8 affected countries will be followed.

During the said meeting of SCFCAH (Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
Section: ANIMAL HEALTH & ANIMAL WELFARE), held in
Brussels 4-5 Mar 2008, the UK delegation
presented an update of the BTV-8 situation in the
UK, which included information on the
PCR-positive offspring of dams imported to
Northern Ireland and Scotland, territories free
of BTV, from infected territories in continental
Europe. The presentation is available online at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_45032008_uk.pdf>.
