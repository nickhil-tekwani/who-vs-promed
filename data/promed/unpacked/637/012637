[1] Africa: variants
Date: Wed 14 Apr 2021

The new coronavirus variant that emerged in South Africa late last year [2020] and quickly spread around the world could complicate efforts to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control. Not only does the variant, known as B.1.351 or 501Y.V2, seem to be more infectious. Evidence is growing that its mutations may help it elude immune responses triggered by vaccines and previous infections.

At least one vaccine that South African officials had begun to stockpile has proven (1) largely ineffective at preventing mild-to-moderate COVID-19 due to B.1.351. Whether that jab -- the vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford -- offers any protection against severe disease caused by the new variants remains unknown. Health experts in South Africa are now debating the merits of continuing with mass immunization plans.

One leading voice in favour of a vaccine rollout is Shabir Madhi, director of the Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Analytics Research Unit at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who has been leading COVID-19 vaccine trials in the country.

Trials of other vaccine candidates in South Africa have demonstrated a life-saving benefit of immunization (2), even though they showed decreased efficacy against B.1.351 in mild cases, he notes. Given similarities in the design of all the vaccines tested, Madhi suspects that the AstraZeneca/Oxford shot would likewise confer protection against severe illness. In the absence of an alternative, he argues, not giving the vaccine to people at high risk of COVID-19 complications "doesn't make much sense". "You've got a vaccine that is safe," Madhi says. "The worst-case scenario is that the vaccine really doesn't protect against severe disease, in which case those individuals would be topped up with another vaccine that might become available."

A rapid spread
--------------
Houriiyah Tegally, a bioinformatician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, agrees that large-scale vaccine distribution should remain a top priority. She has tracked the dynamics of B.1.351 and seen how quickly new variants can spread. "We're kind of seeing Africa being left behind," Tegally says. "There needs to be higher attention paid to vaccinating the continent if we don't want worrying variants to evolve."

She and her colleagues -- led by Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) -- 1st detected the B.1.351 variant in mid-October [2020] in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The variant then quickly moved into neighbouring provinces, becoming the dominant lineage at a time of spiking case counts in the country.

Genomic and epidemiological analyses, described (3) by the KRISP team this month in Nature, found that the variant had an adaptive advantage over other forms of SARS-CoV-2, because of increased transmissibility, better immune evasion tactics, or both.

Those traits probably explain why B.1.351 has overtaken other variants in nearly all of southern Africa -- with corresponding surges in infections. Zambia, for example, saw its case count rise more than 16-fold in December [2020], just as researchers first detected the variant and found that it quickly accounted for nearly all infections (4).

"The levels were stunning," says Daniel Bridges, a Lusaka-based biochemist with the public health nonprofit PATH, who led the Zambian study. "It's looking like B.1.351 is dominant." A similar trend is seen in Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, according to publicly available sequence data. Worldwide, more than 60 countries have reported cases of B.1.351 to date.

"It's spreading very fast," says Tapfumanei Mashe, a molecular epidemiologist at the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory in Harare, who identified the B.1.351 variant in 69% of viral samples sequenced in December 2020 and 95% of samples analyzed in January [2021] (5). Now, he is concerned about the impact of the variant on vaccination campaigns.

Compromised immunity
--------------------
Laboratory tests on the B.1.351 variant have found it to be more resistant to antibodies produced by current vaccines or antibodies from the blood of previous COVID-19 patients.

All vaccines evaluated so far in South Africa have proven to be less effective against the B.1.351 variant than they were against other variants elsewhere -- and laboratory experiments show one reason why. In a test tube, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization compared to other variants, either from therapeutic antibody drugs, antibodies found in the blood of COVID-19 survivors (6) or antibodies elicited by vaccines now in wide distribution (7,8,9).

Those are ominous findings, but as Mashe points out, all relevant lab and field studies performed to date have involved vaccine platforms in which just part of the virus -- namely, the spike protein or its coding sequence -- is used to teach the immune system how to recognize and attack SARS-CoV-2.

B.1.351, with its 8 mutations in the spike protein, including 3 in the critical receptor-binding domain, seems especially adept at circumventing those types of spike-centric, vaccine-induced defenses. Yet, whether the variant equally hobbles other vaccine platforms -- such as those built around killed versions of the entire virus particle -- remains to be seen.

A total of 3 such inactivated virus vaccines are now approved for use in Zimbabwe, where health officials have already begun to vaccinate tens of thousands of people. In theory, "you've got the whole virus there, so you're likely to have a range of antibodies" against targets outside the spike protein, notes Naor Bar-Zeev, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, who works on vaccination campaigns in Africa. "What we don't know is whether, in practice, this is true," says Mashe.

Broad protection
----------------
One potential upside of the new variant is that an infection with B.1.351 seems to elicit antibodies that are active against both original and newly emerging forms of SARS-CoV-2, even though the inverse is not necessarily true (10).

Penny Moore, a virologist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, suspects that the immune system recognizes B.1.351 differently than it does other variants, leading to the induction of antibodies that act at sites shared broadly across different viral lineages. "It's entirely possible that the targeting has fundamentally shifted."

That could bode well for efforts to develop new vaccines or more effective therapeutic antibodies. With a little tweaking to take B.1.351 into consideration, current countermeasures can be modified and may yet put an end to the pandemic. But as Tegally points out, "more mutations are cropping up." Just as Africa gave the world its most worrisome variant documented to date, the region remains "a breeding ground" for next-generation variants to come -- that is, unless the global health community makes the COVID-19 response in Africa a greater priority.

[The World Health Organization (WHO) says African countries are running out of supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, and there is concern over the availability of further doses. So far, 7 countries have already exhausted the vaccines they received from the UN-backed Covax scheme. And some countries have not been able to use AstraZeneca vaccines before their advertised expiry date.

Deliveries of vaccine supplies under the Covax programme started in February [2021], and most countries in Africa have signed up and received vaccine doses. Some countries are also getting donations from China, Russia, the UAE and India.

The Covax initiative has so far delivered 18 million vaccine doses to 41 African countries, according to WHO. A few countries have not joined in. But WHO says Rwanda, Senegal, Ghana, Togo, Tunisia, Eswatini, and Botswana have already exhausted their initial supplies from Covax and will need to wait until early May to mid June [2021] for more. This follows a decision by the Indian government to restrict the export of vaccines following a spike in COVID-19 cases there. Most Covax supplies to African countries have been coming from India.

WHO regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, says there is hope supplies to African countries could resume in early May [2021].

The Covax programme - backed by WHO and other multilateral bodies - aims to supply 600 million doses to Africa, enough to vaccinate at least 20% of the population. But even with the initial deliveries, Africa lags far behind the rest of the world in vaccinations. The continent has only administered 2% of all the vaccine doses administered globally so far.

Some African nations got AstraZeneca vaccines donated via an arrangement between the South African-based MTN mobile communications company and the African Union. The vaccines had been bought from South Africa, which had decided against using them after purchasing them. Zimbabwe rolled out its vaccination programme using vaccines donated by China. It switched to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after deeming it more effective against the variant [1st detected in South Africa].

But several other countries who were given these AstraZeneca doses did not manage to use them before they expired on [13 Apr 2021]. Malawi has been left with about 16 000 of doses out of 102 000, while South Sudan was left with 59 000 doses of the vaccine. Ghana and Sierra Leone were also left with some doses. WHO has now advised those countries to store the vaccines pending further guidance, rather than dispose of them.

The manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India, says the vaccines could still be used up to 3 months after the listed expiry date, although the WHO has yet to endorse this. ...-more (https://www.bbc.com/news/56100076)]

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/03/japan-nurses-voice-anger-at-call-to-volunteer-for-tokyo-olympics-amid-covid-crisis


The organisers of the Tokyo Olympics have sparked anger in Japan's medical community after they asked 500 nurses to volunteer at this summer's Games. The request came as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and organisers pressed ahead with plans to hold the Games, even as the coronavirus pandemic continued to worsen in the host nation, amid warnings that the event could place an intolerable strain on exhausted health workers.

The total number of COVID-19 deaths in Japan recently passed 10 000 - the highest in the region - while media reports said the number of people with severe COVID-19 symptoms reached a record 1050 at the weekend.

Medical staff in Tokyo and other areas where cases are surging say their professional focus must remain on coronavirus patients and people with other illnesses who have had their treatment delayed due to the virus.

Osaka prefecture, the epicentre of Japan's 4th wave, has run out of beds for seriously ill patients, with other people suffering from the virus forced to spend hours waiting in ambulances before they can be admitted.

[3] Brazil: case update

Brazil on [Thu 29 Apr 2021] became the second country to officially top 400 000 COVID-19 deaths, losing another 100 000 lives in just one month, as some health experts warn there may be gruesome days ahead when the Southern Hemisphere enters winter. April was Brazil's deadliest month of the pandemic, with thousands of people losing their lives daily at crowded hospitals.

The country's Health Ministry registered more than 4000 deaths on 2 days early in the month, and its 7 day average topped out at above 3100. That figure has tilted downward in the last 2 weeks, to less than 2400 deaths per day, though on [Thu 29 Apr 2021] the Health Ministry announced another 3001 deaths, bringing Brazil's total to 401 186.

Local health experts have celebrated the recent decline of cases and deaths, plus the eased pressure on the Brazilian health care system--but only modestly. They are apprehensive of another wave of the disease, like those seen in some European nations, due to a premature resumption of activity in states and cities combined with slow vaccination rollout.

Less than 6% of Brazilians have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to Our World in Data, an online research site. President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now being investigated by a Senate panel over his administration's handling of the crisis, has repeated he will be the last to get a shot and he has attacked mayors and governors who enforce restrictions to control the virus' spread. Shortly after the grim landmark was published, Bolsonaro said in a live broadcast on his social media channels that "a big number of deaths has been announced", adding that he is "sorry for every death". But he repeated his stance against social distancing measures. "I pray to God so there is not a 3rd wave" of the coronavirus, the president said. "But if the lockdown policies continue this country will be dragged to extreme poverty."

Epidemiologist Wanderson Oliveira, one of the Health Ministry's top officials at the start of the pandemic, said he expects a 3rd wave to hit by mid-June [2021]. He told radio station CBN on [Tue 27 Apr 2021] that the country's immunization effort won't prevent a new surge because many people won't receive shots before winter, when indoor gatherings and activities are more common even in the tropical nation. "Our vaccination is such that in 2022 maybe we will have a much less tragic summer than we did now," he said, referring to the last few months. He added he expects limited help from local leaders' partial shutdowns, which have yielded weaker results than European-style lockdowns. Many Brazilians flouted social distancing recommendations and partial shutdowns even in the throes of the pandemic's peak.

Brazil's vaccination program, though a far cry from its triumphant campaigns of decades past, has slowed the pace of deaths among the nation's elderly, according to death certificate data published on [Mon 26 Apr 2021]. Younger people remain unprotected, and have begun falling ill in far greater numbers as a more transmissible variant circulates in Brazil.

Adding to concerns, Brazil's Health Ministry has repeatedly cut its outlook for vaccines in the short term. The country's 2 biggest laboratories are facing supply constraints for imports from producers in China and India, which has become the pandemic's global epicenter.

[Brazil has suffered 193 COVID-19 deaths for every 100 000 people since the pandemic began -- higher than the United States' 176 deaths per 100 000 people, and 16 deaths per 100 000 people in India, where the virus is currently raging out of control.

Brazil continues to lag behind fellow South American countries such as Chile and Uruguay, which increasingly see their neighbor as an epidemiological threat. (excerpted from https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/03/americas/brazil-covid-deaths-2021-intl/index.html). - Mod.LK]
