[According to the report above, a total of 82 926 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 7 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (11 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases involve 6 locally transmitted cases in Jilin, and a single imported case reported by Shanghai. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1692 imported cases reported.

There were 8 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 7 locally acquired cases and 1 imported case. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 750, and 37 of these are importations from abroad. I realize this is repetitious mentioning this on a daily basis but..... It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic, in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past week or so, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported -- Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown. The worrisome observation vis a vis the cluster in Wuhan is that the virus had most likely been circulating there undetected until the cluster was identified.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 26 cases and 1 death compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (11 to 12 May 2020) when there were 27 newly confirmed cases and 2 deaths. A total of 10 962 confirmed cases and 259 deaths were reported today (12 May 2020), up from 10 936 cases and 258 deaths yesterday (11 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 40 consecutive days and below 50 for 33 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 5 days. Of concern is that all but 4 of the newly confirmed cases were locally transmitted today (12 May 2020) and 5 yesterday (11 May 2020). 12 of the 26 newly confirmed cases were in Seoul, and 3 were in Busan and Daegu (in Busan all 3 were locally transmitted, in Daegu, 2 of the 3 were locally transmitted), Incheon had 2 locally transmitted cases, and Gyeonggi had 2 cases, 1 locally transmitted), and 1 each in Ulsan, Jeonbuk, Gyeongnam, and in quarantine. Cases in Ulsan, and those in quarantine were the imported cases, the remaining 2 cases were locally acquired. Presumably the new cases in Seoul are associated with the Itaewon nightclub cluster.

The Itaewon club district cluster in Seoul, had 119 cases now identified (as of 00:00 13 May 2020) associated with the district, including club attendees, and their families and coworkers.

Figure 1: Daily confirmed cases by chain of transmission covers the period 1 Apr 2020 through 12 May 2020, on the English language page is striking in the 10 day period with minimal local transmission and predominant importation, and the recent shift (5-12 May 2020) when local transmission replace the majority imported cases. Even more striking is the same breakdown for Seoul City, where one sees 22 Apr 2020 to 9 May 2020 with no locally transmitted cases and then the spike in locally acquired cases (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030)

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be a main problem, but the growing Itaewon nightclub cluster is a major concern at this time. With the outbreak associated with the Itaewon club district in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps.

Cases in Italy as of 6:00 pm 12 May 2020 CET
--------------------------------------------
Intensive care patients are on the decline. Continuing downward trend in new cases, increase in new positives due to a recalculation of the Lombardy Region of 419 cases that refer to more than a week ago.

This is what can be seen from the health monitoring data on the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] released at 18 [hours on 12 May 2020] .

Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus on the national territory:
- 221 216 cumulative cases, increase of 1402 from 11 May 2020
- 81 266 people are currently positive for the virus;
- 109 039 people have recovered;
- 12 865 patients are hospitalized with symptoms, 952 in intensive care, and 67 449 are in home isolation;
- 30 911 deaths have been reported; however, this number can only be confirmed after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of death.

Case distribution by province: number of cases (number of new cases in past 24 hours):

Lombardy: 82 904 (1033)
Piedmont: 28 889 (113)
Emilia-Romagna: 26 929 (53)

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 221 216 cases, including 30 911 deaths, up from 219 814 cases and 30 739 deaths reported on 11 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 11 and 12 May 2020 was 1402 newly confirmed cases, compared with 744 newly confirmed cases between 10 and 11 May 2020, an increase from previous days' declines, but attributable to Lombardy increasing a previous count by 419, which would still have an increase to 983 newly confirmed cases. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 88.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 73.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Piedmont is the only other province reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 10 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (1 province, Bolzano, reported no new cases), and another 8 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna, is the only province reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 63 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 62 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

Iran's death toll from the novel coronavirus has reached 6733 after 48 more people died from the virus overnight, the health ministry announced on Tuesday [12 May 2020].

Kianush Jahanpur, head of Public Relations and Information Center of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, said 1481 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 110 767. According to the data, the number of recovered patients is 88 357, while 2713 people are still in critical condition in hospitals.

The number of administered lab tests across the country is 615 477 so far, said Jahanpur.

Iran announced its 1st cases of COVID-19 on [19 Feb 2020].

[In the 24 hours from 11 to 12 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 109 286 to 110 767, an increase of 1481 compared with 1683 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (11 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6685 to 6733, an increase of 48 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Russia, the UK, Italy, France, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature. A caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so relying on the daily number of deaths at this point may be premature as well. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

In another media report, there is mention that 50% of hotels would be opened for business travelers. "The shutdown cost Iran's hospitality industry 45 trillion rials (some USD 1.1 billion at the official rate of 42 000 rials [to 1 USD]) over the past 3 months," he noted (Jamshid Hamzehzadeh, the head of the Association of Iranian Hoteliers). "We have not made an official announcement in this regard, but hotels in each province are reopening under their condition and coordination with local health departments. Since business trips have commenced, if hotels are not opened, people may go to unauthorized centers, which may lead to harmful consequences," he said. "We are implementing the health protocols previously announced by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts." Briefing on practical health policies carried out in hotels, Hamzehzadeh said "For example, we have declared that a hotel room is disinfected and remain empty after 48 hours of passenger use. Another issue that is important for us is the emphasis on employee health. Also, each passenger should pass through the diagnostic tunnel when entering a hotel." In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry has declared new guidelines and instructions to ramp up the safety in particular for "emergency or work travels" in hotels, guest houses, eco-lodge unites, tourist destinations, transport facilities, recreational centers, and restaurants.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 411 017, including 83 425 deaths, an increase from 1 385 834 cases and 81 795 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 348 655 (24.7%) cumulative case reports and 1504 (6.0%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 184 319 as of 1:15 PM on 12 May 2020, including 15 101 confirmed deaths and an additional 5136 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (4014 -- 15.9% of total), California (1735 -- 6.9%), New York (1504 -- 6.0%), Texas (1011 -- 4.0%), New Jersey (942 - 3.7%), Florida (941 -- 3.7%), Massachusetts (870 -- 3.4%), Pennsylvania (849 -- 3.4%), and Georgia (846 -- 3.74%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Georgia.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Spain, Russia, UK, Italy, France, Brazil, Germany, New Jersey, and Turkey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 Illinois, 13 China, 14 Massachusetts, 15 India, 16 Peru, 17 Canada, 18 California, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. Illinois has now surpassed China in terms of cumulative case counts, and Russia is now the 2nd globally. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City itself would be between Italy and France (it would be number 6).

The US military has confirmed 8130 cumulative cases, with 84 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 11 464 cumulative cases and 301 new cases today (12 May 2020). There have been 3629 cases reported from federal prisons (no new cases in the past 24 hours) and 3204 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (231 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2299 cases (43 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Virginia with 730 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Minnesota with 695 newly confirmed cases, Maryland with 688 newly confirmed cases, Iowa with 539 newly confirmed cases, and Indiana with 500 newly confirmed cases. 27 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are now available in Table 4, which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 426 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24-hour period from 11 to 12 May 2020, bringing the PCR [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 228 030 [269 520] as compared with 227 436 [268 143] confirmed cases on 11 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 27.93, a continual slow decrease over the past 23 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 27.93 today (12 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 228 030 [269 520] cases, an additional 513 cases have been hospitalized (a doubling of the increase noted yesterday 11 May 2020), and an additional 24 cases were admitted to ICU. 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7329841,43. Castile and Leon, Catalonia, and Navarre, all in the northern part of the country, are the most affected communities by population-based rates. - Mod.MPP]
