G-8 Summit Meeting: Outbreak of Illness Inside Security Zone
------------------------------------------------------------
Dozens of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers working
at the site of this week's G-8 summit meeting became nauseous early on
Monday, and some were taken to a Calgary hospital. Constable Rob
Dunnett of the RCMP said the officers at Nakiska camp, inside the
security zone established at the Kananaskis resort where the summit
begins on Wed 26 Jun 2002, "fell ill with symptoms commonly
associated with food poisoning" during the night. He said 4 were sent
to a hospital and "approximately 30" were treated at Nakiska camp.
Those treated at the camp were isolated and their symptoms appeared
to be improving, Dunnett said.
The cause of the outbreak was unknown, Dunnett said. Doug Fraser, a
spokesman for the Foothills Hospital in Calgary, about 55 miles east of
Kananaskis, said 3 people were admitted with flu-like symptoms with
another possibly on the way. Fraser was unable to confirm that those
admitted were RCMP officers, due to confidentiality rules regarding
patients. "From what I understand, they're sick. They've got nausea and
vomiting," he said.
Thousands of police and soldiers are based in the Kananaskis area for
the 2-day summit of leaders of the world's industrial powers, including
President Bush. The security forces have closed off the mountain
resort, which is accessible by only one paved road. Vehicles entering
the resort are searched at a series of roadblocks and then escorted by
police.

[The description of this outbreak suggests that the illness could be the
consequence of Norwalk-like virus infection, rather than malicious
intent. NLV-contaminated food doesn't look or smell contaminated, nor
does the water. Summit food handlers should take special care not to
spread infection to the world leaders. Further information would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP/JW]
