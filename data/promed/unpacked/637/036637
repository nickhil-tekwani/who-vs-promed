The Ministry of Health confirmed the 5th case of hantavirus [infections] in the Araucanía region so far this year [2016].

The individual is a 50-year-old woman living in the rural area of Cunco, who had her 1st [medical] visit [for her illness] this past [27 Jul 2016] in the Los Laureles area, she was then referred to the Hernán Henríquez Regional Hospital in Temuco, from there, she was moved to the hospital in Chillán, where she remains hospitalized with a guarded diagnosis.

The Araucanía Health SEREMI [Regional Ministry of Health], Carlos González, indicated, "Sadly, in this winter season when previously it was unusual to have cases of hanta[virus infection], we now have the 5th case. This is the 2nd in a community like Cunco."

"We hope that the development of this patient, who today [4 Aug 2016] is in the hospital in Chillán for reasons of biosecurity, because there they have beds for adequate management, will go well," he added.

Epidemiological teams are currently carrying out investigations in order to determine where the woman could have been infected and thus avoid new infections.

[Active transmission of hantaviruses in the Araucanía region continues into the cool season. Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, it doubtless is Andes virus. Much of central and southern Chile, including the Araucanía region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus.

The report above provides little information about the circumstances under which the woman acquired her hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
