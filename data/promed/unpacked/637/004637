A 6-year-old Caledonia, Minn., boy has become the year's 1st
confirmed case of La Crosse encephalitis in the region. The onset of
the mosquito-borne [virus] disease was reported 11 Jul [2010], and
the boy was hospitalized in Rochester, Minn., until last week, said
Dave Geske, La Crosse County Health Department mosquito control officer.

[_Aedes_ or _Ochlerotatus_] triseriatus, the mosquito that carries La
Crosse encephalitis [virus; LACV], was found in water on a tarp and
in open bins close to the boy's home, Geske said. The boy's home also
is near a woodland area within 50 yards of traps set up by Geske's
staff to catch mosquitoes, he said. "Houston and Winona counties are
hotbeds for [_Ae_] _triseriatus_ in Minnesota," Geske said.

The risk for La Crosse encephalitis has increased this year, he said.
As La Crosse endures its 3rd-wettest summer on record, "the potential
is great for a bad encephalitis year," Geske said.

"Anything that collects water outside is filled with water. ...
Normally this time of the year, containers are dry," he said. [Basal
tree holes in hardwood trees are protected and replenished by summer
rains so usually retain water throughout the summer, and are ideal
and very common breeding places for _Ae. triseriatus_. - Mod.TY]

The La Crosse area averages 4-6 encephalitis cases every summer, with
the peak months in August and September. La Crosse encephalitis
affects the nervous system and causes acute inflammation of the
brain, with a 5 to 20 percent death rate among children. [CDC reports
that fatal cases are rare, less than 1 percent. Neurological sequelae
in encephalitis survivors have been reported in some cases. - Mod.TY]

While it's a bit early to have a 1st encephalitis case, Geske said he
has seen June cases in past years. The 1st 2009 case came in mid-August.

"The important thing now is to make sure anything, from traps to
containers, needs to be emptied," Geske said. "We can't have water
standing around." [Emptying water catchments near areas of human
dwellings and activity is helpful, especially discarded tires.
However, finding and emptying basal trees holes in extensive woodland
areas is logistically impossible in this area. - Mod.TY]

[ProMED thanks Dr. Swancutt for bringing this report to our
attention. Normally, ProMED does not post reports from endemic areas
where cases occur commonly. The above Minnesota case occurred in the
heart of the LACV endemic area, but is a bit early. However, given
transovarial transmission of LACV in its _Aedes (reclassified as
Ochlerotatus) triseriatus_ vector, infected females emerge in
mid-June and are ready to transmit the virus to vertebrate hosts,
including humans, so early cases are not surprising.

LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of
the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease
cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas (1) in
the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern
Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio and (3) the central
Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North
Carolina (see the CDC map at <http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html>).
There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA. The CDC
has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution
and clinical characteristics (<http://www.cdc.gov/LAC/index.html>).
