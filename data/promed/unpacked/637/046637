Abstract
--------
An HIV-positive man from Zimbabwe living in South Africa sought treatment for multiple clinical signs, including fever, weight loss, anemia, and splenomegaly. We identified in his blood an African rodent piroplasm, _Anthemosoma garnhami_, related to _Babesia_ species. This finding extends the known geographic and host range of _A. garnhami_.

A 24-year-old man from Zimbabwe complaining of a 3-month period of generalized body pains, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. He had no notable previous medical history and was found HIV-positive.

Malaria-like objects found on the blood smear prompted referral for specialist opinion at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in Mdantsane, South Africa.

Thin blood film photographs showing _Babesia_-like early tetrads and pleiomorphic later-stage parasites [for photos refer to the source URL above].

Concurrent rapid malaria antigen tests were negative. On the basis of microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears a diagnose of babesiosis accompanied by hemolytic anemia was made.

The multiply infected erythrocytes and unusual morphology suggested nonmalaria parasites and were later determined to be the rodent piroplasm _A. garnhami_, related to _Babesia_ spp.

The patient received a 10-day course of oral clindamycin and quinine (each 600 mg every 8 h). After 2 weeks, all symptoms improved markedly; splenomegaly was reduced to 5 cm below the costal margin and hemoglobin substantially improved.

DNA extracted from anticoagulated whole blood tested negative for _Plasmodium_ spp. by multiplex real-time PCR for malaria. We used a nested conventional PCR assay for the _Babesia_ species 18S RNA gene (1) and applied bidirectional Sanger sequencing to the 400-bp product, showing sequences shared across members of order Piroplasmida. We used PCR with 18S RNA universal primers to refine this result. (2). The ≈1700 bp product sequence (GenBank accession no. MW276138) had 99.15% identity and a subsequent sequence (accession no. MW276139) from a recrudescence, 99.03% identity with the murine piroplasm _A. garnhami_ (accession no. MH093637.1; Appendix Figure [available at the source URL above]).

The patient returned for treatment 14 months later. He had not traveled outside of South Africa since his initial treatment. He was again pale and had an enlarged spleen. His hemoglobin was 59 g/L, and we again observed intraerythrocytic piroplasms on the blood smear. His CD4 count was now 195 cells/mm3 and HIV viral load 304 copies/mL. He was admitted for intravenous clindamycin and oral quinine (each 600 mg every 8 h) as part of a 6-week treatment plan. The patient responded well clinically and hematologically to treatment.

_A. garnhami_ is an erythrocytic murine parasite, first described in spiny mice (_Acomys percivali_) in Ethiopia in 1969 (3). Because it shares characteristics with Haemosporidia and Piroplasmida, its classification was long debated, but on the basis of ribosomal RNA analysis of archived _A. garnhami_ samples, it was finally assigned to the piroplasms, as the sole species of the family Anthemosomatidae (3). The parasite was identified again in 2 different rodent species in Namibia (4,5). Ixodid ticks serve as vectors of piroplasms and therefore are likely vectors for _A. garnhami_; experiments failed to demonstrate transmission by several tick and mosquito species (3). _A. garnhami_ is closely related to the babesids in the Piroplasmida order, hence the similar microscopic appearance and the good clinical response in this case to clindamycin and quinine, drugs used to treat _Babesia_ spp. Babesiosis in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, is more severe and more likely to recur (6). The recrudescing clinical course of this _A. garnhami_ infection was probably exacerbated by the patient's advanced HIV disease.

Our report establishes a likely epizootologic similarity between _A. garnhami_ and _Babesia_ spp., suggesting the potential for _A. garnhami_ to cause zoonotic infections in humans. Although babesiosis in domestic animals is common in Africa and _B. microti_ has been found in nonhuman primates in East Africa (7), only single reports from southern Africa (8) and Equatorial Guinea (9) have described human _Babesia_ spp. infections. The conjunction of high concentrations of ticks, animals, malaria, and HIV-infected humans in Africa makes it possible for piroplasm infections to be misdiagnosed as malaria, which poses potentially serious clinical consequences for immunocompromised patients.

[The parasite was first described in 1969 (Landau I, Boulard Y, Housin R. _Anthemosoma garnhami_ n. g. n. sp., 1st Dactylosomidae known in mammals. C R Acad Sci Hebd Seances Acad Sci D. 1969; 268(5): 873-875). It is placed in the phylum Apicomplexa, which also include _Plasmodium_ species, _Babesia_, _Theileria_, and _Toxoplasma_, among others. The parasite is most probably transmitted to humans from its animal reservoir by ticks. The infection would probably not be able to cause clinical symptoms had the patient not been seriously immunocompromised. - Mod.EP
