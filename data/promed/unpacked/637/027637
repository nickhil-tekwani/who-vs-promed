Nine Louisiana horses with Eastern equine encephalitis
------------------------------------------------------
NEW ORLEANS: Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has struck 9 horses in
Louisiana, 8 of them in the last 2 weeks. Tests are still out on several
more horses, assistant state veterinarian Martha Littlefield said on Thursday.

"Triple-E's a much more serious disease than West Nile," Littlefield said.
"When horses get it, they don't recover."Nine of 10 horses die from EEE;
survivors almost always have neurological problems. It is much rarer in
people -- fewer than 160 cases have been diagnosed since 1964 -- but kills
3 out of 10 human patients, with neurological problems likely in the rest.

No people have been diagnosed with it this year in Louisiana. Two each in
Georgia and Florida have been diagnosed, and Alabama officials are Waiting
on results of tests on 2 more people. Just as worrying as the threat of
EEE, Littlefield said, is the fact that 1 shot vaccinates horses against
not only that virus but 2 or 3 other viruses which cause encephalitis and
against tetanus. [Generally EEE is packaged in a single injection also
containing western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis and tetanus toxoid.
This vaccine needs to be given twice initially and annually thereafter. ­
Mod.TG] If horses haven't been vaccinated for EEE, they also are
susceptible to the other diseases. One New Orleans horse specialist gives a
vaccine for flu, tetanus and 3 forms of encephalitis for USD 20 a shot.

"Unfortunately, the vaccine against Eastern equine encephalitis has to be
administered a couple of months before the horse is exposed," to give its
immune system time to respond, said Dawn Wesson, a Tulane University
entomologist.

Most of the infected horses have been in West Louisiana: 2 in DeSoto
Parish, 1 in Sabine Parish, and 2 in Allen Parish -- all 3 near Vernon
Parish -- and 1 in Webster Parish. There also was 1 each in Ouachita,
Orleans, and Assumption parishes. Eight either died or had to be
euthanized. The survivor was a 2 month old foal in New Orleans, Littlefield
said. "It's probably going to have some neurological damage," she said.

The mosquito which transmits EEE among birds is a swamp-dweller, hard to
get to for mosquito control. But those which spread it from birds to people
and horses are the same ones likely to spread West Nile virus, said Dawn
Wesson, a Tulane University entomologist. This means people can take the
same precautions around their horses that they take around their houses,
making sure water doesn't stand around in pots, buckets, bottle lids or
other containers. "Horse troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding
habitat and should be flushed at least once each week to reduce mosquitoes
near the paddock area," an LSU AgCenter brochure advises. "The use of
residual insecticides for treating mosquito resting areas around homes and
livestock premises is helpful, too."
