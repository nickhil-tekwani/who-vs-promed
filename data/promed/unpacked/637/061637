Research reports on bovine tuberculosis in badgers published
------------------------------------------------------------
Research reports related to the control of bovine tuberculosis [TB] in
badgers have been made public today [8 Nov 2010].

DEFRA has made public supporting data behind the successful licensing of
the 1st tuberculosis vaccine for badgers (BadgerBCG), which was licensed by
the Veterinary Medicines Directorate in March this year [2010]. The studies
were carried out by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) and the Food
and Environment Research Agency (FERA).

The laboratory studies with captive badgers demonstrated that the
vaccination of badgers by injection with BCG significantly reduces the
progression, severity, and excretion of _Mycobacterium bovis_ infection.

A key finding of the field study, conducted over 4 years in a naturally
infected population of more than 800 wild badgers in Gloucestershire, was
that vaccination resulted in a 74 per cent reduction in the proportion of
wild badgers testing positive to the antibody blood test for TB in badgers.

The blood test is not an absolute indicator of protection from disease, so
the field results cannot tell us the degree of vaccine efficacy. While the
findings indicate a clear effect of vaccination on badger disease, data
from the laboratory and field studies do not lend themselves to giving a
definitive figure for BadgerBCG vaccine efficacy. Nor do they provide
information on the effect of badger vaccination in reducing TB incidence in
cattle.

A scientific paper summarising the results of the injectable BCG badger
vaccine research has been accepted for publication by the scientific
journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B (Biological Sciences) and will
be published shortly.

Professor Glyn Hewinson, head of the TB Research Group at the VLA, and
Professor Robbie McDonald, head of the Wildlife and Emerging Diseases
Programme at FERA, said: "VLA and FERA are very proud to have conducted the
programme of work on BadgerBCG and that a vaccine is now available for use
in the field as one of the tools for tackling bovine TB. In making the data
available today, we hope that people will be able to see for themselves the
detailed research that went into the development of the vaccine and
understand the opportunities and challenges of using vaccination."

DEFRA is also publishing today [8 Nov 2010] the results of new computer
modelling by FERA, which has examined different strategies for controlling
TB in badgers, including both culling and vaccination.

The results of the modelling were consistent with the conclusions of the
Randomised Badger Culling Trial indicating that there were both positive
and negative effects of culling. The modelling shows that badger
vaccination could make a positive contribution to disease control in its
own right and was consistently positive when used in combination with
culling in a ring vaccination strategy.

The results of the modelling were that:
- a combined strategy of vaccination in a ring around a culling area was
more successful than the cull-only strategy, which in turn was more
successful than the vaccination-only strategy, both in reducing the number
of TB infected badgers and cattle herd breakdowns. Ring vaccination partly
mitigated the detrimental effects of culling. However, the combined
strategy requires about twice as much effort than either single approach
done in isolation.
- culling of badgers should continue for at least 4 years to realise a
clear benefit. However, low rates of land access for culling, or low
culling efficiency, or the early cessation of a culling strategy was likely
to lead to an overall increase in cattle herd breakdowns (whilst this is
not the case for vaccination).

Notes
-----
The results of the research have been published on the DEFRA website and
are available at <http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/diseases/tb/>.

The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) issued an authorisation for
BadgerBCG vaccine on 24 Mar 2010. VLA is the market authorisation holder
and the vaccine is manufactured by the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark.

VLA is an executive agency of DEFRA. It is a regional network of 16
veterinary laboratories including a central facility near Weybridge in
Surrey. VLA provides a wide range of applied research and consultancy on
livestock diseases and surveillance of new and emerging diseases for the
government and animal health industry. It is also a national and
international reference laboratory for many farm animal diseases including
avian influenza, bovine tuberculosis, classical swine fever, and TSEs
[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies].

FERA is another executive agency of DEFRA. Its remit is to provide robust
evidence, rigorous analysis, and expert professional advice to government,
international organisations, and the private sector, in order to support
and develop a sustainable and secure food chain, a healthy natural
environment, and to protect the global community from biological and
chemical risks. FERA has the largest group of wildlife management
specialists in the UK. This along with extensive facilities and resources
has positioned their scientists as leaders in wildlife management and
disease control. FERA is responsible for the coordination of the Badger
Vaccine Deployment Project.

The coalition government has committed to publishing a balanced and
comprehensive bovine TB eradication programme early in 2011. In preparation
for that a public consultation on our proposed approach to badger control
is currently under way. The consultation document is available on the DEFRA
website and closes on 8 Dec 2010.

[I am uncertain from this posting whether it is possible to differentiate
naturally infected from vaccinated badgers, without killing them. If the
vaccinated badgers are fitted with electronic chips, that should solve it.-
