A suspected Ebola fever outbreak in the Orientale Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo has claimed [the lives of] at least 6 people in the last 3 weeks. 7 suspected cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever have been reported in Isiro and Monga health zones in Orientale Province. One of the deaths was reported in Mongo health zone while 5 others occurred in Isiro Zone.

According to Dr Marrie-Josee Karani, the head of the office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Kisangani, samples from the suspects were sent to the Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa and are yet to confirm the outbreak of the deadly virus. He however says the symptoms presented by the victims are similar to those of Ebola fever and asked the population to be extra careful. He also asked the locals to desist from eating wild [animal] meat and to isolate patients who show signs of Ebola fever.

If confirmed, this will be the 2nd time that the virus has hit the area in less than a year. In November 2012 the deadly virus claimed 30 people in the territory of Isiro, Orientale Province.

The disease was later declared to have been contained at the end of November 2012 by Congolese public health Minister Felix Kabange Numbi.

[The Orientale Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been the site of recurrent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease. The most recent suspected outbreak in 2013 remains unconfirmed [see ProMED archives below].

The current suspected outbreak has not yet been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis and appears to be involving a small number of people in 2 separate health zones. More detailed information would be welcomed.

Orientale is one of the 10 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It lies in the north east of the country and borders Equateur province to the west, Kasai-Oriental province to the south west, Maniema province to the south, and Nord-Kivu province to the south east.
