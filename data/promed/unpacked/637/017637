Pig infection studies with influenza A (H1N1) associated with global
epidemic in humans
An EU funded study through an EU project consortium coordinated by
VLA-Weybridge

Preliminary summary - update 1, 29 May 2009
-------------------------------------------
1. Study aims
To investigate infection dynamics, clinical outcome, pathogenesis,
host susceptibility, and transmissibility of influenza A (H1N1)
[associated with global epidemic in humans, hereafter referred to as
influenza A (H1N1)] in pigs.

2. Study design - Overview
Group A: 11 pigs directly inoculated aerogenically into the nasal
passages with influenza A (H1N1).
Group B: Mock-inoculated control pigs (n=2); non-inoculated control pig (n=1).
Groups C-F: 8 non-infected pigs, which were sequentially introduced
in pairs for contact transmission (at monitored intervals) with
infected pigs (see below).

Transmission dynamics were initially established by placing the 1st
pair of contact pigs in the same room as the directly infected pigs
at dpi [day post inoculation] 2. The 1st pair of contact pigs
remained in contact until virus shedding in both contacts was
established (approx. 72 hrs). The 1st 2 contact pigs were then
removed to a separate room and 2 more naive pigs were introduced with
the 1st pair of contact pigs (2+2) until shedding was established.
This process has been repeated for up to 4 cycles of transmission.

3. Monitoring and procedures
3a. Full clinical assessment: daily, including temperature
determination and weighing.
3b. Sampling: daily oropharyngeal, nasal, ocular, and rectal swabs.
Between days -1 and 4, plus day 7, blood samples were collected daily
to assess viraemia and acute phase protein production. Twice-weekly
blood sampling for humoral antibody response determination.
3c. Necropsies: 2 pigs from group A were removed and a full post
mortem examination (PME) performed on day 1 (one pig only), and days
2, 3, 4, and 7 post-infection. A full range of tissue specimens was
collected.

4. Preliminary results
[NB. Please note these results are preliminary and may be subject to
modification once full analyses are complete. Therefore, they should
be used as a guide only at this time].
4a. Clinical signs: included nasal discharge, pyrexia (temperature
higher than 39.5 deg C [103.1 deg F]), respiratory signs (cough
mainly, some increased respiratory rate), ocular discharge, lethargy,
and inappetence. Limited morbidity. Clinical scores peaked at dpi 4-6
with progressive recovery evident (n=2) after dpi 7. For in contact
animals, pyrexia was evident from day post-contact (dpc) 5-9.
Clinical signs appeared milder than in those pigs directly infected.
4b. Virus shedding: determinations by real-time RT-PCR; all
inoculated animals became infected and shed virus mainly via the
naso-pharyngeal route from dpi 1-9, peak shedding occurred between
dpi 3-5. Oral and ocular shedding was detected intermittently, but
rectal shedding was not detected. Shedding appeared to have ceased by
dpi 10. No viral RNA was detected in plasma samples collected between
day -1 and dpi 7.
4c. Gross pathology: necropsy at dpi 2 revealed only a mild/moderate
catarrhal rhinitis with no gross pulmonary pathology. At dpi 3 and
dpi 4, PME of pigs (n=2 each day) revealed no evidence of rhinitis
with only minimal lung pathology (discrete, rare focal areas of
lobular consolidation). At dpi 7 more extensive gross lung lesions
were present, characterised as an acute lobular bronchopneumonia with
associated marked lymphadenopathy in the bronchial and
retropharyngeal lymph nodes.
4d. Transmission: The contact animals developed similar profiles to
the directly infected animals, particularly after transmission cycles
1 and 2 (72 hour contact period). Evidence of successful transmission
was apparent between both the direct infected and 1st pair of contact
animals (transmission cycle 1), and between the 1st and subsequent
pairs of contact pigs (transmission cycles 2, 3, and 4), based on
RRT-PCR shedding profiles. For transmission cycle 1, shedding peaked
at dpc 3, and for transmission cycle 2 at dpc 5-6, with shedding
apparently ceased by dpc 6-9. Transmission cycles 3 and 4 appeared
substantially delayed (3rd cycle greater than 4 days).

5. Preliminary analyses: summary conclusions
Pigs are susceptible to infection with influenza A (H1N1) virus that
results in the induction of detectable levels of clinical disease,
virus shedding, and pathology in an experimental setting.
Importantly, mortality was not a feature and infected animals were
able to transmit the virus to naive contact pigs successively for at
least 3 cycles of transmission, suggesting the virus could become
established in susceptible pig populations if introduced.

[The preliminary experimental infection trials in domestic pigs with
the influenza A (H1N1) virus strain responsible for the recent
worldwide human epidemic (also named "novel Mexican North American
Californian swine-like influenza A (H1N1) virus of swine origin"; see
also "To baptise a virus and its disease", available online at
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19225>)
shows that this strain behaves in pigs as a mild swine influenza
strain.

The clinical and gross pathological changes seen were rather similar
to those seen in mild cases of "Swine influenza" (also called "hog
flu" and "pig flu"), which -- senso stricto -- is an animal
disease, caused by a specific porcine virus, namely swine influenza
virus (SIV). SIV is present in all pig-producing countries. When more
pathogenic strains are involved, severe economic consequences may be
expected; this does not seem to be the case with the current
human-adapted strain, at least not in experimental conditions.

Similarly mild disease was observed in the Canadian commercial pig
holding, where infection was introduced by a human patient. Unlike
avian influenza, swine influenza is not a notifiable or statutory
disease and it is not listed by the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE). Pig keepers and their veterinarians are therefore
responsible for dealing with outbreaks of influenza in pigs to
safeguard the welfare and productivity of their animals.

The relatively short virus shedding period, seemingly restricted to
the naso-pharyngeal route, falls in line with the Joint FAO/WHO/OIE
Statement of 7 May 2009 on influenza A (H1N1) and the safety of pork
(see ProMED-mail post 20090507.1710).

According to the statement, pork and pork products, handled in
accordance with good hygienic practices recommended by the WHO, Codex
Alimentarius Commission and the OIE, will not be a source of
infection. The statement indicated that authorities and consumers
should ensure that meat from sick pigs or pigs found dead is not
processed or used for human consumption under any circumstances. -
