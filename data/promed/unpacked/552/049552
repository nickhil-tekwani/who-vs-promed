BioReliance Corp. has teamed with OraVax, Inc. in a contract from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the development and
stockpile production of human smallpox vaccine. OraVax has been awarded a
20-year contract from the CDC as prime contractor to develop and
manufacture a new smallpox vaccine and has estimated the total amount of
the contract at $343 million. The vaccine will be used to create a national
civil defense stockpile for the purpose of countering the threat of
bioterrorism.
To support this program, BioReliance has agreed to provide GMP, large-scale
manufacturing services for the bulk drug and final drug product as well as
testing services to support the development and production of the vaccine.
The prime contract calls for the initial production of a 40 million dose
stockpile. The first deliveries of licensed vaccine to the stockpile are
anticipated by OraVax in mid-2004. The contract also requires sustained
production through the life of the contract both to replace out-dated doses
and to be able to respond to increased demand on need. During the first
phase of the contract- award through FDA approval-development is to be
funded on a cost-plus-fixed fee basis, subsequent to which the deliverables
under the contract will be on the basis of a firm-fixed-price.
This civil defense contract is an integral part of the U.S. government
initiative to protect the country against the hostile use of biological
agents. In August 2000, BioReliance announced that, under a separate
agreement, it has been awarded a contract from DynPort, LLC in support of
the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) of the U.S. Department of
Defense (DoD), to develop and manufacture smallpox vaccine to establish a
U.S. military stockpile. The CDC contract vaccine will be used to create a
national stockpile for use primarily with the civilian population in
countering the threat of bioterrorism.

The CDC plans to hold the new vaccine in reserve, only to be used for the
control of smallpox in the event of a confirmed case of smallpox infection.
The vaccine may, however, be used with laboratory workers directly
handling vaccinia or related poxviruses.

[When the destruction of remaining smallpox virus stocks in Atlanta and
Moscow was put on "hold" until further information became available, it was
essentially inevitable that the fertile mix of politics, general mistrust,
and common sense would lead to the need for adequate vaccine stores. These
contracts address those perceived needs. It seems likely that a great deal
more work will now be done to understand smallpox virus (_Variola major_)
and that a commensurate amount of information about this remarkable disease
agent will be forthcoming. - Temp.Mod.CHC]
