[In virtually all the postings on anthrax in Argentina we have quoted their technique for disposing of carcasses in a region of Argentina essentially devoid of trees, and therefore of timber to burn a carcass with. They developed this singular system for decomposing the carcass, which generates an internal acid pH lethal to _B. anthracis_ vegetative cells, and preventing access to scavengers by covering it with a tarpaulin. Originally the carcass was first covered in agricultural lime but lime is no longer used as it might encourage spore survival. As others might need to use a similar carcass disposal, I requested a copy of the instructions that they provide for their vets in the field. As some of you may lack a facility in Argentine Castilian Spanish both Spanish & English versions are supplied, with thanks to our colleagues in Azul. - Mod.MHJ]


Elimination of carcasses of animals killed by Anthrax
------------------------------------------------------
Technique: Controlled Cover

Objective: To dispose of the animal killed by anthrax at the same place where its death occurred.

Avoidance of the dispersal of spores of B. anthracis capable of surviving in the environment, and able to infect a new susceptible animal.

Adressed at: Rural veterinarians

Basics
------
Complete the survey for the usual bacterial flora present in the rumen and intestines of cattle and the environment with _B. anthracis_, the pathogenic flora causing of animal death by septicemic and toxigenic action.

Create a controlled environment, where the maximum temperatures of the day, and minimum of the night, produce a pasteurization effect on the pathogenic vegetative bacterial flora _B. anthracis_.

Inactivate the pathogenic spores of _B. anthracis_ using 5 percent formaldehyde.

Prevent the dispersal of anthrax spores through the actions of scavengers (foxes, armadillos (_Chaetophractus vellerosus_), and chimangos (_Pharcoboenus chimango_) and caranchos (_Caracara plancus_) - both species of bird of prey in the family Falconidae - by spraying with 5 percent formaldehyde and covering with the plastic sheeting.

Favor the decomposition and destruction of organic tissues through the actions of bacterial enzymes (proteolytic, lipolytic, etc.) produced by the usual bacterial flora.

Necessary materials
-------------------
1. Protection of the field operators:
Disposable overalls
Wellington boots
Disposable gloves
Disposable chinstrap Type 3M 9332
Eye shields type MSA Dual Field
Disposable bag for pathogenic waste

2. Cover proper:
Pressure liquid-sprayer, volume 5000 ml
Black polyethylene sheet, over 100 microns thick, 6 m long x 3 meters wide
Formaldehyde 40 percent, 1000 ml
Container graduated in ml
Water in 5000 ml can
Spade.

3. For the deactivation of the cover and contents:
Gas oil (Red Diesel) 5000 c.c.
Security matches

Technique
---------
1. Preparation of the Controlled Cover:

- Complete the "Epidemiological Survey" form. Remember to identify the livestock establishment with your RENSPA number. Identify if possible, latitude / longitude with GPS or mention the railway station, place or nearest town.

- Prepare the 5 percent formaldehyde for your spray: add 250 milliliters of formaldehyde 40 percent to the sprayer, fill with water to 5000 milliliters, close, shake, add pressure.

- Spray the entire animal with the 5 percent formaldehyde solution, soaking the entire body surface and surrounding area, and specifically areas of natural openings (nose / mouth and anus / vagina) should be emphasized because of the possible loss of blood in these areas.

- Spread the black nylon sheet between two people on either side of the carcass; deploy it starting from the animal's head; and fix the edges of the black polyethylene with soil dug from around the edge, until reaching and covering the rear end of the animal.

- Check the "Controlled Cover" periodically. If you notice any breakage of the black polyethylene, the hole should be covered with another piece of polyethylene over the original cover. The "Controlled Cover" under these conditions must remain in place for 240 to 260 days or around 9 months, time enough for the destruction of all the organic matter of the carcass (only bones should remain).

2. Deactivation of the Controlled Cover:

After 240 to 260 days of Controlled Covering and once all organic matter has decomposed, leaving only the bones, any remaining spores are deactivated by burning all the bone material and the black polyethylene that covers it. We advise taking all the safety measures before starting the fire. Perform the burning of the fire on a day without wind.

- Make 3 openings in the black polyethylene tarpaulin: (A) head, (B) middle of the carcass, (C) hindquarters; pour 5 liters of the gas oil divided equally between the 3 openings.
- Light each hole with caution - best done with a piece of cloth tired to a stick. Burn thoroughly until there are no bones left. This could possibly take many applications. Push the bone remains together, add more fuel until totally burnt.
- Spray the entire surface of the ground where the Controlled Cover was with 5 percent formaldehyde (5000 milliliters).
- Have a 10 kg BC Type fire extinguisher and a fire-flapper in place to control any fire dispersion.

3. Precautions

The personnel involved must take all the necessary precautions to avoid contamination by _B. anthracis_, both in the preparation and deployment of the Controlled Cover. The contamination routes can be: of the skin, or "cutaneous anthrax" (use gloves); by inhalation, or "pneumonic anthrax" (use chinstrap); or by ingestion, or "enteric anthrax" (do not use knives that you later use for food).

4. Tips not to forget

- Use: disposable gloves, disposable overalls, chinstrap, eye protection, and rubber boots.
- At the end of the task, disinfect them with 5 percent formaldehyde. Bag up and discard the disposable gloves, chinstraps and other elements. Wash your hands properly.
