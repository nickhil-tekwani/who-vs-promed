A 25-year-old woman has tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus in Egypt's Nile Delta, bringing the number of cases in the most
populous Arab country to 38, state news agency MENA said on Sunday
[22 Jul 2007]. MENA quoted a Health Ministry official as saying the
woman developed a high fever on Friday [20 Jul 2007], after exposure
to dead household birds.

A 25-year-old woman from northern Egypt has been diagnosed as having
contracted the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, the Health Ministry
announced on Sunday [22 Jul 2007]. The woman from the coastal town of
Damietta went to her local hospital on Saturday [21 Jul 2007]
complaining of high temperature, Ministry spokesman, Abdel Rahman
Shaheen, told the official MENA news agency. She was diagnosed as
having contracted bird flu and was sent to Cairo where she is being
treated with Tamiflu, he said. The woman had been working with
domestic poultry, which had exhibited symptoms of the disease. Others
in her family are now being tested.
She became the 38th case of the virus [disease] reported in Egypt
since the 1st outbreak was announced in February 2006. Women and
children have borne the brunt of the virus [disease] due to their
role in taking care of domestic fowl.
A 10-year-old girl died of bird flu earlier in June [2007], bringing
to 15 the number of fatalities in Egypt. Egypt's geographical
location on major bird migration routes and the widespread practice
of keeping domestic fowl near living quarters have led to it being
the hardest-hit country outside of Asia. The government says it is
conducting a vigorous campaign to combat the spread of the virus
through vaccinations and raising awareness, but cases continue to appear.
In June [2007], the World Health Organisation said the fight against
bird flu has improved around the world, but the situation remains
critical in Egypt and Indonesia where the risk of the H5N1 virus
mutating into a major human threat remains high. Egypt and Indonesia
remain high-risk [areas] because of the permanent contact that many
people in both nations have with domesticated birds.
