Abstract
--------
The zoonotic disease anthrax caused by the endospore-forming bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ is very rare in Germany. In the state of Bavaria, the last case occurred in July of 2009 resulting in 4 dead cows. In August 2021, the disease reemerged after heavy rains, killing one gestating cow. Notably, both outbreaks affected the same pasture, suggesting a close epidemiological connection. _B. anthracis _could be grown from blood culture, and the presence of both virulence plasmids (pXO1 and pXO2) were confirmed by PCR. Also, recently developed diagnostic tools enabled rapid detection of _B. anthracis_ cells and nucleic acids directly in clinical samples. The complete genome of the strain isolated from blood, designated BF-5, was DNA-sequenced and phylogenetically grouped within the B.Br.CNEVA clade that is typical for European _B. anthracis_ strains. The genome was almost identical to BF-1, the isolate of 2009, separated only by 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms on the chromosome, one on plasmid pXO2 and 3 indel-regions.

Further, _B. anthracis_ DNA was detected by PCR from soil-samples taken from spots where the cow had fallen onto the pasture. New tools based on phage receptor binding proteins enabled the microscopic detection and isolation of _B. anthracis_ directly from soil-samples. These environmental isolates were genotyped and found to be SNP-identical to BF-1. Therefore, it seems that the BF-5 genotype is currently the prevalent one at the affected premises. The contaminated area was subsequently disinfected with formaldehyde.

[The outbreak in 2009 was in Bayern and involved soil from a building site being dumped onto a pasture where the index case occurred. If you unknowingly dig up an old, buried anthrax carcass along with the associated contaminated soil, this can result in new anthrax cases in livestock where the digging or soil disposal occurred. The spores can then survive among the root cilia of the pasture. Rain will initiate germination and spore availability when the area is grazed. The positive environmental samples in this case came from where the recent carcass had lain with and extravasated contaminated blood.
