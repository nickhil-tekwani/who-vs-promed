More cattle will have to be tested following confirmation of tuberculosis
(TB) in a wild elk near Riding Mountain National Park. The Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA) recently confirmed an elk shot in an area north of
the park last winter had the disease. The agency expects to know in a
matter of weeks whether another elk shot south of the park last winter also
had TB.
The presence of TB in the park's wild elk herd has caused some aggravation
for cattle producers in the area. They worry bovine TB might be transmitted
from the elk to their herds.
In 1997, a cattle herd south of the park was destroyed because of the
disease. Producers see a double standard, where TB is tolerated in wild elk
but infected cattle herds are slaughtered.
Blaine Thompson, a CFIA veterinary specialist, said notices have been sent
to livestock producers in an area north of Riding Mountain telling them
testing of their herds will start sometime after calves are weaned.
However, Thompson said the same kind of testing is not expected for cattle
herds south of the park if the elk shot there tests positive for TB. Cattle
there recently completed testing due to the discovery 2 winters ago of an
infected elk. There was no TB among the 2 dozen livestock herds tested.
"It doesn't seem practical at this point to go back and retest again,"
Thompson said.
It takes at least 3 months to confirm a TB infection. The latest
indications are that the second elk was infected.
TB in the wild elk herd has also caused some angst for the province's elk
growers. They are concerned animals captured near the park during the final
year of the province's elk capture program will one day be sold into farmed
herds.

[TB can be spread by respiratory droplets where the animals congregate to
eat hay. However, starvation of animals is not an option either. Generally
these outbreaks occur during the winter months when supplemental feeding is
necessary for animals. Preventing wild animals from feeding on hay in a
pasture situation is difficult, as is movement and control of wild
animals.- Mod.TG
[In addition to the threat of transmission of tuberculosis to cattle, there
have been publications that reported that there is a risk of transmission
from elk directly to humans. See:
