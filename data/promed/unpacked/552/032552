[2] Challenges
- Sat 12 Jan 2019 DRC: Ebola staff attacked by residents of Marabo [Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/01/12/actualite/sante/rdc-le-personnel-charge-de-la-lutte-anti-ebola-agresse-par-des-habitants


A group of angry residents assaulted a team of humanitarian workers responding to Ebola in Marabo on [Fri 11 Jan 2019), 40 kilometers [25 mi] southwest of Bunia (Ituri). According to medical sources, protesters opposed the construction of an isolation center for suspected cases of Ebola in their entity.

Students at Nyankunde High School also emptied the classrooms following rumors of another team of aid workers arriving to vaccinate children against the disease.

Some residents of Marabo, mainly taximen, threw stones at a team of humanitarian workers who came to start the construction of an isolation center in a health facility of this entity. They believe that implanting this center is a way to bring Ebola virus disease into their bodies to decimate them.

Local health officials say the police have been deployed as a matter of urgency to disperse protesters. They deplore strong resistance from the population against Ebola response measures in the Nyankunde health zone [Ituri].

A caregiver at Nyankunde Hospital reports that 2 students, who were found to be Ebola positive, escaped from the facility 3 days ago. This situation worries this staff, who fear the exponential spread of this epidemic in the region.

A total of 25 doctors and nurses, who have been in contact with an Ebola patient, are under observation in Nyankunde for the prevention of this disease.

- Sat 12 Jan 2019. Logistical challenges in the DR Congo Ebola virus response

[Byline: Miriam Shuchman]

From Greg Folkers (https://twitter.com/greg_folkers)
.@Lancet: Logistical challenges in the DR Congo Ebola virus response
The ongoing outbreak in the DR Congo has recently surpassed 600 cases. To fight this outbreak, the Ebola response team faces many logistical challenges. Miriam Shuchman reports:

Late last November [2018], around the time the Ebola virus outbreak in the DR Congo's North Kivu province became the world's 2nd largest outbreak of Ebola virus, the country marked the end of a 30-day period in which its Ministry of Health recorded 130 new cases of Ebola virus disease. More than 80 of these cases were not linked to any known case.

To Canadian Ebola expert Gary Kobinger of Laval University in Quebec, this was "really bad" because it meant there were many individuals infected with Ebola virus in the community whom disease trackers had not found -- missing links in the chains of transmission of the virus.

This Ebola virus outbreak has now taken more than 370 lives, and one of its most troubling aspects in addition to ongoing security concerns is that most cases are not linked to a known chain of transmission.

Nevertheless, some strategies developed to staunch the spread of Ebola virus during prior outbreaks are not being used in the DR Congo and other tools are used ineffectively. "It's a partial response", said Kobinger, who was in the DR Congo working with its national laboratory, the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB), during a smaller Ebola virus outbreak last May and June [2018].

Given the unresolved transmission chains, Kobinger is surprised the DR Congo is not using portable gene sequencers in the field. Although these do [not] sequence the Ebola virus as accurately as an in-laboratory sequencer would, portable sequencers are considered a powerful tool for identifying new chains of transmission that link one infected person to the next.

Pierre Formenty, leading Ebola expert at WHO, pushed for their use during the west Africa Ebola crisis of 2013-16, but in this outbreak, sequencing of the virus is largely done at the INRB in Kinshasa, about 3000 km [about 1864 mi] from the North Kivu city of Beni, the outbreak's centre.

A notable difference from the situation in west Africa is that the DR Congo has considerable experience with Ebola: its national lab director is Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, the renowned Congolese virologist who first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, and its Health Ministry have managed previous outbreaks of Ebola virus. As a result, Congolese leaders are the major decision makers in this outbreak. In the case of portable sequencers, Formenty told The Lancet, "the national lab has chosen to go for a less innovative approach for sequencing and a more particular method, and it was their choice".

Formenty is working with a Congolese team on another newer tool, post-mortem screening of so-called community deaths. In Beni, the team is approaching every family that has experienced a death from any cause, asking to swab the mouth or throat of the corpse for a post-mortem Ebola screening test, a strategy that was valuable for figuring out where new cases were occurring in west Africa.

But in the DR Congo, post-mortem screening has been one of the key challenges. Of the expected 50 community deaths per day in Beni, only 5-10 are tested for Ebola virus, with the fraction even lower in the larger city of Butembo, according to a review in early December [2018] that the DR Congo Ministry of Health conducted with WHO and other partners.

The team then brought in a novel rapid diagnostic test for Ebola virus that can be done on the spot, similar to an over-the-counter pregnancy test. The OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test by Pennsylvania-based OraSure Technologies was trialled in Guinea in 2015 and, applied to corpses there, gave excellent results. In the 1st week of using it in the DR Congo, the team use this test to screen 20 bodies post-mortem. Results were obtained within 30 min, while confirmatory swabs to the lab were also sent to the lab for standard Ebola testing by PCR. Then came a crisis: a day or 2 after negative rapid tests led to traditional burials for 2 families, the standard test in the lab returned positive results.

WHO authorities credit the vaccination programme with the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine for controlling the outbreak. The programme has vaccinated more than 55 000 people since August 2018, but it has faced delays due to disorganisation and security issues.

The vaccination programme has evolved. Initially, the DR Congo Ministry of Health and WHO organised vaccinations, but now Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) also vaccinates front line workers and, occasionally, the Ministry contacts MSF to ask for additional vaccinators, said Yap Boum of MSF Epicentre. At one point, the surveillance team had a dataset for identifying individuals eligible for vaccination and the vaccination team had another, leading to concerns over inconsistencies, so a joint data information unit was created in late October, according to the DR Congo Strategic Response Plan.

Today, each Ebola treatment unit in the DR Congo has a vaccination team linked to it but the need has grown and the Strategic Response Plan calls for 5 more vaccination teams. WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarević told The Lancet that WHO's electronic database shows more than 90% of eligible people have been vaccinated. In general, Formenty said, whether and where more resources are needed is "a question we are discussing every day".

The biggest hurdle to effective treatment remains that patients do not arrive at treatment units until they are quite sick. "They are afraid to come; they are scared of the treatment so they are coming very late", said Christophe Clément, a French critical-care physician who was in the DR Congo in August 2018, working for ALIMA [Alliance for International Medical Action].

Another problem is that clinicians and laboratory technicians are operating on different timetables.

With around 60% of people in the DR Congo who are infected then dying from the disease, ALIMA is discussing the use of a form of dialysis known as renal replacement therapy, said its President Richard Kojan, a Congolese physician. Rob Fowler, a Toronto-based critical-care physician and WHO consultant. For him, renal replacement therapy is as an obvious next step to bring the DR Congo's mortality rate closer to the 18% seen among expatriates treated for Ebola virus disease during the west Africa crisis, because those patients received organ support. Kojan said that the DR Congo health authorities have already approved the plans. Clément will lead the process along with a team of expert nurses, but with the DR Congo Government having shut down the internet across the country amid the wait for results of the presidential election, the team is waiting until the security situation improves.

- Sat 12 Jan 2019 Jeremy Farrar's [Director of Wellcome Trust] personal reflections on visit to North Kivu [excerpt, edited]
https://twitter.com/JeremyFarrar/status/1084077688732766208

Personal reflections on visit to Beni, Butembo, Komanda in North Kivu #DRC #Ebola with @DrTedros & team @WHO [28 Dec 2018-4 Jan 2019] -- huge thank you to everyone who made the trip possible -- inspiring, humbling and insightful

Incredible dedication & commitment all teams-hugely impressive & humbling very difficult & at times frightening environment - dedicated, committed teams from #DRC, @MinSanteRDC, across Africa, Ukraine, Bangladesh from @WHO, @WFP, @MSF @AlimaOng @MONUSCO, @UN, @SamaritansPurse

What are the risks? The biggest risk is that the security situation gets worse & the critical public health interventions are interrupted, people migrate because of violence & Ebola spreads across DRC or across borders, the next month is critical.

My reflections -- we should prepare for this epidemic going on for many months, we should prepare for good & bad scenarios and not be surprised by either, as always we should be prepared to deal with the unexpected, an unrelated epidemic Ebola or other elsewhere as we deal with this.

Trust in the community is at the heart of every public health response, can take years to build & can be lost in an instant, communication & understanding of community beliefs & their involvement critical.

Infection control in all settings, clinical facilities, triage, safe burials, community settings is absolutely crucial.

Access to rapid diagnostics & real time sequence of virus to inform about transmission chains & true scale of the epidemic would be invaluable. The best care possible, fluids, oxygen, critical care, and when possible assessment of the 4 potential drugs for Ebola.

Personal view -- vaccine made huge difference to epidemic, reduced number patients & geographic spread, protected health care workers & given hope -- but we need more. I believe @JNJNews vaccine should be fast tracked via study & deployed & used complementary way to @MSDInvents vaccine

[Johnson & Johnson (@JNJNews) conducted a 1st-in-human clinical trial of a preventive Ebola vaccine in development at its Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies. The trial is being led by the Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics. The vaccine is a prime boost vaccine, thus requires 2 doses. This could be challenging with the current difficult of even administering a single dose. - Mod.LK]

What more is needed -- continued strong support of neighbouring countries -- Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi have kept borders open, provided staff logistics & support -- they deserve huge credit. Continued surveillance in these countries & across DRC for spread of this epidemic or a new event.

[3] Diagnostics

A new development in molecular biology is a step towards enabling mobile and instant diagnosis of viruses like Ebola or Zika in the field. The Oxford Nanopore MinION device can sequence DNA and RNA in real time, and researchers at the French agriculture research center CIRAD [Center for International Development in Agricultural Research] have found a way to use the device as a tool for identifying plant viruses and potentially animal and human viruses too.

The researchers at CIRAD were searching for a way to diagnose viruses quickly and early in the infection process, so they could avoid the time consuming and potentially dangerous process of transferring contaminated samples to a lab. They struck on using the portable sequencer MinION device, which in the last few years since its development has become a common tool for biological analysis techniques like de novo sequencing, targeted sequencing, metagenomics, and epigenetics. The CIRAD team were able to both test and validate that the device could be used in plant virology, making it an invaluable potential tool for diagnosing viruses in real world outbreaks.

"Using a diseased yam plant, it took us just a few hours to sequence the entire genome of 2 single-strand RNA viruses, a macluravirus and a potyvirus," CIRAD researcher Denis Filloux said in a statement. This fast and accurate diagnosis technique is a 1st step to providing real time detection of chronic viruses with a mobile device which can be used even in isolated and remote areas.

A key aspect of virus outbreak management is shortening the time between taking a sample of a possibly infected plant and diagnosing it as carrying a particular virus. With this development, this process can be achieved in a shorter time to help public health officials to detect potentially harmful outbreaks at an earlier stage than was previously possible. With the new technique, the device will be able to examine the whole genetic structure of a virus quickly: "The technology is characterized by the production of long nucleotide sequences, which makes it possible to sequence the entire viral genome," Philippe Roumagnac, a virologist with CIRAD, said in the statement.

This technology would be especially valuable in developing countries where there is often a lack of laboratories which can diagnose viruses and limited understanding of how to manage outbreaks and transport contaminated samples.

[According to their website (https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion), the MinION weighs under 100 gm and plugs into a PC or laptop using a high-speed USB 3.0 cable. No additional computing infrastructure is required. Not constrained to a laboratory environment, it has been used up a mountain, in a jungle, in the Arctic, and on the International Space Station.]

[This would allow for rapid, point-of-care diagnosis as long as the instrument is affordable and healthcare workers know how to use it and interpret results. If that is the case, it would be extremely valuable in rapid diagnosis and commencement of treatment or if the patient is not infected with Ebola, separating them from infected individuals. - Mod.LK]

A US healthcare worker who was being monitored for the Ebola virus after treating patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo was released from a Nebraska hospital on [Sat 12 Jan 2019] after doctors said they had seen no signs of the deadly disease.

The individual, whose name was not released for privacy reasons, did not develop Ebola symptoms during 21 days of monitoring at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, the center said in a statement.

Symptoms such as fever and abdominal pain may appear up to 3 weeks after contact with the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The healthcare worker arrived for monitoring in Omaha on 29 Dec 2108 [Exposure was 21 Dec, vaccination 22 Dec]

Officials said the individual left the city on Sat [12 Jan].

If symptoms had developed, the medic would have been moved to the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, one of only a few in the United States for treating highly infectious and dangerous diseases.

The Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo is the second worst ever and has killed 385 of the 630 people likely infected since it began six months ago, according to the World Health Organization.

[This is good news, amidst so much bad news, even though this outcome was expected.

Helen Branswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell) :
The doctor's exposure was on [21 Dec 2018] & he was vaccinated the next day. He was evacuated over fears that, as the security situation on the ground worsened, they might not be able to get him to care if he went on to develop #Ebola. (UNMC [University of Nebraska Medical Center] did not provide these details.)

UNMC is one of a few hospitals in the US with a special biocontainment unit where patients with dangerous infectious diseases can be treated safely. It handled 3 evacuated patients during the West African #Ebola outbreak.
