Anthrax kills 4, infects 18
---------------------------
4 people have died and 18 others have been admitted to Mwandi hospital
following an outbreak of anthrax in Western Province. Central Board of
Health (CBoH) spokesman Victor Mukonka said in an interview that all the
people who had died were from Mwandi in Magondo area. Dr Mukonka said 18
were admitted to Mwandi hospital and a team of experts had been dispatched
to the area to help curb the bacterial disease.
"We have some anthrax cases reported in Senanga district and Mwandi. A team
of experts left on Friday to put control measures in place," Dr Mukonka
said. Dr Mukonka said the veterinary department had banned the slaughter
and movement of animals.
He said that 20 head of cattle had been infected and the veterinary
department had embarked on a vaccination campaign to prevent the spread of
the disease. He said no meat was allowed to be eaten without the permission
of health inspectors. "There should also be proper disposal of animals and
the best is that it be burnt," Dr Mukonka said. Ministry of Health minister
Brian Chituwo said the government would soon issue a statement on the outbreak.

[The report goes on to describe the disease and the usual risks involved
when handling sick animals. Other endemic risks quoted were when infected
hides are used as sleeping mats and for carrying water, obvious but not
usually commented on elsewhere. In this part of Africa it is not unusual to
see a ratio of 10 human cases per bovine case, so the ratio here of 1:1
shows an improved awareness of risk and possibly a quicker public health
response, but this is an area of well-recognised enzootic/endemic anthrax
risk. - Mod.MHJ]
