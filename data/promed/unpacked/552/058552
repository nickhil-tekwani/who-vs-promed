All 4 have been hospitalised and their health condition is stable.

[As per the media report above, 5 deaths and 141 cases of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) have been reported in Shimoga district of Karnataka state so far in 2020. There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf.

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full-sleeved clothes and long pants to cover exposed skin to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites. - Mod.UBA
