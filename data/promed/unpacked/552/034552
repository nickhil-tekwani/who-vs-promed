Even as the Sacramento Valley cools down, the yellow fever mosquito is being discovered in traps in new areas. Some were found this week near Cresta Park in the Arden Arcade area, the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District announced on Wednesday [7 Oct 2020].

This aggressive day-biting pest, formally known as _Aedes aegypti_, can carry not only yellow fever but also Zika virus, dengue and chikungunya [viruses]. While mosquitoes breed more quickly during the heat of summer, these new reports show local residents shouldn't let down their guard this autumn.

"Your assistance is critical! If you are being bitten throughout the day or notice more mosquitoes in your yard, please give the district a call to request a free inspection," said Gary Goodman, the district manager, in a news release. He reported that there were 7 female and 4 male _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes found in the trap near Cresta Park. The mosquitoes also have been discovered in Winters, Davis, Le Grand, Stockton, Yuba City and in other cities around northern California.

To date [7 Oct 2020], there are no known cases where _Aedes aegypti_ have transmitted Zika, dengue or chikungunya [viruses] in California.

Want to protect yourself against bites and reduce areas where these pests can breed? Here's what medical and vector control experts recommend:
- Mosquitoes can breed in overflow dishes under flowerpots, pet dishes and bird baths, tin cans, tires and other water-holding vessels as small as bottle caps. Clean yard fixtures regularly and dispose of refuse.
- Remove any standing water from your property.
- If you need help identifying where mosquitoes are breeding, call your local vector control district for assistance.
- Apply repellents containing federally approved ingredients such as DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 on your skin or clothing.
- Wear long-sleeve shirts, long pants, socks and shoes outdoors.
- Check window and door screens to be sure there are no holes or gaps that a mosquito could use to enter your home.

Goodman said the Sacramento-Yolo vector district will increase the number of traps it has in surrounding areas to better assess the spread of the infestation, and field technicians will be on the look-out for potential mosquito breeding sites.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes continue to increase their geographic range in California this year (2020). Now Sacramento County is added to 4 recent new locations -- Santa Barbara, Butte, Ventura, and Yolo counties. Shasta and San Joaquin counties were added earlier this year (2020). _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes have been detected in an increasing number of California localities over the past 4 years.

Although the report above points out that the probability of introduction of any of these mentioned viruses with ongoing transmission is unlikely, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito in the localities where they have recently been found as quickly as possible is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. - Mod.TY
