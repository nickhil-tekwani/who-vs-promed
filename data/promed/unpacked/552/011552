School's out for Morrinsville College [Waikato, New Zealand] students until [24 May 2016] unless they have written proof they've had 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine.

A student at the school has been treated for measles by the Waikato District Health Board, prompting a public health response.

The school's sports teams have not been competing this weekend [14-15 May 2016] and the school will be closed on [Mon 16 May 2016] to allow staff and students to check their immunisation status.

From [Tue 17 May 2016] students and staff can attend only if they have proof in writing they've had 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. Staff born before 1969 are considered to have natural immunity and can return to work immediately.

However, half of the college's teaching staff were born after that date and will have to provide the same written evidence as students, and most will have to have an extra MMR vaccination, the college says.

"Those students who have not had the 2 required vaccinations must stay at home for at least a minimum of 14 days from their last potential contact with the affected student. "The advice from the medical officer of health is that this makes their next day of school [Tue 24 May 2016]," the school says.

The DHB [District Health Board] says measles is a serious illness, and 1 in 10 people with measles needs hospital treatment.

Measles is infectious before the rash appears, and is easily transmitted from one person to another through the air.

There are 20 confirmed cases of measles in Waikato and 12 are under investigation.

Tasmanian health authorities warn of a potential measles outbreak, with the state recording its 1st case in 2 years.

The acting director of Public Health, Dr Mark Veitch, said the infected person contracted measles abroad and then travelled from Bangkok to Launceston [north Tasmania], via Melbourne.

"In Australia most measles clusters or even outbreaks start off with a case that comes into the country from overseas. In this case we are sure the person caught their case overseas," he said.

Dr Veitch said anyone exposed to the person could have contracted the illness.

"Measles is one of the most infectious diseases that we know, and it spreads very easily through the air," he said. The symptoms include a fever, cough, sore red eyes, a runny nose and eventually a blotchy rash. Symptoms normally start to appear 10 days after contact with the disease.

The state was last hit with measles in 2014, with 6 confirmed cases.

West Londoners are being warned of a suspected measles outbreak after cases rocketed in April [2016].

Public Health England (PHE) is calling on people to check their vaccinations are up to date after records revealed a staggering 267 per cent rise from 6 cases in April 2015 to 22 cases reported last month [April 2016]. There were also 23 cases reported in March, up 64 per cent from 14 in the same month in 2015, with most confirmed in teenagers and young adults.

The outbreak of the highly infectious viral illness comes at the same time as reports of high levels of scarlet fever were reported in west London.

Brent saw 7 measles cases in April [2016], compared to just 1 in 2015, while Hounslow saw 6, compared to 1 in 2015, and Hammersmith and Fulham saw 5 compared to 2 in 2015. There were 2 reports of the infection in Harrow, 1 in Ealing and Hillingdon.

No reports of measles were recorded in Westminster or Kensington and Chelsea.

Do you need to be vaccinated?

Dr Yvonne Doyle, regional director for PHE in London, said: "We are seeing an increase in measles cases across London which could be considered an outbreak.

"The cases are being confirmed mainly in adolescents and young adults, and it's never too late for them to have the vaccine.

"Those who have not received 2 doses of the vaccine in the past -- or who are unsure -- should speak to their GP. There's no harm in receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty."

In September last year [2015], the number of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccines dropped across west London.

Signs to spot measles include cold-like symptoms, sore red eyes, high temperature, or a red-brown blotchy rash. PHE advises anyone with these symptoms to seek medical help but to call their GP ahead of visiting to prevent others from being affected.

In addition, pregnant women unsure whether they have been vaccinated with MMR should check with their doctor as rubella can cause serious complications during pregnancy. The vaccination provides mother and baby protection and can be given before becoming pregnant or after birth.

The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended for all children. It protects against 3 potentially serious illnesses. The vaccine is very effective at preventing disease. After 1 dose, 85 percent of children 9 months of age and 95 percent over 12 months of age are immune. Nearly all of those who do not develop immunity after the 1st dose develop it after a 2nd dose. - Mod.LK]
