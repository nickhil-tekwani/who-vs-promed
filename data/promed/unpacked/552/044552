Australian flu-vaccine probe confirms increased reactions in small children
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Australia's chief medical officer today [1 Jun 2010] renewed his
advice for clinicians to suspend seasonal flu vaccination for healthy
children younger than 5 after national investigations confirmed
higher-than-expected rates of fever and convulsions after immunization
in that age-group.

In a statement today [1 Jun 2010], Dr Jim Bishop said the reactions in
younger children have been linked mainly to Fluvax, made by Australian
producer CSL Ltd. Investigations by the country's drug regulator, its
vaccine advisory group, and the National Center for Immunization
Research and Surveillance found no clinical, biological, or
epidemiologic factors that would explain the higher rates of fever
with convulsion. The groups put the rate at 9 per 1000 children
vaccinated, versus an expected rate of less than 1 in 1000.

Bishop's statement prompted an announcement from CSL today [see below]
that it was pulling remaining doses of its vaccine from medical
clinics and distributors and that it would alert doctors about
Bishop's advice and the results so far of investigations into the
increased rates of adverse events. Though influenza itself can produce
fever with convulsions, symptoms that mimic the reported vaccine
effects, "there is a clear signal that the rate of fever with
convulsions is higher with this year's [2010] vaccine across all
jurisdictions," said Bishop.

When reports of fever and convulsion first surfaced in April [2010],
they were mainly concentrated in Western Australia, where children are
eligible to receive free seasonal flu vaccination. Since then, further
investigations have revealed similar findings across the country [and
in New Zealand - Mod.CP], Bishop said.

The CSL trivalent vaccine is an inactivated split-virus product that
does not include an adjuvant. The pandemic H1N1 virus is one of the 3
flu strains covered by the vaccine. Bishop said 2 other flu vaccines
for children are used in Australia, Influvac, made by Solvay
Biologicals, and Vaxigrip, made by Sanofi Pasteur, but too few doses
of them have been administered to accurately determine if they are
linked to similar rates of fever and convulsion.

Dr Darryl Maher, CSL's medical and research director, said today [1
Jun 2010] in a statement that the safety profile of CSL vaccines has
been well established after 40 years of manufacturing and testing.
"The reports we have seen this season in children under 5 are
unexpected and not consistent with our experience using previous
seasons' vaccines," he said, adding that CSL will continue to work
with authorities to find an explanation for the higher rates of fever
and convulsion.

Bishop advised parents of young children with underlying medical
conditions to talk to their doctors about weighing the risks and
benefits of seasonal flu vaccination this year [2010]. He added that
monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine is an option for both healthy
children and those who have risk factors, because the adverse events
are in line with expected rates.

Australian regulators will continue to work with overseas counterparts
and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate
possible reasons for the higher rates of adverse events in children,
Bishop said.

[2] CSL Ltd Press Release

Update on seasonal influenza vaccination of young children, Melbourne,
Australia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSL Biotherapies (CSL) today [1 Jun 2010] notes the Chief Medical
Officer's statement and updated recommendations regarding influenza
vaccination for children under 5.

In late April 2010, CSL became aware of reports of side effects in
young children following this season's [2010] influenza vaccination.
The Chief Medical Officer subsequently advised immunisation providers
to stop vaccinating children 5 years and under pending further
investigation. At this time, CSL ceased distribution of its paediatric
influenza vaccine as a precautionary measure and began urgent
investigations with government and regulatory authorities.

Analyses of currently available data show that there has been a
significant increase in reports of fever and febrile convulsion in
children aged less than 5 years shortly after receiving CSL's 2010
influenza vaccine, compared to previous seasons.

Extensive investigations conducted by the authorities and CSL to date
have not established an explanation for the increase in reports of
side-effects.

In light of this information, CSL has updated its prescribing
information for influenza vaccine and is writing to doctors to inform
them of this important update. As a further precautionary measure, and
as part of ongoing investigations by CSL and regulatory authorities,
CSL has voluntarily commenced a retrieval program for its remaining
2010 paediatric influenza vaccine from medical clinics and distributors.

CSL supports the Chief Medical Officer's recommendation to not
vaccinate healthy children under 5 with seasonal influenza vaccine
this year, and that doctors should conduct a careful assessment of the
risk and benefits when considering vaccination for children at risk.

"CSL has more than 40 years experience in manufacturing and testing
influenza vaccine and the safety profile of our influenza vaccine has
been well established. The reports we have seen this season [2010] in
children under 5 are unexpected and not consistent with our experience
using previous seasons' vaccines," said Dr Darryl Maher, CSL Medical
and Research Director.

"The actions taken by CSL reflect the utmost importance we place on
patient safety and the quality of our products. We will continue to
work with authorities to find an explanation for the increase in
reports of side effects associated with our vaccine," said Dr Maher.

"If any members of the public have any questions about being
vaccinated, they should consult with their doctor," concluded Dr Maher.

[The reason for the adverse reactions to the CSL pediatric seasonal
influenza vaccine has yet to be established. It was reported in a
Melbourne newspaper on 2 May 2010 (The New Age
<http://www.theage.com.au/national/residue-in-flu-jab-causing-kids-reactions-scientist-20100501-u0dd.html?skin=text-only>) that Professor Nikolai Petrovsky, a Flinders University immunologist, had suggested that the high content of [contaminating -- see URL above] RNA in the CSL vaccine could have been responsible by overloading the infants' immune systems. Professor Petrovsky's view was endorsed by Professor Bryan Williams, head of immunology the Monash Institute of Medical Research. The rationale being that small RNA molecules can activate receptors that produce responses driving a cascade of inflammatory reactions resulting in symptoms like those seen in the children who have suffered adverse
reactions.

However, Professor Petrovsky has been promoting an alternative type of
vaccine and an independent assessment of the situation is urgently
required. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
