Botulism is suspected to be responsible for the recent illness of 2
Taipei County women after the bacteria claimed a life in the county
in April 2010. The women, a 53-year-old mother and her
daughter-in-law aged 38, were hospitalized 18 and 20 May 2010,
respectively, after developing symptoms, officials of the county's
Public Health Bureau said Saturday [22 May 2010].

Suspecting botulism, a notifiable disease, the hospital reported the
case to the Department of Health (DOH), which then informed the county bureau.

Huang Ching-yao, a technical specialist at the bureau, said the women
had eaten soybean products packed in airtight bags, including dried
beancurd and vegetarian meat produced by a Taoyuan County-based
factory, the same factory whose products were blamed for the April
2010 case. This was later confirmed by DOH official Tsai Shu-chen.
Tsai said the factory had been ordered to recall all the processed
foods it had made under contract.

Meanwhile, DOH Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director-General
Lin Ting said preliminary lab test results showed a high possibility
of botulism infection in the mother, although initial tests on the
other woman were less conclusive.

[The following is extracted from the PRO/MBDS post 20100418.1257
regarding the earlier 2010 cases of botulism in Taiwan, 2 clusters of
2 cases, all shown to be type A. As in these cases, the specific
vehicle transmitting the toxin is not established. - Mod.LL

Cases attributable to botulism in Taiwan from the GIDEON (Global
Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network) database. (Note that no
information is available for 2004):

Year / cases
1992 / 3
1993 / 2 (one case from Miaoli and another one from Changhua)
1994 / 1 (case from Taipei)
1995 / 3 (cases from Taoyuan, Changhua and Nantou)
1996 / 4
1997 / 4
1998 / 0
1999 / 1
2000 / 5

2002 / 3
2003 / 1
2005 / 1
2006 / 2
2007 / 8
2008 / 11
Notes: Cases for 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2000 were 'not confirmed'.

In Taiwan, an outbreak of type A foodborne botulism resulted in 9
cases, 2 of them fatal in 1986. Commercially canned peanuts processed
by an unlicensed cannery were identified as the vehicle of in this
outbreak. Clinical manifestations of cases were general malaise,
ptosis, double vision, dysarthria, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness (1,2).

In 1987, the 1st case of infantile botulism in Taiwan was reported.
The laboratory confirmed type B toxin in serum and stool specimen
whereas the vehicle of transmission was not identified. In 1990, an
outbreak of type B botulism was reported in 11 cases. The vehicle of
transmission was fermented food. Cases were presented with
gastrointestinal symptoms (that is, dysphagia, ileus).

In 2006, there were 5 cases reported in an outbreak of type B
botulism in Taiwan. Cases presented with ileus and acute cranial
nerve dysfunction including dysphagia and blurred vision. One of them
had severe neurologic impairment and required mechanical ventilatory
support. No patient received antitoxin administration because of
delayed diagnosis, however, there were no fatalities. The food
specimen (fermented food) revealed positive botulism toxin B (3).

According to newswires (as of 16 April 2010) there were 4 botulinum
toxin cases and one fatality reported. The suspected foods that would
be the vehicles of transmission of this outbreak were packaged
vegetarian foods (mainly imitation dried meat, pig legs, and
preserved bean curd for vegetarians), dried bean curd, and salted
oyster. These suspected foods were bought from different counties.
