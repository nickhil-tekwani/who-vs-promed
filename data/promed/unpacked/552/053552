Watermelons could be the cause of 5 Scottish cases of salmonellosis, which have been linked to a UK-wide outbreak, health officials have said.

Since December 2011, there have been 30 more cases than usual of the _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport infection across the UK. 4 of the 5 infections in Scotland were in children under 6 years old, while the 5th patient was an adult.

The same strain has also been found in the Republic of Ireland and Germany, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) said.

Investigations into the source of the outbreak are continuing, but HPS said no new cases had been reported in Scotland since the 1st week of January 2012. Dr John Cowden, consultant epidemiologist at HPS, said: "Although it's too soon to say with certainty what the likely cause of infection is, early indications from cases across the UK suggest that a number of people became unwell after eating watermelon.

"It's important to remember that many thousands of watermelons are eaten every day and the risk of becoming unwell after eating watermelon is very low. These cases only represent a very small proportion of total consumption. It is always advisable to wash fruits and vegetables, including watermelon, before consumption to reduce the risk of possible illness."

Dr Cowden added: "As soon as any particular producer or distributor of infected watermelons has been identified, steps will be put in place to inform the public and remove any affected items from the food chain."

[Melons grow from vines on the ground and because of this can be contaminated by ground water/irrigation that could contain pathogenic organisms such as salmonellae. Without washing the outside of the melon, when it is sliced open to expose the part that is eaten, bacteria can be introduced. After cutting, if the melon is refrigerated, the inoculum can be small enough not to cause disease unless the organism, like _Listeria monocytogenes_, replicates at cold temperatures. - Mod.LL
