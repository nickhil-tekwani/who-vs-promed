This is an excellent example of the quandary faced by the powers that be.
To withhold information from tourists or natives can hardly be defended,
save to prevent panic and paranoia. To release it is to chance those very
responses.
Finally, will these areas be affected by El Nino (increased rainfall may
lead to increased food supply for the rodent hosts) and, if so, can it be
predicted that the rodent hosts will multiply, disperse and create
additional opportunities for disease transmission?
[These are rhetorical questions, I assume. Certainly, I cannot answer
them. However, withholding information from the public may suit dictators,
would-be dictators, and tourist boards but is inappropriate in a democracy.
Also, if an adequate education program can be put in place, there should
be no reason for public "panic and paranoia". We saw much the same
situation in 1993 when Sin Nombre virus was first discovered in the Four
Corners area (where New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, and Arizona meet). Local
newspapers and gossip had the outbreak attributed to certain individuals.
CDC, other governmental agencies, and local authorities made a concerted
effort to squelch such rumors and to distribute posters, provide
communities with sources of information, and otherwise furnish facts, the
situation became much more calm. This can be done anywhere. Governments
must be aware that there are likely certain individuals who think they will
profit from such panic and the misinformation they distribute countered.
As for whether the El Nino (Southern Oscillation) effect in the northern
hemisphere will provide an environment in which rodent populations and
hantavirus populations increase, that has yet to be determined. Our own
field research suggests that rodent populations will increase and disperse
but there are no data which would allow us to predict a concomitant
increase in hantavirus prevalence. -- Mod CHC]
