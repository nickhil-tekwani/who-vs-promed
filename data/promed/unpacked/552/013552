[Pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) is a small, shrubby plant which produces large
(up to 15 cm diameter) fruit with a sweet smell, subtle flavor, and
attractive yellow/golden skin color often with purple stripes. It is grown
widely in the north of South America and cultivated extensively in Chile.
PepMV, a member of the genus Potexvirus, was first reported in pepino in
Peru in 1980, and has subsequently spread to Europe. The virus is highly
contagious and has a significant potential to cause damage in protected
tomato production. It often occurs in mixed infection with Potato virus S.
PepMV is serologically related to Narcissus mosaic virus and Cactus virus X.
