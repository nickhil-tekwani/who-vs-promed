Lassa fever [LF] situation report -- epidemiological week 24 (8-14 Jun 2020)
------------------------------
Key points
------------
Current week (24) (8-14 Jun 2020) / Cumulative weeks 1-24 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-24
Suspected cases: 74 / 5079 / 2763
Confirmed cases: 5 / 1031 / 591
Probable cases: 0 / 14 / 15
Deaths: 2 / 214 / 132
Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 40.0 / 20.8 / 22.3
Number of states affected: 2 / 27 / 22
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 3 / 129 / 83

Highlights
- In week 24, the number of new confirmed cases is the same as recorded in week 23 with 5 cases. These were reported from 2 states (Ondo and Edo) (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 24, 2020, 214 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 20.8%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2019 (22.3%).
- In total for 2020, 27 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 129 Local Government Areas (Figure 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 72% are from Ondo (33%), Edo (32%) and Ebonyi (7%) states.
- The predominant age-group affected is 21-30 years (Range: under one year old to 78 years, Median Age: 33 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1.2 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases has significantly increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2019.
- One new Healthcare worker was affected from Ondo state in the reporting week 24.
- The Lassa fever outbreak emergency phase was declared over on 28 Apr 2020 based on composite indicators national threshold.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

Response activities
- The National multisectoral Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated to coordinate response activities across states. States with confirmed cases have activated state- level EOCs.
- National Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 10 states
- Surge staff (Doctors, Nurses, Laboratorians and Hygienist) deployed to ISTH and FMC Owo
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states
- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment and IPC commodities.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies.
- Implementation of Lassa fever Environmental response campaign in high burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment

Notes on this report
Data Source
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss and either a. History of contact with excreta or urine of rodents b. History of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR or virus isolation)
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing
- Contact: Anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
- Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only

[The 5 new confirmed and 74 new suspected cases in week 24 (8-14 Jun 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining considerably. The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. There are now 214 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Unfortunately, there is one newly infected healthcare worker during the current week (week 24).

The report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, but local government areas by one to 129 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March 2020) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.
