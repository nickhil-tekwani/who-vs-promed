An adult from Laconia has tested positive for a mosquito-borne virus, New Hampshire's Department of Health and Human Services says.

The adult tested positive for the Jamestown Canyon virus, which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, the department said [Wed 16 Oct 2019]. It's the 2nd time a case has been identified in the state this year; it was identified in a Kingston resident in August [2019].

Reports of Jamestown Canyon virus in humans are rare, but have increased over the last several years. This is New Hampshire's 8th case since the state's 1st report of the disease in 2013.

The department says most illnesses caused by the virus have been mild, but moderate-to-severe central nervous system involvement has been reported, including fatal infections.

[Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) cases are not new in New Hampshire. They were diagnosed in New Hampshire in 2013, 2015, and 2017. JCV infections are extremely rare and, if laboratory confirmed, the 2018 case was the 1st documented death due to the virus (see Jamestown Canyon virus - USA: (NH) fatal, susp 20180629.5882078).

As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal [northern] _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
