The new bacterium responsible for the contamination of nutrition solutions involved in the deaths of 3 very preterm infants and infection of a 4th in Chambery Hospital has been officially recognized by the scientific community, according to the Pasteur Institute. This organism, never described before, now bears the scientific name of _Rouxiella chamberiensis_, said the institute on 17 Mar 2015.

After the deaths of 3 infants in Chambery hospital in December 2013, and the infection of a 4th, researchers from the Institut Pasteur had quickly established the involvement of this bacterium, previously unknown, responsible for the contamination of parenteral nutrition bags. Pasteur researchers now describe "the full characterization of the bacteria of a new kind" in an article just published in the magazine of reference for specialists, the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology.

The study of the bacterium highlighted particular features: Surprisingly, it multiplies at 4 C [39 F], while most of the Enterobacteriaceae are unable to grow below 8 C [46 F]. Moreover, it goes dormant and stops its growth at 37 C [98 F]. After sequencing the whole genome and complete characterization, this bacterium has been officially recognized by the International Committee of bacterial taxonomy, said the Pasteur Institute. _Rouxiella_, the name of this new genus, was chosen in homage to Emile Roux, close collaborator with Louis Pasteur, who headed the Institute from 1904 to 1933. The species name was given in reference to Chambery, the location of the emergence of the new bacterium.

Official recognition of a new species, and in this case a new bacterial genus, is a long process. Researchers must demonstrate that it is a new bacterium, different from those already known and genetically close, says the institute. Researchers of the Unit of Biological Emergency Response (CIBU) of the institute, founded in late 2002, worked on the development of a test specific for the detection of this bacterium.

"The most likely hypothesis" to explain the deaths of the babies at the hospital in Chambery is "an isolated production accident on 28 Nov 2013 at Marette Laboratory," the supplier of the incriminated nutrition pockets. The Marette Laboratory, whose activity was suspended, has since been closed.

Abstract
------
Parenteral nutrition bags for newborns were found contaminated by a previously undescribed [species of] Enterobacteriaceae. The 6 isolates studied by rrs - (encoding 16S rRNA) and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) formed a discrete branch close to genera _Ewingella_, _Rahnella_, _Yersinia_, _Hafnia_ and _Serratia_. Phenotypically, the new taxon was distinct from these 4 genera. The new taxon gave positive Voges-Proskauer, Simmons citrate, o-nitrophenyl-B-galactoside hydrolysis tests; fermented D-glucose, D-mannitol, L-rhamnose, D-melibiose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, and hydrolyzed esculin; did not ferment maltose, trehalose, raffinose, D-sorbitol, sucrose and D-cellobiose. The following tests: motility, gas production, urease, gelatinase and nitrate reduction were also negative. All isolates failed to grow at 37 C. Therefore, the new taxon is proposed as a new species and genus and named _Rouxiella chamberiensis_ gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is 130333T (= CIP 110714T = DSM 28324T). The G+C content of the type strain DNA was 53 mol percent."

This organism does not grow at 37 C [98 F] but rather at lower temperatures, which can put it into a category of bacteria called cryophilic or psychrophilic, growing at colder temperatures, one form of extremophile microbes that grow at extreme temperatures. Psychrophiles like _Rouxiella_ may grow in refrigerator temperatures and cause severe disease not by replication in the human host, since they do not grow at body temperature, but rather related to endotoxin.

Chambery is a city in the department of Savoie, located in the Rhone-Alpes region in southeastern France: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes#/media/File:Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes_in_France.svg. - Mod.LL
