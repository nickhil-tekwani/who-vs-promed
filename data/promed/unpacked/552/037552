Two employees of a Japanese confectionery company fell sick after
eating China-made bean paste in the latest apparent food scare here,
police and the firm said on Saturday [20 Sep 2008].

The workers at Marusei Honten confectionery in central Nagano
prefecture noticed a strange smell like petroleum oil when they
opened the 5-kilogram package of red bean paste on Friday [19 Sep
2008], police said. They tasted it to check on the quality and felt
sick soon afterwards, police said.

The employees, a man and a woman in their 30s, complained of numbness
in their limbs and were taken to hospital. They were in stable
condition, police said.

"Police suspect the food was laced with poison," a local police spokesman said.

Japan has recently been hit by food scares over China-made poisoned
dumplings and pesticide-laced rice.

Farm minister Seiichi Ota resigned on Friday [19 Sep 2008] in a
spiraling scare over the pesticide-laced imported rice, which was
served to hospital patients and schoolchildren instead of being used
for non-food products such as glue.

Ten people suffered pesticide poisoning in December 2007 and January
2008 after eating dumplings imported from China, while thousands more
complained about feeling ill.

[The article does not give us much information regarding the
condition of the people who tasted the product. It does not tell us
how much they tasted, (a teaspoon full or a tiny taste off of a
toothpick) or how long after consumption they started to feel
numbness in their limbs. The other unknown factor is the level of the
alleged toxicant. If we consider it to be a relatively small amount
in the testing, then the level of the supposed toxicant was likely
high. This is also likely since it is reported there was a suspicious odor.

Hopefully, the remains of the suspicious item were sent to a
laboratory for a complete set of tests. Although organoleptic testing
has its place, it can also have some less than pleasant consequences.
Further information from knowledgeable sources on this event will be
welcomed. - Mod.TG]

[If the only symptom experienced by these workers was numbness in
their limbs, there is the possibility that this is a psychogenic
reaction related to hyperventilation, perhaps in response to eating a
product with a strange odor and knowledge that the product came from
an area associated with toxic additives to food products (referring
to the current milk powder adulterated with melamine presently
occurring in China and the recent history of pesticide contamination
of dumplings imported from China -- see references below). A
conclusion of a psychogenic reaction would be a diagnosis of
exclusion once toxic additives of the implicated bean paste have been
ruled out.
