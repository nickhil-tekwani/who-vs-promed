Health officials are warning passengers and crew of an Air Canada flight, along with anyone who was at the Edmonton International Airport during a certain window of time, that they may have been exposed to measles. The warning comes as Alberta Health Services confirmed another case of the disease in the Edmonton Zone on Saturday [19 Apr 2014]. The infected individual has been determined to be a child who was travelling to Edmonton via Vancouver from the Philippines earlier this month [April 2014].

The fact that the child passed through an airport may complicate matters. "It's a busy place, and so a lot of people could potentially be exposed," said Dr Marcia Johnson, Medical Officer of Health for the Edmonton Zone.

The people who are at risk include: passengers and crew on Air Canada Flight AC248, which departed from Vancouver the evening of [9 Apr 2014]. Those who were at the Edmonton International Airport [9 Apr 2014] between the hours of 11:30 pm and 2 am [10 Apr 2014].

"In some ways, it's kind of good that it was so late at night and early in the morning," Johnson said. She added that she didn't know how many passengers were on the Vancouver-to-Edmonton flight. Efforts may be made to obtain a passenger list and contact those people directly, she said, but she noted such efforts could take time and health officials wanted to issue their warning as quickly as possible. Measles is extremely contagious and spreads through the air, according to health officials. "You just have to be walking through the air space where a person of measles has walked through within 2 hours and you can be exposed to measles," Johnson explained. Individuals without prior exposure to the disease, especially those who haven't received the measles vaccine, have a higher risk of contracting it.

These individuals are being told to monitor themselves for symptoms of measles, which include: a fever of 38.3 deg C [100.9 deg F] or higher, a cough, runny nose and/or red eyes, a red blotchy rash that appears 3 to 7 days after fever starts, beginning behind the ears and on the face and spreading down to the torso and then to the arms and legs. Anyone who experiences these symptoms is advised to stay home and call Health Link Alberta (1.866.408.5465) before visiting any health care facility or provider. Typically, the disease will develop about 10 days after exposure, but it can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to show up. If you have been infected, you will be highly contagious before the symptoms even appear. British Columbia is currently in the grips of a large outbreak, with at least 375 cases so far. This is the 2nd case in the Edmonton Zone in the past month, and the 15th confirmed case this year [2014] in Alberta, where immunization rates have fallen 7 per cent in the last 7 years. In Manitoba, health officials confirmed 2 new cases of the disease on Thursday [17 Apr 2014], bringing the total number of cases there to 7. In the latest Edmonton case, the child -- whose age is not being released -- did not require hospitalization and is now recovering at home. Most people who catch it survive, but between one and 3 cases per 1000 can be fatal. "From a public health perspective we feel [kind of] sad because this is preventable," said Johnson. "Once it has occurred, we just work as hard as we can to control the spread."

http://beaconnews.ca/blog/2014/04/ontario-health-minister-calls-calgary-measles-outbreak-a-wake-up-call-to-parents/


A number of recent Calgary measles cases highlights need for vaccinations.

This spring [2014], 7 kids suffered from measles in the Calgary measles outbreak. Also, unvaccinated staff and students were told to stay home following confirmed cases of the disease. A recent outbreak of measles in Calgary has been a "wake up call" for many parents who didn't like the idea of vaccinating their children, said the Ontario Minister of Health, Deb Matthews on Wednesday [16 Apr 2014].

"They're starting to realize now that not immunizing your kids can actually result in their death," she added. Her comments come as the governing Liberals toughen up their vaccination rules for students in elementary and high schools. Starting in the fall [2014], students must have proof they've been vaccinated against 2 additional conditions, meningococcal disease and whooping cough. Those born after 2010 must also prove they've been immunized against chickenpox.

This is in addition to updated dose requirements for tetanus, diphtheria, polio, and mumps immunizations. Requirements for measles and rubella immunizations have not changed.

In addition, Matthews denounced the views of celebrities like Jenny McCarthy, calling her "outrageously irresponsible" for encouraging parents to not immunize their kids against potentially deadly diseases. McCarthy, currently co-host of talk show The View, has been vocal about her belief that vaccines can cause autism in children like her son, a claim largely based on a research paper that has since been denounced as fraudulent.

"The science is very clear," said Matthews. "The study she's referred to has been discredited many times. There is absolutely no truth in that argument." McCarthy, who's faced harsh criticism for the views, recently said she's not anti-vaccine and never told parents not to have their children immunized. She said she simply questioned the "one size fits all" approach to giving infants multiple shots at one time. "I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines," she wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times on [12 Apr 2014]. But Matthews said she's discussed the so-called "Jenny McCarthy effect" with government officials because there's a concern that her views on vaccines may stop Ontario parents from having their children immunized. Parents need to understand that it's perfectly safe to vaccinate their children, which helps prevent the spread of diseases in schools and communities, she said.

Manitoba health officials have reported a 5th case of measles, this time involving a man in his 20s living in the Winnipeg area.

The latest case was announced via Twitter on Wednesday [16 Apr 2014]. Manitoba Health is warning people who visited the Bison Medical Walk-In Clinic on [11 Apr 2014] between 10 am and 10:30 am that they might have been exposed to measles.

If you were at this location and think you may have had contact with someone with measles, the province is asking you to call your doctor or Health Links at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for more information.

California public health officials say the anti-vaccination movement could spark a resurgence of measles, since the unvaccinated are more susceptible to contracting it.

California Department of Public Health reported 2 new cases of measles this week [week of 14 Apr 2014]. The new cases, in Alameda and Monterey counties, increase the state's total to 58 this year [2014].

There were 4 cases in the state at this point last year [2013]. Of the 58 cases, 13 were imported from countries where measles is more common, according to state epidemiologist Dr Gil Chavez. 8 cases were acquired in the Philippines, where there's a large outbreak. 2 cases were acquired in India, where measles is endemic. 1 case each was also acquired in Viet Nam, Singapore, and Western Europe. Measles was declared eradicated from the United States in 2002. Since then, most cases of the highly contagious viral disease have been linked to international travel, according to the state health department.

Cases acquired abroad can spread locally, especially among unvaccinated people and infants too young to be vaccinated, according to the state health department. Chavez said that of the 58 cases so far this year [2014]: 25 people were unvaccinated, and 19 of those were intentionally unvaccinated 11 people were vaccinated 4 people had laboratory evidence of immunity 18 people had an unknown vaccination status. The new case reported in Alameda County is connected to another case there that was acquired through domestic travel, according to county health department spokeswoman Sherri Willis. The county has had 4 measles cases this year [2014]. In Monterey County, where 2 cases have been reported, both are in people under age 18, and the cases are connected, said county health department spokeswoman Karen Smith. Measles is spread through the air when someone coughs or sneezes. It begins with a fever that lasts a couple of days, and is followed by a cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes, and a rash.

Another case of measles has been confirmed in New York City, bringing the total number of cases considered part of the outbreak that emerged in February [2014] to 26, the Health Department said Wednesday [16 Apr 2014].

The outbreak remains centralized in upper Manhattan, the Health Department said, though cases have been identified in the Bronx, the Lower East Side, and Brooklyn. It's not clear where the latest case was.

So far 12 children and 14 adults have tested positive for measles. An additional case was identified, but the Health Department said it was associated with foreign travel and unrelated to the outbreak.

The most recent case was identified more than 2 weeks after the last confirmed cases, and the Health Department is urging continued vigilance. Anyone older than 12 months who hasn't been vaccinated for measles should be as soon as possible, authorities say.

Measles is a viral infection characterized by a generalized rash and high fever, accompanied by cough, red eyes, and runny nose, lasting 5 to 6 days. The illness typically begins with a rash on the face and then moves down the body, and may include the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

As many as one in 3 people with measles develop complications, which can be serious and may include pneumonia, miscarriage, brain inflammation, hospitalization, and death. Infants, people who have a weakened immune system and non-immune pregnant women are at highest risk of severe illness and complications.

Officials investigating the source of the outbreak are looking into whether it could have spread through exposure at medical facilities, including emergency rooms and doctor's offices.

Dr Jay Varma, the Health Department's deputy commissioner for disease control, said last month [March 2014] the outbreak may have spread because workers in those medical facilities didn't recognize the symptoms quickly enough to isolate patients and prevent them from spreading it to others.

Varma didn't specify any facilities where lapses may have occurred. He said exposure in such places was common, but since the outbreak wasn't localized to any specific group of people, it may be more challenging to contain.

In a statement Wednesday [16 Apr 2014], Health Commissioner Mary Bassett urged people who suspect they may have the virus to contact their medical provider before going to a doctor, urgent care center, or emergency room to avoid exposing others. Bassett also advised health facilities to educate staff about isolation protocol in suspected measles cases.

Last Thu 17 Apr 2014, the Regional Ministerial Secretariat of Health [SEREMI] was notified of a measles case in an American citizen who had visited the town of Puerto Williams recently. The case was diagnosed when the tourist returned to her country of origin.

Following this information, the Magellan SEREMI of Health, Oscar Vargas, reported that the Epidemiology Unit has activated the monitoring system in order to identify the persons who came in contact with the tourist during her travel in the region and, at the same time, perform an active search for consultations to emergency services and public and private medical practices from February [2014] until the current date; for this purpose, contact with the entire regional network will be established.

The health authority was emphatic in pointing out that Chile is a measles-free country, in accordance with government policies carried out by the Ministry of Health, for the benefit and protection of the population. Currently this vaccine is part of the National Immunization Program schedule for infants and [again] in 1st grade of school. This shows the importance of parents keeping up the vaccination schedule for their children as a 1st step in protecting them.

It is worth mentioning that in the coming days, on the occasion of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil [12 Jun-13 Jul 2014], the Ministry of Health will be calling on the population traveling to this event and who were born between 1971 and 1981 to be vaccinated against measles.

To date, [Viet Nam] has recorded over 7000 cases of measles this year [2014], a third of which are in Hanoi, said Director of the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases Nguyen Van Kinh at a meeting in Hanoi on [16 Apr 2014] to review the outbreak.

The disease erupted in 61 out of 63 cities and provinces in the 1st quarter of this year [2014]. The number of fatalities from measles complications has amounted to 108, including 25 deaths directly attributable to the disease.

At the meeting, which was also attended by experts from the World Health Organisation, Minister of Public Health Nguyen Thi Kim Tien, said the disease is also plaguing the Philippines, China, and Japan. In Viet Nam, the rate of infections is lower than the 2009-2010 level, but the fatalities are higher, especially in Hanoi. Meanwhile, Ho Chi Minh City has seen fewer cases without any deaths, Tien said. She attributed the high fatalities in Hanoi to the fact that most serious cases are transferred to the city, particularly the National Hospital of Pediatrics. Experts stressed the need to ease the overload in the National Hospital of Pediatrics, which they said causes more infections.

The health minister affirmed the ministry will provide hospitals nationwide with more respirators and antibiotics. At the same time, she made it clear that vaccination for children is the essential and long-term measure to counter the disease.

Viet Nam is in the stage of curbing measles and expects to eliminate the disease by 2017.

On [16 Apr 2014], Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung sent an important telegram urging ministries, agencies, and localities to take tough new measures to prevent the spread of measles and minimise fatalities.

Since December 2013, 3126 out of 8441 suspected cases were diagnosed with the disease in 61 provinces and cities nationwide, claiming 25 lives. Most measles patients had not received an immunization against the disease.

The government leader asked the Health Ministry to timely diagnose and provide treatment for infected cases to reduce fatalities. He called for sufficient supply of vaccines, drugs and medical equipment to save measles patients and control the spread of the disease. He requested leaders of provinces and centrally-run cities to coordinate closely with the Health Ministry to take necessary quarantine measures, give measles vaccination to high-risk groups, and grant financial assistance to patients in need. PM Dung also directed the Ministry of Information and Communications and media agencies to update information on measles and raise public awareness of the potential danger of the disease.

[The newswires above update the measles situation in Viet Nam. It seems that the situation is worse than was reported before. Though the reported numbers are inconsistent, the most up to date media reports show that more than 7000 measles cases have been reported from 61 out of 63 provinces in Viet Nam since the beginning of 2014, and among those, 108 cases died.

As explained by the Minister of Health, most severe, complicated cases have been transferred to the National Pediatric Hospital, which makes the reported number of deaths related to measles from the hospital high. There has been no detailed epidemiological information on measles by province.

The decision of whether to announce a measles epidemic falls to the provincial authorities, not the Ministry of Health or the national government. Although there is no official announcement of a measles epidemic from any of the provinces, the Prime Minister has sent an urgent telegram to ask all provinces to strengthen their measures to suppress the measles outbreak.
