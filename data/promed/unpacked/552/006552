A person has tested positive for the potentially deadly virus eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in Onondaga County. The adult was hospitalized and is in stable condition. This is the 1st human case of EEE [virus infection] in Onondaga County since 2010. EEE [virus] is carried through mosquitoes.

To protect the privacy of this patient and of the family, additional details are not being shared with the public.

Here is more information from Onondaga County Health Department: EEE is a rare but dangerous viral infection that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. Initial symptoms, which usually start 4-10 days after the bite, can include fever, headache, and vomiting. Illness can then progress to altered mental status, confusion, seizures, coma, and even death. The greatest risk for infection with this virus is for people who spend a lot of time outdoors.

The Onondaga County Health Department conducted aerial spraying of the Cicero swamp on 22 Jul 2014 and explained that if additional spraying is determined necessary, the public will be notified through the media and by the emergency reverse 911 notification system.

It is important that the public continues to take measures to minimize being bitten by mosquitoes and to keep yards free from standing water to reduce the mosquito population near the home. Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn. Personal protection is advised during outdoor activities. Personal protection measures include wearing shoes and socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when outside for a long period of time. Applying a mosquito repellent containing DEET, Picaridin, Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus, or IR3535 is also recommended to prevent mosquito bites. Do not put the repellent directly onto children. Put it on your hands and apply it to your child. Do not put insect repellent on your face. Wash skin and clothing after returning indoors. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for application.

The following are ways of helping to reduce mosquito breeding grounds:
- Throw away outdoor containers, ceramic pots, or containers that hold water;
- Remove all tires from your property;
- Drill holes in the bottoms of recycling containers that are kept outdoors;
- Clean clogged rain gutters and make sure they continue to work properly;
- Turn over wheelbarrows and wading pools when not in use;
- Change water in bird baths at least every 4 days;
- Clear vegetation and debris from the edges of ponds;
- Clean chlorinated swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs;
- Drain water from pool covers;
- Use landscaping to eliminate low spots where standing water accumulates.

[This case occurred well within the geographic range of EEE virus in the eastern USA, where human and equine cases occur sporadically. The virus is maintained in passerine birds and transmitted among them by the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_. The species occasionally feeds on mammals, and may have been the bridge transmitter in the above case. There is a vaccine commercially available for equine administration, but not for humans. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in survivors (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/). It is prudent to follow the above recommendations to reduce mosquito breeding sites; however, control of the black-tailed mosquito in swampy areas is more difficult. This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of a human case in the USA this year (2014).
