Rural residents received a warning on Wednesday [7 May 2008] when Fremont
County public health officials announced the 1st local case of hantavirus,
which is fatal in nearly half of all cases. A Kiowa County [Colorado]
resident died from the disease in February [2008].

The virus is carried in the saliva, urine, and droppings of deer mice
[_Peromyscus maniculatus_], which are found in rural areas and pose a
significant risk when residents perform spring cleaning and open up cabins,
buildings, sheds, and barns. "Before people begin cleaning out building
structures that have been closed up all winter, they need to take
precautions," said Clarice Little, Fremont County public health
administrator, "particularly if there are accumulations of mouse droppings
and other signs of mice."

Infection occurs when the virus becomes airborne and is inhaled, or by
direct contact with rodents, their droppings, or nests. Vacuuming an area
without first wetting it down does not provide protection. Little said the
disease cannot be transmitted from person to person.

Hantavirus [infection] begins with high fever, severe body aches, a
headache, and vomiting 1-6 weeks after exposure. Initially, there are no
respiratory symptoms present; however, Little said within 1-5 days, the
illness quickly progresses to respiratory distress, including a cough and
difficulty breathing, while the lungs fill with fluid.

No effective treatment exists for the disease, Little said, so prevention
is the key to avoiding hantavirus [infection]. "When hantavirus infection
is suspected or confirmed, early admission to a hospital where careful
monitoring, treatment of symptoms, and supportive therapy can be provided
is most important," Little said.

Homes can be rodent-proofed by eliminating food sources for rodents and
removing abandoned vehicles, wood, brush, and junk piles where rodents
hide, Little said. She urged caution around mouse droppings and other
evidence of mice. A large, rapid increase in the number of mice around a
home often precedes a human case of the virus.

Rodent control should be undertaken before extensive cleaning efforts, and
structures should be ventilated thoroughly. "If you are living or staying
in rural areas and have deer mice around, you can assume you and members of
your family are at some risk," Little said. "The more live mice that are
present, the greater the risk, although some people have been infected by
directly handling a single mouse."

Little said additional precautions that should be taken to provide
protection against Hantavirus include
- rodent-proof buildings by plugging holes or other mouse entryways;
conduct year-round rodent control, using traps or poisons, or hire a
professional exterminator;
- make home or work areas unattractive to rodents; keep indoor areas clean,
especially kitchens; store food in rodent-proof containers, and properly
dispose of garbage in sealed containers. This includes pet, livestock, and
bird food;
- store firewood at least 100 feet (30 m) from the house; keep vegetation
around the house well trimmed;
- open doors or windows to provide good ventilation for 30 to 60 minutes
before cleaning out structures; avoid stirring up dust by watering down
areas of mouse infestation with a mixture of bleach and water; use a
mixture of 1 1/2 cups of bleach to 1 gallon of water.

Little said the small, gray house mice [_Mus musculus_] commonly found in
urban areas do not carry the disease. Deer mice are brown on top and white
underneath, and feature large ears relative to their head size [and large,
soulful "shoe button" eyes. - Mod.TY]

[The report does not specify which hantavirus is involved in this case, but
it most likely is Sin Nombre virus. No information is given to indicate the
basis for the hantavirus infection diagnosis, but presumably it was based
on serological tests, as Sin Nombre and other hantaviruses are difficult to
isolate. Virus isolation is usually not attempted in non-fatal cases. This
article offers sound, timely advice about prevention of hantavirus exposure
during this period of spring-cleaning of buildings and other structures
that are likely to harbor deer mice.

Sin Nombre virus, clinical signs, treatment, epidemiology, and an image of
the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, can be accessed at
