The following background information on Legionellosis in France was
extracted from the GIDEON software program:
Legionellosis accounts for 0.5% to 5% of community-acquired pneumonia in
France. The disease has been reportable since 1987. Between one percent and
16% of healthy adults are seropositive.
Eighty-one culture-proven cases (27% fatal) were reported for the Paris
area during 1989 to 1994. One hundred and five cases were reported
nationwide during 1988 to 1990.
Year Cases
1991 65
1992 66
1993 59
1994 84
1995 71
1996 85 (13 fatalities; 50% above age 50 years)
1997 191
The true number of cases may be 400 per year, with a case-fatality rate of
10% to 16%. The male/female ratio is 2.8/1.

During 1988 to 1995, 37% to 45% of patients had an underlying disease, and
17% of cases were nosocomial.
The predominant serotype is type 1, which accounted for 68.8% of groupable
_L. pneumophila_ isolates during 1988 to 1996.
