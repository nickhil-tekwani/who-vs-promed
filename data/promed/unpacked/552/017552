The owner of the Montreal restaurant where 7 people contracted _Escherichia coli_ [infection] from tartare is blaming the supplier for delivering contaminated meat. [JM] said he's been serving tartare, a raw meat dish, at 'Marche 27' for 6 years and has never had a problem until now.

[JM] said his restaurant, located in the plateau neighborhood, has passed all inspections. He said he wants to reassure the public that he has addressed the problem and his restaurant is safe. "I want to make sure this never happens again," he told CBC News. "There's a lady that was hospitalized ... like critically ill -- that to me is extremely important."

Although [JM] has admitted that his restaurant was at the center of the _E. coli_ infections, the agriculture ministry is refusing to confirm that information. The ministry confirmed that it had traced all 7 instances back to the same restaurant, but it has refused to release the name of the restaurant or even the city that it's located in. A ministry spokesperson explained that in this type of investigation, the restaurant cannot be named in case file goes to court. Now a patients' advocacy group is criticizing the ministry for holding back that information. It says the public has a right to know where the infections were contracted.

"[This] information should be known to the public because it is of the utmost public interest, if not health hazard interest," said Paul Brunet, the chair of Montreal's Disease Prevention Counsel. The ministry of agriculture says it has done a rigorous inspection of the restaurant and the investigation is still under way. A ministry spokesperson said there is no risk to the public at the moment.

[Although not specifically stated, the seemingly zoonotic nature of the infection, with raw beef being the reservoir, certainly suggests that an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC), possibly serotype O157:H7, is the etiology of illness here.

Certainly, undercooked ground beef is the commonest cause of beef-linked EHEC illness, individual steaks or beef tartare prepared from the steaks can also transmit the infection in certain circumstances as has been noted in past ProMED-mail posts (see list below).

Such non-ground beef items themselves, in the form of steaks or roasts, are uncommon reservoirs for EHEC because the contamination is on the surface cut, not internal. Even if the meat is prepared rare, the bacteria on the surface should be killed by the heat. Several ProMED-mail posts, however, have reported transmission of EHEC from rare steaks, almost all clearly related to injection of the meat with tenderizer or seasonings, or mechanical tenderization with needles meant to heighten the culinary experience. The procedures can physically carry surface bacteria into the meat where the bacteria may not be killed as easily. Needless to say, if the steak is eaten without cooking, after chopping and seasoning for a tartare preparation, the EHEC can be transmitted. - Mod.LL
