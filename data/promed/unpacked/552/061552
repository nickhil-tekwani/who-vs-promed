Fatal hepatitis E reported in Texas
-----------------------------------
Health officials say 2 cases of hepatitis E, thought rare in the
United States, have been reported in Texas and blamed for one death.
The San Antonio, Texas, cases of hepatitis E, a viral liver
infection, usually considered a problem mostly in developing
countries, have gotten the attention of state and local health
officials, the San Antonio Express-News reported Tuesday [22 Jun
2010]. One of the cases was a 21-year-old woman who died during a
liver transplant, the other a 44-year-old nurse's aide who suffered
some liver damage from the disease, the newspaper said.

"We couldn't figure out how they acquired it," Roger Sanchez, senior
epidemiologist with Metro Health, said at a public health meeting in
Austin recently. "[Neither] of them had any (foreign) travel history.
They were previously healthy. Which begs the question -- how did they
get it?" Hepatitis E is usually spread through contaminated food or water.

Serious outbreaks of hepatitis E have taken place in Mexico, Asia,
and Africa. Some US researchers say hepatitis E is more common in the
United States than previously thought. What remains a mystery, they
say, is why some people get sick from the virus but most don't. "It
appears to be a relatively common infection. But clinical symptoms
following infection appear to be quite rare," Mark Kuniholm, an
epidemiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, said.

[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until
1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus
(HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.
Although man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to
HEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and
several other animal species.

HEV is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a
waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have been
implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally contaminated
drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the ingestion of raw
or uncooked shellfish has been the source of sporadic cases in
endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic spread of the
virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows, sheep, goats,
and rodents are susceptible to infection. The risk factors for HEV
infection are related to poor sanitation in large areas of the world,
and HEV shedding in faeces. Person-to-person transmission is
uncommon. There is no evidence for sexual transmission or for
transmission by transfusion.

The highest rates of infection occur in regions where low standards
of sanitation promote the transmission of the virus. Epidemics of
hepatitis E have been reported in Central and South-East Asia, North
and West Africa, and in Mexico, especially where faecal contamination
of drinking water is common. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E
have also been reported elsewhere and serological surveys suggest a
global distribution of strains of hepatitis E of low pathogenicity.

Further information can be obtained from the WHO fact sheet on hepatitis E at
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html>.

In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed
by recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and
chronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of
hepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates
ranging between 0.5 percent-4.0 percent. Fulminant hepatitis occurs
more frequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a mortality rate
of 20 percent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester. The immune
suppression accompanying liver transplantation may be been a factor
in the hepatitis E associated fatality recorded in San Antonio. - Mod.CP]
