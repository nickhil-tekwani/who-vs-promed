[There is a correction of this report: Salmonellosis, effect of
ethanol, 2002 - Portugal:errata 20030331.0793]

The protective effect of alcoholic beverages in a foodborne outbreak of
_Salmonella enteritidis_ PT1 in northern Portugal
-----------------------------------------------
On 23 Oct 2002, the Centro Regional de Saude Publica do Norte (CRSPN) was
informed that several people had been admitted to hospital with
gastroenteritis. Preliminary information collected that day showed that the
patients, residents of different municipalities, had attended a lunch party
in a restaurant on 20 Oct 2002.

The CRSPN and the local health authorities from 4 municipalities conducted
a case-control study to identify the cause and vehicle of the disease in
order to implement corrective measures. An estimated 400-500 people had
attended the lunch party. Cases were selected from clinical records of 3
local hospitals. Controls were those identified by cases as people who had
attended the lunch and had not become ill. The 124 cases and 94 controls
were interviewed about the consumption of 28 food and beverage items served
at the lunch party.

All patients had diarrhea and abdominal pain, with or without nausea,
vomiting, and fever, within 72 hours of eating the meal. Incubation periods
varied between 4 and 35 hours.

2 items were found to be associated with the disease: cod fish pastry
(p<0.0001) [see table 1 at URL above] and red wine. While no data were
missing on consumption of cod fish pastry, information about the
consumption of red wine was available for only 78 cases and 68 controls.
Red wine consumption had a protective effect against the disease (odds
ratio 0.37; p=0.004). In addition to red wine, 3 other alcoholic beverages
had been offered during lunch: white wine, champagne, and brandy. A
dose-response effect became obvious with the number of alcoholic beverages
consumed (p=0.016).

The odds ratios for those guests consuming 1, 2 or 3 types of alcoholic
beverages were 0.87, 0.39, and 0.29 respectively.

Table 1: Association between cod fish pastry and disease.

Cod fish pastry: Cases / Controls
Ate: 118 / 45
Did not eat: 6 / 49

Odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 21.41 (8.01 to 60.53)

When a stratified analysis was performed, an interaction between red wine
and cod fish pastry was found. The odds ratio for cod fish pastry was 13.33
(p=0.0003) among people who drank red wine and infinity (p<0.0001) among
those who did not (table 2). In this last group all cases had eaten cod
fish pastry.

[Note: The infinity sign was translated to an 8 on the original
eurosurveillance weekly report and we repeated the error in posting.
We regret the error and would like to thank Dennis Bayomi for
pointing this out to us.]

Table 2: Odds ratios for cod fish pastry among those who drank and did not
drink red wine.

Drank red wine (n=57) . . . Did not drink red wine (n=89)
Cases / Controls . . . Cases / Controls
Ate: 20 / 15 . . . 56 / 10
Did not eat: 2 / 20 . . . 0 / 23

Odds ratio: 13.33 (p=0.0003)/ infinity (p< 0.0001)

[Note: The infinity sign was translated to an 8 on the original
eurosurveillance weekly report and we repeated the error in posting.

pointing this out to us.]

No food items were available for laboratory investigation. _Salmonella
enterica_ serovar Enteritidis was isolated in 25 of 30 stool samples from
cases; phage typing was performed in 2 of them (PT1). _S. enteritidis_ was
also isolated from 3 of 47 stool samples taken from food handlers at the
restaurant.

Food handlers were excluded from work and treated. The local health
authority instructed the restaurant not to serve food until its structural
and operational hygiene arrangements had been corrected.

A protective effect of alcohol has been reported in the literature (1,2).

[When reading the above report, this moderator had a flashback of an
observation made years ago upon return from a one month stay in a
geographic area known for high levels of "travellers diarrhea" having not
had any untoward illness during or following the trip. When asked by
colleagues on the gastroenterology service what was used as prevention, I
said "EtOH (ethanol) beginning around 12 noon daily". Seems to confirm the
adage that many a true word is said in jest. - Mod.MPP]
