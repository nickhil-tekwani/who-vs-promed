Foot rot disease attacks basmati crop in Punjab
-----------------------------------------------
Foot rot disease has attacked basmati [variety rice] crops in Punjab with farm experts advising farmers to take recommended steps to prevent damage.

In a survey conducted by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), it was found that the foot rot disease has started appearing in certain areas of Gurdaspur and Amritsar districts. There have [also] been few reports in Patiala district, according to additional [information].

Chander Mohan, PAU, said foot rot disease is a serious bottleneck in the successful cultivation of basmati rice in Punjab. "This fungal disease can cause tremendous losses to yield," he cautioned. Mohan said that the farmers have started the application of Trichoderma [biocontrol agent] and Carbendazim [fungicides] mixed with sand, which is a wasteful practice. The post-application of these treatments would not control the disease and would unnecessarily increase in cost of cultivation.

Instead, the farmers should uproot the affected plants and replace them with new seedlings, if available. Punjab is eying to increase basmati cultivation in the next years.

[Bakanae disease of rice (also called foot rot in India and Pakistan) is caused by the fungus _Gibberella fujikuroi_ and can cause significant crop losses of up to 50 percent. The fungus also affects other crops, including barley, maize, sorghum, sugarcane, tomato, banana, and cowpea. Symptoms on rice may include abnormal growth patterns (such as highly elongated tillers), reduced tillering, and partially filled or empty seed heads. Diseased plants show yellow green discolouration, their leaves dry up quickly, and they may be distributed irregularly in a field. Infected seedlings with necrotic lesions on roots may die before or after transplanting from seedbeds.

The fungus infects plants through roots or crowns and later becomes systemic. Seeds are usually infected during the flowering stage and the disease is primarily seed borne. The fungus survives under adverse conditions in infected seeds and diseased plant parts. Disease management is difficult and may include use of certified clean seeds and fungicides, however rapid development of pathogen resistance has been observed.

A bacterial foot rot of rice caused by _Erwinia chrysanthemi_ (with different biovars being renamed as _Dickeya_ species) is also known to cause significant crop damage in the region.
