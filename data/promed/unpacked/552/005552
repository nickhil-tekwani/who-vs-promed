French EVA outbreak stabilizing
-------------------------------
A stallion, several mares, and a foal have tested positive for equine
viral arteritis (EVA) at 2 French Lusitano farms in a new outbreak of
a disease not seen in France since 2007 [but see commentary below],
according to a European equine pathology surveillance network. The
mares suffered fertility issues, including abortion, and the foal
died.

"To our knowledge, several problems of reproduction were reported in
the breeding center where the foal died: embryonic reabsorption, low
fertility, and infertility," said Christel Marcillaud Pitel, director
of the Reseau d'Epidemio-Surveillance en Pathologie Equine [equine
pathology surveillance network] in Caen, France. "There was only one
case of an abortion causing an expulsed fetus, and the fetus was born
alive but very weak and it died within 48 hours."

The outbreak occurred in 2 neighboring farms in southeast France near
Marseille [Bouches-du-Rhone department] and Montpellier [Herault
department]. The outbreak appears to be limited to a Lusitano breeding
program in the area, Marcillaud Pitel said. The affected stallion's
semen was not shipped for artificial insemination because he only
provides live cover, she added.

Analyses revealed that both farms were affected by the same strain of
the virus, but the origin of the outbreak is unknown. The 2 farms have
been quarantined since the 1st case was detected in late June [2011].
Any horses that left the sites prior to the quarantine have been
tested for EVA. Results are pending, but the situation appears to be
stabilizing, Marcillaud Pitel said.

The last EVA outbreak in France [see commentary below] began in July
2007 and affected 26 farms in Normandy, including the French national
stud at Haras du Pin.

"For the moment (the current outbreak) is of a weaker amplitude
because it's localized in just these 2 sites," Marcillaud Pitel said.
"The virus also seems less virulent (than the one in 2007): the
symptoms are less remarkable, and it is less widespread among the
individuals."

The disease, which is caused by the equine arteritis virus, can cause
fever, edema, and abortion and is mainly transmitted through semen.
Affected horses can carry the virus for life after the acute stages of
the illness have passed. During the acute stage the virus can also be
transmitted via respiratory secretions.

[EVA has been annually reported to the OIE by France as present since
at least 1996. During 2010, 11 outbreaks were recorded from the
departments of Lot (2 outbreaks), Manche (1), Orne (1), Ardennes (1),
Bouches-du-Rhone (1), Calvados (1), and Correze (3). It will be
helpful to note if these records were related to clinical or
asymptomatic cases. The information by The Horse above, according to
which EVA is a "disease not seen in France since 2007", deserves
clarification. It will also be interesting to note if the introduction
of the agent may be attributed to national/international movements of
horses.

For detailed background on EVA, please refer to Mod.TG's commentary
in ProMED-mail posting 20100509.1513 and to OIE's Terrestrial Manual
