Monkeys die from a mysterious cause in the Inuyama primate research institute
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 44 Japanese monkeys "Snow Monkey" (_Macaca fuscata_) died
of a mysterious disease between 2001 and 2010 in the Primate Research
Institute of the Kyoto University, Inuyama city, Aichi Prefecture,
Japan. [We are told the university includes several
branches/campuses].

Tetsurou Matsuzawa, director of the Institute and professor at the
Kyoto University, said the cause of the cases would be an unknown
pathogen. Infection happened in only 3 places, and wouldn't spread to
man and other animals.

Phase 1: July 2001 to July 2002, 7 monkeys showed symptoms, of which 6 died.

Phase 2: March 2008 to April 2010, 39 monkeys showed symptoms, of
which 38 died.

Symptoms:
1 bleeding in internal organs
2 bleeding mucous membrane of nose
3 subcutaneous ecchymosis
4 dark brown muddy feces
5 especially almost no platelet in blood of most death cases
