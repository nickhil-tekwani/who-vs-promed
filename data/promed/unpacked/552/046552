Rabies, fox - Serbia & Montenegro
-----------------------------------------
Rabid foxes are being found in areas that have been rabies-free for
decades. During the past year [2005?], 15 rabid foxes were identified in
the area of Belgrade. Four people who had contact with one of those foxes,
but were not bitten, received prophylaxis.
The last reported case of human rabies in Serbia was in 1972 in Kosovo and
Metohija.

[Unless there is a proper surveillance program for rabies, whether in
domestic or wildlife animals, such reports are hard to interpret. That
these were noted in the Belgrade area suggests a metrocentric bias in the
reporting. Or put another way, it could well be far worse in the distant
rural areas, but until Belgrade noted the situation, it hadn't existed.
However, if one questions the OIE HANDISTATUS data for Serbia & Montenegro,
there is clearly a well recognized and reported rabies problem throughout
the country (see
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/sit_pays_mald_pl.asp?c_pays=216&c_mald=26>),
with large numbers of wildlife cases each year (67 to 186 per year from
1996 to 2004) and significant numbers of dogs and cats being vaccinated;
domestic dog and cat vaccination is mandatory, and stray populations are
being actively reduced in metropolitan areas. An oral vaccination program
for foxes was due to be initiated in 2005. - Mod.MHJ]
