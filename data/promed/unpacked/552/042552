[Although a number of sources had recently reported decreasing numbers of daily cases, the numbers seem to support the continuing robust number of daily cases. If the epidemic were to continue at the current rate of cases per day, by the end of 2017, there could be 700 000 more cases for a total of 1.12 million cases since the end of April 2017, with 3300 more deaths for a total of about 5500 deaths over that period. With the continued hostilities in Yemen and the onset of the rainy season, whatever was reported as a decrease in cases will likely and perhaps dramatically be reversed. In August 2017, 171 296 cases were reported; that is 5710 new cases of cholera PER DAY. Whether some of the newly reported upswing of cases are due to other causes is unclear since the ability to formally diagnose these cases is quite limited by military operations throughout the country.

This continuing, record-breaking cholera disaster in Yemen is only about 18 weeks old and is 3.68 times the total number of cases of 2015 and 87 percent more than the peak year of the Haiti outbreak (2011) of 340 311 cases. - Mod.LL
