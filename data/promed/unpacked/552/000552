I found it very interesting that within 2 days there were reports of
increasing leptospirosis in dogs in both the USA and Australia. Australia
has very strict quarantine regulations which should make it difficult for
leptospirosis to be imported. Also Australia weather/seasons are the
opposite to the USA. Is there an explanation for this apparent increase at
about the same time? Are other countries seeing this also in dogs?
About 10(?) years ago, I recall there was a worldwide outbreak of a new
virulent strain of parvovirus infections in dogs including Australia. One
explanation I heard offered for this rapid spread around the world
(including into quarantined countries like Australia) was one of the canine
vaccines had been contaminated with the new virulent strain of parvovirus.
Is there an international vehicle by which leptospirosis could be
potentially spread?
