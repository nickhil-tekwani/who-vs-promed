According to veterinarian Antonio Lopez Palacios of the Ecuadorian Sanitary
Farming Division (SESA), 90 out of 360 cattle at the La Trujillo ranch --
located in the Viche parish of the Quninde canton of San Lorenzo -- have
been infected with foot and mouth disease.
The outbreak was detected last Wednesday [22 Sep 2004]. The animals were
isolated from the rest of the cattle at the cattle ranch and are presently
being treated with specialized antibiotics, but, there is a danger that the
disease may spread to neighboring farms, said Lopez.
[Let's hope something is lost in translation, because isolating sick
animals from other animals on a ranch, i.e. a single premise, is usually
just a recipe for further spread of the disease onto other premises. FMD is
noted for its characteristic rapid spread throughout the herd. Moreover,
treating with antibiotics will do absolutely nothing against a viral
infection such as FMD, except protect against secondary infections of foot
and teat lesions. - Mod.PC]
Lopez pointed out that it was curious that all of the affected animals had
been vaccinated this past 1 Jul 2004, and, therefore, should have been
protected against foot and mouth disease. For this reason, the director of
SESA has requested an investigation to determine what failed with respect
to the vaccination. A request for an explanation was sent to the Colombian
laboratories Laverlam, which produced the Aftovac vaccine.
Marco Tello, president of the Association of Eseraldas Cattle Dealers, said
that the association members have had doubts [concerns? - Mod.PC] for
several months that the vaccines were not potent. The vaccine costs 40
cents and should be applied every 6 months to the cattle.

[One explanation is that the wrong strain was contained in the vaccine, a
common, though not insoluble, problem for vaccination programs in endemic
countries such as Ecuador.
It is rather important to know the strain involved in this outbreak, as
there have been reported, in the last couple of months, a type A from
Colombia, a type O from Peru, a rarely seen type C from an island in the
Amazon in Brazil, and an earlier type O from Brazil. - Mod.PC]
