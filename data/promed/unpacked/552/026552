Uganda's health ministry today reported 14 more lab-confirmed Ebola cases, pushing the outbreak total to 109. Health officials also reported 2 more deaths, raising the total to 30. Earlier in the outbreak, before the 1st cases were confirmed, the ministry reported 20 suspected cases, all of them fatal.

At a media briefing today [26 Oct 2022], Uganda Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero, MBChB, MPH, said 45 people are being treated for their infections.

The World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said in its latest weekly health emergencies update that Uganda's outbreak has expanded to 2 more districts, Kampala and Wakiso, raising the number of affected locations to 7. It warned that further expansion of the outbreak is possible, given that high-risk contacts have been identified for follow-up in 5 yet-unaffected districts.

Uganda is making progress with case management but needs more isolation units, ambulances, human resources, and funding to battle the outbreak, the WHO said.

Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said yesterday [25 Oct 202] that it is stepping up its response. It said its teams will expand to help with the response, including medical care, in Kampala.

MSF is currently supporting the treatment of sick people in Mubende, the outbreak's epicenter. One 40-bed treatment facility has been completed there, and another 40-bed unit with the capacity to provide intensive care is under construction in the same area. An 8-bed unit in Madudu is up and running. MSF also said it stands ready to help with clinical trials of vaccines and treatments for the less common Sudan Ebola virus that is fueling the country's outbreak.

Uganda: MSF steps up Ebola response one month after outbreak declaration
"Preventing further spread of Ebola
In Mubende -- the epicenter of the epidemic -- several MSF teams are currently deployed. Some of these staff are visiting health centers or schools where people with Ebola have passed through to support prevention and infection control. MSF health promotion teams are also in the area identifying and monitoring contacts of people who've been confirmed to have Ebola, as well as raise awareness about how to prevent the spread and what they should do if they develop symptoms.

"One of the most important goals in controlling the spread of the outbreak is to reduce the time between the first symptoms of the disease and its management," said Denis K. Mbae, outreach project coordinator. "We know that the earlier patients are treated, the greater their chances of survival and the less risk there is of the disease spreading within the community."

"On the epidemiological side, MSF's research arm, Epicentre, is collaborating with the ministry of health to support activities like disease surveillance and infection control and prevention in the areas where Ebola has been detected.

"Ensuring care for people who fall ill
MSF continues to support the Ugandan ministry of health in the medical treatment of sick people in Mubende district. One 40-bed Ebola treatment center has been completed, and another 40-bed facility, which will have the capacity to provide intensive care, is under construction in Mubende town for people confirmed to have Ebola. An 8-bed treatment unit in Madudu for those in the early stages of the disease is also now up and running."
