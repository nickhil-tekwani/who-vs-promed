With 135 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) -- which manifests itself in the form of brain fever -- Lucknow district has the maximum number of cases of the deadly disease this year [2018] among 48 districts of the state where it is reported. This is 15 times more than the number of cases last year [2017].

The data maintained by the health department from 1 Jan - 6 Jul this year [2018] records 11 AES deaths in Lucknow. Apart from this, 6 cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE), a disease which is spread by mosquitoes, and 2 JE deaths have been recorded from the district.

In 2017, while there were merely 9 cases of AES from Lucknow, only one JE case was reported between 1 Jan - 6 Jul [2017]. No patient was recorded to have died due [to these diseases].

As of now, the state [of Uttar Pradesh] has recorded 1219 cases of AES, which is more than double the number of cases, 517, recorded last year [2017]. The health department claims the spurt is because of enhanced monitoring of all fever patients. "The rise of cases is because of better reporting and awareness. The special Vector-Borne Diseases Month is also working," said a health department official.

[Japanese encephalitis cases continue to occur in Uttar Pradesh state annually, although they comprise a minor proportion of encephalitis cases. The JE and AES season is now underway in northeastern India, and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018). It is odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination in the report above.

As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_).

As noted previously, a recent publication of investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 AES outbreaks indicated that scrub typhus, caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, was the etiology in about 60 percent of those AES cases. In the report above, there is no mention of scrub typhus.
