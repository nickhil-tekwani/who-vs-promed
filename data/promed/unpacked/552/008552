Viral gastroenteritis Italy - final report
------------------------------------------
Following the previous message dated 26 Jun 2009 [see: Viral
gastroenteritis - Italy: (BS) norovirus susp. 20090626.2331], we here
transmit the report with the final results of the diagnostic
investigations performed at IZSLER [Istituto Zooprofilattico
Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna] in order to
ascertain the aetiological causes of a large outbreak of human gastroenteritis.

As previously described the outbreak started at mid-June [2009] and
occurred in San Felice del Benaco, a small tourist town on Lake
Garda, North Italy, where more than 3000 people were affected by
enteric signs and over 400 asked for assistance at local hospitals.

Since then over 138 samples were referred for diagnostic examination
to IZSLER, including 44 samples of human faeces whilst the remaining
samples were represented by tap water, lake water, sands and water
filters. By now we have completed the examination on 107 samples of
which 41 are faecal samples.

In addition to routine bacteriological and parasitological
examinations for the detection of enteric agents such as Salmonella
sp, Shigella sp, Campylobacter sp, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas
sp and Cryptosporidium hominis, we performed the following specific
investigations on the faecal samples:

1. Clostridium perfringens toxin
2. Norwalk [norovirus] Genotype I and II by real time PCR
3. Enterovirus by PCR and negative staining EM
4. Rotavirus by PCR, negative staining EM and ELISA
5. Astrovirus by PCR and negative staining EM

The C. perfrigens toxin was never found in any samples, whereas most
of the samples tested positive for one or more viruses; i.e.,
norovirus (28/41), rotavirus (18/41), enterovirus (11/41) and
astrovirus (4/41). Only 5 faecal samples were totally negative.

In order to investigate the source of the infection and to confirm
the contamination of the potable water distribution system, over 44
water samples were tested for the presence of viruses and toxins
(including algal and bacterial toxins). No toxins were detected but
viral examinations were positive for norovirus and enterovirus also
when we tested the filters and the water after the treatment of
depuration[purification]. Many other water samples are now under
examination in order to verify the efficacy of improved methods of
filtration and disinfection of the water for public distribution and use.

In conclusion, the clinical and epidemiologic patterns of the
outbreak together with the diagnostic results are highly indicative
of a classical viral gastroenteritis. It was likely characterized by
an initial positivity for norovirus and rotavirus for few days
followed by secondary bacterial infections. To note that the
positivity for norovirus was prevalent in adults, whilst rotavirus
was prevalent in young (<15 year old).
