Disease report (preliminary outbreak assessment, Ref: VITT 1200/SVD -
Portugal)
--------------
Swine vesicular disease (SVD) has been reported in pigs from a farm in
Beja, southern Portugal (1). Confirmation was by virus isolation subsequent
to initial serological detection. Portugal has instituted the prescribed EC
control measures including stamping out of the affected herd (2). SVD was
last reported in Portugal in January 2004.
Situation assessment
--------------------
SVD is a disease of pigs that causes symptoms indistinguishable from foot
and mouth disease. It is caused by an enterovirus of the family
_Picornaviridae_ that is believed to be recently derived from the human
coxsackievirus B5 (3).
SVD is endemic in Italy and has occurred sporadically in Portugal.
A search of TRACES (European Commission Trade Control and Expert System)
shows that there have been no imports of live pigs from Portugal to the UK
during the past 3 months. TRACES does not record movements of pig meat
products.
The following qualitative risk assessment was published after the last
reported outbreak of SVD in Portugal:

Conclusion
----------
This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of routine biosecurity
measures including disinfection of livestock vehicles and the ban on
swill-feeding. We will continue to monitor the situation and will review
the assessment should the situation change significantly.
