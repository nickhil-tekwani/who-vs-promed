Parasite common in fish now found in ducks
------------------------------------------
A parasite from a group that commonly infests fish has been found for
the 1st time in warm-blooded animals -- particularly ducks --
sometimes with fatal results.

Oregon State University microbiologist Jerri Bartholomew says it is
unusual to see a group of parasites develop a new host, and more
study is needed to see how big a problem this could become.

Myxozoa (MIX-o-ZO-ah) is a group of microscopic parasites that can be
found in virtually all fish. One species is responsible for whirling
disease, a deadly condition that has struck trout in many western streams.

A study published in the International Journal of Parasitology
identifies 9 cases of a newly found species of myxozoa in ducks.

[ProMED-mail contacted Dr. Bartholomew and asked: Has this been found
in other parts of the world? Are there others that have
seen/investigated/researching the same? - Mod.TG]

As far as we know this has only been seen here, but the widespread
nature of the detections here suggest this is should not be isolated
to any particular region. I am hoping that others who have seen
something like this will get in touch with us. We would really like
to have additional samples and documentation of additional cases, so
please feel free to provide that request and my contact information.

There are a number of researchers that specialize in this group
worldwide, and to my knowledge, none have ever seen this infection in
birds. However, 2 laboratories in Europe (Poland and Czech Rep) have
detected infections in shrews recently.

[Dr. Bartholomew was kind enough to send a file of the published
paper. The following remarks are extracted from that paper:

Myxozoan parasitism in waterfowl

"Myxozoans are spore-forming, metazoan parasites common in
cold-blooded aquatic vertebrates, especially fishes, with alternate
life cycle stages developing in invertebrates. We report 9 cases of
infection in free-flying native and captive exotic ducks
(Anseriformes: Anatidae) from locations across the United States and
describe the 1st myxozoan in birds, _Myxidium anatidum_ n. sp. We
found developmental stages and mature spores in the bile ducts of a
Pekin duck (domesticated _Anas platyrhynchos_). Spores are
lens-shaped in sutural view, slightly sigmoidal in valvular view,
with 2 polar capsules, and each valve cell has 14-16 longitudinal
surface ridges. Spore dimensions are 23.1 lm _ 10.8 lm _ 11.2 lm.
Phylogenetic analysis of the ssrRNA gene revealed closest affinity
with Myxidium species described from chelonids (tortoises). Our novel
finding broadens the definition of the Myxozoa to include birds as
hosts and has implications for understanding myxozoan evolution, and
mechanisms of geographical and host range extension. The number of
infection records indicates this is not an incidental occurrence, and
the detection of such widely dispersed cases suggests more myxozoans
in birds will be encountered with increased surveillance of these
hosts for pathogens." - Mod.TG]
