[Thus, as well as cat scratches, human acquisition of sporotrichosis has
been documented in association with bites from badgers, squirrels, rats,
and iguanas. Benenson's Control of Communicable Diseases Manual describes
the infection as an occupational diseases of farmers and gardeners. The
fungus, it says, is introduced through the skin by thorns, barbs, or wood
splinters. It appears that animal claws and teeth can do the same. - Mod.SH
