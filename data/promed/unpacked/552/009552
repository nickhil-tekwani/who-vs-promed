Bad vaccines risk encephalitis epidemic in India
------------------------------------------------
India's government sent thousands of ineffective vaccines to a
northern Indian state, halting a planned immunization drive against a
deadly outbreak of Japanese encephalitis that has killed more than
200 children since June [2008], officials said Wednesday [17 Sep 2008].

The mistake -- compounding delays in starting the immunizations --
raises chances that hundreds more children could die of the disease
this year [2008], health officials warned.

North India's impoverished Uttar Pradesh state suffers from recurring
annual outbreaks of the mosquito-borne disease, which causes high
fevers and vomiting -- and sometimes comas and death. It is
particularly deadly among children.

Japanese encephalitis can be prevented by a vaccine, but stocks sent
by the federal government to the state showed in testing that they
were "unfit for human use," state Health Minister Anant Kumar Mishra
told The Associated Press in Lucknow, the state capital.

"Over 1000 people have been affected with encephalitis, and we are
not sure when the fresh stock of vaccines will arrive," Mishra said.
"In the absence of vaccine we cannot start the vaccination drive."

In 2005, more than 1500 children were killed by the disease, but the
numbers dropped sharply after the government started an annual
vaccination drive in 2006.

Last year [2007], about 400 children were killed by Japanese
encephalitis [virus] in Uttar Pradesh. Officials had hoped to keep
the death toll relatively low this year [2008].

Uttar Pradesh's director general of health, Ishwar Sharan Srivastava,
said the state had asked for the vaccines earlier -- in time for the
monsoon season's start in June -- but only received them last week
[week of 8 Sep 2008]. He said they needed up to 1 million vaccine [doses].

And Mishra said that of the 460 000 vaccine [doses] received, many
had indicators that they had lost their potency. Officials from the
federal Health Ministry said it was not immediately clear what happened.

"It is hard to tell as how these vaccines got spoiled. The exact
reason could be ascertained only after tests," said Dr Jagdish
Chandra, a Health Ministry expert sent to investigate.

At least 234 children, all under 15 years, have died of the disease
since June this year [2008], and the death toll is likely to rise
without vaccinations, Mishra said.

Encephalitis usually spreads in eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh during
and after the June-to-September monsoon season, when pools of
stagnant water provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

The mosquitoes transmit the virus from pigs and birds to humans.
Since most infected people never develop symptoms, many adults are
immune from earlier exposure -- leaving young children most vulnerable.

[The newswire refers to the existing Japanese encephalitis (JEV)
vaccine distributed in Uttar Pradesh as "unfit for human
consumption". A further scientific definition of "unfit for human
consumption" is not specifically provided so it is unclear if the
problem relates to a break in the cold chain or if the problem
relates to the initial production process. In the former case, the
cold chain refers to the temperature requirements to maintain potency
of manufactured vaccine from the production site up through the
actual delivery site when vaccine is administered. Many of the
vaccines in use today are heat labile, so that if stored or
transported at high temperatures, the vaccine will lose its potency.
To monitor this, vaccine vials now have temperature markers, which
will change color when the vaccine has been exposed to temperatures
above safe levels that would threaten the vaccine potency. The
newswire above suggests that this is the case: "many had indicators
that they had lost their potency."

According to the WHO (World Health Organization) website, "Licensed
JE vaccines include inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines, a Vero
cell-derived inactivated vaccine, and a live attenuated SA14-14-2
vaccine produced in primary hamster kidney cells. Currently, there is
no JE vaccine which is WHO-prequalified. Recognizing the burden of
disease, more countries are introducing JE vaccination into their
routine paediatric schedules. The inactivated mouse brain-derived
vaccine is gradually being replaced by the live attenuated SA14-14-2
vaccine. In addition, several candidate vaccines are in late stage
development, and are expected to be licensed in the near future. With
improved vaccines becoming available, the global demand for JE
vaccines is projected to more than double by 2012." (For detailed
information on the types of vaccine currently in use and under study, see
<http://www.path.org/vaccineresources/files/JE_vaccines_at_a_glance_25Mar08.pdf>).


In the past, India was using a locally prepared JEV that was an
inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine. In the recent past, in
collaboration with PATH (formerly known as Program for Appropriate
Technology in Health), India has been using the live attenuated
SA14-14-2 vaccine to expand vaccination activities against JE in the
country (see <http://www.path.org/projects/japanese_encephalitis_project.php>).

If the vaccines that were used in Uttar Pradesh (UP) were substandard
in terms of potency, that would help to explain why this year (2008)
has seen a major increase in the JE activity in UP in spite of
increased vaccination activities.

More information on official investigations on the potency of
distributed JEV in Uttar Pradesh from knowledgeable sources would be
greatly appreciated.
