State lab confirms coyote in Prowers County had rabies
------------------------------------------------------
The laboratory of the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment has confirmed a rabies-positive coyote from Prowers
County. This is the 1st coyote to test positive for rabies in
Colorado in at least 30 years, according to John Pape, an
epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment.
The coyote was shot after attacking a person on 15 Jun 2007. The
coyote was submitted to the state lab for rabies testing on 18 Jun
2007. The person bitten by the coyote is currently undergoing
preventative rabies treatment.
"As a result of the positive rabies test on the animal, Prowers
County Public Health has placed a public health order for Prowers
County requiring dogs and cats in the county to be up to date on
rabies vaccinations," said Jackie Brown, director, Prowers County
Public Health Nursing Service. "All dogs and cats in the county must
have documentation of a current rabies vaccination within 30 days of
the order being issued. Under Colorado law, rabies vaccinations
must be administered by a licensed veterinarian," said Pape. "Owners
cannot administer vaccinations themselves." "We encourage pet owners
to contact their veterinarian immediately to get pets up to date on
their vaccinations," added Brown. "It is a simple and effective way
to protect your pets and family from this deadly disease."
Brain tissue from the coyote is being sent to a U.S. Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) laboratory for typing of the rabies strain. The
CDC lab has tests that can tell if a rabies strain is from a bat,
skunk, dog, or other animal, giving a clue as to how the
coyote was infected.
"In the past, isolated rabies cases in animals have turned out to be
a bat strain, usually meaning the infected animal found and ate a
bat," said Pape. Bat strains of rabies virus have limited risk of
becoming established in other animal species and spreading to other
wildlife and pets.
"However, given the location in the southeastern corner of the state,
it is possible that this case could be a skunk strain of rabies,"'
explained Pape. The skunk strain is commonly found in Kansas and
Oklahoma, and has occasionally showed up in eastern Colorado. "If
this turns out to be a skunk variant strain, then people need to be
alert for other infected animals in the area. If skunk rabies has
re-entered Colorado and is circulating in the area, it would greatly
increase the risk of rabies being transmitted to pets or livestock,"
he added. "This is why the county has enacted the public health
order, and it is important for owners to keep their pets'
vaccinations current."
Rabies is a virus that affects the nervous system of humans and other
mammals, resulting in a fatal disease. The virus is shed in the
saliva of infected animals. People and animals get rabies from the
bite of a rabid animal or contact with saliva from such an animal.
To prevent possible exposure to rabies, state health experts warned
Coloradans to keep their pets' vaccinations up to date, leave bats
and other wildlife alone and, if they suspect a family member or pet
has been bitten, to hold the animal for possible rabies testing.
Pape said that rabies in bats is quite common in Colorado, with 30 to
60 confirmed cases each year. However rabies in animals such as
skunks, raccoons, foxes, and domestic animals is rare. Cases of
rabies found in Colorado in cats, foxes, skunks, and cattle over the
past 20 years have been due to exposures to bats or have been
imported from states where rabies is more prevalent. In 2005, a rabid
fox was reported in Otero County, after it was observed trying to
attack 2 large dogs in broad daylight. It was shown to have a bat
strain of rabies virus.
The last human case of rabies in Colorado was back in 1931.
"Bats and other wildlife should not be handled. If a wild animal
allows a person to approach and handle it, the animal is probably ill
or injured and will bite in self-defense. A healthy animal usually
will remain well-hidden and avoid human contact," said Pape.
Other signs of rabies in animals include abnormal behavior such as
nocturnal species being active in the day; animals approaching humans
or other animals; difficulty with walking or movement; and unusual
vocalization (such as excessive bellowing in cows or hissing/chirping
in bats). Such signs are an indication the animal is ill. Some
animals with rabies will be very aggressive (furious rabies) while
others may appear almost catatonic (dumb rabies). Pets should be
examined by a veterinarian. Suspected rabid animals should be avoided
and reported to the local authorities.

[A discussion of rabies virus may be found on ProMED-mail posting
20070426.1364.
Post-exposure rabies prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated persons
should always include administration of both human rabies immune
globulin (HRIG) and a series of 5 rabies vaccinations. The
combination of immune globulin and vaccine is recommended for both
bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the time elapsed since the
exposure. Previously immunized persons should receive only vaccine.
Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) provides rapid passive immune
protection. It is given only once, on the 1st day of the
post-exposure prophylaxis regimen (designated day 0). As much as
possible of the HRIG should be infiltrated into and around the wound,
and the remaining given intramuscularly at a site distant from the
vaccination site (frequently the gluteals [buttocks]) . If the HRIG
was not administered
on day 0, it may be administered through the 7th day of the regimen.
Beyond the 7th day, HRIG is not indicated since an antibody response
to vaccine is presumed to have occurred. The recommended dosage of
HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight, for all ages. No more than the
recommended dosage of HRIG should be given.
Rabies vaccine induces an active immune response that requires 7 to
10 days to develop and persists for 2 years or longer. The PEP
vaccine series consists of 5 1-ml doses of rabies vaccine given on
days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. The injection must be given intramuscularly
in the deltoid [shoulder] region of adults or in the anterolateral thigh of
young children. The 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be administered
in conjunction with HRIG on day 0 of the PEP regimen, except in
previously vaccinated individuals. Previously vaccinated persons are
given 2 1.0 ml doses of vaccine IM, on days 0 and 3 (no HRIG is
administered).
In the USA there are 2 inactivated cell culture rabies vaccines
currently available: human diploid cell vaccine (HDVC) and purified
chick embryo cell vaccine (PCEC). Both are considered equally safe
and efficacious. It is recommended that a vaccine series be initiated
and completed with the same vaccine product.
In general, there is a very low frequency of serious adverse
reactions to the rabies PEP regimen. Local pain and low-grade fever
may follow administration of HRIG. Pain, erythema, swelling, itching,
and other mild local reactions are reported among 30 percent to 74
percent of vaccinees. Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle
aches, dizziness, or other systemic reactions are reported among 5
percent to 40 percent of vaccinees. Rabies PEP should not be
interrupted or discontinued because of local or mild systemic adverse
reactions to rabies vaccine. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
antipyretic agents may be used to control mild adverse reactions.
An immune-complex-like reaction (generalized urticaria, sometimes
accompanied by arthralgia, arthritis, angioedema, nausea, vomiting,
fever, and malaise) occurs in approximately 6 percent of
pre-exposure-vaccinated individuals receiving a booster dose. This
reaction can rarely occur in persons receiving their primary
vaccination regimen; however it has not been reported to be life
threatening in either case.
When a person with a history of serious hypersensitivity to rabies
vaccine must be revaccinated, antihistamines may be administered
concomitant with vaccine, and the person should be observed for
development of anaphylaxis immediately following vaccination. The
Acute Disease Investigation and Control Section of CDC is available for
consultation about the management of possible rabies exposure and PEP
in patients with a history of serious adverse reactions to rabies
vaccine.
