-----------------------------------------
There was uneasy silence in the Bayelsa State capital following the announcement by the Disease Surveillance and Notification Unit (DSN) of Yenagoa local government area of the State that 18 polio-related cases have been reported in the council within the last 8 months.

According to the announcement, 18 cases of the acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) were reported within the 15 wards of the Yenagoa local government area. An officer attached to the Disease Surveillance and Notification Unit (DSN) reported that 9 suspected measles cases and 3 of neonatal tetanus were also reported within this period. He described the disease outbreak as a "threat" to society and maintained that DSN was committed to check any disease endemic and promoting quality health in the local government.

Measles cases in Central Visayas up a whopping 1260
---------------------------------------------------
Measles cases in Central Visayas from January to 13 Sep of this year [2014] reached 1387 with 7 deaths, or 1260 percent higher than the same period last year [2013], the Department of Health (DOH) in Region VII (DOH-7) said yesterday [15 Sep 2014]. Last year, only 102 measles cases were recorded for the entire Central Visayas region with no fatalities, according to records released by the DOH's Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit 7 (RESU-7).

RESU-7 medical chief Dr. Dino Caing said the rise in the number of measles cases in the region can be attributed to the different calamities that struck Cebu, Bohol and Leyte late last year [2013]. This year [2014], Cebu City has the most number of measles cases with 508 and one death, followed by Talisay City with 70 cases and one death. Cases were also recorded in Naga, Argao, Sibonga, San Fernando, and San Francisco in Camotes Island.

The rise in the number of measles cases in Cebu was also due to the coming in of calamity victims into Cebu from Bohol, Leyte and other affected areas. Dr. Caing reiterated the DOH's call for parents to immediately bring their kids, aged 5 and below, to the nearest health centers for measles immunisation. He also urged parents or guardians of children that manifest signs of measles to immediately rush the patient to the hospital or health centers for immediate medical assistance.

Contaminated Measles Vaccine Kills 15 Syrian Children
-----------------------------------------------------
A muscle relaxant appears to have been mixed mistakenly with measles vaccine, killing 15 children in Syria this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday [19 Sep 2014], calling it the biggest such tragedy in memory. The WHO said it could not completely rule out sabotage, so the measles inoculation campaign remained suspended until the investigation was finished. 15 children died after being vaccinated against measles in northern Syria, aid workers said on Wednesday [17 Sep 2014], a tragedy likely to damage trust in health services in opposition-held areas.

The manufacturer, who has not been identified, shipped the vaccine in powder form with a diluent to a hub in Syria where it was stored and then sent to Deir al-Zor and Idlib provinces for the campaign to vaccinate tens of thousands of children that began on Monday [15 Sep 2014], WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said. "In the hub apparently, (from) what we know so far, the diluent was kept ... together in the same refrigerator with a muscle relaxant. The relaxant is called Atracurium. This got mixed in some cases instead of the diluent with the vaccine powder," Lindmeier told a news briefing in Geneva.

Pointing to human error, he said: "So the ones who packed it obviously put the wrong ampoules with the vaccine powder into the package. Then it gets shipped in the vaccine carriers to the facility, there it gets unpacked, mixed and then it has to be used within 6 hours. "So both at the packing and at the unpacking there had to be gross negligence," Lindmeier said. The muscle relaxant, usually administered as an anesthetic for surgery, works according to weight, so all the children who died were under the age of 2, he said. Older children survived after vomiting, diarrhea and anaphylactic shock.

Lindmeier said: "It seems very clear that it was not the manufacturer's fault, not that the vaccine is contaminated, but it's a fault on the ground, again not established whether it's human error or deliberate, but the fault lies on the ground as per indications." It was not clear who was in charge of the refrigerator and investigations continue, he said. The WHO and UNICEF supported the campaign but were not directly involved due to insecurity and the "politically-charged" situation in the area, he added. "There is still a slight possibility that it's not only human error, but an intent, that has to be cleared up definitely before anything can continue," he said.

More than 50 000 children in the 2 provinces (Deir al-Zor and Idlib) province received the vaccine before the campaign was suspended, he added. Prior to Syria's civil war, some 99 percent of children were vaccinated against measles.

[Another version of this report also attributed to UNICEF cites the number of casualties as 34. Another account of this incident involved poliovirus vaccine in addition to measles vaccine and can be read in the ProMED-mail posts: Vaccine adverse event - Syria (ID, DY): muscle relaxant, fatalities 20140918.2784470 and Vaccine adverse event, fatalities - Syria (02): (ID, DY) muscle relaxant 20140920.2790839.

Idlib governorate, which is the site of this incident, is held by moderate rebel groups opposed to both Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and the extremist Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), according to the UNICEF report. - Mod.CP

Measles outbreak over after 281 cases
-------------------------------------
The measles outbreak in the North Island has been declared over. There have been 281 confirmed measles cases across the North Island since December [2013], with 15 percent of the cases requiring hospital treatment, said Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew. The outbreak mainly hit the Waikato and Auckland regions. Public Health Units in the affected regions have been working hard to halt the spread of this highly infectious virus, says Ms Goodhew.

This has included quarantining unimmunised people who have been exposed to the measles virus, promoting immunisation and raising awareness of the symptoms and seriousness of measles. "However, with outbreaks of measles still occurring overseas, we cannot be complacent. The current outbreak began from New Zealanders returning from overseas where they had contracted measles, so we know that it can easily occur again," Ms Goodhew says. As immunisation continues to be the best form of protection, people should check their immunisation status, and get themselves and their families immunised against measles as soon as possible, she says.
