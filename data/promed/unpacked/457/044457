YELLOW FEVER, MONKEYS - BRAZIL: (GOIAS, FEDERAL DISTRICT): CONFIRMED

Yellow fever (YF) has been confirmed in 3 monkeys in the state of
Goias, out of dozens found dead in recent weeks in 31 municipalities
in the state and 10 districts in the state capital, Goiania [see
ProMED ref. below. The report does not say in which of these
locality(ies) the positive monkeys were found. - Mod.JW].

In Brasilia, the Federal capital, 6 monkeys have been reported dead
in the last 10 days, of which 4 died of poisoning from eating fruit
contaminated with fertilizer, according to Jair Iamamoto, Adjunct
Secretary of Health of the Federal District [which is almost
encircled by Goias state -- see map URL below]. The other 2 died in
the National Park of Brasilia, also known as the Mineral Water Park,
which has been closed as a preventive measure pending the results of
tests on the monkeys, which will take at least 20 days. The park is
normally visited daily by hundreds of tourists and swimmers. Goias
state plans to vaccinate 800 000 people (15 percent of its
population) who have not received the vaccine within the last 10
years [the recommended interval before a booster -- but in fact
immunity from one shot is probably life-long. - Mod.JW], and mobilize
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito control agents [the mosquito which transmits
YF in urban areas. - Mod.JW]. The Ministry of Health sent 300 000
doses of YF vaccine to Goiania on Thursday [27 Dec 2007], but there
is a shortage of syringes and needles, as mass vaccination had not
been foreseen.

[In 2000 a patient suffering from YF was admitted to hospital in
Brasilia -- see ProMED references below. Fortunately, there was no
spread within the nation's capital.

[Assuming that the population in Goias can be vaccinated quickly, the
risk of a YF epidemic there can be reduced. The greatest risk would
be travel of infected and viremia people to other parts of Brazil or
other areas of the world where _Aedes aegypti_ populations are
abundant. The significant dengue virus epidemics in Latin America and
other parts of the tropical world indicate that those abundant _Aedes
aegypti_ populations exist. One hopes that those countries have
contingency plans in place to deal with a surprise YF outbreak there. - Mod.TY]
