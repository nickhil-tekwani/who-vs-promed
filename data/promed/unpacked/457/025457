Kyoto Prefecture announced on [Thu 15 Sep 2022] the death of a woman in her 90s after presenting with diarrhea and abdominal pain linked to eating beef yukhoe sold by Meat & Fresh Takami, a meat dealer in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ O157 was detected in the woman's stool.

In addition, 22 men and women between the ages of 9 and 87 who ate yukhoe and roast beef at this restaurant complained of similar symptoms, and _E. coli_ O157 was detected in 12 people including asymptomatic people. The prefectural government determined that these foods were the cause of the food poisoning.

The deceased woman ate yukhoe, which was sold as "rare steak," at home on [Sat 27 Aug 2022], and developed symptoms on [Fri 2 Sep 2022]. She died in hospital on [Thu 15 Sep 2022]. A total of 22 other people ate the meat dealer's stand from [21-26 Aug 2022].

[The following is abstracted from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukhoe

"Yukhoe (Korea) is a raw meat dish in Korean cuisine. It is most commonly made of beef but it can come in various kinds and cuts of meat.

"Yukhoe literally means 'raw (hoe) meat (yuk)'. Therefore, in the strictest context, the term designates any dish of raw meat cut up for consumption without the marinade. But colloquially yukhoe means a dish of marinated raw beef slices. Although relatively rare to find these days, yukhoe can come in all kinds of meat. Yukhoe made of other meats will mention the source of the meat, for instance, a kkwong-yukhoe is made of pheasant, and a mal-yukhoe is made of horse meat.

"Yukhoe is most commonly made of lean cuts such as an eye of round, but more tender cuts of a beef can also be used. The beef is cut into thin strips while removing the fat, then it is seasoned with salt, sugar, sesame oil, pepper, and garlic. Korean pear, raw egg yolk, and pine nuts are commonly used as garnishes. It is similar to a Western tartare or a Levantine kibbeh nayeh.

"In April and May 2011, 5 people died and more than 35 people were hospitalised after eating yukke (Japanese spelling) made from beef not designated for raw consumption in various branches of a bulgogi restaurant chain in Toyama and Kanagawa prefectures, Japan, with enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ bacteria found in many of the cases. As a result, the MHLW developed regulations for trimming raw beef to remove surface contamination, and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) developed new regulations to require cooking the surface 1 cm deep to further reduce contamination. However, since the dimensions of individual pieces of yukhoe/yukke are quite smaller than 1 cm cubes, preparing the beef to this standard would cook it all the way through, and it would no longer be yukhoe/yukke (a sort of "Catch-22" - Mod.LL)."

Since the contamination of beef with EHEC generally occurs on the surface of the meat, if the piece of meat is adequately cooked, the risk from eating it is quite low. However, cutting the meat into chucks (as noted above) can introduce the pathogen more broadly (similar to cutting into a surface-contaminated melon) and if the meat is not cooked, the risk of infection remains. If the meat is tenderized mechanically, bacteria can also be internally inoculated and if undercooked can cause illness. - Mod.LL
