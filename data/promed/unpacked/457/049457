In Meghalaya's South West Garo Hills district, 3 people died of Japanese encephalitis (JE), prompting the district administration to reach out to citizens to prevent the disease from assuming epidemic proportions.

Japanese encephalitis claimed 3 lives in and around Ampati, the headquarters of South West Garo Hills, an official communique stated. Another case has been reported in the district.

Deputy commissioner Ram Singh today called a meeting with district officials, nokmas (headmen), NGOs, local leaders and senior citizens to take stock of the situation. The Ampati medical and health officer briefed the gathering on symptoms and causes of the disease, besides preventive and mitigation measures.

People in the district have been advised to take precautions against mosquitoes and report to the nearest health centre in case of fever or headache. The health officer also said spraying of insecticides in potentially sensitive areas had been taken up.

The veterinary officer has been directed to test pigs and check pigsties.

[There have been numerous JE cases in north eastern India again in 2015, along with some cases of encephalopathy and hypoglycemia associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine. Although lychee consumption is not mentioned as a possible cause of acute encephalitis syndrome, Meghalaya and Assam states are within the lychee-producing areas in northern India http://www.mapsofindia.com/indiaagriculture/fruits-map/litchi-producing-states.html.
