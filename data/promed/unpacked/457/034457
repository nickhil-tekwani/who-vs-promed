A Comment on the History of Mumps Vaccination in the UK
-------------------------------------------------------
The UK item from The Scotsman newspaper, "Mumps outbreak hits Cambridge
University" (see: Part [1] of the ProMED-mail post of 10 Nov 2004 entitled
"Mumps, students - UK & Ireland 20041110.3039") stated that: "Experts
believe that around 3000 students and young people -- born before the
infant MMR triple vaccine program began -- could be infected with the virus
by the end of the year [2004] if trends continue." These people being born
before the MMR programme began -- my own 2 eldest children included -- are
not the problem. The problem is that this cohort has had on average only a
single dose of mumps immunisation.
Following the start of the single-dose MMR programme (given at age about 13
months) in the UK in 1988, there was also a catchup programme targeted at
successively older groups of children. By 1993-4 the experience
of countries that had had a successful MMR programme for longer than the
UK showed that measles outbreaks were again occurring. This was due to the
slow accumulation of susceptibles, due in large part to the 5-10 percent of
immunoconversion failure rate for the measles component of the MMR.
In 1994 the UK added a 2nd dose of MMR to the scheduled pre-school booster
immunisations given at age 4, and at the same time carried out a catch-up
2nd dose programme for all children aged 5 to 15. For logistical reasons,
insufficient MMR was obtainable to maintain the primary programme AND
service the catch-up, so the 1994 catch-up consisted of a measles-rubella
(MR) vaccine.
The programme was a success. Uptake levels were high (I don't have the
exact figures), and the UK averted the measles recurrences seen elsewhere.
(The later MMR-autism bad science and media frenzy is another story.)
However, that 1994 group of 5-to-15 year-olds, having had only one dose of
mumps vaccine, must include a minority remaining susceptible. As they come
together in tertiary and further education institutions, there is the
opportunity for susceptibles to cluster and to meet a new virus.

[Dr. Reynolds comments are very much appreciated. As stated above, the
addition of the second dose of vaccine (MMR) served to capture those
individuals who did not seroconvert after receipt of the first dose of
vaccine.
Clinical vaccine efficacy in the US is estimated to be 95 percent (range 90
- 97 percent) following a single dose of the vaccine. (from the Mumps
chapter of the "Pink" book on vaccine preventible diseases
<http://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/pink/mumps.pdf>)
Reaney et. al. (ref. 1) reported on a mumps outbreak in Northern Ireland in
1999/2000 with 332 confirmed cases of which 184 (55.4 percent) had a
history of one dose of vaccine and 3 (0.9 percent) had a history of 2 doses
of vaccine. Information on the population at risk was not available to
attempt to calculate vaccine efficacy during this outbreak.
Pugh et. al. ( ref. 2) reported on a mumps outbreak among school aged
children in Walsall, UK in 2000. In this outbreak, 49 percent of cases
had a history of one dose of vaccine and 18.5 percent of cases had a
history of 2 doses of vaccine (overall 68 percent of cases had a history of
receiving mumps vaccine). The authors concluded that with the decrease in
vaccination coverages observed in the UK in recent years (to below 90
percent), future mumps outbreaks in schools and among older age groups can
be predicted since most older children and young adults have received only
one dose of MMR vaccine or no vaccination at all.
Nardone et al (ref. 3) reported the results of a serosurvey for prevalence
of mumps antibodies in Europe (Denmark, England and wales, France, Germany,
Italy and The Netherlands) as part of the European Sero-Epidemiology
network (ESEN). The authors concluded that a build-up of susceptibles in
older children and adolescents in England and Wales, France, the former
West Germany and Italy indicates the possibility of further mumps outbreaks
in secondary school environments
Amela, Pachon, and de Ory (ref. 4) reported on a serologic study done in
Spain showing a vaccine efficacy of 76.7 percent in children 2-5 years of
age felt to be associated with use of the Rubini vaccine strain. Lopez
Hernandez et. al. (ref. 5) in an earlier study of mumps vaccine efficacy
during an outbreak in Spain, showed a one dose vaccine efficacy of 46
percent (range 0-84 percent) and a 2 dose efficacy of 87 percent (range 27-99).
Schlegel et. al. (ref. 6) reported on a study comparing vaccine efficacy
of 3 different mumps vaccine strains in Switzerland during a mumps outbreak
where they observed a similar attack rate in unvaccinated children (63
percent) and children vaccinated with the Rubini strain (67 percent) but
significantly lower in those vaccinated with the Jeryl-Lynn (14 percent) or
the Urabe strain (8 percent). The comparative vaccine efficacies were minus
4 percent (range minus 218 to 15 percent) for the Rubini strain, 78
percent (range 64 to 82 percent) for the Jeryl-Lynn strain, and 87 percent
(76 to 94 percent).
It would be interesting to know if studies on vaccine efficacy have been
conducted in the UK, and what strains of mumps vaccine virus were used in
the cohort currently affected by the ongoing mumps activity in the UK.
