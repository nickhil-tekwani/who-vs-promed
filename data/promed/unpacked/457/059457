Close to 900 cases of chikungunya have already been counted in
Brazzaville, especially in the southern neighborhoods of the capital.
The 1st district of the capital, Makelekele, is the most affected.
Mfilou and Bacongo are also hit. For the moment, the authorities have
reported no deaths.

Nevertheless, people are worried; they compare the disease to a
"strong malaria" because of its symptoms -- high fever, muscle pain,
and headache.

Like malaria, chikungunya virus is transmitted to humans by a
mosquito, _Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus_, or the "tiger mosquito".

Chikungunya causes high fever, joint pain (wrists, fingers, ankles,
feet, knees), muscle pain, headache, rash, nausea, and fatigue.

According to the Pasteur Institute: "The disease evolves rapidly
towards a quick improvement, with disappearance of fever in 1-10 days,
skin rash in 2 to 3 days, joint and muscle pain in a few weeks. The
disease is not usually known to be responsible for direct deaths, but
an investigation is currently under way at La Reunion to determine
whether the virus is responsible directly or indirectly for several
dozen deaths that have occurred in a context of acute infection."

[The number of chikungunya virus infection cases remains essentially
the same as reported in a previous ProMED-mail post (see archive no. 20110616.183). However, this is the 1st report of the identity of the
vector mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_. The control of this mosquito will
be quite difficult, as it is not as closely dependent on human
habitations for its breeding habitats as the other common vector of
chikungunya virus, _Ae. aegypti_.
