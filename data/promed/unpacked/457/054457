Summary
-------
During the 2012-13 influenza season in the United States, influenza activity increased through November and December [2012] before peaking in late December [2012]. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated overall, but influenza B viruses and, to a lesser extent, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) viruses also were reported in the US. This influenza season was moderately severe, with a higher percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), higher rates of hospitalization, and more reported deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza than in recent years. This report summarizes influenza activity in the US during the 2012-13 influenza season (30 Sep 2012 to 18 May 2013) as of 7 Jun 2013, and reports the recommendations for the components of the 2013-14 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine.

Viral surveillance
------------------
From 30 Sep 2012 to 18 May 2013, World Health Organization and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System collaborating laboratories in the US tested 311 333 specimens for influenza viruses; 73 130 (23 per cent) were positive. Of the positive specimens, 51 675 (71 per cent) were influenza A viruses, and 21 455 (29 per cent) were influenza B viruses. Among the seasonal influenza A viruses, 34 922 (68 per cent) were subtyped; 33 423 (96 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 1497 (4 per cent) were pH1N1 viruses. In addition, 2 variant influenza A(H3N2v) viruses were identified.

Typically, the influenza season is said to begin when certain key indicators remain elevated for a number of consecutive weeks. One of these indicators is the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. The proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza during the 2012-13 season 1st exceeded 10 per cent during the week ending 10 Nov 2012 (week 45), and peaked at 38 per cent during the week ending 29 Dec 2012 (week 52).

Since the start of the 2012-13 season, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predominated nationally, followed by influenza B viruses; pH1N1 viruses have been identified less frequently. The relative proportion of each type and subtype varied by geographic US Department of Health and Human Services region and week. Influenza A viruses predominated until the end of February [2013], with influenza B viruses predominating from the week ending 23 Feb 2013 (week 8) through the week ending 18 May 2013 (week 20).

Regional differences were observed in the timing of influenza activity and the relative proportions of circulating viruses. Using the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza to determine the peak of influenza activity, Region 4 activity peaked earliest, during the week ending 8 Dec 2012 (week 49), and Region 9 activity peaked latest, during the week ending 26 Jan 2013 (week 4). The highest proportion of influenza B viruses was observed in Region 6 (42 per cent), and the lowest proportion of influenza B viruses was detected in Region 1 (15 per cent).

Novel influenza A viruses
-------------------------
During the 2012-13 influenza season, one case of human infection with a variant influenza A(H3N2) (H3N2v) virus was reported in each of 2 states, Minnesota and Iowa. Both infections occurred in children, one with known exposure to swine. Both patients recovered fully.

Antigenic characterization
--------------------------
CDC has antigenically characterized 2452 influenza viruses collected since 1 Oct 2012, and submitted by US laboratories, including 252 pH1N1 viruses, 1324 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 876 influenza B viruses. Of the 252 pH1N1 viruses tested, 249 (98.8 per cent) were characterized as A/California/7/2009-like, the influenza A(H1N1) component of the 2012-13 influenza vaccine. Of the 252 tested, 3 viruses (1.2 per cent) showed reduced titers with ferret antiserum raised against A/California/7/2009. Of the 1324 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 1319 (99.6 per cent) were antigenically similar to the cell-propagated A/Victoria/361/2011 reference virus; most viruses tested were cell-propagated. The H3N2 vaccine component for the 2012-13 northern hemisphere season was egg-propagated A/Victoria/361/2011; the use of egg-propagated vaccine viruses is a current regulatory requirement for vaccine production. Of the 1324 tested, 5 (0.4 per cent) showed reduced titers with antiserum produced against cell-propagated A/Victoria/361/2011.

Of the 876 influenza B viruses tested, 581 (66.3 per cent) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, and were characterized as B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like, the influenza B component for the 2012-13 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. A total of 295 (33.7 per cent) viruses tested belonged to the B/Victoria lineage.

Resistance to antiviral medications
-----------------------------------
Since 1 Oct 2012, a total of 3626 influenza virus specimens have been tested for antiviral resistance. All 961 influenza B viruses tested were sensitive to both oseltamivir and zanamivir. Among 2123 influenza A(H3N2) viruses tested, one (0.05 per cent) was found to be resistant to oseltamivir alone and one (0.05 per cent) to both oseltamavir and zanamivir. Among the 542 pH1N1 viruses tested for resistance to oseltamivir, 2 (0.4 per cent) were resistant, and all of the 258 viruses tested for resistance to zanamivir were sensitive. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A viruses currently circulating globally (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses).

Composition of the 2013-14 influenza vaccine
--------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee has recommended that the 2013-14 influenza trivalent vaccines used in the US contain an A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A(H3N2) virus antigenically like the cell-propagated A/Victoria/361/2011 virus (A/Texas/50/2012), and a B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. A/Texas/50/2012 is an egg-propagated A(H3N2) virus antigenically similar to cell-propagated A/Victoria/361/2011. The committee recommended that A/Texas/50/2012 be used as the H3N2 vaccine component because of antigenic changes in A/Victoria/361/2011 vaccine virus resulting from mutations acquired during growth in eggs. The committee also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines contain a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus (1). These recommendations were based on global influenza virus surveillance data related to epidemiology, antigenic and genetic characteristics, and serological responses to 2012-13 seasonal vaccines, and the availability of candidate strains and reagents.

Outpatient illness surveillance
-------------------------------
Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI to health care providers participating in the US Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) exceeded the national baseline level of 2.2 per cent for 15 weeks during the 2012-13 influenza season. The peak percentage of outpatient visits for ILI was 6.1 per cent, and occurred in the week ending 29 Dec 2012 (week 52). In contrast, the peak percentage of outpatient visits for ILI during the previous influenza season (2011-12) was 2.4 per cent and occurred in mid-March [2012]. During the 2007-08 and 2010-11 influenza seasons, both of which had influenza A(H3N2) virus as the predominant circulating virus, the peak percentages of outpatient visits for ILI were 6.0 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively; both peaks occurred in mid-February [2008 and 2011, respectively]. During the 2012-13 season, on a regional level, the percentage of visits for ILI exceeded region-specific baselines in all 10 regions. ILINet data are used to produce a weekly state-level measure of ILI activity varying from minimal to high: the number of states experiencing high ILI activity peaked during the week ending 29 Dec 2012 (week 52) with 35 states.

State-specific activity levels
------------------------------
State and territorial epidemiologists report the geographic distribution of influenza in their states through a weekly influenza activity code. The geographic distribution of influenza activity was most extensive during the week ending 12 Jan 2013 (week 2), when 48 states reported widespread influenza activity and 2 states reported regional influenza activity. The week ending 18 May 2013 (week 20) was the 1st week no state or territory reported regional or widespread influenza activity. The number of states reporting widespread or regional activity during the peak week of activity has ranged from 20 to 50 states during the previous 4 influenza seasons (Influenza Division, CDC, unpublished data, 2013).

Influenza-associated hospitalization
------------------------------------
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections using the FluSurv-NET surveillance system. Cumulative hospitalization rates (per 100 000 population) were calculated by age group based on 12 337 total hospitalizations resulting from influenza from 1 Oct 2012 to 30 Apr 2013. Among 12 293 cases with influenza type specified, 9767 (79.2 per cent) were associated with influenza A and 2492 (20.2 per cent) with influenza B; and 34 (0.3 per cent) were associated with influenza A and influenza B co-infections; 44 (0.4 per cent) had no virus type information available. Persons aged 65 years and up accounted for approximately 50 per cent of reported cases. The cumulative incidence for all age groups since 1 Oct 2012 was 44.3 per 100 000. The cumulative hospitalization rate (per 100 000 population) by age group for this period was 66.2 (0-4 years), 14.5 (5-17 years), 16.4 (18-49 years), 41.2 (50-64 years), and 191.2 (65 years and up). During the past 4 influenza seasons, age-specific hospitalization rates ranged from 15.8 to 72.8 (0-4 years), 4.0 to 27.3 (5-17 years), 3.6 to 23.1 (18-49 years), 5.1 to 30.8 (50-64 years), and 13.5 to 65.9 (65 years and up).

As of 1 Jun 2013, among the FluSurv-NET adult patients for whom medical chart data were available, the most frequent underlying conditions were chronic lung disease (27 per cent), cardiovascular disease (45 per cent), and metabolic disorders (39 per cent). Among children hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza and for whom medical chart data were available, 46 per cent did not have any recorded underlying conditions, and 22 per cent had underlying asthma or reactive airway disease. Among the 819 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-44 years), 233 (28 per cent) were pregnant.

Pneumonia- and influenza-related mortality
------------------------------------------
During the 2012-13 influenza season, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) exceeded the epidemic threshold for 13 consecutive weeks spanning 30 Dec 2012 to 30 Mar 2013 (weeks 1-13). The percentage of deaths attributed to P&I peaked at 9.9 per cent during the week ending 19 Jan 2013 (week 3) (figure 4). From the 2008-09 season through the 2011-12 season, the peak percentage of P&I deaths ranged from 7.9 to 9.1 per cent, and the total number of consecutive weeks at or above the epidemic threshold ranged from 1 to 13 (Influenza Division, CDC, unpublished data, 2013).

Influenza-related pediatric mortality
-------------------------------------
For the 2012-13 influenza season, 149 laboratory-confirmed, influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported. These deaths were reported from 38 states. The states with the greatest numbers of deaths were Texas (18), New York (14), and Florida (8). The deaths included 11 children under 6 months old, 20 aged 6-23 months, 20 aged 2-4 years, 52 aged 5-11 years, and 46 aged 12-17 years; mean and median ages were 8.2 years and 8.1 years, respectively. Among the 149 deaths, 79 were associated with influenza B viruses, 32 with influenza A(H3) viruses, 4 with pH1N1 viruses, 31 with an influenza A virus for which the subtype was not determined, one with an influenza virus for which the type was not determined, and 2 with both an influenza B and influenza A virus.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The 2012-13 influenza season peaked early and was a moderately severe season, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Activity peaked in late December [2012], and influenza A(H3N2) viruses were most commonly reported through the week ending 16 Feb 2013 (week 7). From the week ending 23 Feb 2013 (week 8) through the end of the season, influenza B viruses were more commonly reported. The majority of all influenza viruses in specimens sent to CDC for further antigenic characterization were similar to the components of the 2012-13 northern hemisphere vaccine.

The peak percentage of outpatient visits for ILI (6.1 per cent) was one of the highest reported since the system began in its current format in 1997. For comparison, the peak percentage of visits for ILI during those 15 seasons ranged from 2.4 per cent for the 2011-12 season to 7.7 per cent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The number and rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations among adults aged 65 years and up during the 2012-13 influenza season are the highest since systematic data collection on laboratory-confirmed, influenza-associated hospitalization in adults began in the 2005-06 season. Hospitalization rates for those aged 65 years and up were 191 per 100 000 population, 2.5 times the highest rate previously reported for this age group. With the exception of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported to CDC for the 2012-13 season was the highest reported since data collection began in 2004. Reported P&I mortality exceeded the epidemic threshold for 13 consecutive weeks. Based on the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza, the peak of influenza activity for the 2012-13 season, occurring during the week ending 29 Dec 2012 (week 52), was similar to the 2003-04 season, which peaked during the week ending 30 Nov 2003 (week 48), and was the earliest since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when activity peaked during the week ending 24 Oct 2009 (week 42).

Testing for seasonal influenza viruses and monitoring for novel influenza A virus infections should continue year-round, as should specimen submission to CDC for further antigenic and genetic analysis and antiviral resistance monitoring. A total of 308 infections with variant influenza viruses (304 H3N2v viruses, 3 H1N2v viruses, and one H1N1v virus) were reported from 10 states during the summer and fall of 2012, before the start of the 2012-13 influenza season, and 2 cases of H3N2v were detected during the 2012-13 season. The H3N2v virus circulated in pigs in 2010 and was 1st detected in humans in 2011, when 12 cases were identified. Most of these infections occurred in children with prolonged exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. Limited human-to-human spread of this virus was detected, but no sustained community spread of H3N2v was identified. However, this increase in H3N2v cases in 2012, and the recent emergence of the novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China, further emphasizes the importance of continuing to monitor for novel influenza A viruses.

Since 2010, CDC has recommended annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged 6 months and up, preferably in the fall before the US influenza season begins. However, during other times of the year, persons who have not received the vaccine for the current season should be vaccinated before traveling to parts of the world where influenza activity is ongoing. This is particularly important for persons at high risk for influenza-related complications. This recommendation also applies to persons traveling within the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere or as part of large tourist groups (for example, on cruise ships) that might include persons from other parts of the world where influenza activity is ongoing. Persons should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before travel for immunity to develop. Travelers also should be aware that all northern hemisphere influenza vaccine manufactured for the 2012-13 season expires by 30 June 2013, after which influenza vaccines will not be available in the US until the 2013-14 vaccine is available in the fall.

[Interested readers should access the original document at the source URL above to view the associated figures and tables. In summary: during the 2012-13 influenza season, influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B viruses cocirculated. In addition, 2 cases of infection with variant influenza A viruses were reported in the United States. Compared with recent influenza seasons, this season had a higher percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness, higher rates of hospitalizations, and more deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza.

It is recommended that all unvaccinated persons aged 6 months or older should be offered influenza vaccine throughout the influenza season. In addition, timely empiric antiviral treatment is recommended for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza illness; those at higher risk for influenza complications; or those for whom treatment can be started within 48 hours of illness onset. In addition, influenza surveillance, including for novel influenza viruses, should continue through the summer months, and physicians should consider influenza as a cause of respiratory illness outside of the typical season. - Mod.CP
