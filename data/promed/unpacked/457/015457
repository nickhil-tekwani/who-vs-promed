According to the Bulgarian Agency for Food Safety, a flock of 85 sheep has been killed and buried in the village of Choba due to an outbreak of sheep and goat pox.

Clinical examination and blood sampling were carried out by a veterinary team from the regional office of the Veterinary Services in Plovdiv; the diagnosis has been laboratory confirmed.

For the location of Choba in the region (oblast) Plovdiv, see map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BU/51/Choba.html.

If confirmed, this will mean a spread of sheep/goat pox northwards from previous outbreaks which have been diagnosed on the Turkish (September 2013; see 20130924.1964207) and Greek (October 2013; see at http://tinyurl.com/pb3l8rl) borders. Official confirmation (or otherwise) of the new outbreak will be appreciated.

Notably, the English edition of the Bulgarian Focus News Agency published on Fri 13 Dec 2013 included the following report:

"Livestock markets in the district of Plovdiv (central-south Bulgaria) were closed over the spread of foot and mouth disease in the region of the village of Choba. Dr Ivan Shikov, director of the District Directorate for Food Safety, announced the news for Radio FOCUS, Plovdiv. "The markets are closed for all kind of animals, since every animal can spread the diseases, no matter whether it is infected or not," Shikov remarked. "There are 2 legally registered animal markets in the district of Plovdiv, in Rakovski and Asenovgrad" (see at http://www.focus-fen.net/?id=n321106; thanks to submitter Sabine Zentis).

Similar information pertaining to FMD in Bulgaria has not been forthcoming from other sources. The contradiction between the reports -- sheep/goat pox or FMD -- remains to be definitely clarified. - Mod.AS
