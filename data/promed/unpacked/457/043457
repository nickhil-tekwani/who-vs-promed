The Ministry for Primary Industries has confirmed 2 more farms have tested positive for the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis, _bringing the total number of infected properties to 20.

One of the farms is in the Waimate district in South Canterbury, where the disease was first found in July last year [2017] on a Van Leeuwen Dairy Group property, while the other is in Southland.

A Ministry for Primary Industries spokesperson said 11 of the infected properties were in South Canterbury, 2 were in Mid Canterbury, 6 in Southland, [South Island] and 1 in Hawke's Bay [North Island].

_M. bovis_ can cause lameness, mastitis, and abortions in cows, and is spread through nose to nose contact.

South Island cattle breeders had to withdraw their entries from this week's New Zealand Dairy Event [31 Jan-2 Feb 2018] in Fielding last week because of fears it could spread the disease.

[This is a very difficult situation for New Zealand. They were expecting some premises to test positive, as they are testing in order to determine if they manage the disease or eradicate it. It may be too early to tell, but I am sure no one is happy about these positive tests. - Mod.TG
