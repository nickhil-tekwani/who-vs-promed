[The visualization of Regional FMD Virus Pools, as an aid to the disease's global control, divides the globe into 7 pools, recognized as such by the FAO, OIE and EUFMD. Each pool may include multiple serotypes, but topotypes are mainly confined to that pool; each pool may need tailored vaccines and strategies. The situation in each of the 7 established pools is reviewed on a monthly basis.

EUFMD's most recent available Global Monthly FMD Situation Report, covering December 2019 (see ref 1), included in its Highlights section, authored by Don King (head, Vesicular Disease Reference Laboratory Group & WRLFMD), the following statement: "Continued outbreaks of O/EA-3 (2018/19) in North Africa (Libya and Morocco) following on from cases due to A/AFRICA/G-IV during 2017. There are now 2 distinct viral lineages responsible for the cases detected in North West Africa (Maghreb) and North East Africa (Egypt)."

Libya belongs to the FAO's Pool 3 - North Africa, which includes 5 countries: Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.

According to the data included in Table 16 of the December 2019 Global Report, titled Conjectured circulating FMD viral lineages in each country of Pool 3 - North Africa (current to December 2019), Libya's last FMD outbreak was reported in June 2019, caused by FMDV O/EA-3. FMDV serotype A has been reported, within the pool, in recent years in Algeria (November 2016), Egypt (February 2018), and Tunisia (April 2017). The presumed viral lineage was, in all 3 countries, A/Africa (ref 1).

Genotyping results are anticipated with interest. In the past, introduction of livestock from Sudan was suspected as the source of infection.

Additional information on FMD in Libya is available in ref 2.
