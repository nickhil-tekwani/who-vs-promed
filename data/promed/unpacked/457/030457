Coffee fungus, more aggressive variety threatens farmers
--------------------------------------------------------
A mutant strain of one of the world's most devastating coffee diseases is attacking crops in Guatemala, putting farmers on high alert for a wider outbreak across Central America. Growers are battling a new form of leaf rust fungus. Leaf rust usually infects coffee grown at lower altitudes where it is hotter and wetter, but a new type is creeping up to higher, cooler areas [where] arabica coffee [is] grown.

"We haven't seen leaf rust at this intensity ever before in Guatemala,‚Äù said Ricardo Villanueva, coffee growers' association Anacafe. Nearly 40 percent of Guatemala's roughly 274 000 hectares [677 thousand acres] of coffee has been affected by the disease. Smaller farmers who cannot afford expensive fungicides have been hardest hit.

The more common type of leaf rust has existed in Guatemala for decades, but serious outbreaks have been rare. "We are seeing a mutation to a more aggressive variety of the fungus," said Tomas Nottebohm, coffee exporter Transcafe, who said the new strain may be resistant to standard fungicides.

Nicaraguan farmers do not know whether the mutant form has arrived, they are worried about what is happening in Guatemala. A leaf rust attack in Colombia in 2010 [ProMED-mail post 20100526.1745] infested one-third of that nation's crop, prompting growers to cut trees and replant with resistant varieties. The region's coffee associations will meet in El Salvador to discuss a 10-year program to research new types of coffee more resistant to leaf rust.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata but rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

The emergence of a new fungal strain adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, can be expected to make CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. A new more aggressive strain is also suspected to be emerging in Colombia (ProMED-mail posts 20100526.1745, 20091008.3490, and 20090225.0773).
