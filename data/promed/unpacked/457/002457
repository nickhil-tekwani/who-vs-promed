Sevastopol's State Emergency Anti-Epidemic Commission has decided to
declare the Sevastopol area a potentially dangerous zone because of
detection of bird flu in wild birds found in the area, said a spokeswoman
for Sevastopol's City State Administration, Alla Shcherbakova.
She said the decision was made after 5 dead birds were found in the city: 3
crows and a gull in one of the city's kindergartens and a jay in
Kamyshovaya Bay. Laboratory tests have proven that all the birds died of
bird flu.
Nevertheless, Ms. Shcherbakova said that no bird flu cases were registered
in the area among poultry. It is recommended that local inhabitants who own
poultry keep it indoors to prevent contact with wild birds.

[Sebastopol is on the southwestern tip of the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea, while the infected area is in the northern and northeastern parts
of this peninsula. This is an additional circumstantial indication of the
role wild birds might play in the spread of H5N1. Direct evidence is still
pending. A question which remains unanswered is which avian species
(singular/plural) is/are the (efficient) transmitter(s) of this particular
virus strain in terms of distance and time.
Ukraine's last follow-up report, No. 6, was sent to the OIE on 19 Jan 2006.
It includes data on the recent confirmed and suspected outbreaks as well as
updates on the laboratory results of previous outbreaks. Among the avians
found positive, there were one jay, one rook (_Corvus frugilegus_?), one
wild duck and 2 pigeons (no Latin species names included). See
