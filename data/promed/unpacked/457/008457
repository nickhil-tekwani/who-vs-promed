The disease is spreading quite slowly. The latest statistics made
public by the Ministry of Health revealed that 206 people have been
infected with chikungunya. The authorities are continuing their
prevention campaign by reminding people how to reduce risks (avoid
the creation of places where mosquitoes would proliferate, i.e.,
accumulations of water, flower vases, etc.). The ministry has also
received 15 fogging machines as well as 70 insecticide sprayers to
help eliminate mosquitoes.
A South African expert, Mark Edwardes, has been in Mauritius to train
people to use the machines and products. The private company Roger
Fayd'herbe has also put several litres of insecticide at the
ministry's disposal after it rented its fogging machines last week.
A special programme to eliminate mosquitoes in schools has been
launched. The ministry has also asked the World Health Organisation
to send an expert to Mauritius to help local authorities in their
endeavour to reduce risks.
Internal sources at the ministry of Health explain that official
statistics are difficult to obtain. In the same family, 4 people may
be having the same symptoms but only one will be listed as infected.
Likewise, people treated by private doctors may not be added to the
official list of infected people. Although it is mandatory, all
private doctors do not make it a duty to communicate the number of
their patients suffering from chikungunya to the ministry.

[Even with this outbreak, Mauritius is in sharp contrast to Reunion
Island, which has been suffering from a severe outbreak of the
mosquito-borne viral disease since the beginning of 2005.
Mauritius attained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1968
and became a republic within the Commonwealth in 1992. Together with
Reunion and Rodrigues, Mauritius is part of the Mascarene Islands.
The island nation is situated in the southwest Indian Ocean, about
900 km east of Madagascar and with Reunion 200 km to the southwest.
Mauritius has a population (figure from 2005) of 1 230 602. See
