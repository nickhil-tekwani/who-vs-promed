[This series of OIE reports covers [1] Varzelandia, Minas Gerais, 22 May 2012; [2] Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, 29 Jun 2012; [3] Varzelandia, Minas Gerais; Teresopolis, Rio de Janeiro; and Araguari, Minas Gerais, 13 Jul 2012; [4] Palmas de Monte Alto, Bahia, 31 Jul 2012; and now this latest report from 18 Apr 2013 for Engenheiro Caldas, Minas Gerais and Aracariguama, Sao Paulo.

ProMED-mail reports have been for Ceara, December 2012; Distrito Federal, May 2010; Parana, August 2004; and Alagoas in May and June 2000.

To quote my moderator colleague TG: "Glanders is a contagious and fatal bacterial disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, and is caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The disease causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy." While glanders primarily affects horses, mules, and donkeys, it can also occur in dogs, cats, goats, and camels. The disease can be fatal in mules and donkeys. The disease can also be severe for hamsters and guinea pigs.

"Horses get glanders by close contact with other infected horses, especially through shared water and feed troughs as well as by nuzzling (direct contact). The bacteria can also be spread by fomites (non-living objects contaminated by infected animals), such as brushes, halters, or harnesses.

"Carnivores, especially cats, can get glanders after eating contaminated meat.

"The commonest sign of infection in animals is yellow-green nasal discharge and ulcers on the nose. The horse may have enlarged lymph nodes and nodules on the skin. In some cases, they may look like long, hard ropes, under the skin. Severe coughing can also occur. Long term infections can occur in horses, which may last for several years.

"Disease in mules and donkeys can start rapidly (acute) and can lead to death in 1-2 weeks after exposure.

"People can get glanders by having direct contact with infected animals or contaminated objects. Entry of the bacteria occurs through the skin (wounds, cuts) or through surface of the eyes and nose. People in close contact with horses (veterinarians, farriers, other animal workers, as well as laboratory personnel) are at greater risk for getting glanders." [People should remember that _Burkholderia mallei_ was developed as a BW agent by the Germans in WWI and in the following decades. It is a pathogen that should not be regarded lightly. - Mod.MHJ]

"In people, the disease can affect the skin, lungs, or the entire body (systemic). Signs may include fever, chills, muscle aches, and chest pain; pneumonia can rapidly develop. Nodules or ulcers may occur in the skin or the nose, eyes, or mouth. Glanders is a very painful disease and can lead to death without treatment.

"Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of positive reactors. Because it is transmitted to humans by direct contact with sick animals or infected materials, carefully washing hands following handling of animals is important. The wearing of gloves should be encouraged.

"All infected or potentially infected material must be handled in a laboratory that meets the requirements for Containment Group 3 pathogens. In the untreated acute disease in man, there can be 95 per cent mortality within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies.

"For further details on the disease and its diagnosis, see chapter 2.5.11. in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf."
