_Plasmodium knowlesi_ found in several samples from Indonesia
-------------------------------------
This report describes the 1st recognized cases of
_P. knowlesi_ malaria in Kalimantan, Indonesia.

22 samples from Kalimantan, Indonesia were
brought to our laboratory in Munich, Germany.
Blood samples were from patients with severe and
uncomplicated malaria, and all samples were
clinically and morphologically diagnosed by
microscopy as _P. falciparum_ or mixed infection
with _P. vivax_. For the molecular determination
of the species, a nested PCR (polymerase chain
reaction), amplifying the small subunit ribosomal
RNA gene, was performed for all 4 human pathogen
species. Because of the origin of the samples and
the latest news about _P. knowlesi_, we used also
the _P. knowlesi_ specific primers reported by
Singh and colleagues for the amplification (Singh
B et al. Lancet 2004; 363:1017-24.) Four out of
22 samples were positive for _P. knowlesi_. All
were mixed infections with _P. vivax_ and 3 only
with _P. falciparum_. The 4th sample, positive
only for vivax and knowlesi, showed a very weak
band for _P. vivax_ and a strong band for _P.
knowlesi_. Sequencing of the ssU rRNA gene
confirmed the PCR results. Using BLAST and direct
alignment programs (alignment with sequences from
the ssU rRNA gene published in the nucleotide
database of the NCBI), one of our sequences
resembles the Nuri S-type strain
(gi|86155927|gb|DQ350263.1|[86155927]) from
Malaysia; the others differ slightly but match
best with _P. knowlesi_ strains.

These 4 patients had uncomplicated courses of
malaria and were treated with
artemether-lumefantrine. Further sequencing of
other parts of the ssU rRNA gene and the csp gene
is underway and will be described in detail
elsewhere.

It is not surprising to find _P. knowlesi_ in
Kalimantan, Borneo, as it has been described from
the Malaysian part of Borneo, but there are no
cases described from Indonesia for now. Regarding
the distribution of the natural host (_Macaca_
species) and the cases in Southeast Asia, it is
very likely that _P. knowlesi_ will be found in
other parts and islands of Indonesia too.

Recent studies from Asia report simian malaria in
humans as mono-infection or mixed infection with
one or more of the 4 species of the genus
_Plasmodium_ (_P. falciparum_, _P. vivax_, _P.
ovale_, and _P. malariae_) known to cause malaria
in humans. Although more than 20 species of the
genus _Plasmodium_ can infect nonhuman primates,
until recently, naturally acquired human
infections of simian malaria were viewed as rare
events. Nevertheless, _Plasmodium knowlesi_
infections in humans seem to be more common as
expected in Asia.

The 1st reported case of naturally acquired
simian malaria was an employee of the US Army in
1965 who had returned home from an assignment in
Southeast Asia.

In 2002, Singh and colleagues in Malaysia noted
an increasing number of _P. malariae_ cases with
atypical features, including increased clinical
severity and higher parasitemia. The parasites
are morphologically indistinguishable from
_Plasmodium malariae_ by microscopy. Molecular
techniques, such as PCR and sequencing are needed
for differentiation. By establishing a nested PCR
assay, more than 50 percent of these malaria
cases were determined to be _P. knowlesi_,
misdiagnosed as _P. malariae_. In their
retrospective evaluation during 2001-2006, 28
percent of 960 specimens from patients in
Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo were found to be _P.
knowlesi_. The group also reported 4 unusual
fatalities attributed to severe malaria caused by
_P. malariae_ that were later confirmed as _P.
knowlesi_ by PCR. Additional cases of naturally
occurring _P. knowlesi_ infection in humans have
been reported from Singapore, Thailand, the
Philippines, Yunnan Province in China, and from
tourists (Finland, USA, Sweden) having travelled
in the countries mentioned above.

[ProMED thanks Dr Nicole Berens-Riha for this
report. We believe that this is the 1st report of
_P. knowlesi_ from Indonesia, but as she points
out, it was expected to find human cases of _P.
knowlesi_ in Indonesian Borneo after they had
been described in Malaysian Borneo. - Mod.EP]
