NC Links _E. coli_ Outbreak to State Fair
-------------------------------------------
Health investigators are looking into whether 5 of at least 24 people
stricken in an _E. coli_ O157 outbreak were infected at the state fair in
Oct 2004 after finding they were all infected by the same strain.
A 6th victim who also attended the fair in Raleigh, NC was found to have a
different strain of the bacterium, but health officials said Thu, 4 Nov
2004, that they think the case is related.
At least 4 cases of the _E. coli_ infection occurred coincidentally to the
fair outbreak, investigators said. They were 2 people in Mecklenburg County
who got sick before the fair opened and a parent and child who live on a
farm. "It's beginning to tighten it up," said Dr. Jeffrey Engel, state
epidemiologist. "Every day we get more information. If we can get more DNA
types that match the 5 and they all had fair contact, we almost have a
closed case. But we have to wait for results. It just helps us so much in
tightening down what the exposure was that got these people ill."
By Thu, 4 Nov 2004, state health officials were investigating 38 cases of
_E. coli_ infections. Engel said 75 percent of cases involved children. 3
youngsters, including a 13-year-old girl from Moore County and a 2-year-old
boy from Wilson, had developed a serious complication known as
hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which can cause kidney failure.
The number of new cases being reported to state officials has begun to
taper off, Engel said, and secondary outbreaks involving human-to-human
transmission have not appeared. An additional questionnaire will be
written this weekend and distributed to families Mon, 8 Nov 2004, Engel
said, as health officials determine whether either of 2 petting zoos at the
fair was involved.

_E. coli_ cases keep increasing
-----------------------------
The number of _E. coli_ cases under investigation continued to climb Wed, 3
Nov 2004, as state health officials awaited genetic tests on some of the
bacteria to see whether the cases are related. 33 _E. coli_ infections are
being studied; 24 cases have been confirmed by the state laboratory.
Determining whether the infecting bacteria are the same genetic strain will
solve a key mystery of the outbreak and help investigators determine which
of the cases are related so they can begin tracing the source.
The most common link among the people who are sick is a trip to the State
Fair last month, in particular, to a petting zoo exhibit. Of the 33 cases
under scrutiny, 15 have State Fair connections, 1 attended the Cleveland
County fair, 7 did not attend the fair, and the remainder have not
completed the investigator's questionnaire.
"If [the source] does turn out to be a petting zoo, there are thousands of
people who were exposed, and they are widespread," said Dr. Jeffrey Engel,
state epidemiologist. "People came to visit from other states."
Engel said he has alerted his counterparts in other states through an
electronic posting and is working with officials from the CDC. 4 CDC
investigators have joined dozens of state and county health officials
working to track the outbreak and prevent further spreading.
Quarantining the animals in the suspected petting zoos, however, has not
been done. 1 of the petting zoos headed to a fair in South Carolina; the
other is a North Carolina farm and only does a few fairs a year.
"For the petting zoo industry, this is a risk wherever they are," Engel
said, "The measure is not to quarantine the animals, the measure is to
provide information and prevention strategies."
