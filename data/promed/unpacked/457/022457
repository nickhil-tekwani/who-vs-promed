Myrtle rust, a disease threatening native trees and fruit crops in Northland [north island region] has spread, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) says. The fungus was found in Kerikeri [and] tests have confirmed infection at a second site on the same street as the originally-infected nursery.

A second nursery in the town had been under suspicion, but lab tests proved negative. MPI was arranging re-testing of further samples to rule out a false negative result. Geoff Gwyn, MPI, said there would be conditions placed to prevent spread from the new site and affected plants would be treated. Further testing was being done.

Action to prepare for myrtle rust arriving in New Zealand had been ongoing since 2010 [when the rust appeared in Australia - Mod.DHA], Mr Gwyn said. At this stage MPI was assuming that the outbreak came from the Eastern Coast of Australia. NIWA [National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research] would study wind plumes to help identify its point of origin and more research was being done to identify the particular strain of myrtle rust found in Kerikeri.

[Myrtle or guava rust (_Puccinia psidii_) is thought to have originated in the central and southern Americas. It affects a large number of Myrtaceae, including fruit crops like guava (_Psidium guajava_) and feijoa (pineapple guava; _Acca sellowiana_) which originate in the same region. Additional species have been assigned to a 'eucalyptus/guava rust complex' the taxonomy of which appears to need clarification.

Generally, rust spores are spread by wind over long distances, by splashing rain and mechanical means locally. Infected plant material poses a high risk of spreading the pathogens. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

Since its 1st detection in Australia in 2010, the rust poses a threat to native ecosystems, as well as to commercial crops for the production of guava, feijoa and pharmaceutical oils. Eradication attempts have been unsuccessful. In New Zealand, it is also a threat to _Leptospermum scoparium_ ("Manuka"), a native species used widely for commercial honey production.

The recent 1st detection of the fungus in NZ on Kermadec Islands, ca. 1000 km north of the mainland [ProMED-mail post 20170407.4954049] is not likely to indicate the source of this outbreak on the mainland, considering wind directions and the appearance of the disease in both locations in such short succession. Rather, multiple incursions must be suspected.
