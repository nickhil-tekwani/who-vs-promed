As they both battle the highly transmissible delta (B1617.2) variant, COVID-19 cases in Australia and New Zealand reached new daily highs.

In Australia, cases in New South Wales state, home to the nation's hot spot of Sydney, reported 1029 cases today [26 Aug 2021], topping 1000 for the 1st time, according to Reuters. Two hospitals in the city's western suburbs have set up tents to screen patients (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sydney-hospitals-erect-emergency-tents-amid-delta-surge-2021-08-25/).

Victoria state, home to Melbourne, reported a sharp rise in cases, with 80 new infections, including 67 linked to known outbreaks, Australia's ABC News reported (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-26/victoria-records-new-covid-cases-delayed-testing-concern/100408434).

More than half of the country is on lockdown, which mainly affects its major cities. Federal officials are crafting plans to loosen restrictions once vaccination levels approach and exceed 70%. Currently, about 32% of those over age 16 are fully vaccinated.

Meanwhile, neighboring New Zealand reported 68 new cases today [26 Aug 2021], also a record daily high, according to the New Zealand Herald. Most cases continue to be reported from Auckland, though some have been detected in Wellington (https://bit.ly/3yiBOgB). Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the cases are likely to remain high, but the country's COVID-19 measures are working, with cases limited to the 2 cities.

More global headlines
---------------------
- In Viet Nam, a surge of cases in the manufacturing hub of Binh Duong province -- expected to worsen over the next 2 weeks -- prompted the government to deploy troops to help with outbreak response, according to Reuters. Binh Duong is near Ho Chi Minh City, the country's worst hot spot, and it is home to several factories that make products for international companies (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-warns-industrial-hub-binh-duong-see-50000-new-covid-19-cases-2021-08-26/).

- PAHO said during a briefing yesterday [25 Aug 2021] that it launched a new collaboration to work on ways to produce COVID-19 vaccine in Latin America and the Caribbean regions, part of an effort to ease the shortage and more equitably distribute supplies. Leaders from financial organizations, governments, and public health groups will meet for the 1st time tomorrow [27 Aug 2021] to discuss technology transfer issues and how to maximize current production of mRNA vaccines. Similar efforts are underway to boost vaccine production in the African region.

- About 40 000 people recently evacuated from Afghanistan are being temporarily housed at a US Army base in Qatar, and today [26 Aug 2021] Qatar's foreign ministry said all evacuees not immediately transported to other countries will be provided polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19. In a statement, the ministry said that they will also be given the COVID-19 vaccine if they request it (https://www.mofa.gov.qa/en/statements/qatar-evacuates-more-than-40-000-people-safely-out-of-kabul).

- In China, more than 2 dozen cities have warned citizens who refuse vaccination that they will be held accountable if they are linked to outbreaks or come into contact with infected people, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/26/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/#link-SEA57MUXNBDP3IC3I7FNNWQHIY).

- The global total today [26 Aug 2021] topped 214 million, rising to 214 071 676, with at least 4 464 081 deaths, according to the New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html).

[2] Pfizer vaccine: safety
Date: Thu 26 Aug 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/large-real-world-study-pfizers-covid-vaccine-safe


The largest real-world study of a COVID-19 vaccine to date shows that Pfizer/BioNTech's shot is safe and linked to substantially fewer adverse events than SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated patients.

A team led by researchers from the Clalit Research Institute in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Harvard University matched vaccinated Israelis 16 years and older (median age, 38) with similar but unvaccinated people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from 20 Dec 2020 to 24 May 2021. They then derived risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences 42 days after vaccination (short- to medium-term) using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.

The analysis of the Pfizer vaccine, which the US Food and Drug Administration fully approved earlier this week [23 Aug 2021], involved 1.7 million vaccinated and 233 000 unvaccinated people.

The vaccine was determined to be safe, with only 4 of the 25 potential side effects that the group examined strongly associated with the vaccine. While the vaccine was associated with a 3.24 RR (or more than triple the risk) for myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, it was still rare. In contrast, the RR for the condition in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients was 18.28.

"These results show convincingly that this mRNA vaccine is very safe and that the alternative of 'natural' morbidity caused by the coronavirus puts a person at significant, higher and much more common risk of serious adverse events," senior study author Ran Balicer, MD, PhD, said in a Clalit Research Institute news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/926358).

"These data should facilitate informed individual risk-benefit decision-making, and, in our view, make a strong argument in favor of opting-in to get vaccinated, especially in countries where the virus is currently widespread," he added.

The strongest tie between the vaccine and an adverse event was myocarditis, with an excess risk of 1-5 events per 100 000 people, an RR of 3.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44), and a risk difference of 2.7 events per 100 000 (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6). Myocarditis after vaccination was seen mostly in men aged 20-34.

In contrast, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection among unvaccinated patients was associated with a significantly elevated risk of myocarditis (RR, 18.28 [95% CI, 3.95 to 25.12]; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100 000 persons [95% CI, 5.6 to 15.8]).

Other vaccine-linked adverse events included swollen lymph nodes (RR, 2.43 [95% CI, 2.05 to 2.78]; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100 000 persons [95% CI, 64.1 to 89.3]), appendicitis (RR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.02 to 2.01]; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100 000 persons [95% CI, 0.3 to 9.9]), and herpes zoster infection, or shingles (RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.20 to 1.73]; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100 000 persons [95% CI, 8.2 to 24.2]). The increased risk of Bell's palsy (facial-nerve palsy) was small (RR, 1.32).

Previous SARS-CoV-2 infections were also associated with multiple serious adverse events in addition to myocarditis, including pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart), heart rhythm abnormalities, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot), pulmonary embolism (blood clot that travels to a lung artery), heart attack, intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding inside the skull), and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count).

The authors quantified the COVID-19-related risks thus: abnormal heart rhythms (a 3.8-fold increase, or an increase of 166 cases per 100 000 infected patients), kidney damage (14.8-fold increase; 125 excess cases per 100 000), pericarditis (5.4-fold increase; 11 excess cases per 100 000), pulmonary embolism (12.1-fold increase; 62 excess cases per 100 000), deep vein thrombosis (3.8-fold increase; 43 excess cases per 100 000), heart attack (4.5-fold increase; 25 excess cases per 100 000), and stroke (2.1-fold increase; 14 excess cases per 100 000).

The study was the largest peer-reviewed assessment of the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine in the setting of a nationwide mass vaccination, according to the authors. They noted that previous vaccine safety evaluation efforts have relied on vaccinated individual self-reports, which are incomplete.

Marc Lipsitch, PhD, of Harvard, study coauthor, said in the release that the big challenge in vaccine safety studies is ensuring "that those we are comparing to identify the vaccine's side effects are similar in the other characteristics that may predict whether they will experience these side effects," which he said is particularly difficult in the context of a rapidly growing, age-targeted vaccine campaign. "Clalit's extraordinary database made it possible to design a study that addressed these challenges in a way that provides tremendous confidence in the inferences that come out of the study," he added.

Coauthor Ben Reis, PhD, of Harvard, said that the study results should assuage vaccine hesitancy due to lack of potential information on possible vaccine-related adverse events. "Those who have hesitated until now to get vaccinated due to concerns about very rare side effects -- such as myocarditis -- should be aware that the risks for this very same side effect are actually higher among unvaccinated infected individuals," he said.

"The Clalit Research Institute, in collaboration with researchers from Harvard University, analyzed one of the world's largest integrated health record databases to examine the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162B2 vaccine against COVID-19. The study provides the largest peer-reviewed evaluation of the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine in a nationwide mass-vaccination setting. The study was conducted in Israel, an early global leader in COVID-19 vaccination rates.

"Previous efforts to characterize vaccine safety have relied on voluntary active reporting by vaccinated individuals, which is known to be incomplete. The present study relies on the analysis of millions of anonymized electronic medical records, which are far more comprehensive.

"Furthermore, in order to provide the necessary context for interpreting vaccine safety findings, this study is the first to examine a wide range of adverse events both among vaccinated individuals and among unvaccinated individuals who were infected with the coronavirus."

"These data should facilitate informed individual risk-benefit decision-making, and, in our view, make a strong argument in favor of opting-in to get vaccinated, especially in countries where the virus is currently widespread," added Prof. Balicer, who also serves as Chairman of Israel's National Expert Advisory Team on COVID-19 response." - Mod.LK]

[3] Delta variant: transmission
Date: Wed 25 Aug 2021
Source: Healthline [edited]
https://www.healthline.com/health-news/people-with-delta-variant-can-transmit-virus-2-days-before-having-symptoms


People with the delta variant of the coronavirus may be able to transmit the virus for nearly 2 days before having symptoms. This change could be a key feature driving the most recent surge in COVID-19 cases, a new study in the journal Nature suggests.

Presymptomatic transmission was a feature of previous coronavirus variants, but the research suggests the gap between receiving a positive test to feeling systems was just 0.8 days. With the delta variant, it's 1.8 days. As a result, nearly three-quarters of infections with delta happen during the presymptomatic phase, the research suggests.

"The delta strain is more contagious, in part, because infected individuals carry and shed more virus than previous versions," said Dr. Stefen Ammon, medical director of the COVID-19 Task Force for DispatchHealth, an on-demand healthcare service. "While the earlier version of COVID-19 was as transmissible as the common cold, the delta variant is more transmissible than seasonal influenza, polio, smallpox, Ebola, and the bird flu, and is as contagious as chickenpox," he added.

Because of this increased transmissibility, delta has become the dominant variant worldwide. It accounts for more than 90% of COVID-19 cases in the United States.

And while vaccines are still extremely effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19, studies are showing that vaccinated people who contract the coronavirus, so-called "breakthrough infections," may have viral loads as high as those among unvaccinated individuals, meaning they can transmit the infection.

This differs from our previous understanding of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. "When COVID-19 vaccines first became available, they demonstrated a great ability to prevent the recipient from contracting any form of COVID-19, which largely removed vaccinated asymptomatic and presymptomatic exposures from the equation," Ammon told Healthline.

"However, the delta variant has developed an ability in some instances to partially evade the immunity provided by vaccination, meaning there are more breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals from the delta variant than were seen from previous versions of the virus," he said.

But it's not all bad news. Recent studies show the critical importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine both for personal health and limited transmission.

"The fact that asymptomatic people spread the virus is not new information. We have known that people are contagious before they are symptomatic for over a year," said Dr. Jason Gallagher, an infectious disease expert and clinical pharmacy specialist in infectious diseases at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia.

"However, we are learning more about this finding very quickly. Two studies now show that the viral RNA declines more quickly in vaccinated people than unvaccinated people, suggesting that they are less likely to transmit virus to others," he said.

These accumulated findings, along with the rapid rise in COVID-19 case numbers nationwide while vaccination rates have lagged, have brought back public health advisories from earlier in the pandemic. These include mask mandates, calls for physical distancing, and one newer wrinkle -- vaccination mandates -- in many cities and states.

"All people, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, should wear masks while inside in public or crowded spaces," said Dr. Elizabeth Beatriz, an epidemiologist at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in the Bureau of Community Health and Prevention and a public health and COVID-19 adviser at Parenting Pod.

"This is particularly true if you are in an area where there are a lot of COVID infections, or you live with someone who is unvaccinated, including children, or someone who is immunocompromised, or who is likely to get very sick if they do become infected with COVID," she said. "Even though there has been a lot in the news about 'breakthrough infections' among the vaccinated, we continue to see that those who are not vaccinated are the ones getting very sick, being hospitalized, and dying," Beatriz said.

"To protect yourself, vaccination is key."

[From Nature News (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02259-2):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"People infected with the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to spread the virus before developing symptoms than are people infected with earlier versions, suggests a detailed analysis of an outbreak in Guangdong, China (1).

"'It is just tougher to stop,' says Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong and a co-author of the study, which was posted on a preprint server on 13 Aug 2021.

"Cowling and his colleagues analysed exhaustive test data from 101 people in Guangdong who were infected with delta between May and June this year [2021], and data from those individuals' close contacts. They found that, on average, people began having symptoms 5.8 days after infection with delta -- 1.8 days after they first tested positive for viral RNA. That left almost 2 days for individuals to shed viral RNA before they showed any sign of COVID-19.

A dangerous window
------------------
"An earlier study (2) and an unpublished analysis by Cowling and others estimate that before delta emerged, individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 took an average of 6.3 days to develop symptoms and 5.5 days to test positive for viral RNA, leaving a narrower window of 0.8 days for oblivious viral shedding.

"In the latest work, the researchers also found that those infected with delta had higher concentrations of viral particles, or viral load, in their bodies than did people infected with the original version of SARS-CoV-2. 'Somehow the virus is appearing quicker and in higher amounts,' says Cowling.

"As a result, 74% of infections with delta took place during the presymptomatic phase -- a higher proportion than for previous variants. This high rate 'helps explain how this variant has been able to outpace both the wild-type virus and other variants to become the dominant strain worldwide', says Barnaby Young, an infectious-disease clinician at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore.

"The researchers also calculated delta's 'basic reproduction number', or R0, which is the average number of people to whom every infected person will spread the virus in a susceptible population. They estimated that delta has an R0 of 6.4, which is much higher than the R0 of 2-4 estimated for the original version of SARS-CoV-2, says Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 'Delta moves a bit faster, but is much more transmissible.'

"A small number of study participants experienced 'breakthrough infections' with delta after receiving 2 doses of an inactivated-virus COVID-19 vaccine. But the vaccine reduced participants' viral loads at the peak of infection.

"Vaccinated individuals were also 65% less likely than unvaccinated individuals to infect someone else, although the estimate was based on a very small sample size. This reduction 'is significant and reassuring that COVID-19 vaccines remain effective and a vital part of our response to the pandemic', says Young."
