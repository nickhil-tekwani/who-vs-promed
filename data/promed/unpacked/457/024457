** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion.
*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally notifiable
diseases, and therefore, it is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC site [URL above]
for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West
Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 reported to ArboNet
by state and local health departments. ArboNet is the national, electronic
surveillance system established by CDC to assist states in tracking West
Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2006
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.
