The outbreak of dengue fever and its sometimes deadly haemorrhagic strain
will continue to increase across [the Americas] in the 21st century unless
governments boost their will to combat the tropical virus, experts say.
Cases of dengue are on the rise in almost every country in North and South
America even though the disease was almost wiped out by a 1962 plan to
eradicate the mosquito [_Aedes aegypti_] that carries and spreads the
virus. But a lack of coordination between and within governments, dwindling
resources and declining awareness of the problem has led to a resurgence of
dengue in every Western hemisphere country except for Canada, Chile,
Bermuda and Cuba -- which have largely eradicated it.
"If we continue with our present conditions, we're going to have serious
problems," Eric Martinez, a Cuban specialist and author on dengue, said.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number
of cases of dengue fever in the Americas more than doubled to 741,794 in
1998 from 364,945 in 1997. Even in the United States there were 90
laboratory diagnosed cases of dengue in 1998, including one death.

[I do not know about the reliability of the rest of this message but it
simply is not true that Cuba has eradicated dengue; they have outbreaks
from time to time and some of them are widespread and serious. In addition,
including the U.S.A. in the list of countries with dengue is not quite
correct. Although there have been dengue cases in the U.S.A., almost all
have been imported cases, with only a bare few indigenous transmissions in
the states bordering Mexico.
Although there was at one time talk of eradicating dengue from the Western
Hemisphere by the year 2000, that goal clearly has not been met and the
problem is getting much worse. This is one of the prices we are all paying
for budget cuts and deemphasis of vector-borne diseases as a threat. I am
reminded of the Hans Christian Andersen story, "The Emperor's New Clothes".
