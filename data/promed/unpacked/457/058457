The US is banning the importation of dogs from more than 100 countries for at least a year because of a sharp increase in the number of puppies imported into the country with fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates.

"We're doing this to make sure that we protect the health and safety of dogs that are imported into the United States, as well as protect the public's health," Dr. Emily Pieracci of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells NPR.

The pandemic prompted a surge of pet adoptions, including puppies, as Americans sought companionship while they hunkered down in their homes to protect themselves from COVID-19.

That was accompanied by an increase in dog importations, along with a jump in dogs entering the country with falsified or fraudulent rabies certificates, Pieracci says. During 2020, the CDC discovered more than 450 dogs arriving in the US with falsified or fraudulent rabies certificates, a 52% increase compared with the previous 2 years, she says.

"Early on in the pandemic, the shelters were reporting record-low numbers because everybody was adopting pandemic puppies. And so there is a possibility that there may be a correlation between empty shelters here driving an increased demand to purchase puppies overseas," she says.

The rush to meet increased demand may have enticed unscrupulous breeders to cut corners, especially in places so overwhelmed by the pandemic they were having a hard time keeping up with their rabies vaccination programs, she says.

"Given the impact that COVID has had on vaccination programs around the world, we're not sure what the rabies landscape is going to look like in the future. But we are definitely concerned that there could be an increased risk of importing a rabid dog," she says.

How dogs and people get rabies
-----------------------------
Rabies was eliminated in dogs in the United States in 2007 [perhaps in people, but not necessarily so in pets - Mod.TG], though unvaccinated canines bitten by rabid wildlife (or that come in contact with their saliva) -- raccoons, skunks, or bats, for example -- can still contract the disease this way. Today, pet dogs in the United States are routinely vaccinated against rabies to protect them.

But rabies remains one of the deadliest diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans around the world. Globally, about 59 000 people die from rabies each year, the equivalent of about one human death every 9 minutes, Pieracci says. Rabies is nearly always fatal once a person begins to experience symptoms.

The US imports about 1 million dogs each year. So starting on 14 Jul [2021], the CDC is banning the importation of any dogs from 113 countries considered at high risk for rabies for a year. The countries are widespread and include Kenya, Uganda, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, Viet Nam, North Korea, Nepal, China, and Syria.

"What we're really trying to do is prevent the reintroduction of rabies back into the United States from a source outside of the US," Pieracci says.

Veterinarians are praising the decision.

"If a new strain of rabies [were to be] introduced into the United States, it'd just be a matter of where it will spread and how fast it will spread," says Dr. Douglas Kratt, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. "Probably not if, but where, and how fast."

But not everyone is enthusiastic about the CDC's restrictive move.

"While we understand the need to keep animals in the US safe, we are concerned this move will penalize responsible pet owners who adopt rescued animals from other countries," Meredith Ayan, executive director of SPCA International, tells NPR in a written statement.

"It will also cause a large number of otherwise healthy animals living abroad to be surrendered and potentially euthanized if they can't travel to the US to their adoptive owners. The US already has strict quarantine and rabies vaccination procedures in place that have proved highly effective for many years in keeping animals in the US safe from rabies and which we encourage the CDC to keep enforcing."

Some case-by-case exceptions to the import ban
---------------------------------------------------
Pieracci stresses the ban will be reevaluated in a year. And in the meantime, exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis, such as for people returning home after living abroad.

"We recognize there are going to be some people who will need to bring a dog into the United States," Pieracci says. "And so CDC has set up a process by which people can apply for a permit to bring their dog with them."

And anyone hoping to adopt a dog shouldn't worry, she says. The banned countries only account for about 6% of all the dogs imported each year. And there are still many dogs available domestically for adoption.

"We have plenty of dogs available needing wonderful loving homes here in the United States of America," says Dr. Jerry Klein, the chief veterinary officer for the American Kennel Club. "There should be no need to go to foreign countries to fill the need for loving homes for dogs and cats in the USA."

The risk to most puppies having already been adopted during the pandemic is probably low, health officials say, adding that anyone concerned about a puppy should consult with a veterinarian, who can run a blood test to check vaccination status.

"There is a possibility that if you purchased a pandemic puppy and it came from overseas from a high-risk rabies country, it may not have been appropriately vaccinated against rabies," Pieracci says. "You might want to get it checked out, or maybe just have your dog revaccinated."

[2] Pennsylvania: imported dog

A rabid dog imported into the United States this month [June 2021] has sparked a public health investigation across several states.

Health officials say a dog that was brought to the US from Azerbaijan and ended up with a family in Chester County, Pennsylvania, began acting strangely. It later tested positive for rabies and was euthanized. At least 12 people were exposed to the animal. [Actually, the animal could not be tested prior to its death. The animal would have been euthanized and its brain tested for the rabies virus. There currently is no confirmatory test for rabies in a living animal. - Mod.TG]

The dog was one of 34 animals -- 33 dogs and one cat -- imported by an animal rescue organization from Azerbaijan to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on 10 Jun [2021].

The animals were not in the main cabin of the plane or main terminal of the airport. Travelers through O'Hare are not considered to be at risk, but health officials are checking to see if other animals in the shipment are infected and are still tracking down the pets' new owners.

Rabies no longer regularly spreads among dogs in the US, but imported animals are considered a risk for new outbreaks.

Federal agencies are working with health officials in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, and New York on the investigation.

The incident marks the 4th rabid dog imported into the US since 2015. The 3 previous were rescue dogs arriving with rabies vaccination certificates that were later found to be fraudulent.

This week, the CDC announced that starting 14 Jul [2021] it will impose a year-long ban on dogs from more than 100 countries -- including Azerbaijan -- where rabies is still a problem. The ban is being imposed because of a spike in the number of puppies denied entry because they weren't old enough to be fully vaccinated.

The Lake County Health Department is assisting state authorities in an investigation involving imported dogs presumed to have come into contact with rabies.

According to Lake County health officials, the group of 33 dogs imported last week from Azerbaijan passed through O'Hare International Airport. The investigation began after one of the dogs was taken to Pennsylvania and then euthanized after exhibiting behaviors consistent with rabies.

Four dogs from the group are known to have gone through Lake County. Two were immediately sent to other states. The 2 other dogs in Lake County were examined and are being quarantined for 45 days by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

A representative of the state health department was not immediately available for comment Monday [21 Jun 2021], and the status or location of the other dogs was not known.

Rabies is transmitted through direct contact with the saliva or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected animal, usually through a bite. Most cases occur in wild animals, mainly skunks, raccoons, bats, and foxes.

"Cases of dog rabies are extremely rare in the United States," Larry Mackey, director of environmental health for the Lake County Health Department, said in a news release. "However, it is important to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions with pets and wild animals you may encounter."

According to Lake County health officials, dog rabies has effectively been eliminated in the US since 2007. [Perhaps in people. - Mod.TG] There is a temporary suspension prohibiting the entry of dogs into the US from 113 high-risk countries, health officials said.

In human beings, early symptoms include fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations, agitation, hypersalivation, difficulty swallowing, and an irrational fear of water may ensue. Death usually ensues within days of these symptoms.

To control rabies,
- don't feed, touch, or adopt wild animals or stray dogs and cats. Contact the health department if you encounter sick or injured wildlife;
- vaccinate your pets, and don't let them roam free;
- a rabid animal may act tame, so don't go near it.

[This whole imported dog (or pets) saga is very sad. It seems so easy to get a vaccine for these pets. Yet a vaccine seems too much trouble for the groups wanting to import these animals. The lack of vaccination and the human and animal exposure explained in these articles has everyone a bit tense. The human exposure is concerning, and we do not know if any of the workers on the transports were exposed to a puppy bite, thinking it was just a playful puppy.

Rabies is a serious health concern for individuals bitten by an animal without a vaccine against the rabies virus. Rabies can be fatal to human beings if left untreated.

If you are bitten by an animal, wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical treatment. If the animal cannot be found, or if it tests positive for rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, is necessary.

Sadly, an animal with clinical signs of what is suspected to be rabies is euthanized, and the brain is tested. Consequently, getting these animals properly vaccinated prior to transport is safer for the transporters, and safer for the adoptive pet parents, and clearly there is a better outcome for the pet. - Mod.TG
