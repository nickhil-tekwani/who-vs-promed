Bird flu: Officials told to keep an eye out
-------------------------------------------
Provincial officials have been requested to be on watch for bird-flu
outbreaks, Yukol Limlaemthong, director-general of the Livestock
Development Department, said yesterday [21 Jan 2004].
"Bird-flu watch centres will be headed by provincial governors while
district chiefs monitor activities at the local level. Daily reports will
be sent to the department to ensure suspect cases are investigated without
delay," Yukol said.
He urged farmers to cull birds that show avian flu symptoms and said
poultry-transporters must have proof of random virus-tests before chickens
are taken to slaughter.
Yukol said that in the past 2 months the department had arranged for
antiseptic spraying of farms around the country, especially where ducks
were reared, as it was known these could look healthy but still carry the
disease.
He added that Phitsanulok and Rayong were under the 21-day bird-flu watch
but other provinces had not reported any ill or dead poultry.
He also warned chicken-raisers to apply early next month for permission to
transport chickens before selling them for Chinese New Year celebrations.
If they try to move them without the necessary documents, farmers will be
subject to a 2-year jail term for breaking the Animal Quarantine Act, he said.
Meanwhile Rayong livestock development officer Santi Atchayutpokin, said
laboratory tests on chickens in Rayong's Klaeng district had found no
traces of the virus.
The tests were conducted on chickens in a 5-kilometre radius of a farm
where 20 chickens with bird flu were culled on 12 Jan 2005, he
said. Additional tests were carried out in the same area late yesterday,
and the results should be known in 7 days, he said. Meanwhile no poultry
may be transported out of the area.
Rayong public-health official Dr Wiwat Wiriyakijja said his colleagues
running health checks on people living in the control area had not reported
any cases of people with symptoms similar to those of bird flu. However,
all hospitals have been instructed to isolate patients with respiratory
problems as a precaution.
In related news, on Tuesday [25 Jan 2005] Chiang Mai livestock-development
officer Somporn Pornwisetkul is to meet public-health officials and
concerned agencies to discuss measures to deal with any outbreak of bird
flu to prevent it from spreading to the upper northern provinces.
Salakjit Chutivivet, head of the Chiang Mai medical-science centre's human
bird-flu laboratory, said that since the laboratory opened last year,
government and private hospitals had been sending 10-20 tissue samples a
month to be tested for the H5N1 virus, but to date no cases had been found.
Salakjit said 6 samples had come from hospitals in Chiang Mai Muang and San
Pa Tong districts.

PM orders strong actions to stop spread of bird flu
-----------------
*** The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development reported on Saturday
that bird flu has spread to 232 communes in 23 cities and provinces
nationwide, with more than 500 000 chickens, ducks and quails being culled.
After Hanoi and Ha Nam, Hai Duong is the 3rd locality in the northern
region to be affected by bird flu, with the latest outbreaks detected on
Saturday morning. The Mekong Delta still has the highest outbreaks so far.
The Ministry sent a report on developments of the disease to the Government
and asked for VND80 billion to purchase medical equipment, respirators and
chemicals for the 3 regions across the country.
*** Earlier, on Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem, on behalf
of the Prime Minister, ordered ministries, ministerial-level agencies,
government agencies and provincial and municipal People's Committees to
take strict measures to prevent the spread of pneumonia caused by the
type-A flu virus (H5N1).
*** The prevention of avian influenza and its transmission to humans must
be given top, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dzung told an
inter-provincial meeting in Hanoi on Friday.
He asked localities and the mass media to boost information dissemination
to raise public awareness about avian influenza. He requested both
unaffected and affected areas to tighten control over poultry slaughtering,
processing and transportation to prevent the epidemic from spreading.
He also asked big cities and towns nationwide to mark out areas for poultry
trading, slaughtering and processing, and ordered a temporary suspension of
poultry imports from neighbouring countries.
*** HCM City's Veterinary Department is co-ordinating closely with the
municipal Market Watch Force and Police 113 to work round the clock along
national highways and inter-provincial roads to stop the transport of
poultry and poultry products into the city. The city has established 56
safe slaughterhouses under the strict scrutiny of veterinarians.
*** MARD Minister Cao Duc Phat is requesting Hanoi to mark off poultry
slaughter houses and prevent the transport of poultry of unknown origin
into the city. The city has established 13 checkpoints at city gates and
another 30 at markets.
*** In central Quang Nam province, bird flu has spread to 7 communes and
wards. 60 out of 124 test samples showed positive for H5N1. Chairman of the
provincial People's Committee Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered local authorities to
cull sick and infected poultry and fine households which have not
co-operated with bird flu prevention forces. Da Nang city alone has
established a hot telephone line to deal with issues relating to the flu.
