The Health Ministry began a vaccination campaign to combat the high
incidence of dengue and yellow fever, consequences of heavy rainfall in the
area.
To date 142 cases of dengue have been reported, 17 had hemorrhagic symptoms
and 6 patients died [35% DHF case/fatality rate. Although the situation is
under control, the authorities have declared a yellow alert to prevent a
greater incidence of the disease.
The Health Secretary, Claudia James, indicated that, contrary to local
belief, the mosquitoes which vector [viruses causing these two diseases do
not breed in wastewaters. Generally they breed in still waters, thereby it
is very important to apply chlorine and permanently wash water storage
tanks, explained Dr. James.
[The above could be somewhat difficult as the water supply of a vast sector
of the population is not connected to the municipal water supply,
therefore, water has to be collected in buckets and whatever is available.

[Other than the first paragraph, no further mention of yellow fever is
made. If anyone has information as to the geographic distribution (urban?
rural?), number of cases, case/fatality rate, etc. for yellow fever in
Colombia, ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving it. Also, no mention is
made of the dengue serotype(s) circulating in Colombia at this time. -
