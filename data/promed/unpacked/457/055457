Niagara Region Public Health is investigating a confirmed report of H5N1 avian influenza in a mixed flock of birds including chicken, geese and ducks. Niagara Region Public Health is working closely with the Ontario Ministry of Health, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to monitor and respond to the situation.

"Only those working on the farm with the birds are at any risk, and Public Health has followed up with each of them individually," said Dr. Joanne Kearon, Resident Physician working with Niagara Region Public Health. "We are working with our provincial and federal partners to contain the infection so that it doesn't spread to any other birds, and in turn doesn't pose a risk to anyone else."

Avian influenza is a viral disease that affects mostly domestic poultry and wild birds such as geese, ducks, and shore birds. Spread of the virus from animals to humans is uncommon but has been observed. The exact mode of transmission from birds to people is not known; however, most human cases of avian influenza have been traced to direct contact with live or dead infected poultry or their droppings.

While avian influenza remains rare in Ontario, owners of birds with exposure to the outdoors should practice some routine precautions such as rigorous hand washing and wearing of personal protective equipment as appropriate. Safety principles for those with backyard chickens or other domestic birds are available from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Please consult your local municipality about details of keeping backyard poultry and associated bylaws.

Residents should avoid handling wild birds, including those that are sick, injured or dead. Report any sick or dead birds to the Ontario Regional Centre of the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative at (866) 673-4781.

[2] General information about the H5N1 virus in 2022

The avian influenza strain killing poultry across the United States is more infectious than the one having hit over 200 flocks in the last major outbreak. The virus dose needed to cause infection is much lower than in 2015, said Mary Pantin-Jackwood, a veterinary researcher at USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Georgia. Pantin-Jackwood spoke 4 Oct 2022 at the National Meeting on Poultry Health, Processing and Live Production presented by the Delmarva Chicken Association.

Avian influenza viruses circulate in wild waterfowl. In most cases, including the 2015 Midwest outbreak having cost the United States 50 million birds, the virus transfers from wild birds to poultry in a low pathogenic form, and then may adapt to become more infectious and deadly in domestic birds.

These outbreaks are usually controlled quickly. Once the infected flocks are killed and the farms are cleaned up, "those particular viruses are gone," Pantin-Jackwood said.

This year's [2022] H5N1 strain is starting out in wild birds as infectious as the disease spreading among poultry farms in 2015. The disease has infected 231 commercial farms and caused nearly 47 million birds to be depopulated.

An early sign the current strain would be different was its activity in the wild; the virus is killing some species of waterfowl, which don't generally show clinical signs of avian influenza. Other waterfowl species withstand the disease but spread it.

In 2015, only 98 wild birds were identified as infected compared with 2600 across 85 species this year [2022]. The birds having died of disease include hawks and large groups of vultures -- birds which feed on waterfowl.

This year's strain has also infected carrion-feeding mammals like foxes, opossums and raccoons. No mammals were infected in 2015, Pantin-Jackwood said.

The current strain has also traveled more widely than its 2015 counterpart. The active strain made it to the waterfowl migration routes along the East Coast, which was spared 7 years ago.

Still, virus dose, bird age and bird species can affect a flock's susceptibility. Compared with chickens, turkeys are more likely to become infected by a low dose of the virus and to transmit the disease. Turkeys also take longer to die, Pantin-Jackwood said.

The domestic species related to chickens, like quails and guineas, require a low dose to become infected. These types of birds are common in backyard flocks, which have seen 10 times as many outbreaks this year [2022] than in 2015. "If they meet a duck that's infected, they will become infected. And then it's a way how the virus could eventually also infect other birds," Pantin-Jackwood said.

Elevated deaths are the best indicator of an avian influenza outbreak, but decreases in feed, water and egg production can also be red flags. Diagnosis in farmed ducks is particularly hard because they show few clinical signs, Pantin-Jackwood said.

If today's avian influenza virus is especially aggressive, USDA is also better equipped to understand it than it was in 2015. In 2015, USDA's national veterinary lab in Iowa sequenced full genomes for only 260 samples, which can show where the virus came from. This year [2022], thanks to expanded testing capability, it is approaching 4000.

By comparing the genomes from multiple sites, researchers can make a good guess about where the disease came from and how it got into a farm. For example, samples from a Newfoundland farm, one of the 1st North American sites affected in this outbreak, showed the virus resembled a strain causing problems in Europe.

Another sample in Alaska showed the virus was similar to one circulating in Japan. USDA has identified 3 incursions of the virus, 2 from Europe and one from the Pacific. "That immediately tells us, oh, now we know who we're dealing with," Pantin-Jackwood said.

The most prevalent strain reassorted its genes when it interacted with existing North American avian influenza viruses, and it spread quickly across the country. Similar genomes can also suggest farm-to-farm transmission, which was a major problem in 2015. This year [2022] almost all of the outbreaks appear to be separate introductions linked to wild birds. "You're doing a good job on the farm to farm, but we still are not stopping the virus from infecting premises," Pantin-Jackwood said.

That's a problem because waterfowl are continuing to shed the H5N1 virus. Farms must continue to focus on biosecurity, she said. It's not clear if the current avian influenza strain will establish itself for the long term as one of the viruses circulating in the United States. If enough birds became affected, it's possible flocks could develop a level of herd immunity, but there will always be young birds for the disease to infect, Pantin-Jackwood said. [How do they develop immunity if the birds are being euthanized as fast as the disease is recognized? Perhaps she is referring to wild birds? - Mod.TG]

[3] Michigan (Tuscola County): backyard flock
Date: Fri 30 Sep 2022
Source: Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) [edited]
https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/about/media/pressreleases/2022/09/30/avian-influenza-detected-in-tuscola-county


Following an investigation by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD), the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has detected the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a backyard poultry flock from Tuscola County. This is the 1st detection in Tuscola County. To best keep domestic birds healthy and safe, owners need to take every step they can to prevent their flocks from being exposed to wild birds.

"Most of the HPAI cases detected this year [2022] in Michigan's backyard flocks have involved direct or indirect contact with wild birds," said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland. "Keeping domestic birds from intermingling with wild birds and away from open sources of water where wild birds might visit are some key preventative measures bird owners can take to ensure the health of their flock. Protecting Michigan's domestic flocks is a collaborative effort."

HPAI is a highly contagious virus that can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. To protect other flocks in Michigan, the premises is currently under quarantine, and the birds will be depopulated to prevent disease spread. The flock contained approximately 135 birds of various species.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the public health risk associated with this avian influenza detection remains low. Also, no birds or bird products infected with HPAI will enter the commercial food chain. As a reminder, people should properly handle and cook all poultry and eggs.

Whether it's a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following a few key steps is fundamental to protect the health and vitality of Michigan's domestic birds:

- Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.
- Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.
- Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops.
- Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.
- Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.
- Use well or municipal water as drinking water for birds.
- Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.

MDARD is continuing to work diligently with local, state, and federal partners to quickly respond to reports of sick or dead domestic birds to best mitigate the spread of HPAI and provide outreach.

Reporting possible cases
------------------------
For domestic birds: Domestic bird owners and caretakers should watch for multiple sudden deaths in the flock, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected in domestic birds, contact MDARD immediately at 800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after-hours).

For wild birds: If anyone notices what appears to be unusual or unexplained deaths among wild bird populations, please report these cases to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) by:
- Using the DNR's Eyes in the Field app. Choose the "Diseased Wildlife" option among the selections for "Observation Forms.
- Calling the DNR Wildlife Disease Laboratory at 517-336-5030.

[4] Colorado (Weld County): commercial poultry

Colorado is under a disaster declaration again as another large facility's poultry flock has to be culled because of a virulent flu strain affecting birds. Highly pathogenic avian influenza can infect both wild birds and domesticated poultry. Since it kills about 90% of infected birds, the US Department of Agriculture sends teams into affected facilities to destroy all the poultry there, so any birds that might have survived can't carry the virus with them and decimate other flocks.

One person in Colorado tested positive in April [2022], though public health officials thought that person might have just carried the virus in his nose without a true infection.

Gov. Jared Polis had previously declared the situation a disaster in April [2022], after the virus hit a Montrose County facility with 58 000 birds and a Weld County operation with 1.4 million birds and 7 million eggs. At the time, the state set aside USD one million for the response. The declaration expired in late July [2022], following a lull in new cases.

The virus struck again on 20 Sep 2022, hitting a facility with 1.1 million birds in Weld County. Polis issued another executive order declaring a disaster on Thursday [29 Sep 2022]. The declaration lasts for one month.

The order also gave state agencies another month to use the remainder of the USD one million before it returns to the state's disaster fund. It originally was only set aside through late November [2022].

More than 46 million turkeys and other domestic birds had been affected in 40 states as of Thursday [29 Sep 2022], according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus also has been found in 2650 birds in 46 states -- possibly an undercount, given people don't always report coming across a dead bird.

https://www.wowt.com/2022/10/04/two-more-bird-flu-cases-reported-nebraska/


Two more cases of the bird flu have been reported in Nebraska. The new cases were confirmed by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in a press release Monday [3 Oct 2022].

There are a total of 11 cases in the state. The last case was reported in September [2022].

One case was in York County in a commercial flock. The other case was in Box Butte County in a backyard flock. The release further states, "both flocks will be humanely depopulated and disposed of in an approved manner."

As a standard, the NDA is implementing a 6.2-mile [10 km] surveillance zone around the impacted property. Poultry producers in that area should take special care in watching their flock and notify the NDA immediately.

The CDC says the risk to humans remains minimal and no human cases have been detected in the United States.

Avian influenza has hit the Sanpete County turkey industry hard with 400 000 turkeys either euthanized or died from the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Utah's turkey industry produces upward of 3.6 million birds annually according to a federal agriculture statistician based in Utah.

The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) has confirmed 3 more cases of HPAI on turkey farms in Sanpete County this week, making a total of 11 farms impacted by the disease. All turkeys on these premises have been depopulated to prevent further spread of the disease.

While the loss is significant for these farms, currently, food shortages are not expected with current numbers. The situation is fluid and is being closely monitored by UDAF and USDA officials in effort to contain the disease and prevent further impact. The state agency is working to contain the disease and is asking the public to stay away from the infected locations with known cases and locations.

UDAF is asking all domestic bird owners, including backyard chicken flocks, ducks, geese, turkeys, gamebirds, etc., to strengthen their biosecurity practices. "If possible, birds should be kept locked inside enclosures to avoid contact with migratory birds," said Bailee Woolstenhulme, public information officer for UDAF. "Flocks should not have shared water, feed, or grazing sources with wild bird habitats."

Poultry producers from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review the biosecurity materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://bit.ly/3RNr4k7.

Bird owners should know avian flu indicators in their birds, such as nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption, and lack of coordination in birds. If any domesticated birds are experiencing any of these signs, it should be reported to the state veterinarian immediately at statevet@utah.gov.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. One case of this strain of HPAI has been detected in the United States.

https://www.wgal.com/article/usda-reports-new-avian-flu-cases-pennsylvania/41528408#


The US Department of Agriculture is reporting new cases of avian flu across the country and in Pennsylvania.

- A backyard chicken flock in East Lampeter Township, Lancaster County, is among the latest to test positive.
- The flock is one of 2 in the Susquehanna Valley to be impacted by the latest outbreak.
- The other flock is a commercial turkey farm in York County with 25 000 birds.

Pennsylvania Farm Bureau leaders say the new outbreak is a reminder of how to stop the virus from spreading. "Make sure you're checking your vehicles on the way in, making sure you're wearing dedicated clothes and shoes, removing those before you leave the premises. You know, just basic, simple but commonsense biosecurity to make sure we don't spread these terrible illnesses which affect birds throughout Pennsylvania," said Grant Gulibon of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau.

There are currently 18 commercial and 3 backyard poultry flocks in Pennsylvania having tested positive, according to the USDA. About 4.2 million birds have been impacted.

If you suspect live poultry is infected, you are asked to report it to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Service at 717-772-2852. The number is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Signs of avian flu in poultry include a lack of energy and appetite.

While avian flu is deadly to birds, it's still safe to eat chickens and eggs. [Products in the commercial line do not enter the US food chain. Individuals may choose to consume their own raised poultry. - Mod.TG]

[The 1st article in the USA subsection helps explain why this HPAI is moving so fast across North America.

We have many times mentioned biosecurity as being the key to prevention with this virus. While we understand many people practice good biosecurity, still sometimes this virus gets through. Building a tough, impermeable barrier to an unseen, deadly virus is very tough. Please continue to be resolute at maintaining biosecurity.

This virus is still marching on. We hope cooler weather and the end of fall migration will bring a stop to this virus. - Mod.TG
