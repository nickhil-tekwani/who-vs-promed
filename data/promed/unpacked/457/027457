INFLUENZA (50) : VACCINE-ASSOCIATED ENHANCED DISEASE, FURTHER COMMENT

The comments of William James (and the moderator CP) [see ProMED-mail: Influenza (48): vaccine-associated enhanced disease, comment 20130830.1913874] are apt in the context of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) for influenza enhanced disease. James Porterfield also produced an excellent review on ADE (Porterfield JS. Antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infectivity. Adv Virus Res. 1986;31:335-55), which identified other viruses such as rabies, respiratory syncytial virus, feline infectious peritonitis, et al. that in some instances appear to show enhanced disease in the presence of non-protective antibodies, and later other viruses such as HIV could also included. Moreover, it is not particularly well known that tick-borne encephalitis virus has also been identified in this context. Thus, in many European countries, the use of human immune immunoglobulin as a prophylactic treatment following tick-bites is no longer recommended following a recommendation by WHO.

Perhaps more importantly, returning to influenza, one might ask the question: Could the unusually high severity of the 1918 Spanish flu have been attributable to ADE (and/or the 1957 Asian flu...)?
