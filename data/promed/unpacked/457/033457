HealthMap at Boston Children's Hospital and the Skoll Global Threats Fund are pleased to announce the Second International Conference on Digital Disease Detection, which will be held at the University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California USA from 18-20 Sep 2013.

Over the past 15 years, Internet technology has significantly changed the landscape of public health surveillance and epidemic intelligence gathering. Disease and outbreak data is disseminated not only through formal online announcements by government agencies but also through informal channels such as social networking sites, blogs, chat rooms, Web searches, local news media and crowdsourcing platforms.

Pandemics and emerging diseases may occur at any time, with the capacity to cause catastrophic morbidity, mortality and economic hardship. Rapidly recognizing and responding to these pandemics and emerging diseases are global health priorities.

Informal data streams have been credited with decreasing the time between an outbreak and formal recognition of an outbreak, allowing for an expedited response to the public health threat. Collectively, these online sources create an image of global public health that is fundamentally different from the one produced by traditional public health surveillance infrastructure. As these sources become more widely used and relied upon, it is imperative that health professionals collaborate to demonstrate and improve the effectiveness of these sources. We must identify strengths and weaknesses that can be capitalized upon and remedied.

The intention of the Second International Digital Disease Detection Conference is to connect innovators in health and technology to 1) continue to define this emerging field; 2) explore novel data streams and new technologies; 3) host workshops to identify and discuss strengths and weaknesses in surveillance methods, and to promote critique and development of already existing surveillance and diagnostic tools.

Confirmed speakers include:

Larry Brilliant, President, Skoll Global Threats Fund
Tim Campos, CIO, Facebook
Ciro Cattuto, Research Director, ISI Foundation
Sean Gourley, Founder, Quid
Eric Horvitz, Co-Director, Microsoft Research
Ann Marie Kimball, Senior Program Officer, Global Health, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
Maryn Mckenna, Blogger/Columnist/Author, Wired, Scientific American
Aaron Rowe, Research Director, Scanadu, Inc.
Nathan Wolfe, Founder, Metabiota and Global Viral

There will also be rapid-fire talks and tech demos.

Abstract deadline is 17 Jul 2013.

Registration is free, but required, and space is limited:

[The 2011 DDD meeting in Boston was extremely interesting, and this one promises to be as well. ProMED is a contributing organization for Digital Disease Detection 2013, and we think our participants will find it very worthwhile. - Mod.LM]
