[Since ASF penetrated Russia from Georgia in November 2007, the virus has become established in most of western Russia from south to north. Russia reported ASF as "resolved" on 16 Dec 2013, but a few days later had to report new outbreaks.

The Russian ASF OIE reporting history can be summarised as follows:
1. Initially started on 5 Nov 2007, follow-up report no 18 (final report) declaring the disease "resolved" submitted on 9 Jun 2009 (total 65 outbreaks)
2. Restarted on 11 Sep 2009, follow-up report no 110 (final report) declaring the disease "resolved" submitted on 16 Dec 2013 (total 302 outbreaks)
3. Restarted reporting on 1 Jan 2014, 4 follow-up reports (including the one copied in this posting), covering a total of 5 outbreaks, so far, status, "continuing". See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14673
4. Restarted reporting on 14 Jan 2014, 7 follow-up reports, covering a total of 10 outbreaks, so far, status, "continuing". See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14684.

At present, 2 separate ASF epizootics in tandem are covered in 2 separate threads to the OIE. An explanation for that divided reporting would be helpful. - Mod.AS
