The rabies situation remains serious in the Republic of Udmurtia, the
republican administration of veterinary services communicated to the
information agency "Rosbalt-Privoljye". Since the beginning of 2007,
56 animal cases have been registered in Udmurtia. The last animal -- a
fox -- was killed a couple of days ago around Ijevsk. A week ago, a
stray dog bit 5 inhabitants of a village. Epidemiologists confirmed
that the biting animal was rabies-infected and now all the victims are
getting a course of injections with rabies vaccine. The head of the
central veterinary administration, Gennady Burdov, said that an
unfavorable situation is shown by the appearance of wild animals
within the boundaries of the capital of Udmurtia.

[ProMED reported the rabies problem in Udmurtia (also transliterated
as Udmurtiya) last year -- see ref. below. If wild foxes are the main
wildlife reservoir in the Russian Republic of Udmurtia, public health
officials should consider an oral vaccination program similar to the
successful ones carried out in other European countries.

An epidemic of rabies is evolving in the Donetsk region. Rabies was
detected among domestic and wild animals in 59 places. According to
veterinarians, rabies is present in animals in 16 areas in the
region, including Donetsk city. Doctors explain the spread of the
disease by ineffective measures to deal with wandering and stray
animals and warn that every year the number of victims from animal
bites will increase. During the last 5 months, the number of people
bitten by wandering animals was 4500.
A single fatal case in a human -- a 4-year-old child -- in
Telmanovskaya region was registered in March [2007].
The incidence of suspected rabies cases is 250 per 100 000 population
[meaning each bitten person is regarded as a suspected rabies case.
-Mod. AS]. Sometimes it is not possible to confirm the diagnosis and
neutralize the animal even after proof of aggressive behavior of the
animal [which means the biting animal is not found/identified or not
held for the required 10-day observation period by the owner. -
Mod. AS]. The rules on pets accepted 13 years ago by the local
government are outdated, the veterinarians say, and some of them even
contradict the new ones. The mandatory vaccination of pets is not
envisaged and it is not clear where the infected animals should be
kept. In addition, the level of information that the population has
is low and the seriousness of the consequences is not recognized, the
Internet newspaper reports.

[Given the high incidence of animal rabies in the Donetsk region,
there is no excuse for not requiring and enforcing mandatory
vaccination of pet dogs and cats. If all 4500 humans bitten in the
past 5 months received post rabies exposure treatment, the cost would
have been substantial, and probably more than the cost of animal mass
vaccination. The statement "it is not clear where the infected animals
should be kept" is confusing -- why should they be kept until they
die, rather than sacrificed immediately? Perhaps they mean
quarantining animals that have bitten people until the test results
are known. - Mod.TY/JW]
