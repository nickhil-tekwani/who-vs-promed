The Ethiopian government and the World Health Organisation have reported an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis around Arba Minch and Shebdino, in southern Ethiopia. There has been one reported case in Arba Minch town.

[We are not told in the above report about the number of cases or the meningococcal serogroups that are causing the meningococcal meningitis outbreak in Southern Ethiopia.

Ethiopia is one of the countries in the "meningitis belt" stretching from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa that is plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to April) and end at the onset of the rainy season (from May to June). Larger outbreaks occur every 8-12 years (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization (WHO): Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet: http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf).

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains.

There are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal meningitis, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. All these serogroup polysaccharides except B are immunogenic in humans; serogroup B is poorly immunogenic, presumably because serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule.

While effective capsular polysaccharides-based vaccines exist against serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B strains. A new protein-based, 4-component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine has been developed that is hoped will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).

Rarely, outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been related to other serogroups, such as type X, which has occurred in Niger in 2006 and Burkina Faso in 2010.

Arba Minch is a city with a population of 95 373 (2012) located in the Gamo Gofa Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region of southern Ethiopia, about 500 km (310 miles) south of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arba_Minch). Shebedino, with a population of 233 922 (2007), is one of the "woredas" (districts) in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region of Ethiopia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebedino).
