Municipalities have intensified efforts to relocate camel pens from neighborhoods near Makkah and Jeddah amid fears that they can be a potential source of the deadly coronavirus.

Unlike sheep, camels are being kept on city outskirts and are being maintained by Sudanese shepherds, mainly for milking.

Such camel pens are located in industrial areas and in Briman in Jeddah, Mina Road, Old Jeddah Road, and Khakiah in Makkah.

Camel milk sales are on the decline at popular sale points thanks to rampant fear of the virus. "I hardly see any residents drinking camel milk on Jamoom road near Briman nowadays," said Mohammed Cheema, a Pakistani driver who drives a septic water tank past the area daily.

"There are no camels nowadays in the industrial area," said Mohammed Naseer, a local Indian expatriate.

Yet sources have refuted claims that these sheds are being removed only because of the coronavirus. "We are removing these camel sheds because they cause environmental damage and often operate in unhygienic conditions," said Abdul Salaam bin Mushat, Makkah Municipality secretary, on Tuesday [22 Apr 2014]. "Sheds can often be spotted along roads. Owners routinely sell milk along these roads contrary to a warning issued by the municipality, which they continued to ignore."

"The Makkah Municipality has dismantled 90 percent of camel sheds that are found to be a public health hazard," he said. "We will continue to combat the sale of camel milk along highways in poor hygienic conditions in a bid to protect residents from purchasing contaminated milk."

"Gas stoves and other such utensils have been removed from these sites, and 8 camels of various ages were shifted during the raids," he said.

The sudden spike in cases of MERS in Saudi Arabia came soon after camel-racing events at the Jenadriyah Festival in Riyadh. That suggested that the surge in the coronavirus, which resembles pneumonia but is fatal to 1 in 3 who contract it, confirmed what scientists already knew of the disease: that camels seem to be reservoirs for the virus and transmit it to humans more easily than humans do to one another.

But with the number of cases picking up, there are worries that that may be changing. And if the virus has mutated to increased person-to-person contagion, it has potentially catastrophic implications for another annual festival: the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina known as hajj. More than a million Muslims from around the globe gather in the western Saudi cities during the 1st week of October, then return to their home countries, which last year [2013] numbered 188. In an age when international travel has dramatically exacerbated the spread of new viruses like SARS, virologists say the mounting concern is only too clear.

"It's frustrating," says Ian Mackay, an associate professor at the Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre at the University of Queensland. "With the H7N9 virus, China provided almost too much information. You worried about the privacy of some of the patients, given the level of detail that China was providing.

"But we're seeing the complete opposite extreme in Saudi Arabia, where you can't even get the sex of the patient in some cases," Mackay tells TIME. "And the WHO doesn't seem to be getting that information either."

Indeed, the World Health Organization as good as confirmed it did not have the latest information from Riyadh in declining to comment on the outbreak on Tuesday [22 Apr 2014] afternoon. "Kindly be advised that we cannot comment on latest MERS figures since we do not have the latest case count," the WHO's media office says in an emailed reply to questions from TIME. "And we can only communicate and comment on the cases that we have been officially notified of by a member state, namely Saudi Arabia."

Concerns that the virus may have mutated are focused on 2 clusters of cases among health care workers: one cluster is in Jeddah, the western Saudi city through which pilgrims pass en route to nearby Mecca. The other cluster is among paramedics in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.

Mackay, who noted the clusters in his blog, says he can see 2 possible explanations: "One is a fairly bad but widespread breakdown of infection control and prevention protocols" among the health care workers, that is, nurses or doctors failing to use gloves, surgical masks or other standard measures designed to prevent infection while working with a MERS patient. Such a breakdown would be possible even in a well-equipped and prosperous Gulf nation, Mackay noted, but for both outbreaks to take place at the same time "would be fairly coincidental. The other avenue is that the virus has changed and become more easily transmitted between humans," Mackay said.

That is cause for concern way beyond the Middle East. "When humans readily transmit to humans, that's what will cause a worldwide outbreak," Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told National Public Radio. "We are very concerned that ... with what we've seen over the last 2 weeks ... we may be at that point now."

Whether the virus has, in fact, mutated dangerously cannot be known until the Saudis examine the genome of the latest samples of the virus and share the results. The WHO has said it is "working closely" with the kingdom, but has not issued any conclusions. Another way to find out whether the virus has mutated would be if the number of cases were to skyrocket. But with only 344 cases worldwide so far -- a decade ago, SARS infected at least 8000 and killed 775 -- the count remains low, and awareness is growing.

In 2013, concerns over MERS kept as many as a million people away from hajj, an obligation that the Koran imposes upon any Muslim who can afford the trip. Saudi authorities discouraged attendance by the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and people already suffering from chronic illnesses, a major risk factor for the virus. Still, more than 3 million people circulated at the holy sites for 5 days at close quarters.

[Efforts to enforce elementary hygiene and proper livestock-management requirements by the MERS-affected municipalities should have long ago taken place anyway. Consumption of unpasteurised milk (of cows, goats, sheep, camels, buffalo) is a serious health hazard anywhere; tuberculosis and brucellosis are just 2, though prominent, examples of the zoonotic hazards to be considered. The potential involvement of camel milk in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is yet to be properly investigated. This is not the only MERS-CoV-related issue in urgent need of study, for which coordination between the ministries of health and agriculture and between scientists in the human and animal health realms is essential.

A combination of WHO and country reports puts the current global count of confirmed MERS-CoV infections at about 350 cases, the majority in Saudi Arabia. How many of them have been epidemiologically investigated? Of those investigated, how many patients have possibly been exposed to direct or indirect contact with camels or their products, including meat and milk, raw or processed? And how many have been shown to be nosocomial, excluding other sources of infection? For an effective handling of the situation, the said information, repeatedly requested, is crucial. - Mod.AS
