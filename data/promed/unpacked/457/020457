A total of 4 new South Island farms have been confirmed as infected with the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_. They are near Tapanui, Waimate, Invercargill and Darfield. That brings the total number of actively infected farms to 42.

Meanwhile, eradicating this disease could cost more than was first thought, according to advice provided to the cabinet.

The government decided on [28 May 2018] it would try to eradicate the disease over a 10 year period, and said that would cost 886 million USD. By contrast, doing nothing would cost 1.15 billion USD. However, the cabinet paper that informed their decision has been released. It suggested that figure might not be the final word, since it said some infections would probably not be tested in the tracing process. As a result, the number of infected farms might be under-estimated and so the final cost of the disease might have to be revised upwards.

The paper also confirmed the decision to try to eradicate the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_ was done in hope rather than certainty. When ministers made the decision to eradicate, they stressed that it was a difficult choice to make but they had to give it a go. The cabinet paper said success could not be guaranteed.

Moreover, an independent technical advisory group was only narrowly in favour of some sort of eradication - by 6 members to 4. Additionally, the cost of eradication could be wasted if the scheme failed.

Many of these points were acknowledged when the government ministers' decision to eradicate was made. But they stressed at the time it would be wrong not to at least try to get rid of the disease.

Regarding the spread of the disease, the Ministry for Primary Industries has published these figures:
- Hawke's Bay (Hastings) - 2 (1 active)
- Manawatu (Pahiatua) - 1 (1 active)
- Waikato (Cambridge) - 2 (2 active)
- Wairarapa - 1 (1 active)
- Canterbury - 21 (17 active)
- Otago - 8 (5 active)
- Southland - 17 (15 active)

[Contained with the moderator's comments of ProMED-mail Mycoplasma bovis, bovine - New Zealand (09): eradication plan, 20180528.5824157 was the statement: "While the ministry seems convinced, their release contains the sentence, '...But if we don't try now, we will never get another chance.' This might be seen as a positive sign, but it hints at the fact that there could be a failure. Nevertheless, not trying certainly means an endemic disease."

It appears that my concerns are now being voiced as the price for this attempted eradication may be more costly and require a longer time than first mentioned. Likely the success of this project will depend upon how committed are producers, and government. We wish all involved good luck. - Mod.TG
