Fiddleheads can prove a delightful addition to any locavore's [a person whose diet consists only or principally of locally grown or produced food] diet, if, that is, the curled ferns are cooked properly. 7 cases of illness associated with eating fiddleheads have been reported by residents to Toronto Public Health since the beginning of May 2012, spokeswoman Kris Scheuer said. One cluster involved a family of 4.

Raw or undercooked fiddleheads have been known to sporadically cause unpleasant symptoms of food poisoning since 1994, according to Health Canada. The symptoms typically last for less than a day. Only a few people have been affected, but their temporary sickness serves as a reminder to the public to wash and cook the seasonal greens carefully and not to eat them raw, Scheuer said.

"It's not that you'll always get ill, we just sent out the message to reduce the likelihood," she said.

The growing season for the ostrich fern sprouts is short, lasting from about the end of April till mid-June. The ferns grow in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes and are typically picked from the wild.

It's not known why the spiralled veggies, nicknamed after their violin like appearance, can make people ill. Scientists haven't been able to trace any particular toxin to fiddleheads, according to Health Canada, so it's up to chefs to cook them properly.

When done right, they're delicious, healthy, and popular among foodies. They taste similar to spinach or asparagus, and have twice as many antioxidants as blueberries, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research.

Health Canada recommends washing fiddleheads several times in cold water and removing as much of the papery, brown husk as possible. Then, steam them for 10 to 12 minutes, or boil for 15. Get rid of the water afterward.

[The following is adapted from MMWR 1994:43: 677,683-84 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00032588.htm):

Fiddleheads (crosiers) of the ostrich fern are a seasonal delicacy harvested commercially in the northeastern United States and in coastal provinces of Canada. Although some common ferns may be poisonous or carcinogenic, this species has been considered to be nontoxic. However, in May 1994, outbreaks of food poisoning were associated with eating raw or lightly cooked fiddlehead ferns in New York and western Canada. A case was defined as vomiting or diarrhea within 12 hours of eating. The risk for illness was greater for those who ate a full order of ferns (that is, 8-10 fiddleheads) (RR [relative risk] =8.8; 95 percent CI [confidence interval] =1.4-57.5) than for those who ate a half order or only tasted the ferns (RR=2.2; 95 percent CI=0.2-20.7). No other restaurant food was associated with illness. A stool sample obtained from one patient was negative for bacterial pathogens.

Editorial note: The ostrich fern (_Matteuccia struthiopteris_) was a spring vegetable for American Indians of eastern North America and became part of the regular diet of settlers to New Brunswick in the late 1700s (2). Until recently, it was consumed primarily in the Maritime Provinces of Canada and in the northeastern USA. The ferns are available commercially either canned or frozen, but since the early 1980s, farmers' markets and supermarket chains have sold fresh ferns in season.

None of the fiddlehead ferns of eastern and central North America previously have been reported to be poisonous (3). Although some ferns may be carcinogenic (4), the ostrich fern has been considered to be safe to eat either raw or cooked (5-9). One field guide indicates that wild greens may have laxative qualities and recommends boiling them and discarding the 1st water (8).

In both outbreaks described in this report, the specific cause of illness was undetermined. Although the short incubation period suggests poisoning by a preformed toxin, there was no evidence of common bacterial toxins, such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Bacillus cereus_. Alternatively, the plants could have been contaminated by an undetected viral agent, although this possibility is unlikely because of the apparent short incubation period. Although the ostrich fern accumulates some heavy metals (9), the symptoms reported in these outbreaks were not characteristic of heavy metal poisoning, and it is unlikely that absorption of heavy metals occurred at 2 different sites.

Because of the short incubation period and a lack of other plausible causes, the most likely cause of illness in each of these outbreaks was an unidentified toxin. Heating and boiling may either inactivate or leach the toxin from the plant. Fresh fiddlehead ferns only recently have become widely available in restaurants. In addition, many vegetables now are lightly cooked rather than steamed or boiled (10). In both outbreaks, the implicated ferns were either raw or lightly cooked (sauteed, parboiled, and microwaved). In a similar outbreak in British Columbia in 1990, eating lightly cooked fiddleheads was associated with gastrointestinal illness (P. Morgan, Health Canada, personal communication, 1994). Although a toxin has not been identified in the fiddleheads of the ostrich fern, the findings in this report suggest it may be prudent to cook fiddleheads thoroughly (such as, boiling for 10 minutes) before eating.
