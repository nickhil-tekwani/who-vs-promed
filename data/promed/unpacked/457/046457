A Dane county resident has died after having the 1st human case of St Louis encephalitis in Wisconsin since 1981, health officials said [Fri 2 Nov 2018].

The person died after being hospitalized, said Jennifer Miller, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health Services. The cause of death can't be attributed to St Louis encephalitis because the person -- whose age, gender and identity were not released -- had other health conditions, Miller said.

The illness, similar to West Nile virus, is rare, with only 6 human cases reported in the state since 1964 and no outbreaks ever reported, the health department said.

Like West Nile, St Louis encephalitis is spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is not transmitted person to person, the health department said.

The virus can cause fever, headache, nausea, and fatigue, typically starting 5-15 days after a mosquito bite. In rare cases, it can cause stiff neck, disorientation, tremors, inflammation of the brain, and coma. Older adults and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk.

Like with West Nile, most people infected with St Louis encephalitis don't have any symptoms.

People who believe they may have symptoms should see their doctors. There is no specific treatment for the illness.

Mosquito activity has essentially ended for this year [2018], so there is little to no risk of mosquito-borne illnesses in Wisconsin now, the health department said.

[Although human clinical cases of St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) infection occur across the USA they very rarely occur in the Midwestern states including Wisconsin. The CDC states that although the geographic range of the virus extends from Canada to Argentina, human cases have almost exclusively occurred in the United States. The majority of cases have occurred in eastern and central states, where episodic urban-centered outbreaks have recurred since the 1930s. In the rural west, transmission has followed a more endemic pattern. SLEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. All residents of and visitors to areas where SLEV activity has been identified are at risk of SLEV infection, particularly persons who engage in outdoor work and recreational activities, and those living in low-income areas. Most SLEV infections are silent; clinical infections range in severity from mild nonspecific febrile illnesses to meningitis or encephalitis. The risk of severe disease and fatality increases with age. SLEV infection is thought to confer life-long immunity against re-infection. In temperate areas of the United States, SLEV disease cases occur primarily in the late summer or early fall. In the southern states, where the climate is milder, cases can occur year round.

SLEV is a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus _Flavivirus_. SLEV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virus particles are spherical and have a diameter of 40 nm. - Mod.TY
