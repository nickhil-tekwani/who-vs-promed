_E. coli_ was behind a large-scale food poisoning outbreak that involved about 3000 school students and staff in Japan in 2020 according to a study. The investigation found the 2020 outbreak was caused by red seaweed used in a salad contaminated with _E. coli_ O7:H4. The seaweed had been imported in 2017. _E. coli_ O7:H4 carrying the astA gene for enteroaggregative _E. coli_ heat-stable enterotoxin 1 (EAST1) was detected in fecal specimens from patients and in the red seaweed. Foodborne illness cases from _E. coli_ carrying astA for EAST1 usually show relatively mild symptoms, according to the study published in the journal Epidemiology and Infection.

In late June 2020, elementary and junior high school students in Yashio, Saitama, came down with gastroenteritis symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients were in all 15 public elementary and junior high schools in Yashio and the Yashio Board of Education jurisdiction. A school lunch from a private meal supplier was the common foodstuff eaten by all patients. As many as 6732 students, teachers and other staff had consumed the school lunch, and 2958 of them fell sick. The major symptoms were diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever.

An investigation involved collection of fecal specimens from 19 patients in 8 of 15 schools and the Yashio Board of Education who were not receiving antimicrobials. Also, 27 food samples from lunch, served on 24, 25 and 26 Jun 2020, stored by meal type at the Yashio Board of Education and the private school meal supplier's facility, and 9 fecal specimens from food preparation staff were taken. Four swab samples of the kitchen facilities were collected.

Direct examination of culture plates from 18 of 19 patients' samples and 5 of 9 food workers' samples showed growth of lactose-fermenting colonies that appeared to be _E. coli_. Colonies were confirmed for the presence of virulence-associated genes for diarrheagenic _E. coli_. Fourteen isolates from 14 patients were identified as _E. coli_ O7:H4. The 27 stored food samples and 4 swab samples were tested for _E. coli_ O7:H4 carrying astA, and it was detected in 2 seaweed salad samples served on 26 Jun 2020.

The seaweed salad was made from 6 kinds of seaweed rehydrated with water and boiled vegetables with dressing. Coliforms were found in the red seaweed by the manufacturer during self-inspection. _E. coli_ carrying astA was then detected in the red seaweed, which had been imported in 2017. Coliforms were not detected during an import inspection or when it was sold to the manufacturer. No other complaints about the same lot of seaweed have been reported. So, the source of the _E. coli_ contamination of red seaweed could not be identified.

Researchers said it was the 1st report of large-scale food poisoning caused by _E. coli_ O7:H4. "Since this particular outbreak was attributed to seaweed, it is recommended that marine products be carefully monitored for contamination."

[There are 6 pathotypes of _E. coli_ that cause enteric illness in humans: enterohemorrhagic (EHEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), and diffusely adherent _E. coli_ (DAEC). Only EHEC is a zoonosis. The large serotype O104:H4 outbreak centered in northern Germany was a chimeric organism having features of both EHEC and EAEC and is not a zoonosis either. Each organism has different pathogenic mechanisms.

Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ were initially described in 1987 as an isolate from a Peruvian child with diarrhea and subsequently have been associated with acute and chronic diarrhea in children throughout the world and as a significant cause of traveler's diarrhea, and they are more likely to be resistant to antimicrobials as compared to enterotoxigenic _E. coli_. These are primarily human pathogens rather than zoonotic as EHEC strains are.

The EAEC strains appear to be pathogenic via their ability to aggregate intimately with each other and to cells. One of the characteristics of EAEC is the ability to form "stacked-brick" formation when cultured with HEp-2 cells primarily mediated through the AggR gene. EAEC strains do not have characteristic O antigens as EHEC strains do.
