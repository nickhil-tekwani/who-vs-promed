--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.7 and 501.V2, which were first detected in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, are spreading rapidly in the human population. Thus, there is an increased need for genomic and epidemiological surveillance in order to detect the strains and estimate their abundances. Here, we report a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from 3 wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland between [9 Jul 2020] and [21 Dec 2020]. We find evidence for the presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the samples, including co-occurrences of up to 3 B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same amplicon in 4 samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated [9-21 Dec 2020]. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid-December [2020], 2 weeks before its 1st verification in a patient sample from Switzerland. We conclude that sequencing SARS-CoV-2 in community wastewater samples may help detect and monitor the circulation of diverse lineages.

[SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in stool samples as demonstrated in a number of papers, including the following:

Abstract [abridged]
-------------------
"In this study, we aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the excreta of COVID-19 patients. Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory, and radiological findings of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool, and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and its correlation analyzed with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, and this was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness. Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in the feces after the pharyngeal swabs turned negative. The duration of viral shedding from the feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6-10) days, regardless of COVID-19 severity. The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did not differ between patients who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces. Viral RNA was not detectable in urine specimens from 10 patients. Our results demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of COVID-19 patients and suggested the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route."

Because SARS-CoV-2 is shed in excrement, it is a natural follow-up to conduct population level surveillance for the virus/viral RNA by testing waste water. This has been successfully accomplished with SARS-CoV-2, as published by a number of investigators, including a discussion in the following paper:

Larsen DA, Wigginton KR. Tracking COVID-19 with wastewater. Nat Biotechnol. 2020 Oct; 38(10): 1151-1153. doi: 10.1038/s41587-020-0690-1. PMID: 32958959; PMCID: PMC7505213; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0690-1.

This is not a new technique. "The major viral pathogens [found] in wastewater are enteric viruses such as hepatitis A, norovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and the various enteroviruses" as one would expect (Ashbolt, 2004, Cai and Zhang, 2013)" because of their propensity to replicate in the gut.

One can take advantage of this excretion of the virus and use it as an early warning that virus is circulating in a population, possibly before an outbreak is recognized. This practice should be implemented immediately in areas where virus spread presents a risk. - Mod.LK]

On [2 Jan 2021], a nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to a local laboratory for testing of SARS-CoV-2 from an adult-aged individual who had recently arrived in Alberta, Canada from South Africa several days prior. The individual was tested due to development of symptoms 9 days after arrival in Canada and while undergoing a 14-day quarantine due to current Government of Canada regulations [1].

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the Aptima(R) SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Panther(R) System) (Hologic, Marlborough, USA). Sanger sequencing confirmed presence of the S:N501Y, S:D80A, S:A710V, and S:K417N mutations. This provided a high probability of this isolate's genome to be that of the 20C/501Y.V2 (lineage B.1.351), first reported from Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa [2, 3]. This is the 1st case of the 20C/501Y.V2 SARS-CoV-2 variant reported in Canada. At the time of writing, the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant has been detected in Australia, Austria, Finland, France, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Zambia [4].

At the time of diagnosis and detection, the patient was experiencing mild symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection and isolating at home with family contacts. Contact tracing by local public health authorities identified all primary contacts who have been advised to isolate for a minimum of 14 days from the time of last contact with the identified case. Instructions to contact public health should they become symptomatic were provided.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Jamil N Kanji and colleagues for sharing this timely case report. According to the WHO weekly epidemiologic update ([4A] below), as of the time of preparation of the distribution map earlier today (Figure 4. Countries, territories, and areas reporting SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant as of 12 Jan 2021), Canada was still listed as "under verification". With Dr Kanji and colleagues' report, Canada has now confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant in a traveler in Alberta. This virus and its variants are definitely global travelers, sneaking into countries through pre-symptomatic (and likely asymptomatic individuals.

Abstract
--------
Finding medications or vaccines that may decrease the infectious period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could potentially reduce transmission in the broader population. We developed a computational model of the US simulating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential clinical and economic impact of reducing the infectious period duration. Simulation experiments found that reducing the average infectious period duration could avert a median of 442 852 [treating 25% of symptomatic cases, reducing by 0.5 days, reproductive number (R0) 3.5, and starting treatment when 15% of the population has been exposed] to 44.4 million SARS-CoV-2 cases (treating 75% of all infected cases, reducing by 3.5 days, R0 2.0). With R0 2.5, reducing the average infectious period duration by 0.5 days for 25% of symptomatic cases averted 1.4 million cases and 99 398 hospitalizations; increasing to 75% of symptomatic cases averted 2.8 million cases. At [USD] 500/person, treating 25% of symptomatic cases saved [USD] 209.5 billion (societal perspective). Further reducing the average infectious period duration by 3.5 days averted 7.4 million cases (treating 25% of symptomatic cases). Expanding treatment to 75% of all infected cases, including asymptomatic infections (R0 2.5), averted 35.9 million cases and 4 million hospitalizations, saving [USD] 48.8 billion (societal perspective and starting treatment after 5% of the population has been exposed).

Our study suggests that finding ways to reduce the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 could help decrease its spread and impact.

An interesting study making a strong case for continued research on how to reduce the infectivity period. The authors framed their hypothesis as, "A question then is what might be the broader population effects and impact of reducing the length of time that a person may shed the virus.[3]" (and stated), "Therefore, we developed a computational model simulating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential clinical and economic impact of reducing the average infectious period duration."

Recognizing the amount of asymptomatic spread as well, the authors made projections based on treating only symptomatic cases vs treating all infected individuals. The results were impressive when they used the cost of treatment as USD 500/person, more so when using USD 2500/person. What they do not calculate is the cost to identify all infections, or 25%, or 75% of all infections.

In the discussion, the authors mention: "Findings from our study show when medication or vaccination reduces the duration of the infectious period by at least 0.5 days, even treating 25% of symptomatic cases leads to a reduction in cases and cost savings from the societal perspective, but does not substantially affect hospital resource use (such as ICU admissions, ventilated bed days) and is not cost-effective from the 3rd party payer perspective (USD 500 per person treatment cost). However, treating 75% of symptomatic cases is cost-effective or cost savings from both the 3rd-party payer and societal perspectives. When a treatment reduces the infectious period by 2 days or more, providing the treatment to even 25% of symptomatic cases reduces hospital resource use and generates cost savings from the 3rd-party payer and societal perspectives when treatment costs USD 500. Assuming that the virus' inherent contagiousness and the number of daily social contacts remains the same, less time to transmit the virus would mean fewer new cases generated. This also could affect the herd immunity threshold: the proportion of a population that needs to be immune to the virus so that it can no longer spread. The herd immunity threshold is directly related to the number of new cases generated by each infected person, as seen by the following equation: 1-(1/R0). As the pandemic progresses and more people recover from infection and become immune, it becomes more difficult for infectious individuals to encounter susceptible people. Similarly, decreasing the infectious period gives people who are infectious even less time to encounter and transmit the virus to those susceptible. This window to encounter susceptible people decreases more and more as the infectious period duration is further reduced."

An interesting analysis and modeling. - Mod.MPP]

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [10 Jan 2021], 10 am CET

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
Following 2 weeks of low reporting, likely due to the year-end holiday period, the overall upward trend seen in earlier weeks has resumed, with just under 5 million new cases reported last week globally. The number of new deaths has also shown a similar trend, with over 85 000 reported last week, an 11% increase (Figure 1, Table 1). All regions apart from South-East Asia showed an increase in new cases, with the Western Pacific, Africa and the Americas reporting increases of over 30%. The Region of the Americas accounted for 51% of all new cases and 45% of all new deaths globally in the past week. The European Region had a lower increase in new cases (10%), however still accounts for over a 3rd of new cases globally. In South-East Asia, the decline in new cases and new deaths seen since the end of November 2020 continues. Although the Eastern Mediterranean Region is showing an 11% increase in new cases, new deaths have fallen by 9%, continuing a downward trend since a peak in mid-November [2020]. The African Region reported 175 000 new cases and 4300 new deaths, an increase of over 30% in new cases and new deaths, far exceeding previous peaks in July 2020. The Western Pacific also reported an increase of more than 30% in new cases, while the number of new deaths also rose by 14%.

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (with 1 786 773 cases, a 35% increase), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (417 620 cases, a 22% increase), Brazil (313 130 cases, a 24% increase), the Russian Federation (165 167 cases, continuing last week's decrease with a 12% decrease), and Germany (142 861 cases, reversing last week's decrease with a 15% increase).

Please note: New cases and deaths will be reported per 100 000 population instead of per 1 million population, starting from this report.

SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
------------------------------
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has received several reports of public health events associated with variants of SARS-CoV-2. When considered to potentially have different epidemiological, immunological, or pathogenic properties, variants are reported to WHO and raised for further investigation by national authorities. Further background on variants of concern (VOC) is available in Disease Outbreak News and the Weekly Epidemiological Update published [5 Jan 2021]. In collaboration with local authorities, institutions, and researchers, WHO routinely assesses if variants of SARS-CoV-2 result in changes in transmissibility, clinical presentation, and severity, or if they may impact on countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. While investigations are ongoing, in the following update, we highlight the geographical extent of 2 variants - VOC 202012/01 (initially identified in the United Kingdom) and 501Y.V2 (initially identified in South Africa) -- reported by countries, territories, and areas as of [12 Jan 2021], as well as highlight recent reports of other new variants of potential concern.

Since first detected on [14 Dec 2020], VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 50 countries, territories, and areas across 5 of the 6 WHO regions to date (Figure 3). In England, the variant has been detected in all regions and almost all local authorities. Here, investigations are using a proxy S gene target failure (SGTF) to indicate carriage of the VOC, as only a small proportion of these variants is detected using whole genome sequencing, which lags approximately 2 weeks behind the initial test date. Results show that the age and sex distribution of VOC 202012/01, as determined by SGTF, is similar that of other variants in circulation over the same period. Analyses using contact tracing data showed higher transmissibility (secondary attack rates) where the index case has the variant strain, from around 11% to 15% of named contacts.

Since first reported on [18 Dec 2020], variant 501Y.V2 has been detected in 20 countries, territories, and areas across 4 of the 6 WHO regions (Figure 4). From preliminary and ongoing investigations in South Africa, it is possible that the 501Y.V2 variant is more transmissible than variants circulating in South Africa previously. Moreover, while this new variant does not appear to cause more severe illness, the observed rapid increases in case numbers has placed health systems under pressure.

On [9 Jan 2021], Japan notified WHO of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant within lineage B.1.1.28 (initially reported as B.1.1.248) detected in 4 travelers arriving from Brazil. This variant has 12 mutations to the spike protein, including 3 mutations of concern in common with VOC 202012/01 and 501Y.V2, that is, K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, which may impact transmissibility and host immune response. Researchers in Brazil have additionally reported the emergence of a similar variant also with [an] E484K mutation, which has likely evolved independently of the variant detected among Japanese travelers. The extent and public health significance of these new variants require further investigation.

It is well known that viruses constantly change through mutation, and so the emergence of new variants is an expected occurrence. Many mutations have no impact on the virus itself while some could be detrimental to the virus and few may result in an advantage to the virus. These variants of concern identified in different countries highlight the importance of increasing diagnostic capacity and systematic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 where capacity allows, as well as the timely sharing of sequence data internationally.

Systematic sequencing should be considered for a subset of incoming travellers, as well as community-based samples to ascertain the existence and extent of local transmission. The geographical extent of both VOC 202012/01 and 501Y.V2 reported above is likely underestimated given a bias toward countries/territories/areas detecting the variants with sequencing capacity, and where surveillance systems have been adapted to detect these new variants. Irrespective of sequencing capacity in countries, surveillance through established systems and regular epidemiology analyses should continue to inform adjustments to public health and social measures. Research is ongoing to determine the impact of new variants on transmission, disease severity as well as any potential impacts on vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. These efforts will require coordination of research between WHO, partners and groups of international scientists (WHO Virus Evolution Working Group).

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (225 028), Brazil (61 804), and the UK (45 533), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 17 116 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (11-12 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, Spain (25 438), Russia (22 934), France (19 752), Sweden (17 395), Germany (16 373), India (15 903), Mexico (14 395), Italy (14 242), Colombia (14 179), Argentina (13 783), South Africa (13 105), and Indonesia (10 047). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (down from 57 countries on Friday 8 Jan 2021); 24 of the 53 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 15 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 14.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 19.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show an 11.8% increase in daily reported cases and a 25.9% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Even with some residual weekend artifact related to decreased reporting of newly confirmed cases and deaths in a number of countries, there are still close to 700 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, and comparative 7-day averages demonstrate continued growth of the pandemic in terms of reported cases and deaths, especially in Brazil and the USA. The global cumulative reported cases are over 92.0 million with now over 1.97 million reported deaths. As mentioned previously, the elevated comparative 7-day averages are probably indicative of the Christmas and New Year's holiday travel and gatherings. - Mod.MPP]
