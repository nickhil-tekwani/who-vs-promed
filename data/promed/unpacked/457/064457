Health authorities in Western Australia (WA) have issued a warning about an
outbreak of rabies in Bali. The Indonesian government has confirmed the
presence of the disease in the Kuta area, and local media are reporting
that several Balinese people showing rabies symptoms have died after being
bitten by dogs. Bali had previously been considered rabies-free, but 2 dogs
have been confirmed as having the disease.

Paul Van Buynder from the WA Health Department says the symptoms can take
up to 8 weeks to develop and include headaches, fevers, tingling and
confusion. "Cases that develop clinical symptoms almost invariably die," he
said. He says anyone bitten or scratched by a dog, monkey or cat in Bali
since August [2008] should see their doctor.

Dr Van Buynder says those who are planning to travel to the island should
avoid direct contact with animals [while on the island].
