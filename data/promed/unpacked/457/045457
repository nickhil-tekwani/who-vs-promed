Over the past week, 13 new cases of bird flu have
been detected in Afghanistan, bringing the number
of confirmed cases in the country to 17 for this
year [2007], health officials said.
Assadullah Azhari, a spokesman for the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
in Kabul, reported that 9 dead birds were
diagnosed with the virulent H5N1 strain [of avian
influenza] in 5 districts of [eastern] Nangarhar
and Kunar provinces. According to FAO, which has
set up a bird flu diagnostic laboratory in Kabul,
4 other cases were identified in backyard poultry in the capital [Kabul].
Prior to this, 4 cases of the H5N1 strain of the
virus were reported on 24 February [2007] in [the
same] Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, which border Pakistan.
Afghanistan's 1st bird flu case was reported in
March 2006. The Afghan government has banned the
importation of poultry products from neighbouring
Pakistan and other countries where avian influenza has been confirmed.
In an effort to reduce the risks of the virus,
authorities have launched a massive poultry
vaccination campaign in the capital and in the 2
provinces where the infectious disease has been confirmed.
Dr Azizullah Usmani, director of Afghanistan's
Department of Animal Health and Production, told
IRIN on Sunday [11 Mar 2007], that vaccination
and culling in many poultry farms were complete
and that a similar process in households
[backyard poultry] had already started. However,
the Afghan government has run out of funds to
curb the spread of the deadly virus that has
killed 168 people globally. "We had US $64 000 in
the government's avian influenza account, almost
all of which has already been spent", said
Usmani, adding that the government had applied to
the World Bank for US $1 million in assistance.
The World Bank and the Avian & Human Influenza
Trust Fund (the World Bank's [agency] to curb the
spread of bird flu) have jointly pledged US $13
million to assist Afghanistan in its fight
against avian influenza over the coming 3 years.
In Kabul, children were seen playing near the
infected poultry. Although the youths appear
healthy and do not show symptoms of the disease,
samples of their blood have been sent for medical tests.
Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health says
there has not been a human case of avian
influenza in the country to date. More than half
of Afghanistan's estimated 25 million inhabitants
live below the poverty line, which means less
than US $2 a day. Specialists say they are more
vulnerable to a possible outbreak of the avian
influenza because chickens and eggs play a
crucial economic role among poor rural families
who keep scores of backyard flocks unregistered.

[The report of 13 new cases from Afghanistan
contained in this report indicates that cases are
accumulating at a somewhat serious rate, although
they remain geographically confined to the provinces reported previously.
I am including the final OIE posting on the
outbreak situation in Djibouti along with a
request for information. I am doing this because
of a subscriber's request for more information
about the outbreak, which began on 27 May 2006.
There was only a single OIE report on the
outbreak in birds and then this final report. The
outbreak in humans was circumscribed with one
human case and no deaths, as was mentioned by
Mod.CP in the posting on human infection in Egypt referenced below.
The subscriber's comments prompted me to put out
a fresh request for information to answer the following questions:
Why were so few people and chickens or other birds involved in the outbreak?
Why wasn't there more spread?
How was it introduced into Djibouti? and
Which control measures were most effective?
I know answers to these questions may be hard to
come by but any information would be so very useful. - Mod.PC]
