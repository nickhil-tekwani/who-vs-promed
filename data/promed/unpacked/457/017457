[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map is available at http://healthmap.org/r/7eKT. The location of the outbreak, on the southern border of Karachay-Cherkess (a Russian republic in the Caucasus region), is indicated on the map appended to the OIE report at the source URL above. A detailed map of the Caucasus region, showing the 2 territories bordering Karachay-Cherkess on the south -- namely Abkhazia and Georgia -- is available at http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/waroutcomes/pics/ethnicMap.jpg.

Information on the genotype involved and the vaccine strain to be applied "in response to the outbreak", would be appreciated. Has this outbreak been caused by the same FMDV-A strain (topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97) which caused, earlier this year (2013), 4 outbreaks in Russia's Zabaykalsky kray, on Russia's border with China, thousands of kilometers north east to the current outbreak? That strain was found, by genotyping carried out at the World Reference laboratory for FMD (Pirbright), to be identical to the FMDV-A strain circulating in China (so far, reported from 5 provinces scattered throughout China). The same virus strain is also suspected in eastern Kazakhstan; however, official confirmation has, so far, not become available from the Kazakh authorities.

In case the new Russian outbreak, on Georgia's border, is caused by the new Chinese serotype A strain, this development may be seen as of concern for the Near East and beyond. - Mod.AS]
