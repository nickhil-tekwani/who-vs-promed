'It has been reported that anthrax [bacteria] have infected residents
of Tenrigangkae village, Mandai township, Maros regency in South
Sulawesi. In Makassar, South Sulawesi, (30 Mar 2010), the local
official for South Sulawesi, Devi Santy Erawati has reported that 4
people and one head of household rapidly became ill following
consumption of beef confirmed to be contaminated with anthrax.

According to this report, 3 of the people who were involved with the
slaughter of the cow on [19 Mar 2010] subsequently died, with signs
of skin peeling and hand wounds. One pregnant woman had diarrheal
symptoms and the other head of household has severe itching symptoms.
"The people there have been notified that the beef that was eaten was
in fact positive for anthrax. This has been confirmed by tests by the
Maros veterinary lab which tested offal from the cow which was
consumed," said Mrs Devi

Another local official reported that [the owner of the cow] was
apparently surprised to have received a letter from the Maros
veterinary laboratory notifying him of the positive anthrax findings
on the offal samples from his cow. A fax was simultaneously sent to
the Maros Department of Health and Provincial Health Department.

"[The owner] brought the offal for testing to the lab, after he
slaughtered the cow, as he also experienced intense itching on his
hands and became suspicious," Devi had reported this to the public
when she was in the middle of a public awareness programme in the
local elections.

Cows in Tenrigangkae village are bought by people from surrounding
villages like the case from Moncongloe in February 2010. This village
had become known as a village where anthrax infection had occurred.
About 2 weeks after a cow was bought here, veterinary dept officials
had tested a cow and also found it positive for anthrax.

The local residents reported that health department officials would
carry out further examinations on animals next Wednesday [?31 Mar
2010] in their area and throughout Tenrigangkae.

[We are very grateful for Dr Agranoff's help in this. In subsequent
discussion he commented that: "Actually there's a lot of anthrax
reported locally in Indonesia and human fatalities despite veterinary
and health department follow up and education. People can't get
themselves to actually throw meat away, however risky it might look."
A universal failing I fear.

The good news is that it (the ongoing human cases) is just one
dimension of the surveillance for this disease in Indonesia, but it
indicates that the existing control procedures are not cost
effective. We should not have to depend on human deaths. - Mod.MHJ]
