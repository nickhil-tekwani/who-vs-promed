A week after the meat industry called for a ban on downer cows in the
nation's food supply, the U.S. Agriculture Department has not agreed
to change a policy that allows some sick or injured cows to end up on
dinner tables.

Downers -- animals too sick or hurt to stand for slaughter -- are
generally prohibited from the food supply, but current rules allow
for exceptions. Meat producers fought to preserve those exceptions
until last week, when a coalition of major industry groups reversed
their position and joined animal advocates and several lawmakers in
calling for an absolute ban.

But Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer, who defended the current policy
during congressional hearings into the Chino meat recall, has
remained silent.

Industry officials said delays are to be expected with any federal
rule change and said they've called upon the nation's meat plants to
implement a voluntary moratorium on slaughtering downers until a new
policy can be enacted. Downers are considered more likely to have mad
cow disease and other illnesses and, therefore, pose a greater threat
to people who eat them. The Agriculture Department 1st began
outlawing downer cows from food destined for human consumption in
2004, after a cow in Washington State tested positive for mad cow
disease. But cows that pass an initial inspection before they go down
may still be killed and sold for food if they are approved for
slaughter by a veterinary inspector.

The Humane Society and other groups described the exception as a
loophole that meat producers can exploit to boost their profit,
though it is unclear how many downers are slaughtered each year.

Federal meat inspection practices have since come under fire,
particularly in Washington where lawmakers have held a dozen
congressional hearings, often focusing on the allowance of downers in
the food supply. Beyond the investigation of what happened at
Westland/Hallmark -- which could have criminal repercussions -- the
Office of Inspector General is conducting a separate audit of meat
plants to determine whether the Chino case was isolated or part of
larger national problem.

Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Ca., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro,
D-Conn., have introduced bills, in the Senate and House respectively,
that would create a strict downer ban. But Schafer and industry
officials resisted, testifying that the rules in place, if followed,
are sufficient to protect public health.

Then last week the industry agreed to a downer ban, pointing to
concerns over consumer confidence and strained international trade
relations. The American Meat Institute, The National Meat Association
and The National Milk Producers Federation, which together represent
most of the nation's meat producers, filed a petition seeking an
absolute ban prohibiting any downers from entering the food supply.

Animal-rights groups, lawmakers and California meat producers all
hailed the move.

But the Agriculture Department has not responded to the petition,
American Meat Institute general counsel Mark Dopp said Tuesday [29
Apr 2008]. He described the proposed ban as a straightforward rule
change and said he hopes the department would act soon but cautioned
that the formal process can be time consuming. "The fact that
everybody agrees it ought to be done doesn't mean they gave the
authority to skip a few steps in the process," Dopp said. Meat
industry officials discussed the ban with individual meat plant
owners before changing their position and found that most plants had
already stopped slaughtering downers, Dopp said.

The current system that guarantees the safety of food in the United
States is in a state of crisis, a new report finds. Gaps in the food
safety system include out-of-date laws, poor use of resources, and
inconsistencies among agencies protecting food safety, according to
the report Fixing Food Safety: Protecting America's Food From
Farm-to-Fork, released Wednesday [30 Apr 2008] by Trust for America's
Health.

"One in 4 Americans are sickened by food-borne illness each year;
that's 76 million people," Jeffrey Levi, executive director of Trust
for America's Health, said during a morning teleconference Wednesday
[30 Apr 2008].

"That number is far too high, and major gaps in our nation's food
safety system are to blame. The major problem with the current food
safety system is that no one person is in charge," Levi said.
"Instead, there are a total of 15 federal agencies that play a role
in administering some 30 laws related to food safety." The whole
system needs to change from one that responds to threats as they
happen to a more preventive system that tackles challenges before
they arise, Levi said. At the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food safety is on the back
burner, he added.

According to the report, the U.S. food safety system has not been
changed in more than 100 years. Most of the funds spent on food
safety are spent on outdated practices of inspecting poultry, beef
and pork carcasses, even though changing agricultural practices make
this a waste of government money.

Levi noted that ... the federal government has devoted very limited
resources to the problem, despite a presidential directive and recent
serious outbreaks of food-borne illnesses. Not enough money is spent
on fighting bacterial threats such as salmonella and _E. coli_. About
85 percent of food-borne illness outbreaks occur among foods
regulated by the FDA. Yet, the agency gets less than half of all
federal funding for food safety, Levi noted. In the past 3 years, the
FDA has cut back its food safety program by cutting its science staff
by 20 percent and losing 600 food safety inspectors, according to the
report.

However, on Wednesday [30 Apr 2008], the FDA announced that over the
next few months, it will be hiring 1300 biologists, chemists, medical
officers, mathematical statisticians [sic] and investigators.
However, how many of these new positions will be devoted to food
safety isn't clear, Levi said.

The report also criticized the number of federal agencies involved in
food safety. For example, the FDA regulates frozen pizza, unless
there is meat on it, in which case, it is regulated by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. Moreover, only one percent of imported
food is inspected, even though about 60 percent of fresh fruits and
vegetables and 75 percent of seafood [are] imported.
