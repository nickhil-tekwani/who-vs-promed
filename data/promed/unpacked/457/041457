Blight-resistant potato variety tested in Russia
-----------------------------------------------------
WARSAW, Poland -- Russia is teetering on the brink of a large-scale potato
crisis ignited by the same virulent fungal pathogen, _Phytophthora
infestans_ (more commonly called late blight), that was responsible for the
19th century Irish potato famine. But [a new, blight-resistant potato
variety, New York 121, [developed by Cornell University scientists [has
been provided to Russia for testing in the hopes of preventing food
shortages. Currently, Cornell's CEEM [Cornell-Eastern Europe-Mexico
program is the only non-Russian group actively trying to resolve the
Russian potato problems.
Annually, Russia loses 4 million tons of potato, more than 10 percent of
total production, due to late blight. Virulent strains of the pathogen are
now spreading to important potato-producing areas in Russia and to Central
and Eastern Europe. The late blight threat is very important and even
critical in some regions, said Alexei V. Filippov, of the All Russian
Institute of Phytopathology, addressing a group of 58 international
agricultural researchers from 12 countries at the Collaborative Research on
Potato Late Blight workshop in Poland last week. The workshop was co-hosted
by the CEEM International Collaborative Program on Potato Late Blight
Control and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Foreign Agriculture Service
(USDA-FAS).
"In Central and Eastern Europe, late blight is a very serious disease,
often causing considerable losses in the field and storage," said Filippov.
Potatoes account for more than 3.2 million hectares (about 7 million acres)
of Russian farmland. Russia is the world's second largest producer of
potatoes, behind China, holding about 7 percent of the global market.
Domestically, it is the number 2 crop behind wheat and it is considered
Russia's "second bread."
To see if the Cornell-bred New York 121 potato, as well as other varieties
of blight-resistant potatoes, can withstand the rigors of small Russian
farms, Patrick Russo, a CEEM technical adviser who is a researcher at the
University of Helsinki, Finland, and Russian scientists, have made plans to
test these new potato cultivars in St. Petersburg and Moscow. This testing
will prepare the seed for Russian registration and distribution.
Registration would allow the seed to be sold as "certified" to the millions
of small "kitchen gardeners" in Russia who depend on their own production
of potatoes on plots of less than one-third of an acre.
[According to Cornell Emeritus Professor Robert Plaisted, who developed New
York 121, it is a small white potato that resists late blight as well as
other pests such as golden nematode, scab and potato [potyvirus Y (PVY).
[Development of late blight resistance in potato is very difficult and he
said that the resistance of New York 121 to these pathogens is a rare
combination.
Conference participants endorsed the idea of implementing a collaborative
project involving CEEM, USDA-FAS and local institutions in Central and
Eastern Europe to conduct on-farm integrated late blight disease management
trials with emphasis on testing and making promising blight-resistant
potato varieties available in the region.

[This is a follow-up on an earlier piece posted on 30 April 2001. The CEEM
project is an impressive attempt at bringing late blight resistance to
Russian potato farmers. The full report can be obtained at the Agnet website:
