Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Senegal
----------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] Wed 3 Jun 2020 from Dr. Mbargou Lo, Director of Veterinary Services, Directorate of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Livestock and Animal Production, Dakar, Senegal

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 30 Mar 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 26 May 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: RHDV2
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Thies, Thies
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Mar 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 381 / 250 / 142 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Domestic rabbits were affected in rabbit farms.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rabbits / 65.62 / 37.27 / 56.80 / 37.27
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comment: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (serotype RHDV2) has occurred for the 1st time in Senegal. Flemish giant rabbits, checkered giant rabbits, and fauve de Bourgogne rabbits were affected. Clinical signs reported in the farms were fever, anorexia, conjunctivitis, epistaxis, groaning, and sudden death. Investigations are ongoing to identify the origin of the disease through molecular biology.

Control measures
Measures applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Laboratory for Livestock and Veterinary Research (LNERV), Dakar (national laboratory) / Rabbits / Real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 26 May 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and fatal hepatitis of wild and domestic European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). RHD is caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_, family _Caliciviridae_), a nonenveloped small round RNA virus with only one major capsid protein (VP60).

Genetic and antigenic comparison and epidemiological data indicate the existence of 3 main RHDV groups:
- The "classical RHDV", including genogroups G1-G5, first reported in China (People's Rep. of) in 1984. To date, this RHDV has been reported in over 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Americas, Europe and Oceania and is endemic in most parts of the world where European rabbits live naturally or are domesticated.
- The subtype RHDVa/G6 identified in Europe on 1996 and currently reported in other continents (Oceania, Asia and Americas).
- The "new" RHDV (provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb) emerged in France in 2010 in wild and farmed vaccinated rabbits, and rapidly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean basin (Malta and Tunisia), and also in Australia in 2015. According to Le Gall-Recule et al. (2013), RHDV2 did not derive from classical RHDV, but rather it originated as a 2nd emergence of unknown origin. Antigenic and disease protection data led to it being classified RHDV2 as a 2nd RHDV serotype.

The disease caused by RHDV2 has typical features: The mortality rate is lower but highly variable (5%-70%) with an average mortality of 20% in experimentally infected rabbits; death occurs in lactating rabbits from 15 days of age onward, and the course of the diseases is usually longer (3-5 days), with a higher proportion of rabbits showing subacute-chronic disease. In addition, RHDV2 is able to cause an RHD-like disease in 2 hare species: Cape hare (_Lepus capensis_ var. _mediterraneus_) and Italian hare (_Lepus corsicanus_).

There is no indication that RHDV infects humans. (Source: Spickler, AR. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease. 2016. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf). - Mod.CRD
