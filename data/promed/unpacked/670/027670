Suspected birdflu patient dies
------------------------------
A suspected birdflu patient of Bintaro, Tangerang, Banten, known by
her initials as Su (24) died on Tuesday [16 Dec 2008]. Su's aunt said
before she died her niece was intensively treated at Sari Asih
hospital in Ciledug, Tangerang.

She said Su initially had breathing problems, cough and a high fever
and as her condition worsened her family then took her to the nearest
hospital. "However she finally died after being treated in the
hospital for 3 days," she said. Su's body was taken to Punggelan in
Banjarnegara, Central Java, for burial.

The head of the Tangerang health service, Hari Heryanto, said his
office could not as yet confirm if the cause of Su's death was
birdflu virus. "Her blood sample is still being examined and the
result of laboratory tests is needed to confirm if the cause is
really the [avian influenza] virus," he said.

The district of Tangerang which is located west of capital city
Jakarta has been known as an endemic area and has recorded the
highest number of bird flu cases so far, totalling 17 that led to 15 deaths.

[If confirmed this case would become the 140th human case of H5N1
avian influenza in Indonesia, and the 114th fatality. Thus 13 percent
of all cases of avian influenza would have occurred in the district
of Tangerang, with a mortality of 89 percent, compared with a
mortality of 81 percent for the rest of Indonesia.
