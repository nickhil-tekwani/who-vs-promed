The Epidemiological Surveillance Department of Roraima confirmed in a statement sent to the press on Tue 2 Jun 2015 the 1st case of Zika virus in the state.

Samples were taken on 19 May [2015] from a 22 year old man, when he was admitted to the General Hospital of Roraima (HGR) with fever, red spots on the skin, diarrhea and headache.

The diagnosis was confirmed after the result of the laboratory examination by the Instituto Evandro Chagas. The suspicion of the State Department of Health (Sesau; Secretaria de Estado da Saude) is that the man was infected during a trip to Bahia, where he spent 10 days [and returned when to Roraima? - Mod.RNA].

The Sesau reported that the patient lives in Boa Vista, Pricuma neighborhood, in the West Zone. He sought the hospital as soon as he noticed the 1st symptoms [when? - Mod.RNA]. He was attended and released the same day after being treated and had examinations for laboratory analysis.

According to the secretariat, all health surveillance measures were adopted as a means of control and monitoring. The epidemiological surveillance department is monitoring municipal actions to strengthen prevention and control, if necessary. So far, this is the only reported case of fever confirmed as Zika virus in the state.
