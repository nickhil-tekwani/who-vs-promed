The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is on [23 Aug 2014] investigating a fatal case of infection by _Streptococcus suis_, a kind of bacterium isolated from pigs, affecting a 57-year-old man. The patient, with underlying illness, had developed fever, chills, diarrhea, and generalized weakness since [19 Aug 2014]. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital (TKOH) on [20 Aug 2014] and was directly admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. The patient passed away subsequently on the same day. The clinical diagnosis is septic shock with multi-organ failure. His blood culture collected on [20 Aug 2014] grew _Streptococcus suis_.

Initial investigation by CHP revealed that the patient had no history of consumption or contact with raw or undercooked pork. He had no recent travel history and his home contacts remain asymptomatic.

A CHP spokesman explained that _Streptococcus suis_ infection may present as meningitis (inflammation of the membrane enclosing the brain), septicemia (bloodstream infection), and less commonly endocarditis (inflammation of the inner lining of the heart chambers), arthritis, and bronchopneumonia (a kind of lung infection involving the bronchioles). _Streptococcus suis_ infection can be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

[The 2005 Chinese outbreak of _S. suis_ which essentially began the modern era of _S. suis_ was atypical because most previous cases had been sporadic, not in an outbreak, and cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) occurred.

The outbreak was summarized in Yu H, Jing H, Chen Z, et al: Emerg Infect Dis 2006;12: 914-20 http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no06/05-1194.htm. Part of the discussion (with citations removed) is found below:

"Beginning mid-June 2005, a major outbreak of _S. suis_ killed 647 pigs in almost the same areas as the outbreak in humans. The outbreak in swine peaked around 20 Jul 2005 with about 4 dead pigs in each affected village. _S. suis_ caused 98 percent of the deaths of these pigs in Sichuan during this period. All infected pigs came from backyard farms, usually with one sick pig in the herd. A pathogenic strain could have spread by distributing infected piglets to the backyard pig farms and then propagated among healthy pigs. The single ribotype identified in the investigation lends support to this theory.

The main risk factor for _S. suis_ infection in the outbreak was direct involvement in slaughtering sick pigs and preparing carcasses of pigs that died of unknown causes. Unlike professionals in modern abattoirs, the local farmers did not wear protective gear or gloves. Normally one or 2 persons carried out the procedure, which involved bloodletting though a neck artery, manually inflating the carcasses, scalding the pigskin with about 80 deg. C water, and splitting and shaving the skin with large knives. Scalding and shaving were often performed together. The farmers then sliced the meat into smaller pieces before cooking for food. The complete process of slaughtering could take more than one hour. Our study demonstrated that all patients had been infected during direct contact with blood or tissues of sick or dead pigs. Often, this may have occurred through direct exposure of skin wounds. Droplet exposure may also have occurred during slaughter or processing of carcasses, but we could not document this occurrence. The observed risk factors were consistent with those reported in other studies. No evidence of infection from eating cooked pork from these pigs was observed. The uncooked meat was shared with neighboring families, but these villagers normally do not eat raw meat or raw animal viscera.

Person-to-person transmission was highly unlikely since we found no disease in family members, neighbors, or healthcare workers who had not been exposed to sick or dead pigs. One missing link in the outbreak is the exact relationship between a dead goat in the early cluster of patients and the subsequent propagation of the _S. suis_ infections. We could not confirm these 2 cases microbiologically. We speculate that _S. suis_ caused these 2 early human infections because they occurred shortly after exposure to the dead goat, and because clinical manifestations in the 2 patients were similar to those of others in the outbreak. Human _S. suis_ infection after exposure to sick goats has not been reported, despite isolation of the organism from these animals. In backyard farms where different animals are kept together, _S. suis_ infection could have been transmitted between pigs and goats. Animal surveillance would help establish the role of animals other than pigs in carriage of the bacteria and the potential for causing human infections.

Clinically, 3 distinctive forms of human _S. suis_ infection occurred, namely, STSS, sepsis, and meningitis. STSS has not been reported from _S. suis_ infection, although it has been previously described in other streptococcal infections and [a similar illness from] _Staphylococcus aureus_ infections. Unusual STSS-like illnesses brought the outbreak to the attention of local health authorities. A dose effect may explain the relatively high proportion of STSS in this outbreak. While other explanations like co morbid conditions, e.g., asplenia, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and malignancy, have been reported, this was not the case for the outbreak in our study, which involved previously healthy adults. Laboratory examination confirmed virulence factors in the _S. suis_ isolates from this outbreak." - Mod.LL
