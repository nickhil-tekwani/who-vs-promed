[In 2010, Romania reported its 1st case of koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD); 2 outbreaks were reported, and the event was resolved on 30 Mar 2012. See event summary and map at http://tinyurl.com/pc3gd32.

KHVD is a herpesvirus infection capable of inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp.

Following the 1st reports of KHVD in Israel and Germany in 1998 and detection of KHV DNA in tissue samples taken during a mass mortality of carp in the UK in 1996, the geographical range of the disease has become extensive. The disease has been spread to many countries worldwide, predominantly through the trade in koi carp, before the current knowledge of the disease and means to detect it were available. It is now known to occur in, or has been recorded in fish imported into, at least 28 different countries. In Europe, KHV has been detected in many countries across the continent. Most recently, KHVD outbreaks have been reported to the OIE from Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. In Asia, China (Hong Kong), Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore (in fish imported from Malaysia) and Thailand. Elsewhere, South Africa, Canada and the USA have reported occurrence of KHVD. It is likely that the virus is present in many more countries, but has not yet been identified or reported.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2014, chapter 2.3.6 "Koi Herpesvirus Disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf.

Signs of disease
----------------
Animals with disease may show one or more of the signs below, but the pathogen may still be present in the absence of any signs.

Disease signs at the farm, tank or pond level are:
- mass mortalities, with many dead and moribund fish floating at the surface
- disorientation and erratic swimming behavior (sometimes hyperactivity)
- fish coming to the surface and gasping
- fish separated from the shoal.

Gross pathological signs are:
- pale patches on the skin
- overproduction or underproduction of mucous on the skin and gills
- superficial branchial (gill) and skin haemorrhages
- enophthalmia (sunken eyes), erosion of the fins (occasionally), and blistering of the skin
- severe gill necrosis and/or erosion, seen as red and white patches
- focal or generalised loss of skin
- adhesions in the abdominal cavity and abnormal colouration of internal organs (lighter/darker or mottled)
- enlargement and surface haemorrhages of the kidney and liver.

Microscopic pathological signs are:
- inflammation and necrosis of gill tissues, and adhesion of gill filaments
- nuclear swelling, margination of chromatin and pale eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions of the epithelium
- non-specific inflammation and necrosis in other organs.

Koi herpesvirus has no implications for human health.
