Date: Thu 10 Dec 2015
Source: AllAfrica, Radio Dabanga (Hilversum) report [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201512110167.html


According to the Sudanese Ministry of Health, a total of 557 suspected dengue fever cases, including 130 deaths, were recorded in the country between 29 Aug [2015], when the outbreak started, and 4 Dec [2015].

The virus initially affected people in Darfur but has now spread to Kassala and Kordofan states, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan reported in its latest weekly bulletin.

According to the Health Ministry, 53 percent of all reported cases are male. The age group between 5-14 years has the highest number of cases (45 per cent).

In the 5 Darfur states, 512 suspected cases, including 125 deaths, were recorded in 27 localities between 29 Aug [2015] and 4 Dec [2015].

Between 17 Oct [2015] and 4 Dec [2015], 40 suspected cases, including 4 deaths, were reported in the 6 localities of Abyei and Keilak in West Kordofan, El Rif El Shargi, Kadugli, and Habila in South Kordofan, and Sheikan in North Kordofan.

[As indicated in the report, what started as a mixed arboviral outbreak with dengue as one of the pathogens isolated and confined to the 5 states in the Greater Darfur region has now spread to Kordofan and Kassala states with at least 557 cases including 130 deaths reported in the 7 states.

Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family and has 4 serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4). The disease is vectorborne, with _Aedes aegypti_ as the principal vector. Infected individuals present with high-grade fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, muscle and joint pains, and rash. Manifestations of severe dengue include severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, blood in vomit, fatigue, and restlessness.

With no definitive treatment, cases receive symptomatic supportive care, and most outbreak control efforts entail vector control measures.

An outbreak of dengue due to serotypes DEN-1 and DEN-2 was confirmed in Port Sudan in 1986. Out of the 21 patients confirmed to have dengue during the outbreak, 17 had serotype 2, while only one case had serotype 1 infection. Most patients had the classic dengue fever presentation, and none of the cases presented with severe dengue disease (Hyams et al., 1986) [see full article at http://www.ajtmh.org/content/35/4/860.long.]
