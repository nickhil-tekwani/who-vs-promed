A total of 147 confirmed cases of chikungunya were reported so far in Swabi district, and about 51 patients have been treated, said District Health Officer (DHO) Swabi Dr Muhammad Niaz.

He said virus has been contained, as no new cases have been reported for the last couple of weeks.

The 1st case of chikungunya was reported after Eidul Azha, he said, adding that it was believed that the carrier had come from Karachi for Eid. The viral disease was earlier reported in Karachi, and later cases started appearing in Swabi district after Eidul Adha, owing to movement of infected people, the top doc of the district explained.

Dr Niaz said the most affected areas in Swabi district were Gandaf and Sher Dara. Both are semi-urban localities where hygiene conditions are poor.

[The increasing number of cases reported from Swabi district in KP is occurring concurrently with a huge dengue epidemic in the same province. The provincial government has been taking active measures targeting vector control in the short term as well as for long term management. This can be accomplished only through multi-sectoral coordination, including setting up routine surveillance and reporting mechanisms for major vector borne diseases, including both dengue and chikungunya, so that the outbreaks are detected and responded to early. - Mod.UBA
