[British] travellers planning visits to the tropical parts of South America and Africa are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the yellow fever jabs considered necessary due to a worldwide shortage of the vaccination.

Since late July [2013] a growing number of British hospitals and health centres have reported dwindling supplies of the vaccine, which is strongly recommended for travel to winter sun destinations such as Brazil, Cape Verde, and Gambia.

Travel health specialists are warning that in the run-up to Christmas [2013] obtaining the yellow fever jab is likely to get even more difficult as fresh supplies are not anticipated until the beginning of next year [2014].

Should another shortage arise next year [2014] it could affect the tens of thousands hoping to head to Brazil for the World Cup. "We are getting lots of people coming in who have been unable to obtain the yellow fever jab at a number of places and are getting quite nervous about it," said Dr Richard Dawood of the Fleet Street Clinic in London. "At the moment we still have supplies but I fear we too may run out. I would advise anyone planning to go away to affected countries over Christmas to try to get the jab now. It is only going to get more difficult."

Yellow fever is an extremely serious disease which kills up to 60 per cent of people infected. It is prevalent in tropical area of Africa, South America, and parts of the Caribbean where mosquitoes are present. Humans and monkeys are the species most frequently affected.

In addition to requiring the jab to prevent contracting the disease, people travelling from a yellow fever risk area [or country] to another [free of the disease] generally have to provide proof of inoculation in the form of a yellow fever certificate.

According to Dr Dawood, the shortage has come about because there is only one manufacturer of the vaccine -- and because it is inherently difficult to produce.

His advice to travellers was echoed by Greg Lawson, head of retail at the travel insurance specialist Columbus Direct. "Vaccination is the single most important preventative measure against this deadly disease. If travelling to regions where yellow fever is found, it is recommended that you seek advice from a health professional at a registered yellow fever vaccination centre at least 6-8 weeks in advance to ensure it is available."

The government-funded National Travel Health Network and Centre [NaTHNaC] website is also warning about the current lack of the yellow fever vaccine. "Clinics around the country still have the vaccine in stock, but it may take a little more searching than usual to find one," it says. It advises travellers who are concerned to visit the website http://nathnac.org, click on the link to 'Travellers' and then to 'Yellow Fever Centres', on which are listed both NHS and private clinics [in the UK] that are still able to provide the vaccine.

[One wonders how widespread the yellow fever vaccine shortage is becoming. Are other countries experiencing similar difficulty? - Mod.TY

Immigration authorities in countries at risk from yellow fever importation, because they have the urban vector _Aedes aegypti_ and endemic dengue, should be aware that an unknown number of travelers, particularly from some African countries and India, have purchased fake certificates (yellow cards) without being vaccinated. They are especially dangerous to public health of the recipient countries. - Mod.JW]
