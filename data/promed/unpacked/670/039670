["The pig sector is central to the livelihood of rural Africa and is strategically important to the continent's food and nutritional security. Together with poultry, it is one of the fastest-growing livestock sectors in Africa, and this trend is expected to continue over the coming years. Unfortunately, the expanding pig production sector is facing diverse challenges. Poor genetics, inadequate feeding, health constraints, and especially African swine fever and poor husbandry practices are the major challenges to the development of the pig sector in Africa.

The occurrence of African swine fever was reported in almost half of the pig-producing countries on the African continent in 2012. This transboundary animal disease poses a serious negative impact on production and productivity and thus affects national economies and social structures of the pig-producing countries. The virus can have devastating socio-economic consequences, which could lead to food insecurity. Some farmers may lose entire herds of pigs, and compensation is not always provided. This can lead to a reluctance in reporting of ASF clinical signs to veterinary services. A country's trade may be impacted, which could also have an effect on the cost of pork and pork products."

Information from Zambia's last available OIE annual report (January-December 2018) indicates that the country reported African swine fever (ASF) as being restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s). During 2018, 8 outbreaks were reported. See section 3 of this report. Information in this same annual report mentioned that the following disease control measures were in effect or applied: ASF is a disease that must be officially reported, and monitoring, screening, general surveillance, movement control inside the country, and zoning must occur. See report at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2018&semester=0&wild=0&country=ZMB&this_country_code=ZMB&detailed=1.

The diagnosis noted in this immediate notification report was based on suspicion, clinical signs, laboratory (advanced), and necropsy. However, under the section of diagnostic tests, the results are still pending. Further, a media report published on 18 Jul 2020 noted that "a provincial veterinary officer said initial investigations on history, clinical signs, and post-mortem lesions were pointing to swine fever, according to the National Agricultural Information Service (NAIS), a government agency specializing in agriculture information" (see https://africa.cgtn.com/2020/07/18/suspected-african-swine-fever-breaks-out-in-northern-zambia/).

The OIE says that "ASF cannot be differentiated from classical swine fever (CSF) by either clinical or post-mortem examination, and both diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any acute febrile hemorrhagic syndrome of pigs. Bacterial septicemias may also be confused with ASF and CSF. Laboratory tests are essential to distinguish between these diseases."

Information on the results of laboratory testing would be appreciated to clarify this discrepancy.

ASF is not a zoonotic disease and does not affect public health. - Mod.CRD
