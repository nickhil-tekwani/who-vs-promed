_Aedes albopictus_ as a potential bridge vector for West Nile virus
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Further to the ProMED-mail post of 20 Sep 2004 on _Aedes albopictus_ being
found in California (see ref. below), Dr Shamsudeen Fagbo, DVM, Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia, wrote and suggested that perhaps I should have included
references to 3 publications which refer to the potential of _Ae.
albopictus_ to become a bridge vector for West Nile virus.
Sometimes it can be difficult to decide just how many published papers
should be included in the comments on a report, but I have taken up the
suggestion of Dr Fagbo and list the publications below.
1) Turell MJ, Sardelis MR, Dohm DJ, O'Guinn ML. Potential North American
vectors of West Nile virus. Ann NY Acad Sci 2001; 951; 317-24.
2) Sardelis MR, Turell MJ, O'Guinn ML, Andre RG, Roberts DR. Vector
competence of three North American strains of _Aedes albopictus_ for West
Nile virus. Am Mosq Control Assoc 2002; 18: 284-9.
3) Kutz FW, Wade TG, Pagac BB. A geospatial study of the potential of two
exotic species of mosquitoes to impact the epidemiology of West Nile virus
in Maryland. Am Mosq Control Assoc 2003; 19: 190-8.
