Summary
-----
There were 20 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 21 Jun 2015, compared with 24 cases the previous week. Weekly case incidence has stalled at between 20 and 27 cases since the end of May 2015, whilst cases continue to arise from unknown sources of infection, and to be detected only after post-mortem testing of community deaths. In Guinea, 12 cases were reported from the same 4 prefectures as reported cases in the previous week: Boke, Conakry, Dubreka, and Forecariah. In Sierra Leone, 8 cases were reported from 3 districts: Kambia, Port Loko, and the district that includes the capital, Freetown, which reported confirmed cases for the 1st time in over 2 weeks.

Although cases have been reported from the same 4 prefectures in Guinea for the past 3 weeks, the area of active transmission within those prefectures has changed, and in several instances has expanded.

In the northern prefecture of Boke, which borders Guinea-Bissau, the main focus of transmission has switched from the coastal sub-prefecture of Kamsar to the more urbanised sub-prefecture of Boke Centre. Of particular concern, 2 of the cases reported from Boke in the week to 21 June 2015 were health workers.

The single case reported this week from Conakry was from the Matam area of the city, and arose from an unknown source of infection. 3 cases reported over the previous 2 weeks in Conakry are suspected to have generated a large number of high-risk, untraced contacts.
As has been the case for several months, the prefecture of Forecariah continues to be the most complex in terms of transmission, with multiple chains of transmission active across 3 sub-prefectures. 3 of the 5 cases reported from Forecariah in the week to 21 Jun 2015 arose from an unknown chain or chains of transmission, and 2 of those 3 cases were reported from a sub-prefecture, Benty, that has not reported a confirmed case since mid-March 2015. Both cases from Benty and another possibly related case from a neighbouring sub-prefecture were identified after the post-mortem testing of community deaths.

Compared with Guinea, transmission in Sierra Leone has been more geographically confined over the past 3 weeks, with cases clustered in several chiefdoms of Kambia and Port Loko districts. However, the week to 21 Jun 2015 saw 2 cases reported from Marampa chiefdom in Port Loko for the 1st time since the beginning of March 2015. The cases were a mother who died during childbirth, and her newly born child, and are associated with a large number of high-risk contacts. 2 cases were also reported from the area that includes the capital, Freetown, for the 1st time in over 2 weeks. Both cases arose in the densely populated Magazine Wharf area of the city, and although 1 case has an epidemiological link to a previous case, both cases are associated with multiple high-risk contacts.

Only 6 of the 12 cases reported from Guinea and 4 of the 8 cases reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 21 Jun 2015 were registered contacts of previous cases. 4 of the 20 cases reported were identified after post-mortem testing of community deaths. On 21 Jun 2015 there were 2003 contacts being monitored across 4 prefectures in Guinea, with 1023 contacts under follow-up in 3 districts in Sierra Leone.

After over 2 months with no new health-worker infections in Guinea, 2 new health-worker infections were reported from Boke. In Sierra Leone a new health-worker infection was reported for the 1st time since 14 May 2015. There have been a total of 872 confirmed health-worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-----------------------
There have been a total of 27 443 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1), with 11 207 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 12 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 8 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 21 Jun 2015. The outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May 2015.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

A total of 872 confirmed health-worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 507 reported deaths (table 5).

24 Jun 2015 Guinea: Thousands in Guinea refused medical care for malaria fearing Ebola Quarantine
http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/06/24/thousands-in-guinea-refused-medical-care-for-malaria-fearing-ebola-quarantine/
[A new study, published in the Lancet, found the fear of being misdiagnosed and sent to an Ebola treatment center, being quarantined, and contracting the disease while in quarantine with actual Ebola patients, resulted in at least 74 000 untreated malaria cases in West Africa. The researchers found the number of malaria cases treated by medical professionals in Guinea dropped 69 percent in the past year. There was a 46 percent decrease in the number of people seeking treatment in clinics. The World Health Organization [WHO] has recommended all Ebola treatment facilities to include the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases.

23 Jun 2015: Liberia watches nervously as Ebola spreads near border
http://www.voanews.com/content/liberia-watches-nervously-as-ebola-spreads-near-border/2834161.html
[According to Tolbert Nyensuah, the head of Liberia's Ebola Incidence Management Team, Liberia is still performing cross-border surveillance exercises and providing thermometers to help prevent the virus from recurring in Liberia. However, some Liberia residents want the border closed until both Guinea and Sierra Leone are pronounced Ebola-free.]

24 Jun 2015 Liberia: Bush meat trade roaring again despite Ebola ban
http://www.irinnews.org/report/101671/bush-meat-trade-roaring-again-despite-ebola-ban
[Despite the Liberian government's July 2014 ban on hunting and selling bushmeat, animals again are now being seen for sale at markets, roadsides, and other outlets. The ban worked for a while, but the people have become complacent.

The bush meat problem is a complex one, as people must eat, but the practice is a known risk factor for contracting Ebola. - Mod.LK]

22 Jun 2015 Sierra Leone: After 17 Days... Ebola Revisits Freetown
http://africayoungvoices.com/2015/06/after-17-days-ebola-revisits-freetown/
[Last Thu (18 Jun 2015), after 17 days of no Ebola virus disease cases in Freetown, the city reported another Ebola virus case from the Magazine Cut community, among the most densely populated and unsanitary areas in Freetown. The National Ebola Response Centre (NERC) is reported to have quarantined the infected area, and begun contact identification and tracing.]

[After no new Ebola cases in 18 days, Sierra Leone's Freetown (in the Magazine slum) clocked 4 new cases, the last of which was confirmed on 24 Jun 2015. In Guinea, President Conde said: "Infected people are still running away from quarantine areas with the consequences of infecting other people. Right now we have 12 suspected high-risk people on the run from the (Northern) Port Loko District."]

22 Jun 2015 Africa: A nation, continent and people fooled by religion [opinion]
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/features/A-Nation-Continent-and-People-Fooled-By-Religion-363661
[Example given by author: A group of over 100 pastors "laid hands" (a practice where a pastor or other religious person places their hands on a person in order to heal them from an illness or disease) for hours on Liberian Ebola virus disease victims, and attempting exorcism in churches instead of taking the victims to health-care facilities for treatment. The Ghanian pastors performed these rites because they believed the Ebola victims caught the disease because of their belief Ebola was a satanic disease brought to Liberia because of the country's homosexuality and corruption.

Over 100 pastors DIED because of doing this procedure. - Mod.JW]
