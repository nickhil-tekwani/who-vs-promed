Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Friday [11 Jul 2014] the year's 9th case of Japanese encephalitis, reminding the public to be on guard against the mosquito-born disease.

The most recent case is a 66-year-old woman from southern Taiwan's Pingtung County. She is reportedly gradually recovering after being taken to the hospital on 30 Jun [2014].

Of the 9 cases confirmed so far, all have been in patients over 40 [years of age] from across the country, with 2 each in Changhua County in central Taiwan and Chiayi and Tainan cities in the south, and one each in the central city of Taichung and the southern Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County.

Japanese encephalitis usually becomes prevalent between May and October and peaks in June and July each year, according to the CDC.

Authorities urged the public to get vaccinated and try to avoid mosquito bites. Preventive measures include wearing long-sleeved clothing and using mosquito repellent, coils and vaporizers.

According to the World Health Organization, most Japanese encephalitis [virus] infections are mild or have no apparent symptoms, but approximately 1 in 250 infections result in severe disease characterized by the rapid onset of high fever, headache and even death.

The mortality rate can be as high as 30 percent among those who display symptoms.

[Taiwan is well within the endemic region of Japanese encephalitis virus, and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease, but there is no indication if the affected individuals above had been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.
