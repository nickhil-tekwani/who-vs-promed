Dozens of healthy bulls and cows in Viet Nam's central Phu Yen province
have suddenly died after being stricken by an unidentified disease within
one hour, local newspaper Labor reported.
The disease was detected in the province's Song Hinh district, where 17
bulls and cows of a farmer have died.
The animals had difficulty in breathing for one hour, and then died with
blood appearing on their eyes, noses, ears, and anuses, the paper said.
Earlier in February 2004, the central province of Quang Nam announced an
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which affected nearly 2000 hoof cattle,
mainly buffaloes, cows and bulls in 27 communes of 6 towns and districts.
The provincial authorities killed affected pigs, banned transport of cattle
in contaminated areas, vaccinated healthy hoof cattle, and tightened
control over slaughterhouses and meat markets.

[Animals dying acutely, especially with blood appearing on some orifices,
make one think of anthrax. If this farmer is knowingly or unknowingly
feeding an anticoagulant, similar clinical signs may be seen. It would be
unusual for all the animals to be affected almost simultaneously if
anticoagulant is involved. - Mod.TG]
