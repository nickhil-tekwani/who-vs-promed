[West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses causing unapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family _Flaviviridae_. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.24_WEST_NILE.pdf)

West Nile viruses have been found throughout much of the world including Africa, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, the Americas, and the Caribbean. In some regions, the viruses do not seem to be endemic, but are reintroduced regularly by migratory wild birds. These viruses may either cause outbreaks, or circulate asymptomatically among birds during warm weather, and disappear with the onset of cold temperatures.
