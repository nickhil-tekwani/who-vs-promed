A bat captured at the Fort Laramie National Historic site [Goshen county, Wyoming] 16 May 2018 was confirmed to be carrying the fungus responsible for white nose syndrome [WNS]. The fungus is believed responsible for killing millions of bats in the eastern and mid-western United States. It first appeared in New York state in 2006. Scientists believe humans brought the "_Pseudogymnoascus destructans_" (Pd) fungus from Eurasia to the US.

University of Wyoming biologists said the discovery does not mean the bat with the fungus has WNS. But the fungus detection signals the continued spread of the pathogen. It has been found in 32 states and 7 Canadian provinces.

Further testing on tissues from Fort Laramie bats is under way to determine if they have WNS. Another Wyoming field team found a similar instance in May [2018] on 5 bats in Badlands National Park in South Dakota.

"This is a saddening discovery," said Wyoming Game and Fish wildlife and habitat management supervisor Tim Wooley. "Bats are important species because they are incredible predators of insects." He said bats are vital for healthy ecosystems and contribute at least USD 3 billion annually to the US agricultural economy through pest control and pollination.

Humans and their pets are not affected by the fungus.

Wyoming and the National Park Service are implementing response plans in the state. The state's strategy is to increase coordinated management by limiting access to sites where bats roost and hibernate, and by broadening surveys of those sites to monitor any spread of the fungus. Wyoming Game and Fish has been sampling for Pd fungus at known bat roosts since 2014 with no previous detections. The department also implemented strict decontamination measures previously for field personnel who survey bat species, per national standards.

State and federal officials throughout the west are asking people to stay out of closed caves and mines to avoid spreading the fungus. And people visiting other caves or places where bats live are asked to decontaminate hiking and caving boots and gear before and after visits.
