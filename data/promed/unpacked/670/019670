The central province of Quang Nam has recorded nearly 780 hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases since the start of the year, the provincial Preventive Medicine Centre said yesterday (Tue 10 Jul 2012). It was a sharp increase compared to the same period last year [2011] when only 12 cases were reported. Some 51 out of every 100 000 people in the province have now contracted the disease, patients being mainly children under 3 years of age.

More than 310 children with mumps have also been reported, nearly double the number in the same period last year [2011].

[It has yet to be established whether human enterovirus 71 is playing a role in this outbreak, similar to that currently observed Cambodia.
