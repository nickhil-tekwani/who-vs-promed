Lassa Fever in Nigeria
----------------------
Nigeria continues to experience an outbreak of Lassa fever in different parts of the country. From 1 Jan 2014 to 16 Mar 2014, a total of 208 cases including 17 deaths (CFR: 8.2 per cent) were reported from 19 LGAs [Local Government Areas] within 9 states as shown in figures 6 & 7 [see the source URL]; 83 per cent (173/208) of the cases were reported from Edo state. A total of 27 cases were laboratory confirmed.

During 2012 and 2013, a total of 1723 suspected cases including 112 deaths (CFR 6.5 per cent) and 1195 cases including 39 deaths (CFR 3.3 per cent) were reported respectively.

The Federal and State governments with support from WHO and other partners are responding to the outbreak by reinforcing active surveillance and public enlightenment; and sensitizing clinicians on case management protocol and Standard precautions, among others.

Lassa Fever in Liberia
----------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) of Liberia has notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever in a UN Mission in Liberia Kakata camp, Margibi County. A total of 14 cases including one death were reported from 27 Feb 2014 to 10 Mar 2014. A total of 11 of the cases had been reported among UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) Kakata camp peace keepers, 2 among UNMIL civil/UNPOL [United Nations Police] in the camp, while one case is from the neighboring community related to cases in the camp. All the 14 cases have been laboratory confirmed to be due to Lassa fever. Although Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and occurring as sporadic cases in Bong, Nimba and Lofa counties, this is the 1st time a case has been reported in Margibi County which is close to Montserrado County where the national capital city, Monrovia is located.

[Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria. This is the 4th report of cases of Lassa fever virus for Nigeria in 2014 that ProMED-mail has posted. Cases have occurred sporadically in Liberia and this is the 1st report for 2014. Mod.CP provided an excellent summary of Lassa fever (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130911.1937742): "Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is an endemic disease in portions of West Africa. It is recognized in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as Nigeria. However, because the rodent species which carry the virus are found throughout West Africa, the actual geographic range of the disease may extend to other countries in the region. Individuals at risk are those who live in or visit areas with a high population of _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus or are exposed to infected humans.

"Primary transmission of the Lassa virus to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with _Mastomys_ rodents, especially in the geographic regions where outbreaks occur. Storing food away in rodent-proof containers and keeping living areas clean help to discourage rodents from entering homes. When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient secretions (together called VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] isolation precautions or barrier nursing methods) [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm]. Such precautions include wearing protective clothing, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles; using infection control measures, such as complete equipment sterilization; and isolating infected patients from contact with unprotected persons until the disease has run its course. The disease can be treated.

"Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult. The anti-viral drug ribavirin can be used in treatment of severe cases. Currently, there is no protective vaccine."

The 2-fold difference between the CFR in Nigeria for 2012 & 2013 could be explained by the possibility that a smaller proportion of the suspect cases in 2013 were actually Lassa fever, with the rest being due to other causes. It would be interesting to study the unconfirmed cases to discover what other diseases cause syndromes that are being reported as suspected Lassa. - Mod.JW]
