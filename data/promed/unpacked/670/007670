An outbreak of human plague recently occurred in Lang County of
Tibet's Linzhi District. 2 people who contracted pneumonic plague
died. After the outbreak, relevant authorities in the Tibet
Autonomous Region undertook comprehensive plague prevention work.
This district does not have any new cases and the outbreak has been
brought under control.

2 people in eastern Tibet have died of the deadliest and least common
form of plague, Chinese state media said on Wednesday [1 Oct 2008].
The health department of the Himalayan region was notified on Friday
[26 Sep 2008] that 2 people had died of an unidentified illness in a
village in the Linzhi area, more than 200 km (125 m) southeast of the
capital Lhasa, the Beijing Times reported.

Health authorities examined the victims and determined they were cases
of pneumonic plague. The report did not identify the 2, but health
authorities in Hong Kong said they were a couple who developed
symptoms of plague on 14 and 23 Sep 2008.

A spokesperson for the Centre for Health Protection of Hong Kong's
health department said the man, 35, passed away on 20 Sep 2008 and his
38 year old wife died 5 days later.

Pneumonic plague, which is transmitted to humans from infected animals
-- mainly rodents [by their fleas] -- is highly contagious, the centre
said. It can spread between humans by breathing in respiratory
droplets from an infected person and the incubation period of the
disease is between 1 & 4 days.

Pubu Zhuoma, head of the Tibet health department, said cases of human
plague had emerged in Tibet in the past. "Tibet's disease prevention
workers have long carried out plague prevention and control work in
disease areas. They have had good results in controlling epidemics
among animals and there have been no epidemics among humans," he said,
according to the Beijing Times.

Authorities immediately put in preventative and control measures in
the village, no new cases of the disease had emerged in the area, and
the disease had been contained, the report said.

[The 9 day interval between the 2 cases strongly suggests that the man
transmitted the infection to his wife. Primary pneumonic plague (one
percent of natural plague presentations) arises as a result of
inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be
produced when there are secondary pneumonic complications in
bubonic/septicemic plague.

Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness, and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines
identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 ft) as being at greatest risk
and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air
ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic
plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or
tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive
antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for
prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol. - Mod. LL]
