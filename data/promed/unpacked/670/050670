Fish-killing disease reaches inland lake near Mansfield
-------------------------------------------------------
A disease that has killed fish around the lower Great Lakes has been
discovered in Clearfork Reservoir, an Ohio inland lake near Mansfield, Ohio.

The Ohio Division of Wildlife collected routine fish samples in April 2008
to test for viral hemorrhagic septicemia outside of the Lake Erie drainage.
Test results announced Wednesday [4 Jun 2008] detected a positive sample
from a muskie netted from Clearfork Reservoir.

Wildlife officials are asking anglers and boaters to avoid moving live fish
from Clearfork Reservoir to other waters; to drain water from boat live
wells, bilges and engines before leaving the reservoir; and to empty bait
buckets and coolers.

Wildlife experts said the virus poses no risk to humans. Swimming will not
put people at risk, and fish caught from Clearfork Reservoir are safe to eat.

The virus was confirmed by a US Fish and Wildlife Service laboratory in La
Crosse, Wisconsin. A large fish kill from VHS was documented in western
Lake Erie 2006, with mostly sheepshead, or freshwater drum, dying. There
was a smaller fish kill in 2007.

There has not been a fish kill in Clearfork Reservoir.

[Surveillance seems to have paid off. There have been no die-offs but they
have a positive case. It will be interesting to see what the plan is and
how they prevent a die-off. - Mod.TG]
