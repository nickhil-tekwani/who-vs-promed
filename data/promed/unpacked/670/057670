Fish farms linked to sea lice outbreak
--------------------------------------
For the 1st time in Canada, scientists have used data from the world's
largest aquaculture company to draw a link between sea lice from Atlantic
salmon on British Columbia fish farms and soaring infection rates in wild
salmon migrating nearby. After an infestation caused the near collapse of
wild spring salmon stocks in the Broughton Archipelago in 2002, Craig Orr,
executive director of the Watershed Watch Salmon Society (a
non-governmental organization that monitors BC water systems), collected
information from the Norwegian company Marine Harvest on sea lice at its
fish farms in the region.
"We had predicted 3.6 million [wild] salmon returning to the Broughton in
2002. What we got back, according to the [Department of] Fisheries and
Oceans' count, was 147 000 fish, a 97 per cent crash that was only in the
Broughton," said Dr Orr, who is also the science coordinator for the
Coastal Alliance for Aquaculture Reform.
Dr Orr also studied a sea lice action plan brought in by the provincial
government after the collapse -- the only time any such plan to curb sea
lice population growth has occurred in BC -- in his search for growth
patterns in the parasite's demographics. The results were published last
week in an article for the North American Journal of Fisheries Management.
Dr Orr discovered that 12 active, open net-cage farms in the Broughton,
which is composed of dozens of islands between the BC mainland and the
northern tip of Vancouver Island, contained between one and 5 million
Atlantic salmon and produced billions of lice eggs over an 18 month period
in 2003 and 2004. Louse-egg production peaked during late winter in both
years, just before the seaward migration of juvenile wild salmon.
His article confirms that when lice-egg production was reduced by early
harvesting of farmed salmon, infections of wild juvenile salmon near the
farms declined dramatically, including a 42-fold reduction near one emptied
farm. "What we do now know is what's happening on these farms. And it's
transparent, finally. And that's critical," Dr Orr said. "We do hope that
the [government] management agencies and the industry are willing to work
towards reducing those peaks of lice just before the juvenile fish come
out. That's why we're doing all this."
He praised Marine Harvest for making the data available, something
aquaculture companies have done in Europe but not yet in Canada. Dr Orr
said he wants to see a change in practices, especially from the provincial
government, which oversees fish farming in British Columbia. "We are
critical of government because they aren't producing data. They aren't
making these companies share the data like they are in Europe, with the
exception of Marine Harvest, and they didn't make them. [Marine Harvest]
volunteered it," Dr Orr said. The migration of wild spring salmon usually
begins in the 1st days of March.

[Sea lice are crustaceans, parasites belonging to the _copepoda_ in the
family _Caligidae_. _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_ (salmon louse) and _Caligus
elongatus_ causes the greatest problem; especially serious is _L.
salmonis_. _C. teres_ causes serious problems on Atlantic salmon in Chile.
(The term "sea lice" has also been applied to "sea bather's eruption,"
caused by the larval form of _Linuche unquiculata_, or thimble jellyfish,
in Florida).
Geographic distribution: _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_ (salmon louse) -
temperate climates in the northern hemisphere; _Caligus elongatus_ -
globally; _C. orientalis_ - Japan; _C. teres_ - Chile, _C. longicaudatus_ -
New Zealand; _C. clemensis_ and _L. cuneifer_ - Canadian Pacific.
Sea lice species and host affected:
_L. salmonis_: salmonids: Atlantic salmon, Pacific salmon; sea trout,
steelhead trout, Arctic char, white-spotted char, brook trout, cut-throat
trout; _L. cuneifer_: elasmobranch and teleost fish; _L. pectoralis_:
flounder; _L. hippoglossus_: halibut; _C. elongatus_: many marine fish
species; _C. curtus_: gadids (cod, haddock); _C. orientalis_: rainbow
trout; _C. teres_: farmed coho and Atlantic salmon; _C. labracis_: ballan
wrasse
Reproduction:
--Male locate on anterior, dorsal site of fish; fertilized females locate
primarily behind adipose and anal fins,
--One mating fertilizes several egg sacs,
--Egg sacs are chain of fertilized eggs; larvae develop inside the egg sac,
even if egg sac is removed; fully developed egg sacs with ready-to-hatch
larvae are dark brown,
--6 sets of egg sacs can be produced by one female in 50 days at 14 C;
oviducts are filled with eggs, while egg sacs are still attached,
--no. of eggs per egg sac is related to length of egg sac; egg sac of wild
salmon are often longer and contain more eggs, egg sac length increases in
late fall, early winter.
Life cycle:
--Time from extrusion of egg sacs to eclosion (hatching): 5.5 to 40 days
depending on the temperature (shortest time at warmer temperature); _L.
salmonis_ 10-12 days at 11.5 C; _C. elongatus_ 8 days at 10 C;
--2 nauplii stages; non-feeding, positive phototactic; nauplii I 9-52
hours; nauplii II 17-35.6 hours depending on water T (5-15 C);
--One free-living copepodid stage attaches to fish and becomes parasitic;
actively positively phototactic;
--infection rate of fish kept at 0-4 m depth is 40 higher than fish kept at
greater depth,
--attachment of copepodids affected by light, salinity, hydrodynamic factors
--4 attached chalimus stages; sex differentiation in chalimus IV
--generation time (from nauplii I to gravid female): at 9-12 C about 40
(males) - 52 (females) days.
Survival:
--adult sea lice survive up to 22 days off the host,
--copepodids remain infective for 4-6 days at 15 C,
--life span in freshwater: 21 days; have been seen on migrating salmon 70
km inland;
--life span on host in seawater 75 days at 9-10 C; 191 days at 7.4 C; _C.
elongatus_ survived 260 days on arctic char,
--nauplii survive best in sea water; copepodids at 15 per cent; survival of
copepodids is higher at 15 C than at 5 C;
--eggs survive and hatch at 15 per cent, but survival of nauplii is nil;
complete development only at greater than or equal to 30 per cent
Pathological effects on salmonids:
--copepodids cause local reaction visible as small black spot; feeding
activity of chalimus causes small local erosion; more extensive erosions
are caused on the dorsal fin of sea trout,
--adults graze with an non-selective rasping apparatus; there is no
evidence of secretions,
--pathogenic effect increases with the size, mobility and number of the
parasites,
--_L. salmonis_ causes more damage than _C. elongatus_,
--Lesions are/can be most severe in head region with deep erosion occurring,
--Plasma sodium and cortisol (stress level) increase, hematocrit,
lymphocytes and plasma protein levels decrease;
--Non-specific, innate resistance in coho. Higher resistance is associated
with protease activity in mucus (serine and metalloprotease).
--limited cellular and humoral immune response. Immunity, induced
experimentally by antibodies to lice gut antigen, reduced fecundity of
females but does not prevent infection.
--Injection with cortisol increased resistance in smolt,
--it has been suggested that sea lice can transmit furunculosis, vibriosis,
infectious salmon anemia virus, bacterial kidney disease,
--sea lice infestations increase stress and susceptibility to other
diseases; cause starvation, reduce growth, cause mortality, reduce carcass
quality, increase secondary infections (cold water sores) and cause
expenses for treatments.
There are treatments available for farmed fish. Organophosphates and
pyrethroids work well for topical bath treatments. Benzoylphenylurea and
parasiticides in the avermectin class work for feed treatments. Emamectin
benzoate (SLICE) is the only product used in the US under an INAD
exemption. Of course, treatments vs. cost vs. side effects vs. losses have
to be considered in the management plan of handling this parasite.
Treatment management
--Stocking of sites with single year class; copepodids are seen within 3
days of stocking on multiple age sites,
--Fallowing between year classes for 30 days or longer,
--Sites are mostly self-infecting, therefore all cages on a site should be
treated within the shortest possible time,
--Keep fish well-satiated; satiated fish keep in deeper waters where
infection rate is lower,
--Reduce stress; stressed fish are more susceptible. Overcrowding, handling
(grading) causes stress,
--Select for greater resistance to sea lice infection,
--Coordinated bay-wide treatment to reduce initial infection from external
sources
--Late fall/early winter or early spring treatments,
--Use of wrasses where possible,
--Use Integrated Pest Management approach.
