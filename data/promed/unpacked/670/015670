Monkeypox virus: Commission bans the import prairie dogs and rodents that
could carry the disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) agreed
unanimously to ban the import of prairie dogs (_Cynomys sp._) from the USA
and rodents of non domestic species and squirrels from sub-Saharan Africa
because of the risks of monkeypox disease. The decision will soon be
adopted by the European Commission.
Monkeypox is an animal disease, which is not present in the European Union.
In human beings the disease is usually mild but the clinical symptoms may
evoke [resemble? Mod.SH] chickenpox or smallpox. The presence of the
disease has been confirmed in prairie dogs in certain parts of the USA. The
information available cannot exclude the possibility that contamination of
prairie dogs is linked to contacts with rodents of non domestic species
(Gambian rat) imported from Africa where the disease is endemic. The known
reservoirs in the endemic zone are squirrels and rodents of non domestic
species in the African rain forest. Despite the name of the disease,
monkeys and primates are infected accidentally through direct or close
contact with infected reservoir hosts.
The SCFCAH concluded that it is appropriate to take measures to ban the
import of prairie dogs from the USA and reservoir species from the endemic
zone.

[This is a sensible measure, which deserves to be followed by other
countries. It would be interesting to note if Gambian rats have been
imported to EU member states until now and, if affirmative, whether
serological/virological surveillance in such animals is to be undertaken. -
