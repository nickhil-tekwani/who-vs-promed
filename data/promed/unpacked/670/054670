Viet Nam has culled nearly 10% of its pig herd to contain an African swine fever [ASF] outbreak that has started hitting large-scale industrial farms, the government said in a statement on Tuesday [25 Jun 2019].

Earlier outbreaks have appeared mostly at small household farms but have now started to occur at larger industrial operations, including Phu Son Farm in Dong Nai province near Ho Chi Minh City, the statement said.

"This is a very worrying sign, as these farms have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of pigs each, and therefore the damages would be significant," the government said in a statement posted to its official website.

African swine fever, which is deadly to pigs but harmless to humans, was 1st detected in Viet Nam in February [2019] and has spread to farms in 60 of the country's 63 provinces, according to the statement.

Authorities have this week [week of Mon 24 Jun 2019] culled hundreds of pigs at Phu Son Farm, home to more than 18 000 pigs, Bach Duc Luu, the deputy head of Viet Nam's Department of Animal Health, said on Tuesday [25 Jun 2019].

A representative of the farm, owned by Phu Son Livestock Joint Stock Co, declined to comment.

[According to a report by Vietnamnet, published similarly on 25 Jun 2019, more than 2.8 million pigs were culled since the 1st discovery of the disease in Viet Nam (19 Feb 2019). ASF has been recorded from 4401 communes in 459 districts within 60 provinces and cities nationwide. As of 24 Jun 2019, only the south-central province of Ninh Thuan, the Mekong Delta province of Ben Tre, and the southwestern province of Tay Ninh have remained free from the disease (https://vietnamnet.vn//en/society/african-swine-fever-breaks-out-in-60-provinces-cities-544773.html#inner-article).
