An 18 year old boy scout from Connecticut is recovering at home after
becoming infected with bubonic plague, possibly in Wyoming. The teenager
was among hundreds of scouts who built trails and did other service work
late in July 2008. The Wyoming Department of Health is trying to determine
how he became infected.

The teenager traveled to multiple sites in the area, including Yellowstone
National Park. Where the teen contracted the disease is not known.
Infection usually comes after being bitten by a rodent flea that is
carrying the plague bacterium or handling an infected animal.

Each year, 10 to 20 cases occur in the United States according to the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About one in 7 cases in
the USA is fatal.

Wyoming Department of Health officials said today [25 Aug 2008] they are
investigating a case of bubonic plague in an out-of-state resident who
recently visited Teton County and Yellowstone National Park.

The individual traveled to multiple sites in the area with a group of boy
scouts from 26 Jul 2008 to 3 Aug 2008, said Dr Tracy Murphy, state
epidemiologist with the Wyoming Department of Health.

"The young adult traveled to Yellowstone National Park, Bridger-Teton
National Forest and other sites within Teton County. He was involved in a
combination of activities during his visit that included working on a
service project, camping, sightseeing, and participating in sports."

Wyoming Department of Health staff will participate in an environmental
investigation with other agencies this week to look for fleas and animal
carcasses in areas where the individual visited. "At this time the exact
location where the exposure to the disease occurred is not known and it is
likely we will never determine that level of detail," Murphy said.

Dr Karl Musgrave, state public health veterinarian with the Wyoming
Department of Health, said that while the risk for humans to contract
plague is relatively low in Wyoming, the disease has been documented in
animals in 22 of Wyoming's 23 counties since records were kept.

This is the 6th human case of plague thought to have been acquired in
Wyoming since 1978. The most recent human case of plague in Wyoming was
acquired in Goshen County in the fall of 2004. Other recorded cases
involving residents include a 1978 Washakie County case, a 1982 Laramie
County case, a 1992 Sheridan County case that resulted in death and a 2000
Washakie County case.

"It's safe to assume that the risk for plague exists all around Wyoming,"
Musgrave said. 'And while the disease is rare in humans, it is important
that people take precautions to keep exposure to the disease to a minimum."

Ways to avoid the plague include
- avoiding unnecessary contact with rodents and their nests and burrows;
- avoiding unnecessary contact with sick or dead animals, especially
rodents and rabbits, and wearing protective gloves when handling sick or
dead animals;
- having ill pets, such as cats and dogs, examined by a veterinarian;
- avoiding areas where a large number of unexplained rodent deaths have
been observed;
- keeping pets away from rodent nests and burrows by keeping them leashed;
- treating pets with flea preventatives (see your local veterinarian for
more information).

[_Yersinia pestis_, the plague bacillus, is not endemic in the eastern USA.
Any cases in the residents of this area must have been acquired elsewhere,
be related to contact with an infected reservoir inadvertently brought into
the area or be due to a deliberate man-related introduction. - Mod.LL
