HPS Press Release
<http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/news/anthrax-press-release-2010-04-12.pdf>

A patient resident in the NHS [west] Lothian area has been confirmed
as the latest case in the ongoing anthrax outbreak among drug users
in Scotland. This case, the 1st in Lothian, brings the total number
of confirmed cases in Scotland associated with this outbreak to 33,
of whom 11 have died. Further cases have also occurred in England and
Germany. This outbreak represents the 1st reported outbreak of
anthrax to have occurred in conjunction with drug use.

This latest cases emphasises that contaminated heroin still appears
to be in circulation in Scotland and as a result, further cases may
come to light. The number of confirmed cases may also rise due to the
retrospective analysis of borderline test results from patients
earlier in this outbreak. These borderline test results, which may
indicate the possibility of milder infection, require further
analysis before confirmation can be made. At all times, patients have
been treated by their local clinicians in accordance with their
clinical status, and no patient has been denied or delayed treatment
while awaiting test results. As with all patients in this outbreak,
there has been no evidence of person to person transmission or
increased risk to their families, friends or other associates or to
the general public.

Anthrax is still a very dangerous and potentially fatal disease, as
demonstrated by the serious illnesses and deaths which have occurred
in Scotland so far in this outbreak. Dr Colin Ramsay, Consultant
Epidemiologist at Health Protection Scotland and head of the national
Outbreak Control Team, said: "There is no way to tell if your heroin
is contaminated, and there is no way to take heroin which we can
advise is safer or less likely to result in illness or death if it
has anthrax contamination. Drug users are advised that the only way
to avoid the risk of anthrax in this outbreak is not to take heroin.
While we appreciate that this may be extremely difficult advice to
follow, it remains the only public health protection advice possible
due to the nature of anthrax infection. It must be noted that filters
will not make heroin safe or remove all traces of anthrax
contamination, so the best advice remains not to use heroin by any
method. Users should seek urgent medical attention in the event of
symptoms such as redness or swelling at or near an injection site, or
other symptoms of general illness such as fever, chills or a severe
headache, as early antibiotic treatment can be lifesaving. Marked
swelling of a limb which has been used as an injection site is a
particularly important sign of possible anthrax infection."

[Discussion with our UK colleagues reveals that they are having
problems getting folk to pay attention. The non-addicts regard it as
divine justice on the addicts and turn away. The addicts have short
attention spans anyway, and it is just one more risk they cope with
along with clostridial infections, and the anthrax risk is
mathematically trivial; the number of heroin addicts in just that
part of Scotland is some 55 000 individuals or a 0.06 percent
incidence.

Interestingly, the BBC News has been ignoring these weekly incidents
for some time, but today they have issued a report:
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8616163.stm>,
which points up the value of issuing news releases if you want to get
news out. Journalists have a streak of plagiarism in all of them, and
we should take advantage of that. - Mod.MHJ]
