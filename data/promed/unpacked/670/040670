Outbreak of dengue in Pune
A dengue fever epidemic has broken out in many parts of the city and 14
localities have been identified as having maximum incidence of dengue.
According to consultant physician and chief investigator of dengue project
at the Kem Hospital, out of 110 blood samples tested for the fever since
July this year, 55 tested positive. He says that the number of dengue cases
have increased from two per month to 10 per month within a span of three
years and in the last two months it had shot up to 54 which was a cause for
concern. Dengue is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which breeds in
stagnant waters stored in tanks and pots.
