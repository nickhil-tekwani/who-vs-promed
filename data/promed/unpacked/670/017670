Nine children have died since the beginning of February 2016 in Manzala General Hospital in Dakahlia Governorate after having an unknown disease with symptoms similar to influenza. One of the doctors in the hospital stated that the pediatric department admitted 4 children with symptoms of fever, febrile convulsions, and dyspnea. The children were aged from 3 months to 5 years old and died after being admitted to the hospital in the period from the beginning of February 2016 till 10 Feb 2016.

The doctor indicated that the children have been given treatment for avian flu as a precaution, but they don't know the disease. The disease was not diagnosed in spite of the repeated deaths. The Health directorate sent a committee to investigate the disease, but it didn't provide a diagnosis and just recommended taking swabs from new cases, which didn't happen.

[Dakahlia Governorate is an Egyptian governorate lying north east of Cairo. It has a population of about 6 million.

It is not clear what caused the deaths of these children and exactly how they were treated, but the doctors suspected avian flu, most likely H5N1. Emerging Infectious Diseases (http://www.cdc.gov/eid) recently published a report entitled "Increased number of human cases of influenza virus A(H5N1) infection, Egypt, 2014-15" http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/12/15-0885_article:

Abstract
"During November 2014-April 2015, a total of 165 case-patients with influenza virus A(H5N1) infection, including 6 clusters and 51 deaths, were identified in Egypt. Among infected persons, 99 per cent reported poultry exposure: 19 per cent to ill poultry and 35 per cent to dead poultry. Only one person reported wearing personal protective equipment while working with poultry.

"According to the Egyptian Ministry of Health, this was an unprecedented number of persons with severe respiratory illness caused by infection with the H5N1 virus. Whether this trend has continued into 2016 is not known, as the reports have been scant."

ProMED-mail requests further information on this cluster of pediatric cases. - Mod.LK
