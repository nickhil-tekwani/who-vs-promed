A comment on the significance of the 1st case of canine rabies in Taiwan
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In ProMED-mail post: Rabies - Taiwan (18): ferret-badger, 1st canine case 20130910.1934959, the Moderator commented that: "However, this case suggests that rabies-virus infected ferret-badgers are becoming more aggressive than is their usual habit."

Actually I think it signifies something else, equally dangerous. Normally a ferret-badger is reclusive and nocturnal, much like bats, but when rabies scrambles their mental functions, as with bats, they might wander into proximity of humans, including children, and other animals.

A 6-week-old puppy, like the one who became rabid, is going to play with anything that moves. Likewise, most other dogs and cats will investigate whatever moves; children will play with any animal they can catch; and most pigs will curiously nudge any unfamiliar animal or object with their noses.

Pigs rarely are exposed to other forms of rabies, but because pigs are the most abundantly raised livestock in Taiwan, and because many pigs in Taiwan are still raised outdoors, some in semi-forested environments close to ferret-badger habitat, I wouldn't be surprised to see pigs becoming infected if this outbreak continues to spread.
