The Ministry of Health issued a national epidemiological alert after
detecting a case of cholera in the state of Sinaloa.

In an interview, Undersecretary of Prevention and Promotion of
Health, Mauricio Hernandez Avila, said the new case of cholera was
detected in a 10-year-old. He said the case was treated quickly and
the patient has recovered.

The federal official called on state governments to maximize the
monitoring of their water systems, because locally where you found a
new case of cholera the chlorination systems not working properly. The
goal, he added, is to detect a possible infection rapidly.

He said they were working with the Federal Commission for Protection
Health Risks (Cofepris) and the National Water Commission (Conagua) to
strengthen the chlorination systems throughout the country. He
rejected that could be risks of an epidemic as had occurred in Haiti,
as he said, the Epidemiological surveillance systems are active and
running.

[There was a report of cholera in the same central-western state of
Sinaloa in 2010 from
http://www.milenio.com/node/586025 posted on 24 Nov 2010:

"Mexico has raised a warning precisely for the actions that are
essential to make an early detection because there is always risk,
whether from a person who moves from U.S. to here, or directly, and
can be carriers of the disease," he said after the change of board of
the National Academy of Medicine.

In the meantime, cholera has spread across international borders.
There have been detected cases in the Dominican Republic and the
southern state of Florida, the United States, and the SSA confirmed an
isolated case in Sinaloa, about 3 months ago.

"It's getting stronger action of the water quality ... strengthening
the epidemiological surveillance by taking samples from people with
diarrhea and drainage if there is bacteria," he said.

This case was NOT related to the well-reported multinational outbreak
of cholera related to a wedding banquet in the Dominican Republic
which did not occur until January 2011. It was likely not a residua of
the large Latin American outbreak of cholera which began in Peru in
1991 as Borrotoa and Martinez-Piedrab reported (Geographical patterns
of cholera in Mexico, 1991-1996, Int J Epidemiol 2000; 29: 764-772)
that the Mexican states affected were all south of Sinaloa.

That Mexico was significantly involved in that outbreak, however, is
shown in PAHO statistics from 1995 (PROMED: Cholera - Latin America,
1995 19960419.0752)

Countries reporting cholera cases in 1995 included:
Peru, 22 397 cases and 171 deaths;
Mexico, 16 430 cases and 137 deaths;
Brazil, 15 915 cases and 85 deaths;
Nicaragua, 8825 cases and 164 deaths;
Guatemala, 7970 cases and 85 deaths;
Honduras, 4717 cases and 77 deaths;
El Salvador, 2923 cases and 5 deaths;
Bolivia, 2293 cases and 54 deaths;
Ecuador, 2160 cases and 23 deaths;
Colombia, 1922 cases and 35 deaths;
Argentina, 188 cases and 1 death;
Costa Rica, 24 cases and no deaths;
Belize, 19 cases and no deaths;
USA, 19 cases and no deaths.
