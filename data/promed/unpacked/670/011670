Papua New Guinea health officials announced on 9 April that they were earlier
this year informed of 16 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases resulting in 6
deaths on Normanby Island (off PNG's southeastern coast) in December 1997.
All deaths occurred within a 10-km radius in the island's northern region.
Laboratory analysis, done in Australia of blood samples from pigs, chickens
and humans detected JE as the prominent virus, but also found similar
viruses such as Murray Valley and Kunjin. Only one death from JE had been
reported by PNG prior to this event. Health authorities have not yet
decided if there will be a vaccination campaign or more blood tests to see
if the disease has spread beyond the "relatively small" focus on Normanby
Island. It appears likely that a mosquito control program will be employed.
