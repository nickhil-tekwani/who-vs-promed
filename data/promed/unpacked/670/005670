Outbreak of a mysterious disease has killed over 200 sheep in the district [Tirunelveli]. The shepherds are facing huge loss due to this rapidly spreading disease with more numbers of sheep battling the illness reportedly caused by suspected viral infection.

Since the dropping of goat and sheep is excellent manure, the shepherds would have the sheep pens in the farms and the fields ahead of every paddy season in the district. When farmers rearing goat and sheep in Marudhakulam, Moolaikkaraipatti, Munanjipatti, Paruththipaadu, Rengasamudhram and other adjoining areas are taking their flock, each having 150 to 1000 animals, around Tirunelveli and create pens in the fields, a mysterious disease has started ravaging the sheep over the past 25 days.

After sudden swelling in the eyes of the animals, the infected sheep suffer frothing in the mouth. And the affected animals die within a couple of days even as the infection is spreading rapidly in the flock.

"We suspected it to be a kind of sheep pox for which the animals were vaccinated 10 days ago by the veterinarians. However, we continue to lose the sheep even after the vaccination," say [2 shepherds] of Moolaikkaraipatti.

[Another] farmer from Rengasamudhram, who is rearing over 1000 sheep, has so far lost 58 animals to this mysterious disease. "A total of 28 more animals are dying gradually with the symptoms of this disease," he weeps.

Even though the farmers isolate the infected animals from the flock, 15% of the animals in every bunch have contracted the infection. The farmers claim that they had not witnessed such a devastating infection over the past 35 years.

"This is not a kind of pox, as being suspected by the veterinarians of the Department of Animal Husbandry. The officials, with the help of the Veterinary College and Research Institute at Ramaiyanpatti, should have collected the blood samples of the infected animals to pinpoint the exact reason behind this infection. Unfortunately, none has turned up so far to rescue us," said [2 shepherds] from Rengasamudhram and Paruththipaadu.

The Joint Director, Department of Animal Husbandry could not be reached for his comments. The faculty of the Veterinary College and Research Institute too said that they had not received any information from the animal husbandry department seeking their help.

[Tirunelveli district is situated in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

From the above report, it is not clear if the disease/mortality started before or after the sheep pox vaccination, applied 10 days before the date of the above report. Sheep pox vaccine is live-attenuated. Have unvaccinated animals been similarly affected? Are goats kept with the sheep? In case affirmative, have they been affected as well? Has the vaccine undergone safety testing, excluding contamination (e.g., pestivirus)?

The diagnosis is yet to be established, based upon clinical investigations, gross pathology and lab tests of obtained samples. Sheep pox is, in most cases, readily identifiable by experienced practitioners. In case no typical lesions were seen, other infectious and non-infectious etiologies should be excluded. - Mod.AS
