The WHO said Tuesday [10 May 2022] that there are now 348 probable cases of acute hepatitis among children across 5 regions globally.

The new cases are in addition to 70 others previously reported, according to Dr. Philippa Easterbrook, a senior scientist in the WHO's hepatitis department. The cases reported are a mixture of new cases and historic ones, Easterbrook said.

While [it is still unknown why there has been a spike in cases globally], Easterbrook said a strong correlation has been found with adenovirus, a common ailment that typically features cold or flu-like symptoms. Over 70% of the UK's cases tested positive for adenovirus. Easterbrook said adenovirus type 41 was most common among the cases, which typically causes diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, as well as respiratory symptoms, according to the WHO. She said more data from the UK will hopefully come within the week to see whether the adenovirus is a correlation or causal.

COVID-19 was also detected in 18% of the UK cases, and the WHO is investigating how many of the total hepatitis cases previously had the virus. "An important consideration is the role of COVID-19, either as a co-infection or past infection," Easterbrook said.

The Arkansas Department of Health is investigating an unexplained illness in a child last year [2021]. The mysterious illness has been coined "hepatitis X" because it is an unexplained form of hepatitis. Doctors are still researching what the virus is and how children are becoming infected with it.

The CDC has asked doctors to report cases of unexplained liver damage in children under 10 going all the way back to October 2021.

This began when a cluster of 9 children had this mystery syndrome in Alabama.

"These weren't kids that had prior health problems that sometimes you see with hepatitis more often in. These weren't immunocompromised children," said Dr. Joel Tumlison, ADH's Physician and Outbreak Response.

Doctors tested them for the usual causes of hepatitis, but everything came back negative. They did test positive for a common intestinal virus, adenovirus 41. "So, it's unclear yet whether that's the smoking gun or not. It's looking like the most likely suspect, but it's not clear," said Dr. Tumlison.

At first, this disease looks like an ordinary case of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. But if liver damage sets in, symptoms of jaundice show up. That is when the skin or eyes turn yellow. Most children with stomach problems do not have hepatitis.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health said it is investigating "multiple" reported cases of unexplained hepatitis infection in previously healthy young children. A spokesman for the department told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that no cases have been confirmed yet. Pennsylvania is one of 25 states and territories that have reported possible cases to the CDC.

In Pittsburgh, UPMC Children's Hospital has had a "handful of children that meet [CDC's] reporting requirement, but none of these cases have been confirmed as of this time," according to a spokeswoman for the hospital. The infections date back to October 2021, and there are no current hospitalizations. Allegheny Health Network has not had any such cases in children, a representative said.

The agency is investigating 109 US cases of hepatitis of unknown cause in children over the past 7 months, including 5 reported deaths. More than 90% of these patients were hospitalized, and 14% received liver transplants, according to the CDC. Cases have also been reported in the UK, Israel, and several European countries.

"That's obviously very alarming if these children are getting so sick that they require transplantation as a treatment," said Dr. James Squires, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Children's Hospital. Dr. Squires said none of the hepatitis patients at Children's have needed liver transplants.

The CDC first issued a health alert on 21 Apr [2022], notifying health-care providers of a cluster of 9 children in Alabama with hepatitis and liver injury from October [2021] to February [2022]. Two of the children required liver transplants, and 3 developed liver failure. Most of the children who have developed hepatitis have since recovered. None of the 9 children had COVID-19 infection during their hospitalization or a documented history of COVID-19. They also had not received the COVID-19 vaccine before being hospitalized for hepatitis.

The cause of the outbreak is still unknown, but health officials have identified a type of virus called adenovirus in many of the 109 US children with unusual hepatitis. Specifically, many have tested positive for adenovirus 41, which typically causes mild gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms and is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.

"Adenoviruses have not historically been known to cause much in the way of liver disease," Dr. Squires said. "Even though this adenovirus 41 has been linked or discovered in association with some of these children who have hepatitis, it has not been found in the liver itself. When they've actually tested the liver tissue, the adenovirus 41 isn't there. It's actually picked up mostly in the stool." He cautioned that more information is needed to determine if adenovirus 41 is truly the cause.

A mysterious virus causing hepatitis in children is here in Hawai'i. The Hawai'i Department of Health said a child on Maui is being treated for the virus, and it's unknown how the child got it. Health experts say it is troubling because 9 out of 10 children who get the virus are hospitalized.

The health department said the Maui child, under 10 years old, "was hospitalized for several days with abdominal pain and fever at the end of April 2022. An extensive medical investigation was performed. At this time, no cause has been determined." According to the CDC there have been more than 100 cases of a mysterious type of hepatitis in children; 90% of them have been hospitalized, and 14% of them needed a liver transplant.

Health experts say a majority of them were infected by what's known as an adenovirus, which is a fairly common virus. But this particular form of the virus is different. "More infecting the kids, more directly to the GI tract but rarely in the past go to the liver, and this one goes to the liver. That's what really concerns us," said Dr. Naoky Tsai, a liver specialist. Dr. Tsai says this type of hepatitis is different from the other known types, so there is no vaccine for it. He adds that it's also troubling that 14% needed a liver transplant, because getting donors can be difficult.

"Because of the availability of a donor. We don't really have kids dying and then donate a liver, so majority of them get it from their parents," said Dr. Tsai. He says children should see the doctor if they get symptoms similar to the stomach flu: nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Dr. Tsai says adults can get it also, although not as bad. But they should stay away from children if they get the same symptoms.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is investigating 2 cases of pediatric hepatitis in the state, but both cases have tested negative for adenovirus infection. The DPH said no additional details are being released to respect the privacy of the pediatric patients.

Last week, the CDC said that it was investigating more than 100 cases of severe and unexplained hepatitis in children.

More than half of cases worldwide have been connected to an adenovirus, a common virus that causes a variety of illnesses. There are dozens of adenoviruses, many of them associated with cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, and pink eye. But some versions can trigger other problems, including inflammation in the stomach and intestines. Officials are exploring a link to one particular version that's normally associated with gut inflammation.

"As clinicians, we should be watching out for our children with the same types of symptoms," Dr. Brian Chow with Tufts Medical Center said. "Earlier on in this outbreak, many of these cases have been caused by a virus called adenovirus."

"More than 90% of those kids needed to be hospitalized," Dr. Ali Raja, deputy chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, said last week. "In fact, 14% of them required a liver transplant. So it's a pretty big deal."

"What parents should be looking out for is, 1st of all, the recognition that, so far, this is really quite rare," Dr. Richard Malley with Boston Children's Hospital said.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/7-cases-of-severe-acute-hepatitis-reported-at-toronto-children-s-hospital-1.6447257


One of Canada's largest children's hospitals is reporting 7 cases of severe acute hepatitis identified in recent months, which may be part of an unexplained outbreak impacting youth in multiple countries, CBC News has learned. It's still unclear how many cases have been reported across Canada, or whether any of the cases under investigation at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, also known as SickKids, are linked to the mysterious instances of serious liver disease among children in the UK, USA, Israel, and elsewhere.

A spokesperson for SickKids provided the tally in an email, saying the hospital is "closely monitoring" for any cases of severe acute hepatitis and has reported 7 cases meeting the "probable case definition" to Public Health Ontario. Those cases were identified between 1 Oct 2021 and 30 Apr 2022.

"It remains to be seen whether this number represents an increase in cases of unknown origin compared to similar time periods in previous years, or if any of these cases will be confirmed to be caused by a novel clinical entity," SickKids spokesperson Jessamine Luck said.

The Public Health Agency of Canada has not yet provided specifics on how many cases are being investigated Canada-wide to determine if they are related to the unexplained instances of hepatitis elsewhere.

In the UK, where there have been at least 163 cases of acute, unexplained hepatitis identified in youth under 16 since the start of the year [1 Jan 2022], including 11 cases which required a liver transplant, officials say the leading hypothesis remains focused on adenovirus. "However, we continue to investigate the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 and to work on ruling out any toxicological component," the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said in a briefing note released on Friday [6 May 2022].

Adenovirus, referring to a family of common viruses that typically cause mild cold or flu-like illness, was the pathogen detected most often, found in more than 70% of the UK cases and primarily detected in blood, the UKHSA said. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 18% of cases. Serological testing, a method to determine if someone has antibodies from a prior infection, is also underway.

"A range of other possible pathogens have been detected in a low proportion of cases and are of uncertain significance," the UK briefing note continued.

"I don't think the answer is a simple smoking gun here," said Hamilton, Ont.-based infectious diseases specialist Dr. Zain Chagla, of the global investigations into this mystery outbreak. "Certainly, we've seen adenoviruses cause hepatitis in immunocompromised populations. But even then: Why now, and why in the context of certain countries, and not others? The context of certain time frames, but not others?" he questioned. Is there a cofactor -- a toxin, or genetics, or another infection like COVID-19 -- that might be involved in all of this?"

Unexplained cases of hepatitis have been identified in an array of countries, and at varying points in the pandemic, with significant numbers being reported in recent months following alerts sent out by officials in the USA and UK.

What's unclear, whether in global reports or the numbers under investigation in Toronto, is exactly how these tallies compare to the typical baseline rate for unexplained hepatitis in children. "There's just so much uncertainty," said Chagla, including why certain regions are reporting more cases than others.

In Israel, Dr. Yael Mozer Glassberg, head of the liver transplant unit at Schneider Children's Medical Center, said her team has treated multiple children who faced strange instances of hepatitis, but hasn't seen a "huge jump" in overall numbers. Medical staff analyzed those recent cases, including genetic testing, and the only link between them was that each one had faced a previous bout of COVID-19, identified through serological testing and each family's medical history. None of the patients tested positive for adenovirus, Mozer Glassberg told CBC News.

"I can't say that this is the same thing that happens right now around the world," she said. "But we had 7 definite cases like that [since February 2021 [2022?]], and right now we've hospitalized the 8th one."

Given variations in testing for COVID-19 around the world, it may also be tough to determine any possible links to prior infections from SARS-CoV-2, adding another layer of uncertainty to this global puzzle. "Maybe it's a new virus. Maybe it's not [adenovirus]. Maybe it's not even post-COVID... Maybe it's a combination of the 2," Mozer Glassberg said.

Shared Health has confirmed one pediatric case of severe acute hepatitis in recent weeks in Manitoba.

In a statement on Tuesday [10 May 2022], a spokesperson said they could not share details of the health region or severity of the case due to patient privacy. The spokesperson was also unable to say whether the person with severe acute hepatitis previously had COVID-19.

The WHO said it is aware of 348 cases of severe acute hepatitis in children around the world. One death has been reported, and 17 liver transplants have been required.

South Korea has identified its 1st suspected case of acute hepatitis of unknown origin in a child, health officials said Tuesday [10 May 2022] following hundreds of similar cases reported in Europe and across the world.

The case of acute hepatitis, which causes inflammation of the liver, was reported on 1 May [2022], according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). The unidentified child was infected with both adenovirus, which often causes respiratory illnesses among children, and a type of common human coronaviruses.

Lee Sang-won, a KDCA official, said in a regular briefing that the suspected case in South Korea did not appear to be closely related to COVID-19 or coronavirus vaccines.

The public health authority has received reports of 9 suspected cases of inflammation in the liver, acute hepatitis, with an unknown cause in children. The Swedish Public Health Agency urges caregivers to be aware of cases of acute hepatitis, especially in children, where the cause of the disease is not clear.

The current cases that have been reported to the Swedish Public Health Agency, and which the Swedish Public Health Agency has reported to the European Communicable Diseases Control Agency (ECDC), are a form of acute hepatitis but without a known cause. The cases have fallen ill during the period November 2021 to April 2022 and are spread across the country. Similar cases have been reported from the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, the USA, and Japan, among others.

That a child suffers from acute hepatitis with an unknown cause is very unusual but does occur. The Swedish Public Health Agency is investigating whether the cases we see now represent an increase in acute hepatitis with an unknown cause or not, says state epidemiologist Anders Lindblom.

The development is closely monitored by the WHO and by the authorities responsible for infection control in the member countries (in Sweden, the Swedish Public Health Agency). The cases are investigated to see if there is anything in common that can explain the cause of the disease.

The Swedish Public Health Agency has informed healthcare in Sweden about the development to draw attention to patients with symptoms that need to be investigated as a suspected case of hepatitis with an unknown cause, says state epidemiologist Anders Lindblom.

The main hypothesis is that this is an adenovirus infection, but it has not yet been established. Adenovirus is a large group of viruses that can cause both respiratory and intestinal infections. Infection with adenovirus is common, but serious infections are very rare.

[More cases and case locations continue to be reported. Updates will likely occur in the next few days from CDC and UKHSA. It remains to be seen whether all of the cases are due to one etiology or not.

- Adenovirus type 41, one of the enteric adenoviruses, has been found in the blood of many of the cases but has not been known to cause hepatitis in immunocompetent people and was not found using metagenomics in the liver. It is not yet known whether type 41 is similar to older isolates of this adenovirus serotype.

- SARS-CoV-2 can cause hepatitis, which may be much more prominent in children with MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory disease in children). Only some of the children were actively infected with this virus at the time of the hepatitis, but no substantial data has yet been published regarding past infection with SARS-CoV-2, as some cases of MIS-C are thought to be late sequelae or possibly not fitting the multi-system disease.

- Adeno-associated virus 2 was found in some cases in the liver as reported by UKHSA, but it has been known to cause hepatitis in humans and may be just reactivating the latent genome, which can integrate into the human genome.

- A possible link to dog ownership has also been suggested by UKHSA.

ProMED awaits more information regarding blood and liver metagenomics, evidence for past COVID-19 infection, and screening of asymptomatic household contacts for elevated aminotransferases. I am sure that serum specimens and hopefully samples from cases and household contacts are being saved for later testing. - Mod.LL
