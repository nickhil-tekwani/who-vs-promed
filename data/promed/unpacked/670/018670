The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said national levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) are on the rise, signaling the start of the 2018-19 flu season. For the previous 3 weeks, ILI rates had been near or at the national baseline, which is 2.2% at this time of year. This week, the rate jumped to 2.7%. During last year's severe flu season [2017-18], ILI rates reached 7.5% before flu activity peaked, the highest it has been since the 2009-10 flu pandemic.

The percentage of specimens testing positive for flu at clinical laboratories reached 11% during the week ending on [15 Dec 2018], up from 6.5% the week before. Of those specimens, 94.6% were influenza A, and 5.4% were influenza B. Of subtyped influenza A samples last week, 81.9% were H1N1, and 18.1% were H3N2.

Eight of 10 regions reported ILI at or above their region-specific baseline level, CDC said. Colorado and Georgia noted high ILI activity. New York City and 9 states (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Virginia) experienced moderate ILI activity.

H1N1 strain predominant
-----------------------
Last year's [2017-18] severe flu season was marked by transmission of influenza A H3N2 more than any other strain. This year, the H1N1 strain that first emerged in 2009 is causing most illnesses.

"It's too soon to make any assessment about this season's [2018-19] severity, however since this H1N1 virus emerged in 2009, it has been associated with significant illness and severe illness among young children," CDC said. "At this point, most flu activity has been driven by illness in school-aged children, and hospitalization rates among children younger than 5 years old (7.7 per 100 000) are now the highest among all age groups."

To compare, in 2013-14 and 2015-16 (the 2 previous H1N1-dominant seasons) the hospitalization rates among children younger than 5 years old for the same week were 7.2 per 100 000 and 1.8 per 100 000, respectively. This week CDC also recorded the 7th pediatric flu death of the season; the patient had an influenza A virus that was not subtyped. Last year [2017-18] the pediatric death toll rose to 185, the highest in recent years. CDC said there's still time for all unvaccinated persons over the age of 6 months to get the seasonal flu vaccine.

"With significant flu still to come this season, CDC continues to recommend that anyone who has not yet gotten a flu vaccine this season should get vaccinated now. It takes approximately 2 weeks for the protection provided by vaccination to begin," said CDC.

Officials with the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH) report that while overall flu activity in Wyoming is low, it is increasing in north eastern and central Wyoming. Reggie McClinton, an epidemiologist with the department, says those trends are in line with a national trend of increasing flu cases. He also said last year's [2017-18] Wyoming flu season was especially severe, with 27 deaths reported across the state, far more than is typical. Influenza is a contagious, respiratory illness caused by a virus.

Symptoms include fever, headache, extreme tiredness, dry cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and muscle aches. State epidemiologist Dr Alexa Harrist said just because the flu is a familiar disease, that doesn't mean people shouldn't take it seriously. She also said "nearly everyone 6 months or older" should get a flu shot. Shots are available at public nursing offices, retail stores, clinics, and other locations. She also advised people who are sick to stay home from work or school and said frequent hand washing is also a good practice for preventing the spread of the virus.

For people who already have the flu, doctors may recommend antiviral medications. These medications are especially useful for people at higher risk for complications from the flu. But for the antiviral medications to work, people need to seek medical care soon after they become ill.

Another 2 deaths linked to the flu have been reported by [North Carolina] state health officials, bringing the total so far this season [2018-19] to 8, according to state health officials. According to the state's Department of Health and Human Services, the 2 newest deaths occurred between [9 and 15 Dec 2018]. Authorities did not elaborate on the circumstances behind the deaths, but they add to the state's flu death toll.

During the 2017-18 flu season, nearly 400 deaths in North Carolina were attributed to the flu, the highest death toll in a single flu season since state officials began publicly reporting flu deaths in 2009. Of those, 290 were people who were 65 years and older, while 7 of them were under the age of 18, state officials said.

In North Carolina, flu infections are commonest from late fall to early spring, with activity usually peaking in January or February, according to state health officials.

The number of flu cases in Italy has passed one million, the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†; ISS) said on [Thu 20 Dec 2018]. There were over 200 000 new cases in the week from [10-16 Dec 2018], it said.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported on 21 December 2018 that in "Week 50, 10-16 December 2018
Influenza activity remained at baseline or low levels in the majority of countries throughout the WHO European Region. However, most countries are starting to see geographic spread (widespread, regional or local) within their borders.

"The majority of influenza virus detections were type A among both inpatients and outpatients.

"For week 50 in 2018, data from 20 member states and areas reporting to the EuroMOMO project indicated all-cause mortality to be at expected levels for this time of year."(https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/communicable-disease-threats-report-22-december-2018.pdf). - Mod.SH]
