I am pleased to send you our most recent assessment report on the subject,
by specific country and diseases, according to information gathered and
validated by our country offices. We also include recommendations on
actions to be carried out. We believe this
information will be useful for ProMED-mail users and other readers. The
Public Information Office at PAHO will keep you updated.

PAHO/WHO REPORT ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION IN CENTRAL
AMERICA
November 23, 1998


EL SALVADOR
Cholera: As of November 20, the Ministry of Public Health has reported six
cases and one death (San Alejo, La Union). _V. cholera_ 01 El Tor Owaga
has been isolated in one case. Of the six reported cases, four were
imported from Jutiapa, Guatemala; the other two originated in border areas
of El Salvador (Metepan, Santa Ana and San Alejo, La Union.) On 19
November, an outbreak of diarrheal disease erupted in the San Juan de Dios
Hospital in the department of Santa Ana on the Guatemala border. All the
fifteen cases required hospitalization. This is a suspected outbreak of
cholera, which is attributed to ingestion of food sold by a street vendor
from Jutiapa, Guatemala. The Ministry of Health initiated a public
information and health education campaign and launched activities to
control the disease, targeting the areas along the Guatemala border.
GUATEMALA
Cholera: The Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health reported
that between 4-20 November there were 234 confirmed cases of cholera out of
a total of 261 reported. There were 17 deaths. On 20 November, an
outbreak was reported in the Mental Health Hospital of Guatemala, with 18
confirmed cases and one death. In Chinaltenango that same day, there were
27 suspected cases and 37 confirmed cases, which correspond to the
cummulative total notified cases for that area in the last two weeks. All
reported outbreaks implied food-borne transmission. Reporting by
epidemiological weeks (through Week 45-November 14), as reported by the
Health Information Management System (SIGSA) on 19 November, shows a clear
rise in cholera beginning in Week 37 (September 13). However, this
information service reports 395 cases of cholera during Week 44 (November
1-7) and 511 cases during Week 45 (November 8-14), sharply higher than the
figures reported by the Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health.
Diagnostic measures have been strengthened and treatment of cases and
contacts stepped up.
Leptospirosis: On 23 November, the Surveillance Department reported six
cases of leptospirosis, five of which were confirmed. Four of the cases
occurred in Guatemala City and two in Escuintla. No deaths were reported.
Dengue: SIGSA reports 277 cases of dengue for Week 45, a rise of almost 200
cases from the previous week.
Malaria: According to SIGSA, the situation is stable.
NICARAGUA
Cholera: As of 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 335 cases of
cholera, 301 of which were confirmed. Managua reported 156 cases or 52% ,
followed by Carazo (46 cases), Masaya (25) and Matagalpa (18 cases).
According to an analysis of trends by the Epidemiological Surveillance
System, one can observe an increase in Week 45, with 102 cases.
Seventy-five were reported the preceding week. The Ministry of Health has
taken measures to treat the cases, distribute chlorine, and conduct
community education and environmental health campaigns.
Leptospirosis: Up to 22 November, the Ministry of Health reported 264
suspected cases of leptospirosis, 98.1% of which were in Chinandega and
Esteli (136 and 123 cases respectively). Of the 182 samples processed in
laboratories, 42 resulted positive for Leptospira (23%). The Ministry of
Health is sending medical brigades and epidemiologists to the affected
departments and strengthening control measures and community support.
Dengue: The Ministry of Health reports a rise in notification of cases
during the last two weeks.
Malaria: According to information from the Ministry, the situation is
stable.
HONDURAS
Cholera: As of 21 November, the Ministry of Health reported three confirmed
cases of cholera and 11 suspected cases in Regions 1, 3 and 4 of the
country.
Leptospirosis: On 20 November, the Ministry of Health reported and outbreak
of febrile illness compatible with leptospirosis in three municipalities
(San Pedro Zula, Choloma and La Lima in the department of Cortes (Region
3). Four cases were reported with three deaths. Two of the cases were
serologically confirmed. The Ministry of Health has sent an
epidemiological team to the field, strengthening the diagnostic capacity
and improving epidemiological surveillance efforts.
Dengue: As of 21 November, the Ministry reported 1,080 cases of classic
dengue, 444 of which occurred in Region 3. A total of 33 suspected cases
of hemorrhagic dengue have been analyzed, and 15 of these were confirmed.
The remainder are being studied. To date, 4 people have died.
BELIZE
Cholera: Health authorities report, as of 20 November, an outbreak of
cholera in Saint Martin Village in the Cayo District, with 11 suspected
cases and five confirmed. The latter have been hospitalized in the
Belmopan Hospital. In one case, a 78-year-old person died 12 hours after
being hospitalized. The suspected source of infection was contaminated
drinking water from the Roaring Creek. Fifty-two contacts received
treatment.
ANALYSIS OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION - As of 23 NOVEMBER
The following situations can be identified from available information:
1. there is epidemic activity of cholera in the five countries affected by
Hurricane Mitch. Guatemala has the highest risk.
2. there is epidemic activity of leptospirosis in Nicaragua, Honduras and
Guatemala. The area at greatest risk is Esteli and Chinandega, Nicaragua.
3. there is epidemic activity of hemorrhagic dengue in the metropolitan
region of Honduras.
PAHO recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the local and national health
authorities in the five countries affected by Hurricane Mitch to control
the risk of epidemics. These efforts, particularly the improved
epidemiological surveillance, have sharply increased the capacity to
suspect and detect cases as well as to confirm instances and eventually
treat diseases that have the potential to cause epidemics. Consequently,
we can expect a significant increase in the epidemiological reporting of
cases in the coming weeks.
However, PAHO recommends the immediate establishment of the following
measures: Cholera: 1) Strengthen health control measures, including basic
hygiene measures, provision of safe water, and handling and consumption of
food from street vendors, among the at-risk population, particularly in
shelters. 2) Intensify local epidemiological surveillance measures of
cholera (active identification of cases) in the affected population. 3)
Implement social communication campaigns particularly in shelters and among
the displaced population and native communities. Leptospirosis: 1)
Strengthen the local capacity to diagnose and quickly treat cases. 2)
Stimulate community participation in expanding the application of
preventive measures and the early detection of suspected cases. 3) Step up
health surveillance measures, including rodent control.
Hemorrhagic Dengue:
1) Ensure that health authorities have prompt access to suspected cases.
2) Intensify health measures to control vectors.
3) Strengthen local community participation in the control of breeding
sites of mosquitos.
