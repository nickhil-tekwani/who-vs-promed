Mysterious disease kills 2000 cattle in Kurigram
------------------------------------------------
About 2000 animals died and several hundred cows were attacked by a
mysterious disease in Kurigram district in October 2004.
The disease is spreading fast in Kurigram Sadar, Roumari, Rajibpur and
Rajarhat upazilas [administrative regions]. Every day hundreds of the sick
cows are being brought at the upazila livestock offices for treatment, but
to no effect.
Some small farmers who are dependent on ploughing the land of others are
facing tough days after the death of their cows. Abul Hossen, a small
farmer of Najira in Kurigram Sadar upazila said that one of his 2 cattle
died of a mysterious disease 3 weeks back. The cattle were his only source
of income, he said. One of the cows of Mahbub, a neighbour of Abul Hossen,
also died of the mysterious disease.
Fearing possible attack, farmers in 9 upazilas are selling their cows at low
prices. A number of people also became sick due to intake of meat of sick
cows. Police arrested Khairul, a butcher at Tagrihat in Kurigram Sadar
upazila, on charge of selling meat from sick cows. Another butcher, a
resident of the vocational crossing area in the district town, [has
disappeared] following the police search.
Although experts in the district Livestock Department are trying to identify
the cause of the diseases, they are yet to be successful in their efforts,
said a livestock officer.
Abdus Saber, a merchant-cum-dairy farmer of Baparipata in Kurigram Sader
uapzila, told this correspondent his 2 cows worth about Tk 60 000 [USD 1033]
died within 4 hours of an attack of the mysterious disease.
A veterinary surgeon from the district livestock department carried out an
examination of the cows, but he could not ascertain the cause of the
animals' deaths, said Abdus Saber.
Abdus Chhalam, former chairman of Kurigram municipality, said that one of
his cows died of a mysterious disease a few weeks ago. He said after loose
motion [diarrhea] his cows became weak. They vomited several times and
finally died.
The District Livestock Department identified the cause of death as
dehydration. But application of medicine proved to be ineffective, said
another official of the department, on condition of anonymity.

[This news item is rather confusing; reportedly, it initially occurred "last
month" (October 2004?) and is "spreading fast". The report includes 3
separate descriptions of the alleged mysterious condition in the Kurigram
district (north Bangladesh, neighbouring India and Bhutan), namely:
a. "2 cows died within 4 hours of attack of the mysterious disease".
b. "After loose motion cows became weak. They vomited several times and
finally died".
c. "District Livestock Department identified the cause of death as
dehydration. But application of medicine proved to be ineffective."
The etiology(ies) of the condition that reportedly affected thousands of
animals, remains to be investigated, if not established. Combination
of "vomiting, dehydration and general weakness" in bovines will permit more
than 20 possible diagnoses -- including infectious (including rinderpest),
toxic, and metabolic factors. The legal measures taken against persons
engaged in uncontrolled slaughter might hint a suspicion by the authorities
that the condition may have also public-health aspects.
Any information will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
