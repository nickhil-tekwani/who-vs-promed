I read with interest the speculations surrounding changes in the patterns
of reported dengue hemorrhagic fever in Thailand. Annual epidemic
occurrences vary in magnitude as the result of very complex phenomena, only
partially understood. David Vaughn and colleagues at the AFRIMS laboratory
in Bangkok over a 30 years observation period have showed that new
serotypes, previously absent, are causally associated with DHF for three or
four years and then disappear again. The only serotype which has
persistently caused DHF over the period of observation has been dengue 2.
>From the experience in 1983 when a dengue 3 was introduced into Thailand
accounting for some 30% of secondary infection DHF cases, we learned that
virulence may or may not be associated with various serotypes. Prior to
1983, secondary DEN 3 occurred, but accounted for little DHF. More
dramatic was the almost complete absence of DHF associated with the
numerous secondary DEN 1 infections in the Rayong and Bangkok studies of
1980. In an unexpected reversal, (unpublished observations from the U.S.
Navy's study in Jogyakarta), of all viruses circulating, secondary DEN 1
was most often associated with DHF.
When dengue transmission rates fall, a progressively larger fraction of the
adult population is susceptible to primary or secondary dengue infection.
Because the clinical disease to infection ratio in adults is nearly one,
just about all these cases are clinically observed. When minor hemorrhagic
manifestations occur these may be reported as DHF. The adult cases may be
very numerous and give the false impression that infection rates are
rising. The only reliable way to estimate dengue infection rates is to
measure them serologically. For more information see: Halstead SB in Gubler
