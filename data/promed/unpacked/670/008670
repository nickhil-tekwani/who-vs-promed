A wild deer was discovered with chronic wasting disease (CWD) for the first
time outside a 411 square mile zone west of Madison, a newspaper reported.
A 3 year old buck shot in Grant County in south western Wisconsin during
the 9 day hunting season that ended Sunday tested positive for the fatal
disease, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in Wednesday's editions.
The Wisconsin Viral Research Group in Wauwatosa is conducting the lab work
for test kits marketed to hunters through sporting goods stores. Tom Hauge,
a Department of Natural Resource wildlife administrator, told the newspaper
he was not surprised by the lab's discovery.
"If there is an expectation that there is more CWD out there, I wouldn't be
surprised to find it in that part of the state," Hauge said. Grant County
borders Iowa County, part of which is included in the Wisconsin Department
of Natural Resources' (DNR) 411 square mile eradication zone, where it
wants all the deer killed in an effort to eradicate the disease from the
herd. So far, 41 wild deer have tested positive within the zone [But how
many have been tested? - Mod.TG].
The private lab is using technology not approved by the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA). It has tested about 300 samples out of about 600, with
only the 1 positive result.
The lab's founder, Konstance Knox, defended the accuracy of the company's
testing technology, which she said is under review by the USDA. The lab
will use a different approved procedure to check the results. Knox's lab
was hired by Wildlife Support Services of Hayward, which sold about 10 000
kits to Wisconsin sporting goods stores. State officials will have to
analyze the test results from the Grant County deer and any others found.
"Where we are right now is that we need to sit back and let all of the test
results get in," Hauge said. "We are not going to charge out and start
killing deer in other places." The DNR would plan to wipe out local deer
populations if the disease is found only in pockets and not widespread
through the herd, Hauge said.
CWD creates sponge-like holes in the deer's brain, causing the animal to
grow thin, act abnormal, and die. There is no cure. The DNR is not sure how
the deer became infected.

[Surveillance outside of the designated eradication zone is likely to turn
up other positive animals, as the method of transmission of this disease
has not been defined. At this point, it may be nothing more than previously
infected animals having escaped the eradication zone. - Mod.TG]
