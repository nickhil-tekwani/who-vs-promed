_Acinetobacter baumannii_ has became a major cause of
hospital-acquired infections in a growing number of countries,
including Israel. In my experience, this microorganism has a
combination of characteristics that makes it one of the sturdiest
nosocomial pathogens: 1) excellent environmental survival; 2)
extraordinary ability to become highly resistant to most or all
antibiotics except colistin; and 3) high virulence, with a
significantly greater case fatality ratio than other nosocomial
pathogens. Although initially seen in intensive care units
(neurosurgery, burns, and respiratory ICUs), it has recently spread
to general wards and nursing homes.
Its occurrence as a community-acquired pathogen has been reported
from limited areas in the world including Papua New Guinea and far
East Asia. The occurrence of _Acinetobacter spp_ infections amongst
wounded Iraqi natives is very intriguing and worrisome. Are those
community- or hospital-acquired infections? An urgent epidemiological
investigation should be carried out to answer this question. In
addition, stringent infection control measures should be applied in
order to contain the potential spread of this dangerous and virulent
pathogen.

I wouldn't dare to have doubts about the identification of this bug;
nevertheless it's well known that contact with soil and multidrug
resistance are also key indicators of _Ochrobactrum anthropi_. Did
you exclude rule out this option?

Several readers noted that imipenem is a carbapenem antimicrobial,
not a monobactam as stated in the original report. ProMED-mail
regrets the error and has corrected the archived report .

[As pointed out by Dr.Pitlik, community-acquired _Acinetobacter_
infections have been reported. As an example, Anstey and colleagues
reported 11 cases of bacteremic, community-acquired _A. baumanii_
pneumonias from the Northern Territory of Australia and reviewed 34
others (1). Cigarette smoking, alcoholism, chronic lung disease, and
diabetes were risk factors. The scenario has also been described in
Papua New Guinea (2) and other parts of Asia including Taiwan and
Malaysia, as well as more developed countries such as the USA (3) and
France (4).
More importantly, however, in regard to _Acinetobacter_ infections of
wartime injuries, Myron Tong reported that _Mimeae-Herellea_
(organisms of which some were renamed _Acinetobacter_) were the most
common Gram-negative bacilli isolated from wounds on day 1 of
hospitalization in the Vietnam conflict (5). Aarabi (6) found that
_Acinetobacter_ was the second most common cause of infection of
missile-related head wounds in a Iranian report from data collected
during the Iran-Iraq conflict.
Regarding _O. anthropi_, a bacterium formerly referred to as
Achromobacter CDC Group Vd, it is a Gram-negative, aerobic,
oxidase-positive and non-lactose fermenting organism for which most
reports in the medical literature are related to intravenous line
bacteremias (7).
