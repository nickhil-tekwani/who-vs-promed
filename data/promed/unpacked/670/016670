Efforts to save the critically endangered shore plover from extinction in New Zealand have suffered a major setback: nearly 60 of the birds have died due to unknown causes, reducing the world population of the species to just 200.

Shore plovers (also known as shore dotterels or Tuturuatu, _Thinornis novaeseelandiae_) lived on both of New Zealand's main islands before European settlers introduced cats and rats that nearly eradicated the species during the 19th century. Luckily a small population of 130 birds survived 800 kilometers [497 mi] away on one of the country's smaller islands, South East Island (also known as Rangatira), from which a captive-breeding program began in the 1990s. The New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) has spent the last 20 years establishing small, additional populations on other New Zealand islands, including Portland Island (also known as Waikawa), where the dead birds were found at the end of 2012.

Until this unexpected tragedy the birds on Portland had been doing so well that some of the eggs laid there were being moved to other predator-free islands to fortify additional assurance populations. "This has a huge impact on the viability of the species," DOC team leader for shore plover recovery on Portland Island said earlier this month [February 2013] in a prepared release.

Portland Island is a privately owned sanctuary that to the best of the DOC's knowledge does not contain rats, cats, stoats (a type of weasel), or other bird-killing predators. DOC has now set up cameras and recently brought in dogs capable of sniffing out any stoats, but nothing has turned up. The department is also performing disease screenings and autopsies on the dead birds. At least one previously established island population failed when the birds contracted a disease called avian pox.

The remaining 20 shore plovers on Portland Island are now being closely monitored, while 12 eggs found at the end of last year [2012] have been moved to 2 other wildlife centers for incubation before being released on Mana Island, which should take place in March [2013].

Additional populations are also maintained on Rangitoto and Motutapu islands, which the DOC cleared of predators in 2011 before moving 17 plovers there in 2012. Most of the island reserves are far out to sea, too far from the mainland but close enough that the birds can fly from island to island. Mana Island, however, is just 3 kilometers [1.9 mi] from New Zealand's north island and the birds have been known to fly back to the mainland. In 2011 a group of 30 shore plovers flew from Mana Island to a mainland beach near Wellington.

The DOC has previously asked anyone sighting shore plovers on the mainland to report them so the department can try to recapture them and remove them to safety.

[The shore dotterel, shore plover, or Tuturuatu (_Thinornis novaeseelandiae_) is an endangered small species (20 cm/8 in in length) of plover endemic to New Zealand. See picture at http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/files/2013/02/shore-plover.jpg.

Some of the released birds can be seen in the video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=PsPZnPE5VLs.

There is not much information to speculate about a possible cause. It is encouraging to read that postmortem exams are being carried out. More data on the episode would be useful.
