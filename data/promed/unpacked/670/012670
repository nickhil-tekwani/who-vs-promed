The Ministry of Health has become aware of more than 160 cases of people
affected by an outbreak of Oropouche [virus], reported by the office of the
Director General of Epidemiology (DGE) in Bagazan, Pachica district in the
Mariscal Caceres province in San Martin [department (state equivalent)] at
the end of May [2010].

[Of these cases] 48 per cent were male and 52 per cent female. By age, 31
per cent were children up to 10 years, 23 per cent 11-20 years, 27 per cent
21-30 years, 13 per cent 31-40 years, and 6 per cent 41 years and over, as
reported by the DGE of the Ministry of Health [MINSA]. School absences have
been numerous (about 68 students).

Specialists explained that Oropouche virus is transmitted mainly by a
hematophagous (blood-sucking) midge named _Culicoides paraensis_. The fever
caused by the virus [infection] is similar to that caused by dengue (abrupt
onset, headache, anorexia, myalgia, joint pain, and vomiting). In some
patients, it can cause a clinical picture of asceptic meningitis, but
thanks to timely [medical] attention, this type of serious case has not
been reported [in the current outbreak].

Currently, MINSA action includes active case searching, taking of samples
and processing of samples taken from affected individuals. The 26 samples
taken were sent to the reference laboratory in Tarapoto. From there, they
were taken to the National Institutes of Health, where they were processed
for studies of etiologies of febrile syndromes. The results confirmed 16
cases (61 per cent) positive for Oropouche virus [infection].

The office of the San Martin Regional Health Director sent health personnel
of the Juanjui Hospital and of the Pachiza Health Post to the area of the
outbreak, to help with [medical] attention for the cases and in their
investigation. In addition, specialists in infectious diseases were sent
there to attend the cases. Also, analgesics and antibiotics were provided
to the health unit in Bagazan and the Juanjui Hospital. Meanwhile, the DGE
is carrying out the follow up for the outbreak in coordination with the
Epidemiology Office of the San Martin DIRESA [Direccion Regional de Salud;
Regional Health Directorate].

Oropouche virus was isolated in Peru for the 1st time in 1992 from febrile
patients in Iquitos. In 1994, this virus caused an epidemic in the south
east area of the Amazon region.
