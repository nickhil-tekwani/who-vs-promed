Local Shigella Outbreak Has Local Health Officials Worried
--------------------------
A highly contagious disease, shigellosis, is sweeping through several area
communities.
Shigellosis is a communicable disease which causes severe diarrhea. It is
caused by the bacteria _Shigella_ and is spread from one infected person to
the next by hand-to-mouth contact [a more polite way of referring to
fecal-oral transmission - Mod.LL].
On the South Plains of Texas, the disease is having a big impact on 3
communities: Lubbock, Levelland, and Brownfield. Most cases of shigellosis
occur among toddlers who are not fully toilet-trained.
The children at All God's Children Learning Center in Lubbock are learning
a very important life lesson early.
"We wash their hands before everything," says the day care's director,
Gloria Wellington. "After coming from home and before every activity the
first order of business is to wash hands."
It is an order of business which could prevent them from contracting
shigellosis.
"Children may not observe proper hygiene after going to the bathroom and
children put their hands in their mouths or in other children's mouths,"
says Ken Condon, a Disease Investigator for the City of Lubbock Health
Department. Condon says shigellosis has become and epidemic in the city
and that it's "keeping us very, very busy."
Right now, the Lubbock City Health Department is investigating 48 cases of
shigellosis and that's more than double the number of cases they tracked
last month.
Condon says _Shigella_ is "very highly contagious, it takes as little as 10
bacteria to transmit the bacteria from person to person and that's why we
are so eager to inform people to properly wash hands often using the
bathroom or before preparing foods."
And for the little ones at All God's Children Learning Center, washing
their hands is something they enjoy.
"Our teachers model what we teach to the kids. We have a song that we sing
just to reinforce in their little minds that every time you hear this song,
you need to wash your hands," says Wellington.
Without medical treatment, it takes about 24 to 48 hours for shigella to
exit your system. But officials say, even if you no longer have symptoms,
you are still contagious for sometime afterward.

[Indeed, this outbreak of shigellosis is typical; amplification often
occurs in schools or day care settings, where hand-washing and overall
hygiene may be suboptimal. From these settings, shigellosis may be brought
home to infect the older siblings or adults In the household. It is not
unusual for outbreaks to end when the schools go on vacation. - Mod.LL]
