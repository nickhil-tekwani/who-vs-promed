Regional authorities on [12 Mar 2018] kickstarted this year's major immunization effort as the 1st teams of veterinaries moved out the remote tundra area with vaccine doses against anthrax. In the course of the year [2018], at least 658 000 reindeer are to be vaccinated, the 1st 50 000 already in the course of March [2018], regional authorities say.

It is all part of an effort to prevent an outbreak of the deadly infection, similar to the one in 2016 when a young boy died and at least 115 people were hospitalized. Military personnel was sent to the region and burned more than 2300 infected reindeer in order to halt the spread of the infection. About 667 000 reindeer in the region were subsequently vaccinated in a huge immunization effort.

This year [2018], about 160 people will be engaged in the efforts. They will operate 30 stationary and 100 mobile vaccination units. It is the 2nd year in a row that they [have] mass vaccinated animals against anthrax, but the 1st time that they started [as early as] March.

According to regional chief veterinary Andrey Listishenko, spring time is the most practical and cheapest period for the vaccination effort. Furthermore, many reindeer herders have themselves requested vaccination at this time, he says in a press release. Listishenko and his people now have on hand a total of 520 000 doses and another 800 000 is to arrive in the course of the year. That will be sufficient both for this [2018] and next year [2019], the regional authorities say.

The 2016 anthrax outbreak is believed to have come from an old burial site with reindeer that died of the disease more than 70 years ago. Veterinary authorities fear that more outbreaks will occur as climate change is melting the tundra permafrost bringing more similar burials sites to the open. "There are thousands of such cattle graves across Russia and many of them are inside the Arctic Circle, says Sergey Netesov, chief of the bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology laboratory with Novosibirsk State university told the media.

Anthrax infections are lethal unless they are treated with antibiotics.

[They are starting early, which is wise. Last year [2017] they claimed that they would vaccinate 800 000 reindeer. But this year [2018] they appear to be more realistic as the proposed number for 2018 is 658 000 reindeer and they vaccinated 667 000 in 2016. A very significant challenge for the vaccinating teams, the organizers, and the reindeer owners. And it is March, winter is not over. We wish our Russian colleagues the very best of luck and good fortune, and may it be boring. When there are adventures it means that something has gone wrong.
