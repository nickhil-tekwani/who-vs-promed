Southern Sudan, 23 Nov 2006 [edited]



The public statement on avian influenza (AI) or bird flu situation in Juba
attributed to H.E. Dr Samson Kwaje, the GOSS Minister of Information and
Broadcasting by the United Nations Integrated Regional Information Networks
(IRIN News Agency) on 20 Nov 2006, has been totally taken out of context by
the media.

The Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries thus issues this PRESS
RELEASE to give a true picture of the AI situation in Juba and to clarify
contents of the mentioned statement. We strongly feel that the statement
given by H.E Dr Kwaje was largely misinterpreted. This Ministry confirms
that there has not been any AI human case reported (or confirmed) in Juba
where only infected and contact chickens and ducks have continued to be
sampled and destroyed since August 2006.

Upon receiving confirmation from the UK-based Weybridge International
Laboratory on 4 Sep 2006, MARF initially adopted policy of depopulation or
mass culling as an effective control measure but unfortunately could not
implement this policy for many technical reasons related to MARF technical
capacity and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE),
disinfectants, sampling kits and disposal kits always recommended in cases
like this.

However, medical teams from MARF and the Central Equatoria State Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Resources and Irrigation, in collaboration with FAO, WHO
and US Centre for Disease control (CDC) have continued to conduct surveys,
participatory disease search (PDS) and samples collection to assess the
extent of AI spread in Juba.

The sample collection, survey and PDS exercises have not yet been completed
but no more positive AI cases [in avians] have been serologically confirmed
since September 2006. In Southern Sudan, where only traditional backyard
poultry exists, compensation always remained to be debated and given
consideration should depopulation be an option.

[In his commentary to posting 20061122.3318 which included IRIN's news about
the current HPAI situation in southern Sudan, Mod.CP indicated and explained
the need to treat the news about the suspected human case in Juba with
extreme caution. The current official press release of the authorities fully
justifies his remark. Furthermore, it seems that the animal health situation
in south Sudan is also not as alarming as might have been concluded from
IRIN's newswire: according to the official statement, no positive serology
has been detected in poultry since September 2006.

As experienced elsewhere, media-distributed alarming or unclear avian
influenza pronouncements might instigate consumer hysteria, affecting local
and international markets of poultry and poultry products and the farming
industry as a whole. - Mod.AS]
