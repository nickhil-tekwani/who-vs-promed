Well, this is from GIDEON:
Info: _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection in Japan
The organism accounts for 45% to 60% of all food related infections.
Disease rates peak in August and September. Restaurants account for 40%.
4,063 outbreaks and 116,838 cases (5 fatal) were reported during 1980 to
1993 (including 100 outbreaks
and 3,124 cases in 1993). 224 incidents involving 5,849 cases were reported
in 1994; 245 incidents involving 5,515 cases in 1995.
Sure sounds like a major problem to me.

You sushi eaters are a brave (?) group! Dr. Ann Adams, FDA, Seafood
Products Research Center, Bothell, WA, confirmed my cowardice, with a 1997
Food Safety Farm to Table presentation.
Idaho's food rules, which are based on the FDA's Model Food Code, states:
Fishery products, other than molluscan shellfish, which are not thoroughly
cooked to one hundred and forty-five degrees Fahrenheit (145F) or above and
which are intended for raw, marinated or partially cooked consumption shall
have been or shall, before sale or service in ready-to-eat form, be blast
frozen at minus thirty-one degrees Fahrenheit (-31F) or below throughout
for fifteen (15) hours or conventionally frozen to minus four degrees
Fahrenheit (-4F) or below for one hundred and sixty-eight (168) hours
(seven (7) days).
Additionally, the person in charge [of the establishment must keep records
showing either that the above procedure was followed or have letters from
suppliers stipulating that the fishery products meet the requirement.
The "four hour rule" mentioned by Dr. Frankel, Hawaii, is also part of the
model code and Idaho's. "... when time is used as a public health control
in lieu of temperature..." It has many applications in the food industry,
including fast food (for example, when burgers are cooked in anticipation
of a lunch rush), in school lunch programs, feeding operations making sack
lunches, or one-time events with shortened serving hours (buffets).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final regulation (21
CFR 123) on December 15, 1995 which became effective on December 18, 1997
entitled "Procedures for the Safe and Sanitary Processing and Importing of
Fish and Fishery Products." The FDA also recently published the second
edition of the "Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide."
Within this guide is information which should prove helpful for the
discussion on sushi. Single copies of this Guide may be obtained as long as
supplies last from FDA district offices and from : U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, Office of Seafood, 200 C St. S.W., Washington, DC 20204
(202) 418-3133. Multiple copies may be obtained from National Technical
Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, (703) 487-4650. The Guide
is also available electronically at http://www.fda.gov. Select "foods;" then
select "seafood;" then select "HACCP." The U.S. Dept. of Health and Human
Services/ Public Health Service/ Food and Drug Administration also published
a document entitled "1997 Food Code." The Food Code is neither federal law or
federal regulation. It represents FDA's best advice for a uniform system of
regulation to ensure that food at retail is safe and properly protected and
presented. Information contained within this document is applicable for sushi
bars. Copies of this document can be obtained from National Technical
Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, (703) 487-4650 or by
accessing their website at http://www.ntis.gov. You should request report
number PB97-133656.

While I have no disagreement with the first three comments, they seem to
equate sushi with raw fish. Perhaps there is some confusion with sashimi,
which is indeed raw fish. Some sushi includes sashimi, but there are many
varieties of sushi which do not contain any raw fish. Rice is the basic
ingredient. Thus the health concerns are broader than those associated with
raw fish.
The primary concern in Hawaii related to sushi prepared in advance (as
opposed to prepared-to-order at a sushi bar) and then stored for some time
without refrigeration. This allowed for growth of potential
gastrointestinal pathogens or toxin-producing microorganisms, as the rice is
generally shaped by hand, and the sushi may contain egg, raw vegetables, and
a wide variety of foods.

Correction for Robin Lake:
The book he refers to is " New Guinea Tapeworms and Jewish
Grandmothers" and the author is Robert Desowitz.... as far as I know
SJ Gould doesn't write about parasites!

Robin Lake (March 18th, Sushi note [2 mentions Steven Jay Gould's book on
Jewish Grandmothers. He may well have written one, but I suspect Lake is
referring to "New Guinea Tapeworms and Jewish Grandmothers", by Robert
Desowitz (Avon Books, 1981), a book I recommend highly to all the students in
my epidemiology of foodborne disease and zoonoses courses.
Being a bone fide member of the Writers Union of Canada I am also somewhat
touchy on the subject of properly attributed authorship.
