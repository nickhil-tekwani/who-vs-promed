A teenage girl who has recovered from a rare case of wound botulism after a 77-day stay at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, California shared her story and experience on Thu 30 Mar 2017. The 14-year-old Escondido girl needed 6 surgeries and was partially paralyzed. She was the 1st case of wound botulism for Rady Children's Hospital chief of infectious disease, Dr. John Bradley.

In January 2017, the girl was doing cartwheels in the park with her sisters when she broke her arm. A week later she was re-admitted in the intensive care unit. She could not speak, and was partially paralyzed. Three days later, doctors said the protruding bone during the break attracted dirt in the park carrying the spores that can cause botulism.

"It wasn't something I was scared of. It was painful, but it wasn't frightening. I am very thankful for everyone who has helped me in this journey," she said.

Doctors said the girl is nearly fully recovered. She still has a tracheotomy, but the botulism is nearly gone. It will take 2 years to fully heal the broken bone, but it has not stopped [her] from doing more cartwheels.

Doctors said the CDC reported only 2-3 cases of wound botulism a year in the country. Health officials said although the botulism was found in the dirt at the park, there is no public health hazard because it can only survive in dead human tissue.

[Most cases of wound botulism are injection-related, linked to illicit injection drug use, particularly black tar heroin. In this case, however, the botulism, likely type A given the severity and length of symptoms, was related to an open arm fracture which allowed _Clostridium boutlinum_ spores in the environment to enter the body. Practically speaking, adequate surgical debridement of the open wound with removal of any necrotic, devitalized tissue should minimize the risk of germination of the spores into the vegetative bacillary form of _C. botulinum_. In the absence of any residual devitalized tissue, the bacterium (which is a strict anaerobe) cannot replicate and cannot elaborate the potent neurotoxin. The circumstances regarding the initial orthopedic approach to the open fracture are not specified in the posting. - Mod.LL
