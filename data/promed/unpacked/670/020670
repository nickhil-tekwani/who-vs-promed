[Note: the disease has been reported in 4 provinces: Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba, and Quebec. Information on the 58 outbreaks is available in the report archive at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_imm_0000015161_20140428_161445.pdf. - Mod.CRD]

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is not a federally reportable disease, but Canada has a Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network that has been used to monitor and report on the situation. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) supports the investigation led by the provinces and has confirmed the outbreaks in each of the affected provinces. The disease is now reportable in some provinces, including Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec. Canada advised the OIE on 5 Feb 2014 that Canada was experiencing cases of PED. Canada has so far experienced 4 outbreaks (including 2 clusters) of PEDv in 4 provinces with a total of 58 farms affected.

The 1st suspected case of PED in Canada was reported at a hog farm in southwestern Ontario on 22 Jan 2014, which was confirmed by the CFIA on 24 Jan 2014. The breakdown of the 58 outbreaks of PED on swine farms is: 54 in Ontario, one confirmed outbreak each in Prince Edward Island (PEI) and Quebec and 2 outbreaks in Manitoba. The latest cases were reported in Ontario on 22 Apr 2014. Outbreak information included in this report was provided to the CFIA by provincial animal health authorities.

Clinical signs observed include diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia; they were more severe in younger pigs. Mortality was also observed in young piglets. Sequencing of the PEDv strain from cases on farms in Canada has confirmed that they are similar to the strains circulating in the United States of America. Canada continues to implement control and prevention measures to reduce the risk of spread of this disease. These include the implementation of strict biosecurity measures at the farm, cleaning, and disinfection of trucks, and enhanced controls at the border. In addition, Canada continues to collect and integrate epidemiological information to better understand the risk factors for the introduction and spread of this virus. CFIA has import policies already in place to mitigate the risk of introduction of communicable swine diseases into Canada. Canada has considered the risk factors associated with PEDv transmission and the information can be found on the CFIA website at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/other-diseases/ped/eng/1392762503272/1392762576176.

[Canada is the 3rd country to notify the OIE of the presence of PED as an "emerging disease". Reporting an emerging animal disease is applied in rather exceptional (internationally agreed) circumstances, addressing disease entities, which are not included in OIE's list.

Maps of Canada can be seen at http://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/geott/atlas_tif/atlas6/Reference/English/can_eng.pdf and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2437483,12.

According to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, an "emerging disease" is defined as
"(1) a new infection or infestation resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic agent,
(2) a known infection or infestation spreading to a new geographic area or population, or
(3) a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the first time and which has a significant impact on animal or public health."

Canada's notification has been preceded by USA (see Pro-MED-mail post 20140423.2422215) and Japan (see ProMED-mail post 20140426.2431292). USA termed the newly introduced emerging disease as "swine novel enteric coronavirus disease", and the causal agent as "novel swine enteric coronavirus" (SECoV). In fact, the disease in the USA is reportedly caused by at least 2 emerging porcine coronaviruses, namely porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) and porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV). Japan, similarly to Canada, notified 'porcine epidemic diarrhea' as the disease entity, and the causal agent as 'porcine epidemic diarrhea virus'.

Prior to 2013, PED was known to be limited to European and Asian countries. It was first identified in the United States in May 2013 and was regarded as a newly introduced disease. The PED virus circulating in the US swine herd has been found to be 99.4 percent genetically homologous with a strain known to be circulating in China in 2012.

PED was confirmed in Japan in October 2013 after an absence of 7 years. Japan informed in its initial OIE notification that according to genetic analysis, viruses isolated from its cases in October and November 2013 were close to the viruses isolated in the People's Republic of China and the United States of America in 2013. The route the virus spread (from eastern Asia?) to the USA (and, most likely, further to Canada) remains to be established.

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is a viral disease of swine caused by a coronavirus and characterised by watery diarrhoea and emaciation affecting all ages of pigs. Clinical signs include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. The disease is clinically similar to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). The disease was first reported in the UK in 1971 and was subsequently identified in many other European countries, China, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, and Viet Nam.

PED is restricted to porcines. It is not zoonotic.
