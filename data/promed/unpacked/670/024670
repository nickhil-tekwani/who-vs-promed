[More information on the actual situation of rabies, both animal and human,
in Costa Rica would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP
I am responding from south-central Costa Rica, not far from the location of
the recent human and cat cases. ANIMAL PEOPLE publisher Kim Bartlett and I
were the keynote speakers for the animal welfare section of the biennial
conference of the Collegio de Veterinarios de Costa Rica. We learned of the
rabies cases just before leaving the US, and incorporated much relevant
information into our presentations.
According to Gerardo Vicentre, DVM, of the Veterinary Licensing Board of
Costa Rica, only about 3 percent of the Costa Rican dog population is
currently vaccinated against rabies. Previous to the recent outbreak, few
veterinarians and none of the several active animal welfare organizations
in Costa Rica had stressed vaccination against rabies, and our previous
warnings that they should, had been shrugged off because of the long gap
between human, canine, and feline rabies cases.
However, there evident great interest in rabies at the conference, and
previously scheduled lectures on rabies in bats and cattle were
well-attended. Follow-up questions focused on what vaccinations to use.
Some veterinarians were unfamiliar with Imrab (a brand of rabies vaccine),
having never been asked to vaccinate a dog or cat in a dozen-odd years of
practice, and most of the attendees seemed unfamiliar with Raboral (an oral
form of rabies vaccine). There were many questions about the temperatures
vaccines should be stored and transported at, the expiry dates of vaccines,
and the advisability of combining anti-rabies vaccination with other types
of vaccination.
Even though Costa Rican vets and animal welfare workers have not taken
rabies seriously before, they are taking it seriously now. 4 out of the 5
most active animal welfare organizations in Costa Rica were represented at
the conference, and all 4 agreed to add anti-rabies vaccination to their
present dog and cat sterilization programs (one, managed by a U.S.
immigrant, already had). I have been surveying dog and cat populations and
care standards in the various different ecological zones of Costa Rica. Of
the 336 dogs I have counted, 207 were free-roaming, although just 47
appeared to be possibly without regular caretakers, a very low ratio for
Latin America, and only 33 were puppies, an extremely low ratio. Along the
west coast, 73 of 108 were free-roaming. This could be associated with a
higher risk of rabies spreading, if it enters the canine population -- and
adds urgency to the need to vaccinate.
Fortunately, most of the people who have dogs appear to take good care of
them, as best they know how. The dogs roam free because relatively few of
the houses have fenced yards, outside of the capital city of San Jose, and
it is widely believed to be cruel to keep a dog tied up. Since the people
do care about their dogs, convincing them to vaccinate should be relatively
easy: the vets and animal welfare workers just need to make the effort, and
make vaccination widely and inexpensively available.
The cat population of Costa Rica is also mostly free-roaming, but very
small. We have encountered only 1 community in nearly 2 weeks which even
had an acknowledged feral cat problem, and have seen feral cats in only 3
areas, all of which had already largely eliminated free-roaming unowned
dogs through sterilization programs.

[It is astounding that some veterinarians have never been asked to vaccine
against this disease. It is also reassuring to know they are taking the
disease seriously. As always, education is a powerful tool. - Mod.TG
