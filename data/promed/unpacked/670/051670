On Thursday evening, 10 Sep [2020], the Norwegian Veterinary Institute notified the Norwegian Food Safety Authority of a confirmed case of CWD (chronic wasting disease) in a wild reindeer shot during the ordinary hunt on the Hardanger plateau in central southern Norway. Material from a lymph node tested positive, while brain tissue was negative.

This is the 1st case of classical CWD in reindeer identified outside the Nordfjella zone 1, where the disease was 1st detected in 2016. At that time, the Nordfjella zone 1 wild reindeer population was culled to avoid the possibility of the disease spreading further. In Norway, this classical type of CWD has previously only been detected in wild reindeer from Nordfjella zone 1.

Two types of CWD prions have been identified in Norway. In wild reindeer, this prion seems to be contagious (classical CWD) as opposed to 7 cases in moose and one red deer where it has probably occurred spontaneously in older animals (atypical CWD). CWD is a deadly prion disease for cervids but has never been detected in humans.

This last CWD-positive wild reindeer was shot in the south part of Hardangervidda in Vinje municipality.

Hardangervidda is northern Europe's most extensive mountain plateau and Norway's largest wild reindeer area with around 8000 to 10 000 animals.

Since 2016, more than 100 000 cervids have been tested for CWD in Norway. From Hardangervidda, 3520 wild reindeer have been tested and found to be CWD negative. Of these, 518 have been tested already in 2020 without positive findings.

[It sounds like some massive culls to control a disease whose occurrence is extremely concerning. This report mentions over 100 000 animals have been tested, but it does not tell us the percentage of positives. By visiting https://www.vetinst.no/nyheter/surveillance-and-eradication-efforts-towards-cwd#sthash.Zu8KuZzw.dpuf you can see a 3-minute video of Jorn Vage, CWD coordinator at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute, explaining how and why the government is using massive culls in one particular region to try and control CWD. They are most concerned about the spread of this disease. - Mod.TG
