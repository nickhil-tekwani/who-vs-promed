Crown rot a menace
------------------
No-till farmers may have to reconsider their rotations to minimise the impact of the fungal disease crown rot. There were widespread reports of yield penalties in wheat of around 20 percent in the Victorian Mallee attributable to crown rot, while in the northern cropping zone it was also a major issue. The hot and dry finish to the season in these regions exacerbated the problems.

Birchip Cropping Group's (BCG) Simon Craig said it could now be regarded as the most severe fungal disease in wheat, especially as it is difficult to control with fungicides. He said that many Mallee crops that did not do as well as expected may have suffered from crown rot.

Mr Craig said the problem had been building since 2010 when there was a massive amount of stubble. "It is an especially big problem in low rainfall zones on heavier soil types. There is a yield penalty with all lines, but the shorter season ones are less susceptible.

"It really takes a 2-year break to lower inoculum levels. It's well worth it, we're seeing yield losses of up to 40 percent and that is a lot of money."

[Crown rot of wheat is caused in most areas mainly by the fungus _Fusarium pseudograminearum_. Other fungal species (such as _F. culmorum_) are also reported to be associated with the disease in some locations (including the area in the item above). It is a serious disease of cereals such as bread wheats (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheats (_T. turgidum_; used for example for pasta), barley (_Hordeum vulgare_), and triticale (wheat/rye hybrids) with reported yield losses of up to 40 percent. For example, annual losses of AUD 56 million [about USD 50 million] are estimated in Australia. Infection is favoured by good crop conditions in the 1st part of the season followed by dry conditions during flowering and grain filling. These conditions lead to the production of 'deadheads' or 'whiteheads' containing pinched seed or no seed at all.

The pathogen survives from one season to the next on infected crop stubble and other plant debris. Spores can be spread by wind, contaminated materials, and mechanical means. Crown rot incidence increases with continuous cropping of wheat and conservation cropping (such as no-till systems). Disease management may include control of grassy reservoir hosts, crop rotation with broad-leaf non-hosts (for example brassicas or legumes), and burning of infected stubble. Some tolerant varieties of bread wheat are available, but effective genetic resistance in the highly susceptible durum wheats as well as in barley still needs to be identified. Resistance breeding programmes are ongoing.
