[This is confirmation of a new case in Glasgow & Clyde. This series
started officially with the death of a man in Glasgow on 16 Dec 2009.
A Eurosurveillance Report was released on 14 Jan 2010, when there were
14 cases and 7 deaths; see Anthrax - UK (07): (Scotland)
20100120.0231. It is now 11 weeks later, and there are 31 cases and 11
deaths. In that mid-January 2010 report, it stated: "The distribution
of cases suggests either that small batches of contaminated heroin may
still be circulating in Scotland or that there is a continuing source
of contamination in material used to cut (dilute down) the heroin
before supply to end users. Further investigations are proceeding to
try to trace the supply network and validate the existing hypothesis."

Unfortunately, we are beginning to see uninformed speculation in the
international press about potential greater risks posed by these
events. Unless it were to put the UK forensic investigations at risk,
it would be very useful to have an informed update to calm the heated
speculation. - Mod.MHJ]
