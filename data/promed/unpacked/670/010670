Statement - Investigation into local outbreak of rabbit haemorrhagic disease in Quebec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is investigating a local outbreak of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in small hobby farms in Eastern Quebec.

Three farms near Rimouski, Quebec, are currently under investigation and quarantine to control the movement of animals, products and equipment to prevent the disease from spreading. The outbreak is restricted to small hobby farms. Commercial rabbit farms are currently not involved in this investigation.

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease is highly contagious and often deadly to affected rabbits. It is a virus that spreads between rabbits through secretions including saliva, runny eyes and nose, urine, feces and contaminated bedding, food and water. It can also be spread accidentally by humans, wildlife and insects or on infected meat or fur.

The disease does not affect humans and is not known to affect other animals.

Commercial and backyard farmers are reminded to practice biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of spreading the disease. Farmers should:

- report any suspicious signs immediately to a veterinarian or the provincial veterinary authority, and
- avoid bringing in new rabbits from a location where there has been illness or death in the previous 60 days.

The CFIA is working with the Province of Quebec on this investigation and will provide updates as they become available.

[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is an extremely contagious and often fatal viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. This disease affects only rabbits of the species _Oryctolagus cuniculus_.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus _Lagovirus_ and family _Caliciviridae_. Many strains of RHDV appear to circulate in rabbit populations; these viruses can have distinct epidemiological and genetic characteristics. Only a single serotype is known, but 2 major subtypes exist: RHDV and the antigenic variant RHDVa. Nonpathogenic strains of RHDV have been identified in wild rabbits. One recent study suggests that different lineages of RHDV may have repeatedly emerged as epidemic viruses.

RHD is endemic in Australia, New Zealand, Cuba, parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. Outbreaks have also been reported from domesticated rabbits in the Middle East and the Americas" (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf).

According to recent publications, the emerging lagovirus rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) has been described as a strain that infects not only rabbits but also hares (http://tinyurl.com/pttjtp5).

RHDV2 is less virulent and with lower observed mortality rates than RHDV and RHDVa. However, the disease resulting from RHDV2 is longer in duration and will take a chronic or subacute course more often than RHD caused by the other viral strains (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3848706/).

Subscribers may want to refer to these 2 interesting articles which describe this new strain:

Camarda A, Pugliese N, Cavadini P, et al. Detection of the new emerging rabbit hemorrhagic disease type 2 virus (RHDV2) in Sicily from rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus). Res Vet Sci. 2014; 97(3); 642-5. http://tinyurl.com/pttjtp5
and

There is no indication that exposure to RHDV is associated with infection or disease in humans.

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease, Canada
------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 25 Aug 2016 from Dr Martine Dubuc, OIE Delegate for Canada, Chief Food Safety Officer Vice-President, Science Branch, Health Ministry, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canada

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 13 Aug 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 23 Aug 2016
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 30 Mar 2011
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Calcivirus
Serotype: RHDV2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (QUE-2016-001): Mont-Joli, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Aug 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 23 / 18 / 18 / 2 / - /
Affected population: Hobby rabbit farm (companion animals).

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rabbits/ 78.26 / 78.26 / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive; introduction of new live animals
Epidemiological comments: New rabbits were introduced from another farm recently, with high mortality observed in the following days. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has initiated an investigation, in collaboration with the Ministere de l'Agriculture, des Pecheries et de l'Alimentation du Quebec in order to identify possible sources of infection. Quarantine measures have been implemented, under the authority of the CFIA. On Aug 23, 2016, the National Center for Foreign Animal Disease (Winnipeg, CFIA) confirmed the presence of RHDV2. A 350 base pair RT-PCR amplicon representing 3' end of VP60 gene was sequenced. The sequence showed 96.2 percent identity to RHDVb (or RHDV2) isolate (GenBank: KT000337.1) from Sao Jorge in Azores Islands.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; traceability; quarantine; stamping out; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection/disinfestation

[The "new" RHDV (provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb) emerged in France in 2010 in wild and farmed vaccinated rabbits, and rapidly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean basin (Malta and Tunisia), and also in Australia in 2015. According to Le Gall-Recul√© et al. (2013), RHDV2 did not derive from classical RHDV, but rather it originated as a 2nd emergence of unknown origin. Antigenic and disease protection data led to it being classified RHDV2 as a second RHDV serotype. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf
