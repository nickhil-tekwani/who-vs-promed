[SJB] isn't getting much sleep these days. She's up in the middle of the night, checking the horses on her Cedar Creek Farm in Melancthon, just north of Shelburne, Ontario. She's said she's afraid of what may happen while her eyes are closed.

[SJB] has lived her life alongside horses, working for Thoroughbred breeding farms before opening Cedar Creek. She has managed horses through outbreaks of strangles and MRSA, but said she's never seen anything like the strain of neurologic EHV-1, which has come to her farm. Ontario's Office of the Chief Veterinarian released an update 21 May 2020 stating 3 horses at a farm in Dufferin County "with an epidemiological link" to an EHV-1 outbreak at Woodbine had tested positive for the highly contagious disease.

"My blood pressure has gone up," she said. "I'm afraid if I do go to sleep, I'm going to miss something. I'm checking the barn during the night."

Since then, [SJB] said, all her horses have been tested 3 times. The 1st round of tests came back negative, but several horses subsequently developed signs characteristic of neurologic EHV-1. Three have died, and another 5 are at the Ontario Veterinary College's hospital at the University of Guelph with similar signs. [SJB] said she is still awaiting test results from samples taken from her horses last week and on Monday [25 May 2020], and expressed frustration that results have been so slow in coming.

On Tuesday [26 May 2020] evening, [SJB] was making the drive back to Cedar Creek from the University of Guelph after hauling the 5th horse to the hospital. So far, the horses she has lost include a beloved children's lesson horse, a 28-year-old retiree, and a boarded horse doted on by its owner.

Interestingly, [SJB] said no horses have been into her farm for roughly a month prior to the outbreak at Woodbine. She believes, however, that a trainer based at Woodbine may have brought the disease to the property when he visited Cedar Creek after caring for a sick horse at the track just after the outbreak at Woodbine began. Cedar Creek is home to Thoroughbred broodmares, yearlings, 2-year-olds, and lay-up horses as well as a small boarding and lesson operation.

As soon as she got word there may be a transfer of the disease from Woodbine, [SJB] divided Cedar Creek into 3 zones based on potential exposure, put out foot baths for boots, and began disinfecting everything she could. All her horses, including those having died, have been vaccinated for equine herpesvirus, but there isn't a vaccine specifically for the neurologic strain of EHV-1. She turned horses out who could live outside round the clock to minimize their exposure to people and other horses possibly having been exposed.

"Our test results all came back negative, so I thought I was okay, but I still shut the farm down," she said. "If I hadn't, I probably would have lost a lot more. We treated it as if we could still have it but didn't know."

[SJB] is begging her fellow horsemen to take the disease seriously and take all the biosecurity precautions they can, especially if they are going between barns of sick and healthy horses.

"They need to completely shower, change boots, and use boot wash and hand sanitizer," she said. "These [sick] horses did not have contact with whatever horse the trainer touched. They were just in the barn with him. This strain is mind-blowing. When they go down, there is no helping them. I don't want this to happen to anybody."

Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) officials have confirmed a 14-year-old Paint mare in Linn County with the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Seventeen additional horses were exposed. The affected horse is reported as alive, and the premises has been quarantined.

EHV 101
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread. [Routine hygiene may not be enough. Showering between infected and non-infected animals may be equally important as is a complete change of clothes and especially footwear. This virus is apparently robust, so please take extra precautions. - Mod.TG]

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[Regarding the 1st article, from Canada:
This is a phenomenally heartbreaking piece about the neurological form of equine herpesvirus. The available vaccine does not prevent, or even lessen, the effects of the neurological form of this disease.

It is heartbreaking in the sense that no one seems to be working on a vaccine. Pets, large or small, or livestock of any form are important to their owners. Horses are often classified as companion animals and, indeed, some horses assist some individuals as service animals. Caring for animals evokes tremendous emotions, and the loss of one is very painful and emotionally distressing. As many horse owners have lost horses to this horrible disease, it is incredible there is no word of a company, research group, or government entity tackling this horrible disease. It seems that horse owners' pleas and cries for someone to tackle this disease fall on deaf ears.

This is a great story in taking biosecurity seriously. This manager/owner/horse lover is doing everything right: preventing contact with ill horse, showering, changing clothes and boots between barns or groups of horses, and likely taking temperatures of the animals. She expresses great empathy in not wanting her situation to happen to anyone else.

The old adage of "don't track it back" takes on new meaning here, as possibly a trainer who failed to take proper personal biosecurity measures after caring for an ill horse tracked the disease to this facility. If no other horses have been to the property in over a month, then it seems likely this disease rode in on a person.

Concerning both articles:
Biosecurity can be taken one step farther. Tire washes of vehicles can be done, especially if a vehicle is going into a pasture.

Biological security of a premises is huge and is no easy task and requires hypervigilance all the time, 24/7. Diseases never sleep. Neither should measures to protect yourself and your animals.

Hopefully -- wishfully -- someone will soon develop a vaccine to prevent the neurological form of this nasty disease. - Mod.TG
