Restrictions have been put in place around a Lancashire farm after bird flu was detected. The H5N8 strain of avian flu was confirmed in a small backyard flock of chickens at the farm near Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire. A 3km [1.9 mi] protection zone and a 10km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been put in place around the infected premises to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said: "The flock is estimated to contain around 30 birds. A number have died and the remaining live birds at the premises are being humanely culled. "A full investigation is under way to determine the source of the infection. Public Health England advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency is clear that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers."

[The most recent DEFRA update of the periodic risk assessment for the incursion of HPAI H5N8 into the UK's poultry premises during the spring to summer season, issued [Thu 27 Apr 2017], includes the following "conclusions" passage:

"This assessment looks at the risk of further poultry or captive bird outbreaks of H5N8 HPAI, given the reduction in cases in Europe and the lifting of disease control zones in GB. There is a lack of data, but given that there is a medium risk of wild bird infection still being present in some areas of GB and the potential for occasional outbreaks to continue to occur, it was determined that the overall risk should be assessed as low, which is defined as "outbreaks are rare but can occur occasionally".

The risk level will be kept under review with the changing seasons, migration patterns and disease level elsewhere". Subscribers are encouraged to visit the full, exhaustive assessment at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/611566/qra-avian-flu-spring2017.pdf.
