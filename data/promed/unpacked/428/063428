Recall information
------------------
- On 9 Mar 2020, Sun Hong Foods, Inc. recalled enoki mushrooms because they may be contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria.
- Enoki mushrooms are white, with long stems and small caps.
- Enoki mushrooms from Sun Hong Foods were sold in 7.05 oz / 200 g clear plastic packaging with a green label.
- "Product of Korea" is labeled on the front of the packaging, and "Sun Hong Foods, Inc." is labeled on the back of the packaging underneath the bar code. These products can also be identified by the UPC code: 7 426852 625810.
- This investigation is ongoing to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness.

Advice to consumers, food service operators, and retailers
----------------------------------------------------------
- Do not eat, serve, or sell any recalled enoki mushrooms distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc.
- Check your refrigerator for recalled enoki mushrooms. Return them to the purchase location or throw them away.
- Do not eat any food made with recalled enoki mushrooms, even if some was consumed and no one became sick.
- Wash and sanitize any surfaces and containers that may have come in contact with the recalled enoki mushrooms. Listeria can survive in refrigerated temperatures and can easily spread to other foods and surfaces.
* Follow the 5 steps to clean your refrigerator at [https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/clean-refrigerator-steps.html]:
* Wash surfaces with hot, soapy water.
* Wash containers with hot, soapy water or clean in the dishwasher.
- Call your healthcare provider if you have consumed recalled enoki mushrooms and are experiencing symptoms of _Listeria_ infection.

Until we learn more about the source and distribution of the enoki mushrooms, CDC advises that people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infections -- pregnant women, adults ages 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer or on dialysis -- avoid eating any enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea".
- At home, check your refrigerator for enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea".
- If you have them, don't eat them and throw them out.
- If you have them, wash and sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators where they were stored. Follow these fiv5e steps to clean your refrigerator [https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/clean-refrigerator-steps.html].
- When you buy, order, or eat out, check with stores and restaurants that they do not use enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea".
- If they don't know where their enoki mushrooms are from, don't buy or order the product.
- Call your healthcare provider if you have consumed enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea" and are experiencing symptoms of Listeria infection.

Latest outbreak information
---------------------------
- 36 people infected with the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ have been reported from 17 states.
- Illnesses started on dates ranging from [23 Nov 2016] to [13 Dec 2019].
- 30 hospitalizations have been reported. 4 deaths have been reported from California, Hawaii, and New Jersey.
- 6 pregnancy-associated cases have been reported, of which 2 resulted in fetal loss.
- Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea" are the likely source of this outbreak.
- On [9 Mar 2020], Sun Hong Foods, Inc. recalled enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea" because they may be contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ bacteria.
- This investigation is ongoing to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

Investigation details: [10 Mar 2020]
------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _L. monocytogenes_ infections linked to enoki mushrooms.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of [9 Mar 2020], 36 people infected with the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ have been reported from 17 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page [available at the source URL above].

_Listeria_ samples from ill people were collected from [23 Nov 2016] to [13 Dec 2019]. Ill people range in age from less than 1 to 97 years, with a median age of 67. Fifty-eight percent of ill people are female. Of 32 ill people with information available, 30 hospitalizations have been reported. 4 deaths have been reported from California, Hawaii, and New Jersey. 6 cases are pregnancy-associated and 2 resulted in fetal loss.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea" are the likely source of this outbreak.

State and local public health officials interviewed ill people about the foods they ate in the month before they became ill. 12 out of 22 (55%) reported eating mushrooms, including enoki, portobello, white, button, cremini, wood ear, maitake, and oyster.

Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development collected mushrooms for testing from a grocery store where an ill person purchased enoki mushrooms. 2 samples of enoki mushrooms yielded the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_. These mushrooms are labeled as "Product of Korea" and were distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. Additional product testing is ongoing in California.

On [9 Mar 2020], Sun Hong Foods, Inc. recalled enoki mushrooms (UPC 7 426852 625810) labeled as "Product of Korea". Consumers, food service operators, and retailers should not eat, serve, or sell recalled enoki mushrooms. Enoki mushrooms distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. do not account for all illnesses in this outbreak. FDA is working to identify the source of the enoki mushrooms distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. and determine if other distributors received the same enoki mushrooms.

CDC is concerned that enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea" may be contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ and are advising people at higher risk -- pregnant women, adults ages 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems -- to avoid eating any enoki mushrooms labeled as "Product of Korea", until investigators determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness.

CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[In the USA, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet also works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source. - Mod.ML
