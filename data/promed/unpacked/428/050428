Influenza activity in the southern hemisphere: a preliminary look at
the winter 2007 season
-----------------------------------------------
Human seasonal influenza occurs in the northern and southern
hemispheres in epidemics in the colder months of the year. These vary
annually in their mix of viruses (which constantly evolve), the
severity of the illness and the fit with the vaccine composition,
which is reviewed annually by the World Health Organization (WHO) for
each hemisphere [1]. Those in Europe responsible for influenza
prevention and recommending immunization for those at risk are always
interested in how severe the coming winter season will be. That
interest is highest in August and September, when preparations are
being made for immunization campaigns. One clue can come from the
severity of the winter epidemics in the southern hemisphere, which is
coming to an end at about that time.
There have been a few unusual and widely reported influenza cases in
some parts of the southern hemisphere this [2007] season [2]. In
Australia, several states have reported a higher number of cases this
winter, with Queensland and New South Wales particularly affected.
Six children under the age of 5 who contracted influenza A this year
have died; the cases were in Western Australia, Queensland and New
South Wales. The predominant strain circulating in Australia is
A(H3N2), although A(H1N1) has also been seen widely in some states.
The country has only experienced low levels of influenza B activity
this season.
In contrast, Chile has had a rise in cases from last year [2006], but
not as many as in 2004; incidence has also been falling since week 28
[3]. The regular vaccination campaign there targeting the elderly,
those with chronic diseases, public health workers, pregnant women,
infants and workers in the avian industry was launched in March 2007;
3.2 million doses were given. H3N2 has been the predominant strain in
Chile this season [2007]. This has also been the case in Argentina:
in week 20, 10 samples were characterized as A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like
(H3N2); in week 21, 7 samples were characterized as
A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like (H3N2); and in week 22, 11 samples were
characterized as A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like (H3N2) [4].
In equatorial regions (where influenza is less seasonal), the
experience was also unexceptional. In China, the Philippines,
Thailand and Malaysia, the predominant strain this season [2007] has
been A (H3N2), with A(H1N1) and B also present [4]. According to the
WHO's summary of seasonal influenza activity in the world, last
updated in March 2007, Hong Kong saw a high level of A(H3N2) activity
in weeks 8-11 [5].
Sri Lanka has seen a lot of A(H1N1) activity this season [2007],
while in Singapore, it has been the B virus that has been most
reported [3]. In contrast to Australia, New Zealand has been having a
relatively mild influenza season in 2007 so far, with a mix of
A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and some B viruses circulating [1]. South Africa,
which saw a peak of activity in weeks 29 and 30, has had both A and B
viruses in roughly equal proportions, with H1N1 viruses more common
than H3N2 so far [4].
In summary, therefore, apart from the unusual cases in children in
Australia, the 2007 influenza season in the southern hemisphere has
not been exceptional, either in the number of cases being reported or
the strains circulating [4]. Those strains that have been seen were
also seen in the northern hemisphere in its last season [2006], and
most of them are included in the current vaccine for the southern
hemisphere this season (an A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus, an
A/Wisconsin/67/2005(H3N2)-like virus and a B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like
virus). As was seen in the northern hemisphere's 2006/07 season,
A(H3N2) strains in the southern hemisphere have not reacted well to
antiserum A/Wisconsin/67/2005 [4]. The WHO will formally address the
southern hemisphere experience in its coming regular consultation for
selection of vaccine strains [6].
