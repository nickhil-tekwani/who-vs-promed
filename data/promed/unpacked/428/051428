From 3 Nov through 8 Dec 2019, 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of yellow fever including 2 deaths (case fatality rate = 67%) were detected through the national surveillance system in Mali. The 1st case-patient was a 15-year-old girl from a village in Kati district, Koulikoro region, Mali. The 2nd and 3rd cases were in 17- and 25-year-old men, nationals from Cote d'Ivoire, living in the district of Bouguimi, Sikasso region, Mali. All 3 cases tested positive for yellow fever by immunoglobulin M (IgM) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 3 Dec 2019 at Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD). The 1st case was not vaccinated against yellow fever and had no travel history outside of Kati district. Meanwhile, the vaccination status for the other 2 cases was unknown.

Additionally, there were 9 suspected and 3 probable cases reported from the Bouguimi district, including 3 deaths among the probable cases. The age of the suspected, probable, and confirmed cases ranges between 1 and 33 years, and the male-to-female ratio is 2:1. Among the reported symptoms, fever, jaundice, and vomiting were the most common. There are 8 health areas of Bouguimi health district that have been affected, with Manakoro (4 cases) and Mafele (3 cases) reporting the highest number. One suspected case is pending for confirmation at the Institute Pasteur Dakar laboratory.

On 5 Dec 2019, the government of Mali officially declared a yellow fever outbreak in 2 regions of Sikasso and Koulikoro.

Public health response
- An emergency operations centre (EOC) for public health coordination of the outbreak in the regions of Sikasso, Koulikoro, and the affected districts has been set up. In addition, an EOC has been activated in Bamako city.
- A multidisciplinary rapid response team was deployed to conduct investigations in the affected districts of Sikasso and Koulikoro regions. A plan to conduct an in-depth entomological survey is underway.
- Enhanced epidemiological surveillance, including active case finding in both the affected districts, has been strengthened.
- A comprehensive response plan is being developed with specific objectives, including the preparation for an international-coordination-group (ICG) request to conduct a yellow fever reactive mass-vaccination campaign.
- Risk communication capacity through involvement of relevant stakeholders [is being provided], as well as public communication and awareness efforts on yellow fever (signs, symptoms, and vaccinations), including prevention measures.
- On 3 Dec 2019, a joint investigation team (WHO Country Office and Ministry of Health) was deployed to characterize the risk and develop an intervention plan. Field investigations indicate vaccination coverage under 80% in Kati and 88% in Manakoro districts.

WHO risk assessment

Although population immunity in the southern regions of Mali has benefited from large-scale preventive mass vaccination campaigns in 2008 (5.8 million people protected) combined with nationwide children routine immunization since 2002, the overall national routine immunization coverage for yellow fever in 2018 was estimated to be 67%, with estimates nearly 80% in the non-desert areas (including the recently affected Koulikoro and Sissako regions). This is below herd immunity thresholds and may indicate the presence of pockets of low immunity in the country. Kati district in Koulikoro region is located proximal to the capital city, Bamako, an urban city with more than 2 million inhabitants, and Bouguimi district in Sikasso region borders with Cote d'Ivoire.

The high population movements within Mali and across borders increases the risk of national and regional spread, and this may have diluted the population immunity. The geographical distribution of the virus, coupled with suboptimal vaccination coverage, and the presence of susceptible populations presents a risk of amplification. Furthermore, the protracted humanitarian crisis and concomitant ongoing outbreaks of epidemic-prone diseases (measles, dengue) may impact the response due to competing limited resources.

Based on available information, WHO assesses the overall risk as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.

WHO advice

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure, and fever, and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections, is recommended.

Mali is a high-priority country for the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemic (EYE) strategy. Vaccination is the primary intervention for prevention and control of yellow fever. In urban centres, targeted vector control measures are also helpful to interrupt transmission. WHO and partners will continue to support local authorities to implement interventions necessary to control the current outbreak.

WHO recommends vaccination against yellow fever for all international travellers more than 9 months of age going to areas south of the Sahara Desert in Mali. The vaccine is contraindicated in children aged less than 6 months and is not recommended for those aged 6-8 months, except during epidemics when the risk of infection with yellow fever virus may be very high. Other contraindications for yellow fever vaccination are severe hypersensitivity to egg and severe immunodeficiency. Caution is recommended before vaccinating people aged above 60 years against yellow fever.

WHO does not recommend vaccination for travellers whose itineraries are limited to areas within the Sahara Desert. Vaccination is recommended, if indicated, for pregnant or breastfeeding women travelling to endemic areas when such travel cannot be avoided or postponed. Mali requires as a condition of entry a yellow fever vaccination certificate for all travellers aged one year or over.

Yellow fever vaccines recommended by WHO are safe and highly effective and provide life-long protection against infection. In accordance with the IHR (2005) 3rd edition, the validity of the international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever extends to the life of the person vaccinated with a WHO-approved vaccine. For both existing or new certificates, revaccination or a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine cannot be required of international travellers as a condition of entry into a state party, regardless of the date their international certificate of vaccination was initially issued.

On 1 Jul 2019, WHO updated the areas at risk of yellow fever transmission and the corresponding recommendations for vaccination of international travelers. The list of countries at risk and revised recommendations for vaccination against yellow fever are available on the WHO website (International travel and health (ITH), https://www.who.int/ith/en/).

WHO encourage its member states to take all actions necessary to keep travellers well informed of risks and preventive measures including vaccination. Travelers should also be made aware of yellow fever signs and symptoms and instructed to seek rapid medical advice should they develop signs of illness. Travellers returning to Mali who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Mali on the basis of the information available on this outbreak.

[This updated report includes information about 9 suspected and 3 probable yellow fever (YF) cases that were not mentioned in previous reports, indicating that the outbreak was more extensive than originally stated, with an outbreak declared by government authorities in the 2 regions. These additional cases may have been a result of the additional surveillance that has been undertaken. Since vaccination coverage has been found to be less than 80% and 88% in Kati and Manakoro districts, respectively, presumably the preventive measures mentioned will include vaccination. The entomological survey will be an important factor in risk assessment. The presence of abundant populations of the mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_, would be of concern, raising the possibility of urban transmission of YF virus that might get out of hand quickly. - Mod.TY
