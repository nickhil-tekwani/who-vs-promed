''Worst crisis ever'' hits strawberry crop
------------------------------------------
[Straw]berry crops have been hit by the worst crisis ever: a fungus which causes berries to rapidly rot started infecting plants in the southern counties of Agder [and] is now moving north.

"We've never seen anything like this," said Roger Utengen of fruit and vegetable wholesaler Bama. "There has never been so much damage to the strawberry crop as right now." Bama has lost at least 40 per cent of the berries. Norway's agriculture directorate is also well aware of the problem.

Bama Rogaland has delivered 244 fewer tons of berries than last year [2015]. Some producers have lost 95 per cent of their crop. Norway's largest farmers' organization, Bondelaget, worries that the fungus is a result of a rainy pre-season but also that it has become resistant to the "normal" pesticides sprayed on berries.

"The situation is serious for various producers and it will have major consequences for growers if this is a resistance problem," Lars Petter Bartnes stated on the organization's website. Farmers often receive state compensation for crops lost to weather problems, but not for fungus attacks, urging a study of resistance patterns and find the cause of this year's [2016] fungus.

[Fruit rots of strawberry can be caused by a number of fungi in a range of genera, including species of _Botrytis_ (grey mould), _Alternaria_, and _Glomerella_ (anthracnose). These pathogens are often favoured by humid conditions. Emergence of fungicide resistant fungal strains, as suspected above, is a continuing threat to many crops. It may be delayed by mixing different fungicide classes and counteracted by ongoing breeding programmes for resistant crop cultivars.

Reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s), as well as identification of any potential new strains (as suggested above) associated with the problems in Norway would be needed for the strawberry industry in the country.
