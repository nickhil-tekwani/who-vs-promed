Local governments and cattle-breeding businesses across the nation
have begun efforts to protect stud bulls of brand-beef cattle from
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] by dispersing them across multiple
locations.

The move comes after the Miyazaki prefectural government was forced
to kill stud bulls that had been or were suspected to have been
infected by the disease.

According to a Yomiuri Shimbun survey of 46 prefectures -- all except
Miyazaki Prefecture -- about management of stud bulls, stud pigs and
frozen stud semen, 4 prefectures have already begun dispersing stud
animals and stored semen.

14 prefectures were considering taking such measures.

On Monday [24 May 2010] evening, the Kagoshima prefectural government
moved 3 stud bulls of Kuroge-wagyu cattle, which provide the
prefecture's specialty beef, and 3 candidate studs to Kikaijima
island, about 380 km from the prefecture's mainland coast.

The 6 bulls, selected from the prefecture's 53 studs and candidates,
were carried by truck to Kagoshima Port. The truck was then
sterilized before being loaded onto the ferry.

The prefecture plans to move 6 other bulls to Tanegashima island by
the end of this month [May 2010] and relocate about 150 candidate
stud pigs to multiple locations.

Similar precautions are being adopted elsewhere in the nation.

Keiichiro Tominaga, chief of the livestock department of the Hyogo
prefectural government's center for livestock technology, stressed
the necessity of such actions.

"It takes a mind-boggling amount of time and labor to develop
excellent stud bulls," he said. "We'll make all possible efforts to
protect our treasures." The center, located in Kasai, Hyogo
Prefecture, manages stud bulls of Kobe-brand beef cattle.

The center plans to move several of its 12 top-of-the-line stud
bulls, which together form the backbone of the prefecture's cattle
breeding program, to a prefectural agricultural technology center in
Asago, located in the prefecture's north, about 50 km from Kasai.

The Miyagi prefectural government is also considering relocating some
stud bulls and pigs from a prefectural livestock test center to other
facilities.

It will also put stud semen in frozen storage in multiple locations,
once necessary hardware has been obtained.

"We didn't even consider this kind of thing when FMD cases occurred
10 years ago," a Miyagi prefectural government official said.

The Saga prefectural government is also considering relocating 8 stud bulls.

Many local governments are worried that transporting animals may
carry higher risk.

Fujio Minamikawa, chief of the prefectural government's livestock
division, said, "We aren't sure that the current level of control
will be possible at other facilities. We don't know which option --
transferring them or not -- carries higher risk."

An official of the Kochi prefectural government who is involved in
plans to disperse frozen stud bull semen to livestock health
facilities across the prefecture said: "Our prefectural livestock
test center may be the safest place. We don't know where to move
them."

Some local governments are worried about the adequacy of facilities
at potential relocation sites.

The Oita prefectural government's plan to move about 10 stud bulls to
a facility about 70 km from their current location ran into trouble
because the new facility did not have a barn large and sturdy enough
to accommodate the animals. Stud bulls are bigger and more aggressive
than ordinary cattle.

In the end, the prefectural government had to modify an existing barn
at the facility at a cost of more than 5 million yen [USD 55 340].

A Gifu prefectural government official said: "It would be ideal to
move stud bulls to remote islands like Kagoshima Prefecture did, but
our prefecture doesn't have any islands. If infection spreads to a
relocation site, it will be disastrous. Selecting relocation sites is
a serious headache for us."

Farm minister Hirotaka Akamatsu apologized Tuesday [25 May 2010] over
the government's handling of the FMD outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture,
backing away from his previous remarks that he has "nothing at all to
reflect on" over the issue.

"I feel deeply sorry that it has spread this much," Akamatsu told a
session of the House of Representatives committee on agriculture,
forestry and fisheries, with the outbreak likely to result in the
slaughtering of more than 30 000 cows and pigs.

Akamatsu was apparently forced to change his earlier stance, offering
a formal apology for the 1st time, as the situation appears to be
causing unprecedented damage to livestock.

While the agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister reiterated, "I
have done what was deemed necessary," he also expressed his intention
to examine the central government's handling of the issue after the
spread ceases.

"It is necessary to examine if the handling was really appropriate,"
Akamatsu said, responding to questions from main opposition Liberal
Democratic Party lawmaker Koichi Tani.

At a news conference before the committee session, Akamatsu said 73
percent of vaccinations, which the government began conducting last
week on livestock within a 10-km radius of infected farms in the
southwestern prefecture prior to slaughter, had been completed by
Monday [24 May 2010]. A further 30 000 livestock will be vaccinated,
and the task is expected to be basically completed later Tuesday, he
said. According to the Miyazaki prefectural government, 90 percent of
the vaccinations are likely to be completed by the end of Tuesday.

The farm minister also said the government will stick with its
decision Monday [24 May 2010] to slaughter 49 stud bulls in the
prefecture to prevent the spread of the disease, despite the desire
of local authorities to keep the animals alive.

The slaughter of the 49 stud bulls will leave only 5 to produce
Miyazaki Prefecture's prized beef, dealing a great blow to the local
livestock industry.

"It is stated in law that they must be terminated immediately once
designated as suspected cases," Akamatsu said.

During the lower house committee session, Senior Vice Minister of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Masahiko Yamada said the spread
of the disease was caused by the infection of pigs, among which the
disease is highly contagious.

"Regrettably, we were not able to secure places to bury them,
allowing the disease to circulate," Yamada said.

LDP lawmaker Taku Eto urged the government to purchase land for the
burial of slaughtered cows and pigs in locations that will not be
used as farmland even 10 years from now, but the government did not
give a clear response.

The main opposition party plans to submit a no-confidence motion
against the farm minister as early as this week.
