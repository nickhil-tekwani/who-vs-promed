A 2nd fatal human Rift Valley fever (RVF) case in recent weeks was reported in Uganda. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the 2nd confirmed case of RVF was reported from Ntoroko district, Uganda.

The individual was a 25-year-old male from the Democratic Republic of Congo who was living and working in Kimara Village, Butungama sub-county, in Ntoroko district, Uganda. The patient developed hemorrhagic symptoms on 5 Dec [2019] and despite treatment, the patient died the next day [6 Dec 2019]. A safe and dignified burial occurred later in the month [December 2019].

The 1st RVF case/death was reported from Obongi district (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (06): Uganda ex South Sudan 20191209.6829994).

According to WHO, RVF is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and blood-feeding flies that usually affects animals (commonly cattle and sheep) but can also involve humans. In humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe hemorrhagic fever that can be lethal. When livestock are infected, the disease can cause significant economic losses due to a high mortality rate in young animals and waves of abortions in pregnant females.

[The WHO report cited above leads one to conclude that although the man was from the DR Congo, he was living and working in Uganda and contracted the Rift Valley fever [RVF] there. There is no indication that RVF cases were occurring in livestock in Uganda at the time this case occurred, nor how the man became infected. There were RVF livestock cases in 2018. There were 3 reported RVF outbreaks located in 3 separate southwestern districts of Uganda (Mbarara, Isingiro, Lyantonde) (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (31): Uganda, bovine, OIE 20180907.6014484). At that time, there also were 2 confirmed human cases (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (13): Uganda, WHO 20180711.5898523). However, in 2019, no livestock cases were reported. The occurrence of human cases in the absence of reported animal cases prompted Mod.AS to comment: "Unfortunately, during the recent South Sudan RVF event, as in most -- if not all -- previous RVF events in other African countries, humans served as sentinels. Improved surveillance in animals is desperately needed in Africa to allow timely measures applied, predominantly preventive vaccination, before the development of a full-blown epizootic involving secondary infection in humans."

It is likely that RVF virus has persisted in this Uganda and other countries in East Africa in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long periods of time and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with the subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for keeping livestock of the area well vaccinated into the future. This may have accounted for the reappearance of RVF in South Sudan in 2018, after nearly 2 years without additional reported cases in humans or livestock, and again with this human case in 2019. - Mod.TY
