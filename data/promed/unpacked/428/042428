Lassa fever situation report -- epidemiological week 7 (15-21 Feb 2021)
------------------------------------------------------------
Key points:
Current week (7) (15-21 Feb 2021) / Cumulative 2021 week 1-7 / Cumulative 2020 week 1-7
Suspected cases: 113 / 817 / 2176
Confirmed cases: 19 / 102 / 586
Probable cases: 1 / 2 / 7
Deaths: 3 / 22 / 103
Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 15.8 / 21.6 / 17.6
Number of states affected: 6 / 8 / 26
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 15 / 32 / 101

Highlights
- In week 7, the number of new confirmed cases increased from 17 in week 6, 2021, to 19 cases. These were reported from 6 States (Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Nasarawa, Enugu, and Taraba) (Table 3)
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 7, 2021, 22 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 21.6%, which is higher than the CFR for the same period in 2020 (17.6%)
- In total for 2021, 8 States have recorded at least one confirmed case across 32 LGAs (Figures 2 and 3)
- Of all confirmed cases, 85% are from Edo (49%), Ondo (25%), and Taraba (11%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range: less than 1 to 70 years; median age: 29 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.9 (Figure 4)
- The number of suspected cases has decreased compared to that reported for the same period in 2020
- One new healthcare worker was affected in the reporting week 7
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels

Response activities
- Conducted 2021 Lassa fever high burden States preparedness/response engagement meeting
- Lassa fever alert letters sent to States
- The National Emergency Operations Centre alert mode activated 2021 for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of Lassa fever response
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected States
- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across the states
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices guidelines
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment

Notes on this report
Data source: Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 19 new confirmed and 113 new suspected cases in week 7 (15-21 Feb 2021), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing and increasing. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 last year (10-16 Feb 2020). There are now 3 deaths among confirmed cases for the 7th week of 2021. Unfortunately, there is one newly infected healthcare worker during the current week (week 7).

The report above confirms that, so far this year (2021), Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi states have the most suspected cases, while Edo, Ondo, and Taraba states have the most confirmed cases. The area affected is 8 states, and the number of local government areas [LGAs] increased to 32 with at least one case. Nigeria is now in the period of the year when cases begin to peak, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 4 years and will likely be the case again for year 2021.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.
