A battery of blood tests, water tests, and bird necropsies could not reveal
what suddenly killed 2 dozen birds on Longboat Key this summer.
"It does not appear that (the bird deaths) were natural, but there is no
way to prove it," said Gary Morse, a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission spokesman. Chemicals were the chief suspect.
The birds -- including the roseate spoonbill, great blue heron, wood stork,
pelican, egret and ibis -- died during a 2 week period starting in late
June 2004.
According to the investigation report, the birds were found dead [or]
distressed in the area of Harbor Side Golf Course. Staff from the Pelican
Man Bird Sanctuary attempted to rehabilitate the ill birds that were found,
the report said. Sanctuary staff declined to comment on the investigation.
Morse said the preliminary indicators were that a man-made event was the
cause, perhaps an adverse chemical release. Morse explained there are some
natural events that can cause bird die-offs, such as avian botulism brought
on by high air temperatures and lack of rain. But Morse added that
typically an avian botulism outbreak occurs in winter and only one type of
bird is affected. For example, ducks can be struck by avian botulism
occasionally, but it would not also affect shore birds.
"We had multiple bird species. Then it becomes suspicious and you wonder
what it is going on here," Morse said. But the water tests, conducted by
the State Department of Environmental Protection, found nothing unusual.
Blood tests, as well. The US Fish and Wildlife service even conducted the
avian necropsies -- but nothing conclusive was turned up, Morse said.
One possible impoundment [impediment? - Mod.SH] to the investigation was
some of the birds were given medicine at the Pelican Man Bird Sanctuary.
"You try to save the birds and then try to figure out what happened," Morse
said. "But sometimes when you treat animals and the medicines might prevent
finding the cause."
The investigation report notes that no reoccurrence of bird deaths on
Longboat has taken place since. So the case was closed. "All this
speculation of whether it is man-made or not, it is irrelevant now," Morse
said. "We just don't know what happened."
