Outbreak of trichinellosis in Argentina
---------------------------------------
About 30 residents of Pueblo General Belgrano [Entre Rios province] have
been diagnosed with trichinellosis, a disease transmitted through the
ingestion of pork, horse, or boar meat contaminated with a microscopic
parasite.

Among those affected are at least 10 court workers in Gualeguaychu and the
intendant [head of the local government] of Pueblo Belgrano, Francisco
Fiorotto, who confirmed to Diario El Argentino the suspicions that it could
be an outbreak of trichinellosis. Nonetheless, he called for prudence until
the results of the samples obtained from the area and from those affected
are known.

As reported, the original focus is believed to be a butcher shop in Pueblo
Belgrano, where several of those infected acquired salami and pork meat.
The Epidemiology Department sent 2 residents who work in the area to
determine the cause of the outbreak of trichinellosis. "There are several
suspected cases of trichinellosis," said the local health director, Martin
Piaggio.

According to reports from 2 health centers, some of those infected reported
having fever, muscle aches, swollen eyes, and diarrhea, all symptoms
consistent with [trichinellosis], although none was admitted to hospital.
Blood samples were taken in the Hospital Centenario health area and sent to
the laboratories indicated by the provincial Epidemiology Department.

Faced with a possible outbreak of trichinellosis, the Pueblo Belgrano
Development Board decided, "To prohibit the production of slaughter
by-products and the transport and marketing of pork and its by-products."
The board also asked that anyone with the symptoms mentioned "go to the
Carlos Artusi Health Center in Pueblo Belgrano, or directly to the Hospital
Centenario in Gualeguaychu, for the correct diagnosis and treatment of the
disease."

Finally, the Board announced that it "will be on permanent alert with the
purpose of continuing to implement and analyze the measures that may arise
from to this health issue."

[A study of trichinella antibodies in humans and swine in Argentina found a
seroprevalence in humans of 8 per cent and 25 per cent in pigs for human
consumption samples from the local slaughterhouse (Costantino SN et al.
Detection of trichinellosis in a historically trichinella-free area of
Argentina. Vet Parasitol. 2009; 159(3-4): 354-7; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19059725>).

Another study of trichinella in wild animals from Argentina found 16
positive sample 3 of which were identified as _T. spiralis_ and the
remainder were not typed. The study concluded that "The presence of
trichinella infection among wild animal populations suggests a sylvatic
cycle of transmission in Argentina, which can serve as a reservoir for
humans and domestic animals." (Ribicich M, et al. Trichinella infection in
wild animals from endemic regions of Argentina. Parasitol Res. 2010;
107(2): 377-80; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20424859>).

Based on these studies there is little doubt that there are trichinella in
domestic pigs in Argentina and whether the sylvatic cycle is involved in
maintaining this needs further studies. - Mod.EP
