Duck carcass found in Tai O tests positive for H5N1 virus
---------------------------------------------------------
A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department (AFCD) said today (7 Feb 2011) that a duck carcass found in
Tai O was confirmed to be H5N1 positive after laboratory testing.

The duck carcass was found and collected at a beach near Po Chue Tam,
Yeung Hau Temple, Tai O on 3 Feb 2011. It was highly decomposed when
found and required a series of tests before H5N1 avian influenza was
confirmed today [7 Feb 2011].

The spokesman said there were no poultry farms within 3 km [1.8 mi]
of where the dead duck was found. AFCD staff have conducted
inspections and found no evidence of any backyard poultry being kept
there. AFCD will continue to monitor the situation and conduct
inspections of the area.

A ban on backyard poultry has been in force since 2006. Unauthorized
keeping of 5 kinds of poultry -- chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, or
quails -- is an offense with a maximum fine of HKD 50 000 [about USD
6400]. Repeat offenders are subject to a maximum fine of HKD 100 000
[about USD 12 800].

All relevant government departments will continue to remain highly
vigilant and strictly enforce preventive measures against avian
influenza.

AFCD has phoned poultry farmers to remind them to strengthen
precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza.
Letters have been issued to farmers, pet bird shop owners, licence
holders of pet poultry, and racing pigeons reminding them that proper
precautions must be taken.

The spokesman said the department would conduct frequent inspections
of poultry farms and the wholesale market to ensure that proper
precautions against avian influenza have been implemented. The
department will continue its wild bird monitoring and surveillance.

"People should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live
poultry and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly
after coming into contact with them. The public can call the Call
Centre on 1823 for follow up if they come across suspicious sick or
dead birds, including the carcasses of wild birds and poultry," the
spokesman said.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will continue to
be vigilant over imported live poultry as well as live poultry stalls.
It will also remind stall operators to maintain good hygiene.

The Department of Health will keep up with its health education to
remind the public to maintain strict personal and environmental
hygiene to prevent avian influenza.

AFCD, FEHD, the Customs and Excise Department, and the Police will
strive to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong Kong
to minimise the risk of avian influenza outbreaks caused by imported
poultry and birds that have not gone through inspection and
quarantine.

[This report is a continuation of H5N1 incidents in Hong Kong this
year (2011), of which this is the 6th incident:

17 Jan 2011: oriental magpie robin
18 Jan 2011: large-billed crow
24 Jan 2011: black-headed gull
25 Jan 2011: chicken
28 Jan 2011: chicken (2 carcasses)
3 Feb 2011: duck

This press release does not state what species of duck was found.
Knowing the species of duck or whether it is a domestic or wild duck
would be important in a management plan. The only clue given is that
there are no poultry farms within 3 km (1.8 mi) of where this duck was
found.

All reports from Hong Kong so far this year (2011) have been from
found bird carcasses. No outbreak in poultry farms has yet occurred.
The present poultry farming management seems to be effective in
preventing outbreaks of H5N1, but due vigilance must continue.

Tai O is a little village of 5000 inhabitants on the western shore of
Lantau Island, which is to the west of the city of Hong Kong. -
