As a layman who's been subscribed to this list for 2 years, it's starting
to look like we can't see the forest for the trees on the topic of
xenotransplantation, the first issue should be to differentiate between
normal, screened & purified animal organs such as baboon hearts from
animals raised in a sterile environment versus genetically altered organs
grown by a host animal (perhaps a genetically human liver plugged into a
pigs body to grown until harvested). The recent creation of artificial raw
stem cells appears to be leading to the latter solution in the near future.
If we look at the first category it appears to me that the recipient will
have to beware of pathogens that have an effect on the donated organ but
not other pathogens from the host animal because the human immune system
should provide some protection & no other organs will have the correct
receptors for these pathogens, only the transplant.
Regarding the latter classification, I guess debate will begin in the
scientific community whether these organs are human or animal, will these
organs be immune to the host's pathogens, will pathogens mutate to adapt to
the human genome any faster than through the mixing bowl of nature? On the
flip side, it may be possible to incorporate a genetically altered organ
from a host animal that will be resistant or even immune to human pathogens.
There is always a risk for every reward.

The experience with porcine valves may have limited applicability to live
organ xenotransplantation. The valve material is thoroughly denatured
during processing and there is simply no issue of infectious agents
surviving. (I suppose that all bets are off for the BSE agent, but for
other organisms there appears to be no risk.)
I believe that most of the concern with xenotransplantation has centered on
animal viruses, latent or lively, which would proliferate in the
immunosuppressed host. Another AIDS is the nightmare scenario.
The biological, regulatory, and social issues have been well examined and
can be followed in 2 threads:
1) An extensive discussion in Nature Medicine. You can pick it up with an
editorial and a news article in the February 98 issue.
2) The development of FDA's policy and moratorium. The transcripts of a
meeting on "Developing USPHS Policy in Xenotransplantation" are available
on the FDA web site. Just search on Xenotransplantation.
>From the point of view of a clinical research manager, one of the most
interesting implications is the need to follow the recipients family and
care givers for the development of infection/disease for long periods (years).
I believe the issues are far from settled.

Regarding the comments on the safety of porcine cardiac valves in humans
and the attempts to extrapolate to organ xenotransplantation, the most
obvious difference is that the host receiving an organ transplant is
severely immunocompromised (to prevent rejection). There is also the issue
of more heterogenous tissues being transplanted with organs (with the
possibility of carrying organisms with particular tissue tropisms) in
contrast to the porcine valve. These issues (and possibly others) make
extrapolation of infectious risks from porcine valve transplantation to
organ xenotransplantation a potentially dangerous sport, if it was to be
put into practice without experimental evaluation (which obviously no one
is advocating).

[Apropos the last point, this summer I managed to catch up with a classmate
of mine, Richard Medd, after a gap of some 25+ years. In the American and
British senses of the word I 'visited' (with) him for three days and we got
caught up. I discovered that he had been part of the Cambridge
heart-transplant team and responsible for the animal transplant model
constructions & surgery and, among other organ transplants with pigs and
such, routinely carried out mouse heart transplants, which boggles the
average mind. Presumably those developing porcine xentransplants will be
involved in similar inter-species organ transplants and monitoring the
results, hopefully over prolonged periods? If so, have they published their
results? - Mod.MHJ ...........................................mhj/es
