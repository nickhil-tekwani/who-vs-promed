1st report of tan spot caused by _Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_ (anamorph
_Drechslera tritici-repentis_) in Bulgaria
-----------------------------------------------
M. Todorova <todorova.m@abv.bg>, University of Forestry, Faculty of
Agriculture, Bull. Kliment Ochridski 10, Sofia 1756, Bulgaria. Accepted for
publication 8 Aug 2005.
In June 2004, an unknown leaf spot was observed on wheat, rye and triticale
collected from commercial fields in different geographic regions of
Bulgaria. The visible symptoms were oval to elongated brown spots
surrounded by a chlorotic halo.
Conidiophores in the necrotic tissues were long, mainly single, hyaline or
dark brown. Conidia were cylindrical, 90-220 x 10-16 micrometers with a
conical terminal cell at the base and 3-9 septa. Consequently, the fungus
was identified as _Drechslera tritici-repentis_, as described by Hunger &
Brown (1987), Ellis (1976) and Shoemaker (1962). In follow-up collections
made in March-April 2005, the teleomorph _Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_ was
identified in straw debris collected in North Bulgaria. Pseudothecia were
setate, dark brown and spherical. Asci with 8 ascospores -- with 3
transverse and one longitudinal septum -- were observed (Shoemaker, 1962).
Conidia and ascospores plated onto PDA formed white to grey cottony
colonies secreting a brown pigment. Young wheat plants (second leaf stage)
were inoculated with a mycelial suspension by spraying, placed in a moist
chamber for 24 hours and then incubated under greenhouse conditions. After
7-8 days, the typical brown spots with chlorotic halo were observed.
_Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_ is one of the most common and economically
important diseases in many Western European countries. During the last
decade, it has been reported in Ukraine, Latvia, Russia, Czech Republic and
Hungary (Sarova et al., 2003). It is likely that wet weather, reduced
tillage and lack of crop rotation has favored its spread in Bulgaria.

[Tan spot commonly infects wheat in the Canadian prairies. Resistance to
tan spot is not widely dispersed in the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center (CIMMYT) germplasm, but moderate resistance is known to
occur (Rees and Platz, 1992). Some newer CIMMYT lines, such as Milan,
Attila, Corydon and Tinamou, and some Chinese wheats and their derivatives,
such as Luan, are also reported to carry high to moderate resistance (Diaz
de Ackermann and Kohli, 1998). Tan spot is increasing in areas where
reduced tillage practices are being combined with stubble retention. CIMMYT
has an ongoing project to search for new and better sources of resistance
to tan spot for these areas.
The fungus over-winters on infected wheat straw or stubble. Spores are
dispersed primarily by wind. Wheat is the primary host, but forage grasses
and rye are alternate hosts. Barley and oats are highly resistant to tan
spot. Ways to reduce tan spot include rotating between cereal and broadleaf
crops, such as oilseeds and pulses, planting disease-free seed or seed that
has been treated with a recommended fungicide, planting cultivars with
known resistance to one or more leaf spot diseases, and, if leaf spots are
present and rain is forecast, applying a registered foliar fungicide might
be advisable.
