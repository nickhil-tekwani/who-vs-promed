Three locations in eastern China reported a total of 4 more H7N9 influenza cases today [15 Jan 2014], and the World Health Organization (WHO) fleshed out details on 6 previously reported patients, revealing that all had links to poultry. The 4 newly confirmed cases were announced in a statement from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP), which received notifications from health officials on the mainland. All 4 patients are middle-aged men who are hospitalized in critical condition.

Two of the men are from Guangdong province, a 48 year old from the city of Foshan, and a 55 year old from the city of Dongguan who is hospitalized in Shenzhen. No details were available about their illness onsets or exposures to poultry. The other 2 men are a 41 year old from the Zhejiang province capital city of Hangzhou and a 35 year old from Shanghai. The 4 new cases lift the outbreak total to 181 cases, including 52 deaths.

WHO's update today [15 Jan 2014] covers information on 6 cases it received on [13 Jan 2014] from mainland China, as well as a notification from Hong Kong of a death of a 65 year old man who had fallen ill with H7N9 after visiting the mainland. 5 of these patients had a history of exposure to poultry, and one is employed by the poultry sales industry, according to the WHO report. Their illness onset dates range from 1 Jan 2014 through 8 Jan 2014. Days until hospitalization varied, but 4 people were hospitalized within 3 or 4 days of their 1st symptoms.

Four of the patients are from Zhejiang province -- 3 from Ningbo city and one from Yiwu city. Those from Ningbo are a 34 year old man who is in critical condition, a 41 year old woman in serious condition, and a 59 year old woman in serious condition. The patient from Yiwu is a 78 year old man who is in critical condition. The other newly confirmed cases involve 2 patients from the Guangdong province city of Foshan, a 46 year old man who is in critical condition and a 28 year old woman who has a mild illness.

Though the H7N9 virus mainly appears to be spreading from poultry or their environments to people, some illnesses in the 1st wave of the outbreak were part of clusters that could have involved limited human-to-human spread. Also, genetic studies of the virus have identified markers that suggest that H7N9 virus can easily infect the airways of mammals. But studies so far suggest that the virus has limited ability for airborne spread, an element closely watched by experts monitoring the virus's pandemic potential.

Chinese health officials who are anticipating crowds that will be traveling for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday [beginning 31 Jan 2014], however, are worried that the conditions could help fuel the epidemic, according to a report today 15 Jan 2014] from Xinhua, China's state news agency [see item [3] below]. Li Lanjuan, MD, an avian flu researcher and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told Xinhua that travelers returning to their rural homes from the more developed eastern regions could spread the virus. China estimated that in the 40 days surrounding the celebration, about 3.62 billion trips will be made.

The holiday period, also known as Spring Festival, starts at the end of the month, with the Lunar New Year falling on 31 Jan 2014.

Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus -- update
------------------------------------------------------------
On 14 Jan 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China notified WHO of 3 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.
Details of the cases are as follows:
- a 29 year old man from Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, who became ill on 2 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 12 Jan 2014. He is currently in a serious condition;
- a 58 year old man from Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, who became ill on 6 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 12 Jan 2014. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to poultry;
- a 50 year old man from Jinjiang City, Fujian Province, who became ill on 5 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 11 Jan 2014. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to poultry.

The source of infection is still under investigation. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

The Chinese government continues to take the following measures:
- strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
- reinforce case management and treatment;
- conduct risk communication with the public and release information;
- strengthen international collaboration and communication; and
- conduct scientific studies.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

[3] News report

As millions of Chinese prepare to return to their hometowns for Spring Festival [beginning 31 Jan 2014], the challenges of containing the latest H7N9 bird flu epidemic have come sharply into focus. Health authorities are deeply concerned by the resurgent epidemic, with about [?] 20 new cases reported in the 1st 2 weeks of 2014, mostly in eastern costal regions. About 150 cases of H7N9 bird flu have been confirmed in China since the 1st case in March last year [2013].

The virus is more active in winter and spring, and high density transportation in coaches, trains, and aircraft could create "favorable circumstances" for the epidemic to spread, according to Li Lanjuan of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Li is China's leading researcher on bird flu and a member of the H7N9 prevention and control group. She warns that the virus might be spread by migrants returning to their, mainly rural, homes from developed eastern regions.

During the world' s biggest annual human migration in the 40 days around Spring Festival, about 3.62 billion trips will be made this year [2014], according to Tuesday's [14 Jan 2014] National Development and Reform Commission press release. This year [2014], the highlight of the Spring Festival, Chinese Lunar New Year, falls on 31 Jan 2014. It is the most important Chinese occasion for family reunions. "We are worried about the risk brought by massive numbers of people gathering together in confined spaces," said Dr Liang Weifeng of the medical college at Zhejiang University.

In Zhejiang, new H7N9 cases have been reported for 6 consecutive days. As of Tuesday [14 Jan 2014], the eastern province had reported a total of 11, including some fatalities. Zhejiang was also the site of China's 1st confirmed human-to-human transmission last November [2013], when a man was infected while caring for his father-in-law. More alarming still, Guizhou Province in the remote south west of the country confirmed its 1st H7N9 fatality on Saturday [11 Jan 2014]; that of a migrant worker who returned from Zhejiang on 4 Jan 2014.

Results of research by a Chinese team published in the Lancet, have established that variation of an amino acid on the H7 gene has made the H7N9 strain more infectious to mammals. "[In] the PB2 gene, we have found another variation in a key amino acid. One more variation of a specified amino acid, and human-to-human transmission will become much more likely," said Liang, indicating his extremely high concern over the possibility. The team recently identified a new partial [?] variation in the virus, demonstrating its capacity to adapt to its environment. "It has increased the risk of human-to-human transmission and [may have] brought more difficulty in treatment," Liang added.

"In spite of this, there is no reason to panic. We can confirm that the H7N9 flu virus has not shown scaled variation and human-to-human transmission," said Gao Hainyu, a member of the team drafting a thesis on the new results.

Besides the travel rush, another problem facing health authorities is that Spring Festival is also the peak season for poultry sales and consumption. The Chinese have a long tradition of eating fresh ingredients especially at important feasts and family reunions. Chinese people, especially those in eastern regions, like to buy live chickens and ducks and slaughter them at home for freshness and a festival atmosphere. Despite a government ban, live poultry markets are reemerging in some regions. At an open-air market in Zhejiang, a local senior, and his wife selected several live birds for the city's specialty, Hangzhou roast duck. "Dishes of chicken and duck are a must on New Year's Eve. We can hardly change tradition," said [the senior citizen].

"There is no problem after cooking and the duck and chicken sold here have been quarantined," said a housewife at Xianlinyuan market in Hangzhou. Zhejiang and other provinces are cranking up H7N9 control with more inspections and tougher quarantine measures wherever live birds are sold.

Poultry are easily infected by H7N9, and the risk cannot be contained simply by closing live poultry markets, said Li Lanjuan. "Some deaths [have been] caused by delays in seeking medical advice, as the virus quickly attacks the lungs," said Li, alerting people to mind their health during the holiday and go to hospital if they have fever or a cough.

[Human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection continue to occur sporadically throughout southern China, but the numbers remain small in relation to the population at risk. The cases remain predominantly middle-aged to elderly people, often with exposure to live poultry.

The traditional Chinese New Year holiday period is approaching with its associated large-scale population movement and enhanced slaughter and consumption of poultry, which the local and national authorities will have difficulty controlling. During this period there will be enhanced opportunity for the evolution of H7N9 virus with potential for transition from person-to-person. - Mod.CP]
