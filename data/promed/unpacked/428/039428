J&B Meats Corp. recalled 173 554 pounds (86.8 tons) of ground beef
that may be contaminated with the potentially deadly _E. coli_
[O157:H7] bacteria, the 5th such recall by an American company in the
past 3 weeks.

The products subject to the latest recall include boxes of burgers
with "Topps" and "Sam's Choice" labels, the USDA (US Department of
Agriculture) said in a statement issued Sat 13 Oct 2007. The meat was
produced on 12, 18, and 22 Jun 2007 and distributed to retail outlets
nationwide. Company officials didn't return calls seeking comment.

The biggest of the recalls was by Topps Meat Co., which went out of
business earlier this month after recalling 21.7 million pounds of
ground beef. Topps, of Elizabeth, NJ, had been the owner of J&B
Meats, which is based in Coal Valley, IL, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. J&B recalled the beef after investigators
found a possible link to a reported illness.

[The J&B recall seems to be linked to both Topps and Cargill recalls
based on the products mentioned. It is not clear if J&B actually
manufactured the ground beef or just distributed it. - Mod.LL]

The Knox County (Tennessee) Health Department has now positively
linked 3 _E. coli_ infections with a beef recall earlier in Oct 2007.
The ground beef was sold in frozen patties at Sam's Club and was made
by Cargill Meat Solutions. It was also distributed to some
restaurants and foodservice institutions. If you have purchased
American Chef's Selection Angus Beef Patties, check to be sure it
does not fall under the case code of "7703100."

An additional case of _E. coli_ in Cocke County has been determined
to be unrelated and is considered by health officials to be a
sporadic case.

The 3 victims in Knox County became infected with _E. coli_ O157 from
eating contaminated beef. The CDC has identified this specific strain
as outbreak no. 0710NYEXH-1c. Analysis showed it to be a distinct
infection from a cluster in Indiana under the same outbreak number.

Now, an Illinois company is recalling more than 86 tons of ground
beef, some apparently sold in Sam's Club stores, over an _E. coli_
concern. J & B Meats is recalling Topps Premium Pure Sirloin Beef
Sirloin Steak Burgers, Topps 100 percent Pure Ground Beef Hamburgers
32 Quarter Pounders, Sam's Choice Backyard Gourmet Beef Burgers 80/20
12 Quarter Pound Round Patties, and Topps 100 percent Pure Ground
Beef Hamburgers 12 Quarter Pounders. You can recognize the packages
by the establishment number, Est. 5712.

A Georgia company, Arko Veal has also recalled ground beef patties,
but the USDA reports those patties were distributed only to
restaurants in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
