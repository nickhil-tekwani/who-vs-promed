Kuwait on alert after bird flu detected
---------------------------------------
Kuwait announced on Sunday [25 Feb 2007] that it had detected the
deadly strain of avian influenza in poultry and birds and had shut
the nation's only zoo, AFP reported.
The 20 cases of the deadly H5N1 avian influenza were detected in
birds, mainly falcons.
A nationwide emergency response program was implemented, which
included a ban on all bird imports, the temporary closure of Kuwait
Zoo and bird markets.
Blood samples from all people suspected of having had contact with
the infected birds were taken, and tests were underway. About 30
teams were dispatched to various parts of the country following the
discovery of the virus.
Kuwait is a member of the 6-nation Persian Gulf Cooperation Council
which has recently adopted measures to prevent the spread of avian
flu, including the ban of birds, poultry and their products mainly
from countries in Asia and Europe, where bird flu cases have surfaced.
The last case of avian flu in Kuwait was discovered in November 2005.

[It would be interesting to know whether this suspected outbreak
might be related to imported birds (falcons from Asia?!).
Until additional epidemiological details, particularly lab results,
become available, this disease event is regarded as suspected.
We are grateful to Joe Dudley for sending similar information. - Mod.AS]

Peacocks spread flu at Pakistan zoo
---------------------------------------
A fresh outbreak of bird flu has struck at the zoo in Pakistan's
capital Islamabad, where a gift batch of infected peacocks is blamed
for decimating bird displays.
The Marghazar Zoo has been temporarily closed after test results this
week confirmed the deaths of ducks and geese from the H5N1 strain of
bird flu that is also lethal to humans.
"We took emergency action by culling 5 peacocks and vaccinated the
rest of the flocks. The entire premises has also been fumigated," zoo
director Raja Javed said as his 84 staff members underwent daily
medical checks for any sign of the virus.
Two dozen of around 200 birds died after the zoo received a gift of 7
peacocks on 12 Feb 2007. Health inspectors had only just given the
collections a clean bill of health when the new birds arrived.
The virus hit only ordinary species of ducks, geese and peacocks kept
in one section of the leafy zoo nestling at the foot of the Margalla
Hills. Other birds like eagles, owls and birds of song tested
negative for H5N1, Javed told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.
Although bird flu has affected humans in several countries, there
were no recorded cases of people getting the disease in Pakistan.
But a main concern is that wild birds found on the zoo grounds such
as starlings and sparrows could become infected and carry the virus
to other parts of the city of almost one million inhabitants.
Red ribbons mark the infected area, and, across the deserted
premises, staff can be seen wearing surgical masks and protective
suits as they go about their daily tasks, apparently unruffled by the
emergency.
"Workers are performing their duties without any fear; you can see
for yourself from their relaxed postures," zookeeper Mohammad Imran said.
However, some staff have complained about not receiving sufficient
supplies of masks, gloves and overalls during the containment of the outbreak.
Water and oil-based vaccine against the virus was being administered
to the remaining birds. A single vial costing around USD 60 is enough
to inoculate more than 100 birds, said Javed, adding that the zoo
could reopen in March 2007 if there were no more bird deaths.
Four employees with protective clothing have been specially assigned
to tend to the suspect bird collections and clean the cages.
Pakistani health officials warned keepers to avoid contact with the
animals where possible.
"Do not enter the cages without taking precautionary measures, and if
the management forces you, simply refuse," Najeeb Durrani of the
National Institute of Health (NIH) told staff during a visit Friday
[23 Feb 2007].
The health official is well aware of the dangers from the virus,
which after lying dormant for a year flared up in Pakistan earlier
this month [February 2007] in Islamabad's twin city Rawalpindi.
40 chickens at a farm died of the H5N1 strain or were killed while
infected, according to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock.
Other cases in peacocks were simultaneously detected in Pakistan's
North-West Frontier Province, where in February 2006, authorities
carried out a preventive cull of some 40 000 birds.
Experts fear the disease could mutate and infect the human
population, causing a global pandemic that could wipe out hundreds of
millions of people.
So far, 273 cases of humans contracting bird flu have been reported
worldwide, and 167 infected people died, according to Durrani.
While media have exhaustively reported earlier cases of bird flu,
public knowledge about the virus is still generally low in the country.
"Bird flu is found only in chickens; there is nothing to fear at the
zoo," opined a private security guard working near the zoo.

[From the above report, it is not clear whether the arriving peacocks
were of local or international origin. In case imported, the identity
of the country/countries of origin/transit will be helpful.
Peacocks (_Pavo cristatus_) are known to have been infected by H5N1
in the past, namely in May 2006 in Denmark (see archive 20060520.14179).
Both above suspected outbreaks have been discovered in zoos. For the
recent EU/EFSA recommendations on preventive vaccinations against
H5N1 in zoos, see item [3] in posting 20070221.0646. - Mod.AS]
