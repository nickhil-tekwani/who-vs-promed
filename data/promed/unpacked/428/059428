State health officials are warning people to throw away certain dog treats over the risk of salmonellosis. "Dog Gone Dog Treats" have been linked to 3 cases of salmonellosis (infection with the _Salmonella_ bacteria) in people who have handled the treats. The cases include 2 adults in their 70s and a child. All are residents of Essex County. One open bag from a customer and several unopened bags purchased last week all tested positive for _Salmonella_ at the State Public Health Laboratory, according to a statement from DPH.

The treats include "chicken chips" and beef liver and sweet potato chips. These treats are dehydrated and are not fully cooked. The treats were sold at:

- Essex County Co-Op in Topsfield
- New England Dog Biscuit Company in Salem
- Gimme Chews & Moore in Haverhill
- Animal Krackers in Gloucester.

"All stores have been ordered to remove any existing product from their shelves, and no additional product is currently being made. People get _Salmonella_ if they eat or handle food that has been contaminated with the bacteria and the food has not been properly handled, prepared, or cooked. _Salmonella_ is common in uncooked food products from animals, such as eggs, poultry, and unpasteurized milk. People who get the germs on their hands can infect themselves by eating, smoking, or touching their mouths. They can also spread the germs to anyone or anything they touch, including food," according to the statement from DPH.

DPH says most people with an infection will have diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps that can last up to a week. Severe disease is possible but uncommon. "People who have weakened immune systems, very young children, adults over 65, and those experiencing severe symptoms should talk to their healthcare providers about treatment," said DPH.

Dogs that become ill from _Salmonella_ infection may experience diarrhea that can contain blood or mucus, may seem more tired than usual and may have a fever or vomit. "It is also possible for dogs to have _Salmonella_ infection and not appear sick. Those concerned that their dogs may have become ill after eating the treats should consult their veterinarians," said DPH.

DPH offered these tips to prevent getting _Salmonella_ from dog treats:

- Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water right after handling pet food or treats or having contact with animal feces (stool), especially before preparing, serving, or eating foods or drinks, or before preparing baby bottles.
- Store pet food and treats away from where human food is stored or prepared, and away from young children.
- Children under 5 should not touch or eat pet food or treats.
- Clean and disinfect surfaces that the pet treats may have touched. _Salmonella_ can survive several weeks in dry environments.
- Don't let your dog lick your mouth and face after eating. If you do, wash your hands and any other parts of your body they may have licked with soap and water.

The CDC does not recommend feeding raw diets to pets, as they have been found to contain germs, including _Salmonella_, that can make pets and humans sick.
