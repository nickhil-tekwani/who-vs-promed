A recovering heroin addict has told BBC Radio 5 live that the government's advice to drug users about the risk of anthrax will not have any effect.

There have been 11 cases of the disease among drug-users across Europe since June this year [2012].

The female addict contracted anthrax after injecting contaminated heroin and, speaking to her, she said she knew about the risk.

[Readers are advised to listen to this informative interview, but be warned, you might need to listen to it a couple of times or more to understand what is being said, as the interviewee has a strong accent.

Other points:
[1] It sounds more like a man than a woman; my ear is not as sharp on British accents as it once was, but it sounds like the Lanarkshire case [see 20120725.1214623];
[2] The addict is very clear about the trivial impact to prevent using a possibly contaminated batch, but once the symptoms kicked in after 2 days, she went across the road to the hospital quickly;
[3] The contaminated batch had minimal heroin in it, and the addict was angry about that;
[4] The 2 doctors in the emergency clinic thought it was either gangrene or celulitis and had to be briefed by the addict, or so it seems, so the warning poster had overall more impact than it 1st seemed. - Mod.MHJ
