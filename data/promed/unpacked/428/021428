Abstract
--------
Anthrax is a zoonosis caused by the environmentally maintained, spore-forming bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, affecting humans, livestock, and wildlife nearly worldwide. Bacterial spores are ingested, inhaled, and may be mechanically transmitted by biting insects or injection as occurs during heroin-associated human cases. Herbivorous hoofstock are very susceptible to anthrax. When these hosts die of anthrax, a localized infectious zone (LIZ) forms in the area surrounding the carcass as it is scavenged and decomposes, where viable populations of vegetative _B. anthracis_ and spores contaminate the environment.

In many settings, necrophagous flies contaminate the outer carcass, surrounding soils, and vegetation with viable pathogen while scavenging. Field observations in Texas have confirmed this process and identified primary browse species (e.g., persimmon) are contaminated. However, there are limited data available on _B. anthracis_ survival on environmental substrates immediately following host death at a LIZ. Toward this, we simulated fly contamination by inoculating live-attenuated, fully virulent laboratory-adapted, and fully virulent wild _B. anthracis_ strains on untreated leaves and rocks for 2, 5, and 7 days. At each time point after inoculation, the number of vegetative cells and spores were determined. Sporulation rates were extracted from these different time points to enable comparison of sporulation speeds between _B. anthracis_ strains with different natural histories.

We found all _B. anthracis_ strains used in this study could multiply for 2 or more days post inoculation and persist on leaves and rocks for at least 7 days with variation by strain. We found differences in sporulation rates between laboratory-adapted strains and wild isolates, with the live-attenuated strain sporulating fastest, followed by the wild isolates, then laboratory-adapted virulent strains. Extrapolating our wild strain lab results to potential contamination, a single blow fly may contaminate leaves with up to 8.62 x 105 spores per day and a single carcass may host thousands of flies. Replication outside of the carcass and rapid sporulation confirms the LIZ extends beyond the carcass for several days after formation and supports the necrophagous fly transmission pathway for amplifying cases during an outbreak. We note caution must be taken when extrapolating replication and sporulation rates from live-attenuated and laboratory-adapted strains of _B. anthracis_.

Conclusions
-----------
Our data show the growth and persistence of viable _B. anthracis_ on environmental substrates. We simulated the propagation of _B. anthracis_ from carcasses by necrophagous flies onto nearby surfaces at LIZ sites during an anthrax outbreak as contaminated necrophagous flies are capable of expanding LIZ sites by moving viable bacteria from the host onto surrounding vegetation. Of the environmental substrates, leaves are the most likely source of future infection in the immediate days after host death. Continued investigations into LIZ contamination and the complexities of this disease system, like the necrophagous fly transmission pathway, will elucidate new methods to manage and prevent recurring anthrax outbreaks. Furthermore, additional studies into the impact of environmental conditions on growth and sporulation mechanisms of different _B. anthracis_ strains will improve upon predictive modeling efforts.

[I must point out that we saw this everyday in West Texas when studying anthrax in their whitetail deer, which are both browsers and grazers. This paper co-authored by my one-time grad student Jason Blackburn, presently on the faculty at the University of Florida, studied this risk posed by vomiting blowflies. These cannot digest liquid blood, so it is vomited onto scrub leaves within some 30' (9.14 m) of a deer carcass, where they then feed on the blood clots. If you want to find the remains of this feeding look for the small black dry blood clots on the lower leaves of surrounding scrub. It is an ideal source to infect visiting browsers. And it can persist until it rains.

If you want to learn more about this aspect of anthrax epidemiology, check this paper and read the referenced articles by Jason who knows this first hand. And this should lead to some very informative related research articles on this phenomenon in wildlife species in Africa and elsewhere, and their varied risks of grazing and browsing species and ecology.
