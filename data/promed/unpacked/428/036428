An unidentified blight is being blamed for the deaths of apple trees
in northern Michigan and researchers are working to determine what is
to blame. The disease has killed apple trees of 4 McIntosh varieties
grown from dwarf rootstock. Nikki Rothwell, Northwest Michigan
Horticultural Research Station, said the problem also is being
reported in western Michigan and in New York state. "We're seeing tons
of decline," she said.

"We have quite a few dying on us," said a grower in Williamsburg. The
disease has affected about 20 percent of his McIntosh crop, or about 3
percent of his total harvest. He worries that it might spread to other
trees. A grower in Northport said he has seen "scattered" attacks. He
said researchers took a chunk of one of his dead trees and are
investigating possible causes. "Some part of the orchard will have 7
or 8 trees in a row with it, and in other parts it's just one tree."
He said the disease is worrisome because McIntosh are popular regional
varieties.

Trees from dwarf rootstocks grow smaller, it's easier to harvest them
and the smaller size allows trees to be planted closer together.
Michigan and New York are among the top apple producing states.

[The problem above is reported to be associated with specific dwarfing
rootstocks used for specific apple varieties. This could imply one or
several graft transmissible disease agents such as viruses, viroids,
or phytoplasmas. More than 20 diseases of apple have been shown or are
suspected to be caused by a member of these groups of pathogens, but
molecular methods are needed for reliable diagnosis. Monitoring of
affected orchards would also be important since rate and patterns of
spread can provide clues as to the type of pathogen involved.
