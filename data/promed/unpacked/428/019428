First Report of Pepino mosaic virus in Canada and the United States.
During the winter of 2000, tomatoes (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) with a
bright yellow leaf mosaic were observed in a commercial greenhouse in
southern Ontario, Canada. Examination of leaf extracts, using leaf dips and
... ISEM, showed flexuous rods consistent with the potexvirus group.
Polyclonal antibodies raised against the original Peruvian Pepino mosaic
virus (PepMV) isolate (1) and commercial antibodies obtained from Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikro-organismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ), GmbH,
Brauns[chweig, Germany, and Plant Research International (PRI),
Wageningen, the Netherlands, were used in ISEM. Leaves tested positive in
... DAS-ELISA with antibodies from DSMZ and PRI. A triple-antibody
sandwich-ELISA obtained from Adgen Ltd. (Nellies Gate, UK) gave similar
results. Potato virus X did not react with PepMV antiserum in ELISA.
Positive PepMV ELISA controls were a U.K. and a Dutch isolate supplied by
R. Mumford and R. A. A. van Vlugt, respectively, and DSMZ.
Using primers generated from a sequence of the RNA polymerase region of a
U.K. PepMV isolate (R. Mumford, unpublished data), a[n RT-PCR test showed
the expected 312-bp amplicon for the ... [3 isolates. The primer sequences
used were forward 5' CTA TTA CAA CTC CGG AAG CCA 3' and reverse 5' TGG TCT
GGC CAG GCT TTG AC 3'.
The [3 isolates were maintained in tomato cv. Bush Beefsteak. When
mechanically inoculated on _L. esculentum_ cv. Rapsodie, the Canadian
isolate caused a bright yellow mosaic in 1 to 2 weeks, while the 2
European isolates caused a faint yellow mosaic and mild puckering of the
leaves. When mechanically inoculated on 17 indicator plants, the Canadian
isolate had a host range similar to the U.K. isolate. The most striking
difference in symptoms occurred in _L. pimpinellifolium_, in which the
Canadian isolate caused a yellow mosaic, the Dutch isolate caused no
symptoms, and the U.K. isolate caused a marked puckering of the leaves,
suggesting virus strain differences among the isolates.
Tomato fruits originating from the United States were collected during
border inspections by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and tested for
PepMV by ELISA with antisera from DSMZ. PepMV was not detected in 7 samples
from California, but was detected in 6 of 12 samples from Colorado, 6 of 7
samples from Arizona, and 1 of 5 samples from Texas. PepMV was originally
isolated from pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) in Peru in 1980 (1) and
subsequently from tomato in the Netherlands in 1999 (2).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of PepMV in North America.

[PepMV is highly contagious. How it spreads intercontinentally is not
known. Scientists at the U.K. Department for Environment, Food & Rural
Affairs (DEFRA) are assessing the possibility that movement of
virus-contaminated seeds (e.g., seeds from infected tomato on which
infectious sap has dried) may be a way for long-distance spread.
Germination of such seeds would propagate the next round of infection.
There is no convincing evidence of true seed transmission (via infected
gametes). A good summary of what is known about this disease can be
obtained at the DEFRA website:
