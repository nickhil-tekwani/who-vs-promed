A white-tailed buck harvested 1 Nov 2010 in Hunt area 3 about 3 miles
[4.8 km] northwest of Moorcroft has tested positive for chronic
wasting disease (CWD), a brain disease known to affect some deer, elk,
and moose.

On 5 Nov 2010 personnel at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD)
Laboratory analyzed samples that were collected as part of the
department's annual CWD survey and discovered positive results for the
deer. As with other new areas testing positive for CWD this year
[2010], WGFD wildlife disease specialist Hank Edwards said the
discovery of CWD in hunt area 3 was not surprising since it borders
endemic deer areas 2, 18, and a small portion of 8.

After a review of available scientific data, the World Health
Organization in December 1999 stated, "There is currently no evidence
that CWD in cervidae (deer and elk) is transmitted to humans." In
2004, Dr Ermias Belay of the Center for Disease Control said, "The
lack of evidence of a link between CWD transmission and unusual cases
of CJD, [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a human prion disease] despite
several epidemiological investigations, suggest that the risk, if any,
of transmission of CWD to humans is low." Nonetheless to avoid risk,
both organizations say parts or products from any animal that looks
sick and/or tests positive for CWD should not be eaten.
