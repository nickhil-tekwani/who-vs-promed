Disease chokes cloves' supply line
----------------------------------
A sharp fall in Indonesian cloves output due to an unknown disease
has aggravated the supply situation, skyrocketing prices. The disease
has reportedly destroyed trees in the major growing areas of Manado
[North Sulawesi] and Java -- which contribute 80 percent of cloves'
production in [Indonesia, which is a] major clove producing country.

As the gestation period for cloves is 5 to 7 years to bear fruit,
Indonesia is likely to have small crops for the next few years. "The
current Indonesian prices are the highest ever in cloves' history
following a nearly-total crop failure, with 90 percent of trees
affected by the disease," said a source. A similar situation, but with
less intensity, was experienced in Indonesia in 2000.

Prices have gone up to USD 14 000 a tonne in Indonesia. The crop from
origins such as Madagascar, Brazil, Zanzibar, and Comoros are all
above USD 10 000 a tonne. There is a lot of buying by Middle East,
European, and American companies. The requirement of cigar companies
is estimated at 25 000 to 30 000 tonnes. The reported crop loss in
Indonesia due to the disease would lead to frenzied buying efforts.

Indian requirement is estimated at between 10 000 and 12 000 tonnes a
year with availability from indigenous production below 1000 tonnes.
Alert notices [have been issued] to all ports to check clove import
cargoes.

[Diseases of clove (_Syzygium aromaticum_, family _Myrtaceae_) due to
a number of fungi (leaf spots, blights, bud shedding, sooty mould), as
well as algal leaf spot and little leaf of suspected phytoplasma cause
have been reported.

In Indonesia, a bacterial disease of clove caused by _Ralstonia
syzygii_ was reported from Sumatra and Java, and the fungus
_Ceratocystis polychroma_ has been shown to be associated with a
serious clove decline in North Sulawesi (see links below). The report
above may refer to one or more of these pathogens.
