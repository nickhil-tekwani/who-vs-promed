Update: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in U.S. Military Personnel --
Southwest/Central Asia, 2002--2004
-----------------------------
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a sand fly-borne parasitic infection.
Preliminary data about cases of CL in military personnel deployed to 3
countries (Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait) in Southwest/Central Asia have
been published previously (1).
During August 2002-February 2004, Department of Defense (DoD) staff
identified 522 parasitologically confirmed cases of CL in military
personnel. _Leishmania major_ was the etiologic agent for all 176 cases for
which species data, obtained by isoenzyme electrophoresis of cultured
parasites, are available. This update focuses on the 361 cases (69 percent
of 522) in patients whose demographic data were collected systematically
under treatment protocols for therapy with the pentavalent antimonial
compound sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam; GlaxoSmithKline, United Kingdom)
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, District of Columbia (1). U.S.
health-care providers should consider CL in persons with persistent skin
lesions who were deployed to Southwest/Central Asia or who were in other
areas where leishmaniasis is endemic.
Of the 361 patients with CL, 352 (98 percent) were male; 274 (76 percent)
were non-Hispanic white, 54 (15 percent) were non-Hispanic black, and 25 (7
percent) were Hispanic. The median age was 25 years (range: 18-57 years).
On the basis of the patients' deployment histories, all but 4 of the
patients probably were infected in Iraq, notably in areas near the
Iraq-Syria border (e.g., Tall Afar) and the Iraq-Iran border (e.g., Balad
Ruz, Kanaquin, Mandali, and Tursaq). The patients represented multiple
branches of the U.S. military, including the Active Force, Reserve, and
National Guard components of the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps; the
majority of the patients were in the Active Force component of the Army.
Self-reported dates of onset of skin lesions ranged from May 2002 to
January 2004, with 274 (78 percent of 350) occurring during August -
November 2003, including 169 (48 percent of 350) during September--October.
Department of Defence (DoD) is implementing measures to decrease the risk
for CL among U.S. military personnel in Southwest/Central Asia and to
expedite detection and treatment of cases of CL. The measures include 1)
improving living conditions for deployed personnel; 2) heightening
awareness that leishmaniasis is endemic in this region (e.g., through
publicity about cases of CL in U.S. military personnel and pre- and
postdeployment briefings about leishmaniasis); 3) emphasizing the
importance of deployed personnel using personal protective measures (e.g.,
using permethrin-treated clothing and bed nets or other barriers to sand
flies, minimizing the amount of exposed skin, and applying insect repellent
containing 30 percent-35 percent DEET to exposed skin, especially from dusk
through dawn); and 4) enhancing vector-control activities.
Persons deployed previously to Southwest/Central Asia who have questions
about their general health or leishmaniasis may contact DoD's Deployment
Health Clinical Center, telephone 866-559-1627 or at
<http://www.pdhealth.mil>. For evaluation, treatment, and referral of
military health-care beneficiaries with suspected or confirmed cases of
leishmaniasis, clinicians should contact the Infectious Disease Service of
either Walter Reed Army Medical Center (District of Columbia), telephone
202-782-1663/8691, or Brooke Army Medical Center (San Antonio, Texas),
telephone 210-916-5554/1286. Diagnostic support can be obtained by
contacting the director of the leishmaniasis diagnostic laboratory at
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (Silver Spring, Maryland), telephone
301-319-9956.

[The risk of leishmaniasis in South East Asia and in particular Iraq is
well-known. The same issue of MMWR, the source of the above posting, also
carries a description of 2 cases of visceral leishmaniasis acquired in
Afghanistan with a thorough discussion of symptoms, diagnosis, and
treatment, with selected references.
