Doctors have recommended residents control rats and mice following [the case of a] man recently acquiring a hantavirus infection after being bitten by a rat. Not all hantavirus infections lead to diseases and not all cases are fatal, said Dr Tran Phu Manh Sieu, director of the Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] Preventive Health Center. He was speaking to the media in the wake of a recent human infection in Ho Chi Minh City's District 3. Sieu said people should not unnecessarily panic, but act swiftly to control rodents that can also spread several other diseases.

On [Mon 19 Nov 2012] the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City announced that it had found the potentially deadly hantavirus among rats caught near the house of a man who became infected with the virus and was successfully treated last month [November 2012]. 3 of 25 rats caught in District 3's Ward 9 tested positive for hantavirus. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hantavirus found in Asia can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which is fatal 5-15 percent of the time. People become infected through contact with hantavirus-infected rodents, or their urine and droppings.

On 8 Nov 2012, the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases confirmed that a 55-year-old patient had contracted hantavirus infection. The patient had been admitted to the hospital with a high fever and skin rashes. Doctors initially diagnosed as a case of mosquito-borne dengue before tests at the Pasteur Institute confirmed hantavirus infection. Doctors said the patient recovered after 10 days of treatment and was discharged from the hospital in late October [2012]. The patient said he had been bitten by a rat while asleep at home.

The information prompted the Pasteur Institute to conduct tests on 25 rats and house mice collected randomly near his house. The 3 samples that tested positive for hantavirus all came from rats, an institute representative said. According to Dr Sieu, hantavirus infection is rare and cannot be spread from human to human. "Over the past decade, Viet Nam only recorded 3 [human] cases of hantavirus infection from rats and none were fatal," he said. However, Sieu said rats and mice do transmit other diseases such as bubonic plague and tetanus, and that residents should be vaccinated after being bitten by rodents.

Following reports on the recent hantavirus case, many residents told Vietweek about the high number of rats and mice in and around their homes. A resident in an apartment in Nguyen Van Troi Street in Phu Nhuan District said rodents have been found in all the complex's units, including those on the sixth floor. A 22 year-old student at a dormitory in Tran Hung Dao Street in District 1 said the rats sometimes crawl across her face as she sleeps.

Dr Nguyen Dac Tho, deputy director of the HCMC Preventive Health Center, said his agency had instructed district-level preventive health agencies to issue a report on the spread of rats in order to formulate a plan to control them. However, Tho said: "There are not many rats in apartments and residential areas where people maintain good hygiene." Dr Sieu said discarded food, abundant in HCMC, is the main reason why so many rats and mice exist in the city. He warned that most sewer systems in the city have open manholes without nets that rats can easily come out from to enter residents' homes. He also said many people continually litter food near manholes and do not care that they are feeding the rats with this bad habit. "The most effective way to control rats and mice is to eliminate their food source," Sieu concluded.

[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) comprises a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses classified in the _Bunyaviridae_. The viruses that cause HFRS include Hantaan, Dobrava, Saaremaa, Seoul, and Puumala virus. HFRS is found throughout the world. Haantan virus is widely distributed in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and Korea, whereas Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia, Western Europe, and Western Russia, Dobrava virus is found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul virus is found worldwide. Saaremaa virus is found in central Europe and Scandinavia. (In the Americas, hantaviruses cause a different disease known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome).

Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents. People can become infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after exposure to dust from their nests. Transmission may also occur when infected urine or these other materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. Individuals who work with live rodents can be exposed to hantaviruses through rodent bites from infected animals. Transmission from one human to another may occur, but is extremely rare.

The rodents known to carry hantaviruses include the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_), the reservoir for both the Saaremaa and Hantaan virus; the brown or Norway rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the reservoir for Seoul virus; the bank vole (_Clethrionomys glareolus_), the reservoir for Puumala virus; and the yellow-necked field mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_), which carries Dobrava virus. It is likely, therefore, that the hantavirus responsible for the case of human infection in HCMC is Seoul virus.

Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to infectious material, but in rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to develop. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include intense headaches, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision. Individuals may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include low blood pressure, acute shock, vascular leakage, and acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload. The severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus causing the infection. Seoul virus infections are usually moderate and non-fatal, although complete recovery can take weeks or months. (In part abbreviated from http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hfrs/index.html).

As recommended by the authorities in HCMC, rodent control is the primary strategy for preventing hantavirus infections. Rodent populations near human communities should be controlled, and rodents should be excluded from homes. Individuals should avoid contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials, and safety measures should be followed when cleaning rodent-infested areas. - Mod.CP
