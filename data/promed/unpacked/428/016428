I think that it is important to determine how the sludge/feces are
processed before deciding how it might represent a health hazard for
animals or humans, especially in a process that appears to have been
pursued for such a long time. Remember that nucleic acid testing of viral
genomes from material that has gone through an autoclave may still be
reactive, but this does not indicate that the product/equipment coming from
a properly functioning autoclave is infectious. For years, conventional
IGIM (immune globulin, intramuscular) has contained HCV (hepatitis C Virus)
RNA (Ribonucleic Acid), yet no cases of HCV has ever been traced to that
product or to albumin. The same can be said for HIV, HCV and HBV (hepatitis
B virus) from virally inactivated plasma derivatives which surely contain
these viruses.
