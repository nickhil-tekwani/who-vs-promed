The patient was also confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 and later died. Contact tracing of 88 people was done, and no secondary cases were found.

On 17 Jun 2021, a 2nd confirmed case was detected at Nzerekore Regional Hospital; this case was from Beyla prefecture and died the same day. A listing of 111 contacts has been done for follow up.

A dignified and secure burial of the body was conducted by the Red Cross under the supervision of the provincial health department on 18 Jun 2021.

Other public health actions taken include the strengthening of epidemiological surveillance; sensitization of health workers and community members on the definitions of cases of Lassa fever and other epidemic-prone diseases.

[Lassa fever cases have occurred before in Guinea, this year [2021] and in previous years, although sporadically. West Africa, including Guinea, is endemic for the Lassa fever virus. The follow-up contact tracing for these 2 cases by the Ministry of Health is prudent indeed. Orientation of the population where these cases occurred is an important preventive measure. Assuming that these cases acquired the virus from a rodent host, keeping the household environment free of rodents is a prudent practice.

Images of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of the Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis. - Mod.TY
