Shellfish lovers have been warned to steer clear of Perth's Swan River after potentially harmful algae was detected.

A Health Department spokesman said the microscopic algae could be absorbed by shellfish and cause vomiting, diarrhoea, breathing difficulty and memory loss if eaten.

The spokesman warned the public to avoid collecting oysters, mussels, clams, scallops and other shellfish from the Canning and Swan rivers.

[People are advised to heed this warning. Cooking does NOT destroy the toxin.

Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a public health risk worldwide, resulting from the consumption of seafood that has bioaccumulated toxins produced by microalgae. Bivalve shellfish (such as mussels, clams, oysters, and scallops) pose a particularly high risk, as they feed by filtration, providing a method of toxin accumulation. Algae responsible for causing PSP include several species of the genus _Alexandrium_, _Pyrodinium bahamense_ and _Gymnodinium catenatum_. Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) have been recorded in shellfish from Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania.

PSP is often caused by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_. PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

It is likely that seasonally recurring outbreaks of PSP are linked to the existence of a dormant cyst stage in the _Alexandrium_ life cycle. This strategy allows the species to deposit dormant cells in sediments, where they survive through harsh winter conditions and then germinate to initiate new outbreaks in subsequent years. Long-term climatic variability, which affects temperature, upwelling, and currents, or allows cysts to survive in areas where they did not before, may be factors in extensions.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases death may occur in 2 to 25 hours.
