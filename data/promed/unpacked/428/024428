West Bengal has been adversely affected by [avian influenza], with 9
out of its 19 districts being struck with the lethal disease. [Their
number has risen, in the meantime, to 11; see item 2. - Mod.AS] The
rapid-response team and the medical officers of the health department
have continued with the culling procedure to restrain the further
spread of the virus.
The 7 teams that have been sent to West Bengal are constantly
surveying people who deal with poultry, and those who live in the 10
km 96 mi) radius of the affected districts to identify any cases of
human bird flu. To date, there have been no reported cases of human
avian flu in the state.
In Birbhum district, the 10-km (6-mi) radius contains a population of
about 500 000, out of which only 250 000 people could be surveyed on
Tuesday [22 Jan 2008]. Similarly, in Nadia district, out of 90 000
inhabitants, the health officials could survey only 10 000
inhabitants. In Burdwan district, out of the 920 000 human population
in the 10-km (6-mi) radius, only 60 000 inhabitants could be properly examined.
[The] culling process has been hindered in most of the affected
districts of West Bengal due to incessant rain. However, the district
officials have geared up to control the bird flu by distributing
Tamiflu drugs among poultry owners. Proper isolation camps have been
set up in the government hospitals for treating the individuals who
show clinical symptoms of contracting bird flu.
The West Bengal State Government and the Central Government have
planned systematic strategies to eradicate the deadly disease.

On Friday [25 Jan 2008], bird flu appeared right at the doorstep of
Kolkata with 2 more districts of West Bengal, Purulia and Howrah,
falling prey to the deadly virus that has now spread to more than
half of the state.
Expert teams were accompanied by police force at many places in
culling operations in view of resentment among many villagers fearing
loss of livelihood.
On Friday [25 Jan 2008], the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory
in Bhopal confirmed avian influenza (H5) in samples from Sankrail
block of Howrah district and Santuri block of Purulia district, an
official statement in Delhi said.
The virus has now spread to more than half of the state's 19
districts. The 11 districts affected by bird flu are Birbhum, South
Dinajpur, Murshidabad, Nadia, Burdwan, Bankura, Malda, Coochbehar,
Hooghly, Purulia, and Howrah [see map included in item 1. - Mod.AS]
The samples from Mayureswar-II and Khoyrasole blocks of Birbhum
district and Kandi block of Murshidabad district have also tested
positive for avian influenza, [the statement] said.
Official sources in Kolkata said at least 10 lakh [one million]
chicken have been culled in the 9 affected districts while 1.46 lakh
[146 000] eggs have been destroyed as of 24 Jan 2008.
At least 901 rapid response teams were deployed today in the state
for carrying out culling and surveillance operations.
Confirming the deadly H5N1 virus in Purulia, district magistrate
Deepak Ranjan Kar said the avian flu surfaced at Ramchandrapur
village under Santuri block in the district.
Elsewhere in the state, expert teams had to seek help from police
force at many places in culling operations. The force was sought to
thwart any untoward incident, particularly in view of resentment
among many villagers fearing loss of livelihood, Coochbehar district
magistrate Rajesh Sinha said.

The re-emergence of avian flu was confirmed in Phichit, a day after
Nakhon Sawan province was declared a bird flu outbreak zone on
Thursday [24 Jan 2008], according to Livestock Development Department
chief Sakchai Sriboonsue yesterday [Fri 25 Jan 2008].
Mr Sakchai said the H5 strain of bird flu was detected at a chicken
farm in tambon Sak Lek of Sak Lek sub-district following lab tests on
carcass samples.
Phichit is the 2nd outbreak location this year [2008] after Nakhon Sawan.
[A total of 70 chickens were being raised in the farm.] Of them, 30
began falling sick from 8 Jan 2008. On 22 Jan 2008, [the farm owner]
told livestock officials to inspect and collect some carcass samples
for lab tests. The H5 strain of bird flu was later confirmed.
Mr Sakchai said further tests were needed over the next couple of
days to determine whether the poultry was infected with the deadly
H5N1 virus, which was transmissible to humans.
All chickens at [this] farm and at 3 nearby [farms] totalling 217
were culled. The livestock officials also collected fowl samples from
within a radius of 5 km (3 mi) and barred the movements of all
poultry within a radius of 10 km (6 mi) from the infected farm.
Mr Sakchai said the situation in 2 provinces was not worrisome as the
infected areas were far away from densely populated communities.
In Uttaradit, Kajon Winaipanich, of the provincial health office,
said 3 chickens had died mysteriously in tambon Nampai of Nam Pat
district. They were suspected to have died from bird flu. Their
carcasses had been sent to a laboratory for the cause of death to be
identified. Mr Kajon said the results would be made known soon.
The Public Health Ministry has ordered the stockpiling of 2.4 million
anti-virus pills and for them to be sent to hospitals across the
country, said the ministry source. If any patient was infected with
influenza or pneumonia or had had close contact with dead poultry,
they could be given the anti-virus pills immediately, he said.
To date, 10 farm workers and 3 people who live near the infected farm
in Nakhon Sawan's Chumsaeng district have not displayed any bird
flu-like symptoms yet after being quarantined.
Meanwhile, Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Thira Sutabutra said
the authorities had mounted regular surveillance operations to
prevent H5N1 outbreaks in the country.
Hence, there was unlikely to be an impact on poultry consumption at
Chinese New Year, he said. Consumers could buy avian flu-free poultry
products at outlets guaranteed by the Livestock Department or
labelled ''Q-Mark'' by the ministry.
Mr Thira added that poultry exports might not feel the pinch from the
re-emergence of bird flu because authorities had managed to keep
outbreaks under control immediately.

[According to India's immediate notification to the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health), dated 15 Jan 2008, the outbreak in
West Bengal had started on 4 Jan 2008, with the 2 first foci
confirmed on 15 Jan 2008.
The notification stated that the source of infection was "unknown or
inconclusive." However, HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1
has been spreading in neighbouring Bangladesh since February 2007,
eventually covering the country's entire territory (see follow-up
report No 4, submitted 17 Dec 2007, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6600>).
Its penetration into West Bengal is not overly surprising --
similarly to its potential further spread in the Indian subcontinent
(rumors on suspected, so far unconfirmed cases in Tamil Nadu and
Nepal, as well as unfounded rumors on suspected cases in crows and
goats, have been recently published in the media).
The following epidemiological comments were included in India's
official notification: "Epidemiological investigation is ongoing.
Stamping out of all domestic poultry is being applied in an
approximately 5-km (3-mi) radius zone around the outbreaks followed
by compensation of the owners. An intensive surveillance campaign has
been launched in a 10-km (6-mi) radius zone including:
- closure of poultry markets and prohibition on sale and
transportation of poultry products in the infected zone;
- disinfection of premises after culling and sealing of premises
where appropriate.
Restocking will be applied in accordance with a specific protocol."
Clearly, in spite of the application of said measures, the disease
has been rapidly spreading and is threatening other parts of the
Indian subcontinent. The exposure of large rural human populations to
the virus may eventually lead to infections.
In view of the unfolding situation, with many small, backyard poultry
holdings getting infected, the applicability of the stamping out
policy as the preferable or sole disease control policy, and the
application of mass vaccination deserve to be considered. - Mod.AS]
