Romania detected new cases of suspected bird flu in the Danube delta,
one of them close to the border with Ukraine, Agriculture Minister
Gheorghe Flutur said on Tuesday [18 Oct 2005].
"A swan tested positive with (bird flu) antibodies close to the
border with Ukraine, near the village of C.A. Rosetti," Flutur told
reporters. "A few swans in Maliuc and a wild duck in Ceamurlia de Jos
also tested seropositive."
The village of C.A. Rosetti is 10 km away from the border with
Ukraine, in southeastern Romania. [About 60 km to the east of Maliuc. - Mod.AS]
On Monday, 17 Oct 2005, Romania said the bird flu outbreak was
limited to Ceamurlia de Jos and Maliuc, 40 km (25 miles) to the
north. All 21 000 domestic birds in these 2 villages have been culled.
On Saturday [15 Oct 2005], British tests identified the H5N1 strain
of the disease in 3 ducks found dead in Ceamurlia de Jos -- the first
incidence in mainland Europe of H5N1, which has killed more than 60
people and millions of birds in Asia since 2003.
Romania has not reported any cases of bird flu in humans.
Turkey, which also detected the H5N1 strain in birds, tested 9 people
for possible bird flu last week, but no immediate sign of illness was detected.
Greece was conducting tests on Monday on a turkey with bird flu found
on an Aegean island to establish whether it was infected with the
deadly strain. [The island is Chios; in another newswire of 17 Oct
2005, the disease was reportedly suspected "in 8 dead birds found in
the northeastern Evros river delta", situated on mainland Greece,
adjacent to the Turkish border; see 20051017.3034. - Mod.AS]

Authorities have taken supplemental measures to ensure that the bird
flu will not spread. Foreign experts present in Bucharest these days
warned that all efforts must now be focused on preventing the virus
from spreading to other areas than Ceamurlia and Maliuc and in
particular from infecting humans.
The Emergency Response Committee decided that bird breeding farm
staff would be strictly checked. Furthermore, Avicola employees are
no longer permitted to take birds home; they must sacrifice all birds
in order to avoid virus spread.
Officials for Roche, the producer of Tamiflu, acknowledged as the
most effective medicine against bird flu, offered support to Romania
and Turkey, announcing they will send medicines to these countries.
Experts with the World Health Organisation (WHO) present in Romania
to support Romanian authorities in implementing the National Action
Plan regarding prevention of a flu pandemic stated that for the time
being the virus is present only in birds, not in humans. WHO experts
once again urged the population in affected areas to avoid contacts
with dead birds. The same appeal was addressed to journalists in the
area. "For the time being, the bird flu is only a veterinary
situation, and it is important that human health and veterinary
authorities work together," Guenael Rodier, special adviser for
infectious disease of the WHO Regional Directorate, pointed out. WHO
specialists believe the absence of human infection is encouraging and
congratulated authorities for the measures taken so far. "So far the
measures have been good, and as we work we will adjust them to the
given situation," the WHO official added.
In a week's time authorities will send healthy chickens to Ceamurlia
and Maliuc to test the presence of the virus after protection
measures are applied. "We prepare the introduction of a lot of
healthy chicken to see if they pick up the virus. If they do, we will
carry on measures to prevent the virus spread," Minister of
Agriculture Gheorghe Flutur said yesterday. He explained that the
risk of a new bird flu focus emergence has not been overcome, as
there are still locals who leave their fowl free, and they can get in
contact with migrating birds, from which they can pick up the virus.
Flutur added that migrating birds will also be monitored around the
country, and that traps will be installed to catch them alive. The
Minister urged the population outside risk areas to avoid travels to
the Danube Delta.
Romania requested a mobile test lab from the USA, to conduct virus
tests on the birds in the Danube Delta more rapidly. According to the
Agriculture Minister, talks are underway with officials of the USA
Embassy. Tests can be completed in one day with this mobile lab.
Minister Flutur added that a list of equipment and protection
materials has been drawn up, for the purchase of which Romania will
request support from the USA and EU.
Charge d'Affaires of the American Embassy Mark Taplin met yesterday
with Romanian Minister of Health Eugen Nicolaescu and talked about
the current situation regarding avian flu in Romania.
The Charge d'Affaires expressed his support for the Government of
Romania's efforts to date to contain the outbreak of the avian flu
virus, along with the readiness of the United States government to
actively assist Romania in responding to this public health
challenge. The 2 agreed that one important priority was raising
public awareness of practical steps for avoiding transmission of the
virus from birds to humans. [Mr Taplin] offered the help of the U.S.
Agency for International Development in working with the Government
of Romania to develop public advisory messages for the population in
the affected region.
Swiss company Roche yesterday announced it will donate Romania 2400
doses of Tamiflu, acknowledged for the time being as the most
effective medicine against bird flu. The doses will be used for
protecting employees of veterinary agencies who come in direct
contact with infected birds. Turkey will also receive Tamiflu from
Roche, but in a higher amount - 20 000 doses.
Also, Roche announced it will increase the Tamiflu output as soon as
possible, although it will remain the only producer of the medicine,
after having announced last week that it intended to cooperate with
several companies to produce the medicine.
In the meantime, in Romania pharmacies sold out their stocks of
anti-flu vaccines for October-December in 2 weeks only, but promised
they will [obtain] further amounts. Not only pharmacies, but also
vaccine producers sold out their stocks, after distributing many of
the anti-virus doses to areas affected by floods this spring and summer.
In full crisis of bird flu, the Union of Poultry Breeders of Romania
(UCPR) has asked for the government's support in [curbing] the likely
imports [of poultry], yesterday announced Ilie Van, the UCPR
president. At the moment, according to the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forest and Rural Development (MAPDR), the imports of poultry meet in
Romania represent 40 per cent of the urban market. "In return, our
country exports approx 4000 tons/year, meaning only 2 per cent of the
local production."
UCPR, which includes 166 registered poultry farms, has implemented a
bio-security programme against the bird flu. The programme implies
the monitoring and strict control of chickens, starting with the egg
stage, breeding the poultry in [a system securing] isolation from
possible contact with other animal or wild birds and vaccinating
their employees.

virus isolation from samples taken from 2 hens and a duck in the
backyard premises of 2 inhabitants. Additional information in current
newswire: a seropositive wild duck;
2. Maliuc, about 20 km east of the city of Tulcea. Initially, a hen
and a swan, probably virus isolation. Additional information included
in the current newswire: a few swans seropositive;
3. C.A. Rosetti, about 60 km east-north-east of Maliuc, close to the
Ukrainian border. Initial information, included in the current
newswire: swan seropositive;
4. Jurj Vasile (information on its exact location will be
appreciated). OIE news release of 17 Oct 2005, see 20051017.3036:
Samples from chickens, analyzed at the OIE Reference Laboratory,
confirmed to contain Influenza A subtype H5N1.

For a map of Tulcea county, where the locations of Ceamurlia de Jos,
Mariuc and C.A. Rosetti are visible, see

Clearly, the virus is present within the Danube Delta region in wild
birds (swans, ducks) and domestic fowl (chickens, ducks). Official,
first-hand updates will help in elucidating the picture. - Mod.AS]
