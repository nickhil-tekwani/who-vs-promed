An insect-borne virus that has taken a toll on deer has spread to
some cattle herds, presenting another problem for producers already
struggling with a shortage of feed supplies, authorities said.
Wade Northington, director of an animal diagnostic laboratory in
western Kentucky, said Wednesday [26 Sep 2007] that epizootic
hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, was detected by his lab in 20 to 30
cattle that died in recent weeks.
"A lot of people are very, very concerned," said agricultural
extension agent Rick Greenwell in Washington County, where the virus
is blamed for infecting some herds and killing several cattle.
The disease, which cannot be contracted by humans, is spread to deer
or cattle by gnats or flies. Horses do not appear to be susceptible
to the virus, said Northington, director of the Murray State
University Breathitt Veterinary Center in Hopkinsville.
Mature cattle generally survive the virus but can be sick for a week
to 10 days. Signs include fever, diarrhea, nose or mouth lesions, and
stiffness. There is no vaccine to prevent the illness, Northington
said. "It's kind of like having the flu, you just have to wear it
out," he said.
Veterinarians suspect that some cases of aborted calves may also be
due to the disease, he said.
The virus is another headache for cattle farmers in Kentucky, the
largest beef cattle producer east of the Mississippi. Cattle
accounted for 14 percent of Kentucky agricultural sales in 2005,
putting it behind only horses and poultry as the biggest farm
sectors, according to figures from the state Agriculture Department.
Kentucky cattle producers have already been struggling with
inadequate hay supplies and pastures since a spring freeze followed
by a summer drought. That has many worrying how they will feed herds
this winter.
Now, some farmers are dealing with sick cattle: "It's just another
aggravation for them," said Greensburg veterinarian Michael Shuffett.
Shuffett said that in south-central Kentucky, treating cattle
infected by the virus, or suspected of having it, has become a daily
occurrence at his practice in the past 6 weeks. "We've treated an
average of 2 cows a day, sometimes 4 or 5 a day," he said. Cattle
producers can try to protect their herds through insect-control
measures, Shuffett said.
The disease is blamed for killing at least 1100 to 1200 deer so far,
about one percent of the state's total herd, said Mark Marraccini,
spokesman for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources.
The outbreak in deer is probably the worst in 30 years, he said,
because the drought forced herds to congregate at remaining water
sources, making it easier for the gnats or flies to infect them.
Green County cattle farmer David Lee Givens learned that the illness
can strike quickly. In one of his herds, 5 cows died during a 2-day
period earlier this month [September 2007]. "You've just got to
tighten your belt up, replace those cows with other heifers and keep
the thing rolling."

[The EHD outbreak seems to be relatively severe this year (2007). It
was bound to spill over into cattle at some point. It already has in Ohio.
