The Greek Center for Disease Control and Prevention has registered 20 cases of West Nile fever in the country since the beginning of this year [2017]. Two deaths were reported, Nova TV reported.

At present, the dangerous virus is observed only in the Peloponnese area of Argolida. In 12 of the cases, the disease occurred with complications in the central nervous system, including encephalitis, meningitis and paresis. Experts cannot confidently predict the dynamics of virus spreading. They recommend mosquito protection measures, including sprays, window nets, and wearing closed garments. Epidemiologists also advise to avoid water pools with stagnant water.

West Nile disease is an acute viral disease that can cause central nervous system damage such as meningitis or encephalitis, and usually occurs with flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever and sore throat. It is also possible for rash or intestinal problems to occur.

[The 1st case of West Nile infection was reported this year in July 2017; see West Nile virus - Europe: Greece (PW) 20170726.5200784.

It appears that additional cases have been detected since then, with a large number of cases from Peloponnese region. It is important to consider that a majority of WNV cases may remain asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, and such infected individuals are unlikely to seek medical attention. Therefore, the actual disease burden may be much higher and requires setting up regular surveillance and monitoring systems. - Mod.UBA
