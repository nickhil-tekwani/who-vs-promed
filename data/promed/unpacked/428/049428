In Mauritius, since early April 2005, several people have been attending
the hospital and health centres of the capital city, Port-Louis, with fever
and arthralgia of hands and feet. In some cases, a rash was also noted.
Chikungunya virus was suspected based on the clinical presentation, the
self-limiting course, and the recent report on ProMED-mail of a Chikungunya
virus disease epidemic in the Comoros Islands.
The diagnosis has been confirmed on blood samples sent to Erasmus
University in Rotterdam and Marseilles-Armies Laboratory in France.
The middle-aged and elderly are most affected. Very few cases have been
noted in persons under 30 years of age.
The outbreak started in an area of the capital where there is a hostel
often used by visitors from the Comoros Islands.
On the French Indian Ocean Island of Reunion (230 km from Mauritius),
according to newspaper articles, the 1st cases of Chikungunya virus disease
were reported at the beginning of last week, but since then the number of
cases has increased rapidly.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr. Mohammad Iqbal Issack for the report. It is
very encouraging to receive this report from these 2 island countries
prompted by ProMED's report on a Chikungunya outbreak in the Comoros
Islands in April 2005. Further information will be appreciated.
Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease; both humans and mosquitoes
(either _Aedes albopictus_ (_Stegomyia albopicta_) and/or _Aedes aegypti_
(_Stegomyia aegypti_) are infected by the virus. Chikungunya virus belongs
to the family of _Togaviridae_. Chikungunya fever and dengue fever are
similar but distinct in many ways. For details please see recent reviews in
