[This is the 2nd case reported in Taif in the past 3 days. The 1st case (a 58-year-old Saudi male) had a history of possible animal exposure that was under investigation. This current case (the 42-year-old expat male) has a history of possible exposure to a case in the healthcare environment that is under investigation, suggesting that there is continued transmission ongoing in Taif. Since 12 Sep 2014, there have been a total of 25 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Taif.
