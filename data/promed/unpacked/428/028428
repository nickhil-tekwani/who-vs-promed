Up till now (16 Sep 2005) 110 persons on the West Coast of Sweden
(Halland and Vastra Gotaland counties) have contracted
enterohemorrhagic _E.coli_ (EHEC) O157 verotoxin type 2. A few
persons in other parts of Sweden got ill with the same disease during
the same time period. Either they had visited the West Coast had or
eaten lettuce from the same producer.
In this cluster, the 1st person fell ill on 16 Aug 2005 and the
latest person fell ill on 10 Sep 2005. 7 persons have developed HUS.
The outbreak is mostly among adults, and 2/3 are women. The outbreak
investigation and the epidemiological survey have shown that a local
producer of lettuce is strongly suspected to be the source of the
outbreak. The lettuce was removed from the market on 9 Sep 2005.
