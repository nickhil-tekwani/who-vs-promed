No H5N1 virus found in dead poultry in Mekong Delta
-----------------------------------------------
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus was not found in dead poultry in
the Mekong Delta province of Dong Thap, but the H5 virus was, a veterinary
official has confirmed.

In early May 2004, it was rumored that bird flu had reoccurred in several
areas of the province. In fact, there was an outbreak of bird flu in the
province's Cao Lanh Township, after the province had declared itself free
from the deadly virus. But, it was contained right afterwards.

Bui Quang Anh, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development's Veterinary Department, said that bird flu might reoccur
unless strict measures are taken to control the import, trading, and
slaughtering of poultry.

Veterinary workers are checking the remaining poultry in the areas to
determine if poultry rearing can be resumed. They are also checking
breeding poultry on all farms in the province to ensure that they are healthy.

Viet Nam declared itself free from the deadly H5N1 virus on 30 Mar 2004.
The bird flu epidemic caused a total loss of VND 1300 billion [more than
USD 82 million], of which the mass culling of poultry in bird flu-affected
areas cost VND 1000 billion [more than USD 63 million]. In addition, the
epidemic has caused an increase in food prices in the domestic market and
environmental pollution in the bird flu-hit areas.

[A new outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by
H5N1, was announced on 6 May 2004 (see update 69). The current outbreak, in
a different site within the Dong Thap province (Mekong area, south Viet
Nam, bordering Cambodia on the north), is certainly a cause for great
concern to the Vietnamese poultry industry and public health authorities.
On top of the economic losses, Viet Nam reportedly suffered at least 16
fatalities in human patients.

A Vietnamese program for the testing of all breeding farms -- requiring
compliance before they may once again begin supplying chicks to the sector,
and, also, requiring a 3 month delay before allowing depopulated farms to
restock -- was made public in early Apr 2004 (see update 60). These farms
were said to be being monitored for at least 3 weeks after their
restocking. It will be interesting to note whether the new outbreaks are
related to previously affected farms.

Final identification of the current H5 strain involved, including its
pathogenicity, is urgently required. Until then, this outbreak should be
considered to be a suspected additional outbreak of HPAI. - Mod.AS]
