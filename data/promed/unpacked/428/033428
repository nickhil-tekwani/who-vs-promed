Poliomyelitis in Angola - 1 Jul 2005
-----------------
On 24 Jun 2005, the Ministry of Health of Angola reported a polio
case. Angola has not had a case of polio since 2001. A 17-month-old
girl with a previous history of taking oral polio vaccine (OPV)
developed fever and paralysis in both legs on 25 Apr [2005], in the
metropolitan area of the capital, Luanda.

Genetic sequencing of the type-1 wild poliovirus shows that it
originated in India. Virological and epidemiological evidence suggest
a recent importation. The affected child and her family have no
travel history. An investigation did not detect spread beyond the
community.

Outreach from routine immunization services has been stepped up in
advance of the campaign. The national routine immunization coverage
of children against polio is estimated to be 45 percent.

A nationwide polio vaccination campaign is planned 29-31 Jul [2005].
Authorities are considering the use of a combination of monovalent
oral polio vaccine (mOPV) in the immediate area of the case and
trivalent oral polio vaccine in the rest of the country for maximum
impact. This will be followed by another round in August.

Health authorities have immediately intensified Acute Flaccid
Paralysis (AFP) surveillance in the infected district and surrounding
areas and WHO/African Region has notified neighbouring countries.

Briefings with all community and religious leaders, non-governmental
organizations and traditional healers are taking place in all
municipalities of Luanda.

Situation report on polio case in Angola

Outbreak response
-------------
A nationwide polio vaccination campaign is planned 29-31 Jul [2005].
Authorities are considering the use of a combination of monovalent
oral polio vaccine (mOPV) in the immediate area of the case and
trivalent oral polio vaccine in the rest of the country for maximum
impact. This will be followed by another round in August [2005].

Health authorities have immediately intensified Acute Flaccid
Paralysis (AFP) surveillance in the infected district and surrounding
areas and WHO/African Region has notified neighbouring countries.

Briefings with all community and religious leaders, non-governmental
organizations and traditional healers are taking place in all
municipalities of Luanda.

Background: Angola and polio
---------------------
Angola's last polio case was in September 2001. An outbreak of over
1000 cases in 1999 was met with repeated supplementary immunization,
and by 2000, cases were down to 55.

Indicators: The municipality Cacuaco reports a routine OPV coverage
of 50 percent and has an AFP surveillance rate of 2.1. In Luanda
generally, the AFP rate over the past 12 months is 1.25.

Supplementary immunization activities and funding: The Ministry of
Health, Angola, supported by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative
partners, had already planned for 2 National Immunization Days in
July and August to protect Angola's polio-free status. These
campaigns, requiring external financing of USD 3.74 million, are
supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
Canadian International Development Agency, the European Commission,
USAID and the governments of Spain and Portugal. Any eventual 3rd
round of campaigns would require an additional USD 1 million in
external funding.

Global context
---------
Importations such as this and other recent ones into Indonesia and
Yemen underline the importance of stopping transmission in endemic
countries with indigenous poliovirus. Until polio is eradicated
everywhere, all countries remain at risk.

To stop transmission in the endemic areas, prevent further spread and
protect polio-free countries, supplementary immunization activities
need to be stepped up. For this, the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative requires USD 50 million by the end of July [2005] and
multi-year pledges to enable activities in 2006-2008, of which UDS
200 million is needed by 2006.

The funding shortfall is a major risk to global polio eradication.
Outbreaks and importations place further stress on available
resources.

[The occurrence of an "imported" case of polio in Angola is yet
another setback for the global polio eradication effort. The
identification of the virus as one originating in India is a reminder
that India is still an endemic area for wild poliovirus activity,
even though there has been major progress (to date there have been 18
confirmed cases in India for the year 2005, with 134 cases confirmed
in 2004, 225 cases confirmed in 2003, 1600 cases confirmed in 2002 --
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/casecount/afpextractnew.cfm>).

While this case is being classified as "imported," the absence of a
history of travel of the case means that there has been local
transmission of a wild poliovirus imported from India in the general
area where the case lives. With an overall country-wide vaccination
coverage of 45 percent, it is wise that the "mop-up" activities in
response to this case will be at the national level. That this case
had date of onset in late April 2005 and no additional cases have
been identified may be good signs, although there is not mention of
additional AFP cases currently under investigation. Of note, an
adequate AFP surveillance rate is a non-polio AFP rate of at least
1/100 000 population. According to the statistics presented above,
AFP surveillance is adequate in the affected areas. - Mod.MPP]
