Ebola situation report - 22 Apr 2015
------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The decline in confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has halted over the last 3 weeks. To accelerate the decline towards 0, cases will require stronger community engagement, improved contact tracing and earlier case identification. In the week to 19 Apr 2015, a total of 33 confirmed cases were reported, compared with 37 and 30 in the preceding weeks.

In the week to 19 Apr 2015, Guinea reported 21 confirmed cases, compared with 28 cases the previous week. Sierra Leone reported 12 confirmed cases, compared with 9 cases reported the previous week. Liberia reported no confirmed cases.

A total of 4 Guinean prefectures reported at least one confirmed case in the week to 19 Apr 2015, compared with 5 the previous week. Transmission remains confined to the west of the country and is primarily focused on the prefecture of Forecariah, bordering Sierra Leone, which reported 86 per cent of national confirmed cases.

In Sierra Leone, Western Area Urban, which includes the capital Freetown, reported 6 confirmed cases, which represent half of the cases reported nationally, a slight increase from 4 cases the previous week. Koinadugu, which borders Guinea to the north, reported one new confirmed case of unknown origin. Other districts reporting new confirmed cases were Kambia (4 cases) and Port Loko (1 case) in the west of the country. In the week to 19 Apr 2015, 4 districts reported at least one confirmed case compared to 3 districts the previous week.

Response indicators from Sierra Leone present a mixed picture. The number of EVD-positive deaths that were identified in the community after postmortem testing was 3 (1 in Kambia, 1 in Western Area Urban, 1 in Koinadugu) in the week to 19 Apr 2015, and the percentage of new cases arising from known contacts was 44 per cent in the week to 12 Apr 2015. Laboratory indicators reflect heightened vigilance: large numbers of samples were collected (1467), and less than one per cent of these tested EVD-positive (12 of 1467 samples).

Response indicators for Guinea also present a mixed picture. A total of 6 deaths from EVD in the week to 19 Apr 2015 were identified post-mortem in the community compared with 8 deaths the previous week. The percentage of confirmed cases that arose among registered contacts remained below 50 per cent for the 3rd consecutive week, at 46 per cent in the week to 12 Apr 2015 (the most recent week for which data are available), but an increase on 29 per cent reported in the previous week. Laboratory indicators improved with the number of laboratory samples tested increasing for a 5th consecutive week to 565 samples tested in the week to 19 Apr 2015 and the number of positive samples dropping to 6 per cent compared with 10 per cent the previous week.

Community engagement appears to be steadily improving in Guinea and Sierra Leone, but more needs to be done to identify all chains of transmission. A case-finding and community awareness-raising campaign took place in the Guinean prefecture of Forecariah from 12 to 15 Apr 2015, identifying 12 new confirmed cases, 7 of these from postmortem testing, representing 52 per cent of confirmed cases reported in Forecariah during that period. A similar campaign is planned for the prefecture of Coyah (launch date 24 Apr 2015) and later in Dubreka, Conakry, Kindia and Boffa.

The last confirmed case in Liberia died on 27 Mar 2015 and was buried on 28 Mar 2015. Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country. In the 5 days to 19 Apr 2015, 212 new laboratory samples were tested for EVD, with no confirmed cases. 42 days will have elapsed since burial of the last confirmed case on 9 May 2015.

There were no new health worker infections reported in the week to 19 Apr 2015.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
There have been a total of 26 044 reported, confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1 -- see source URL), with 10 808 reported deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 21 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 0 in Liberia, and 12 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 19 Apr 2015.

The total number of confirmed and probable cases is similar in males and females (table 2 -- see source URL). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 3-5 times more likely to be affected than children.

A total of 865 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 504 reported deaths (table 5 -- see source URL).

[3] WHO statement on Ebola response
Date: Thurs 16 Apr 2015
Source: WHO Global Alert and response [edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/joint-statement-ebola/en/


The Ebola outbreak that started in December 2013 became a public health, humanitarian and socioeconomic crisis with a devastating impact on families, communities and affected countries. It also served as a reminder that the world, including WHO, is ill-prepared for a large and sustained disease outbreak.

We, the director-general, deputy director-general, and regional directors of WHO, are making this commitment of collective leadership to member states and their peoples in line with recommendations made by the special session of the Executive Board on Ebola held in January 2015. We have taken note of the constructive criticisms of WHO's performance and the lessons learned to ensure that WHO plays its rightful place in disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies and in global health security.

What have we learned?
---------------------
We have learned that new diseases and old diseases in new contexts must be treated with humility and an ability to respond quickly to surprises. Greater surge capacity contributes to a flexible response.

We have learned lessons of fragility. We have seen that health gains -- fewer child deaths, malaria coming under control, more women surviving child birth -- are all too easily reversed when built on fragile health systems, which are quickly overwhelmed and collapse in the face of an outbreak of this nature.

We have learned the importance of capacity. We can mount a highly effective response to small and medium-sized outbreaks, but when faced with an emergency of this scale, our current capacities and systems -- national and international -- simply have not coped.

We have learned lessons of community and culture. A significant obstacle to an effective response has been the inadequate engagement with affected communities and families. This is not simply about getting the right messages across; we must learn to listen if we want to be heard. We have learned the importance of respect for culture in promoting safe and respectful funeral and burial practices. Empowering communities must be an action, not a cliche.

We have learned lessons of solidarity. In a disease outbreak, all are at risk. We have learned that the global surveillance and response system is only as strong as its weakest links, and in an increasingly globalized world, a disease threat in one country is a threat to us all. Shared vulnerability means shared responsibility and, therefore, requires sharing of resources, and sharing of information.

We have learned the challenges of coordination. We have learnt to recognise the strengths of others and the need to work in partnership when we do not have the capacity ourselves.

We have been reminded that market-based systems do not deliver on commodities for neglected diseases, endemic or epidemic. Incentives are needed to encourage the development of new medical products for diseases that disproportionately affect the poor. The scientific community, the pharmaceutical industry, and regulators have come together in a collaborative effort to vastly compress the time needed to develop and approve Ebola vaccines, medicines, and rapid diagnostic tests. In future, this ad hoc emergency effort needs to be replaced by more routine procedures that are part of preparedness.

Finally, we have learned the importance of communication, of communicating risks early, of communicating more clearly what is needed, and of involving communities and their leaders in the messaging.

What must we do?
----------------
We will engage with national authorities and request them to keep outbreak prevention, preparedness and response management at the top of national and global agendas.

We will develop the capacity to respond rapidly and effectively to disease outbreaks and humanitarian emergencies. This will require a directing and coordinating mechanism to bring together the world's resources to mount a rapid and effective response. We commit to expanding our core staff working on diseases with outbreak potential and health emergencies so we will have skilled staff always available at the 3 levels of WHO. We will also create surge capacity of teams of trained and certified staff so that we have a reserve force in the event of an emergency.

We will create a Global Health Emergency Workforce, combining the expertise of public health scientists, the clinical skills of doctors, nurses and other health workers, the management skills of logisticians and project managers, and the skills of social scientists, communication experts and community workers. This Global Health Emergency Workforce will be made up of teams of trained and certified responders who can be available immediately. A key principle must be to build capacity in countries, with training and simulation exercises.

We will establish a Contingency Fund to enable WHO to respond more rapidly to disease outbreaks. We must ensure that adequate resources -- domestic and international -- are available before the next outbreak.

We recognize that emergency situations demand a command and control approach, and we commit to seamless collaboration between headquarters, regional offices, and country offices. Better WHO systems for rapid staff deployments, data collection and reporting, expansion of laboratory services, logistics, and coordination were developed as the outbreak evolved. These systems will be institutionalized.

The massive international response revealed the unique strengths of multiple partners, including UN agencies. We will build on these partnerships, concentrating on capacities that are most critically needed under the demanding conditions of emergencies.

We will strengthen the International Health Regulations, the international framework for preparedness, surveillance and response for disease outbreaks and other health threats. We commit to strengthening our capacity to assess, plan and implement preparedness and surveillance measures. We will scale up our support to countries to develop the minimum core capacities to implement the IHR. We will establish mechanisms for independent verification of national capacity to detect and respond to disease threats.

We will develop expertise in community engagement in outbreak preparedness and response. We will emphasise the importance of community systems strengthening and work with partners to develop multidisciplinary approaches to community engagement, informed by anthropology and other social sciences.

We will communicate better. We commit to provide timely information on disease outbreaks and other health emergencies as they occur. We will strengthen our capacity for outbreak and risk communications.

We call on world leaders to take the following steps:
-----------------------------------------------------
1st, take disease threats seriously. We do not know when the next major outbreak will come or what will cause it. But history tells us it will come. This means investing domestically and internationally in prevention and in essential public health systems for preparedness, surveillance and response, which are fully integrated and aligned with efforts to strengthen health systems and included in the scope of development assistance for health.

2nd, remain vigilant. This Ebola outbreak is far from over, and we must sustain our support to the affected countries until the outbreak is over, in the face of increasing complacency and growing fatigue. We must continue to maintain a high level of surveillance. Ebola has demonstrated its capacity to spread; it may do so again.

3rd, engage to reestablish the services, systems and infrastructure which have been devastated in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. This recovery must be country-led, community-based, and inclusive, engaging the many partners who have something to contribute, including bilateral and multilateral partners, national and international NGOs, the faith community, and the private sector.

4th, be transparent in reporting. Accurate and timely information is the basis for effective action. Speedy detection facilitates speedy response and prevents escalation.

5th, invest in research and development for the neglected diseases with outbreak potential, diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines. This will require innovative financing mechanisms and public-private partnerships.

This is our commitment; together we will ensure that WHO is reformed and well positioned to play its rightful role in disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies and in global health security.

[WHO has been highly criticized in the press for its delay in declaring the Ebola outbreak an emergency, a major factor in allowing the epidemic to build momentum to the point it grew out of control. This report is the outcome of a meeting of top policy makers of this organization, who very wisely reviewed what errors were made and what changes must be made to prevent a repeat. A panel of outside experts also is currently reviewing WHO's response to Ebola.

As there surely will be outbreaks of unknown etiology, especially zoonotic diseases as well as Ebola, in the future, it is admirable for WHO to review the steps that were taken that worked well and those that did not. Now the hard work begins to make the recommended changes. This will require sufficient funds budgeted to maintain infrastructure to be able to respond quickly to new outbreaks. - Mod.LK]

Researchers were able to protect all of the nonhuman primate subjects against a lethal Makona Ebola infection when treatment began 3 days following infection, when the infected showed clinical signs of disease and had detectable levels of virus in their blood. All of the test primates showed advanced symptoms, but those receiving treatment had milder symptoms and recovered fully. The untreated controls died from the disease on days 8 and 9, similar to that reported in the field after patients begin showing symptoms of Ebola.
