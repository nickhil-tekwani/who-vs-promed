The mystery disease that has spread in some villages of Banke
district in mid-western Nepal for the past 2 weeks was diagnosed as
cerebral malaria, The Himalayan Times reported on Thursday [2 Nov 2006].
Talking to the daily, advisor to the Health Ministry Mahesh Maskey
said a medical team reached the affected villages with essential
equipment and medicines on Wednesday [1 Nov 2006] to examine the patients.
"The disease was diagnosed as cerebral malaria (a severe type of
malaria), after examining blood samples of some patients," Maskey
said. Fifteen of the patients were found infected with malaria.
"Cerebral malaria is transmitted after being bitten by a female
mosquito of 'anopheles' species. This kind of malaria directly
affects the brain so a person infected with this malaria dies within
few days, " Maskey said.
According to the daily, as many as 36 people have died of an
"unknown" disease that has spread in 6 villages in Banke district.

[Background information on the malaria picture in Nepal can be found
at the WHO SEARO (SouthEast Asian Regional Office) website:
<http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section21/Section340.htm>.
"In 2004, out of 27.3 million population of the country, 19.4 million
are at malaria risk in Nepal. Out of that, 5.9 million reside in
forests and forest fringes and inner Terai, 7.9 million in plain
cultivated area and 5.6 million in hill areas. Malarious areas of the
country have been stratified into 5 eco-epidemiological strata. >From
1996 malaria cases have remained below 10 000 annually. _Plasmodium
falciparum_ proportion was 10 to 13 in 1996 and 1997 because of the
outbreak in 1996 in Kanchanpur and in Nawalparasi in 1997. Malaria
incidence in the last 5 years has stabilized at around 8000 to 9000
cases annually. In 2000, there were 7616 cases with 7.4 percent of
_P. falciparum_ cases. Monthly distribution of malaria indicated that
the disease is prevalent throughout the year with main concentration
during the monsoon season. Even _P. falciparum _ is found throughout
the year. In the last fiscal year (1998-99) altogether 47 000
clinical malaria cases with 8900 (in 1999!
) confirmed malaria cases were recorded with morbidity rate due to
malaria estimated at 0.35 percent for the area at malaria risk. The
highest morbidity rate (API 7.3 percent) was in Kavrepalanchowk
district where 29 percent of the total country confirmed malaria
cases were recorded in 1999. For the VDC Mahadevsthan of the district
where maximum cases were concentrated, the API was 45. During the
period from 1995-1999, few severe malaria cases were recorded. There
were 15 deaths in 1996 during the epidemic in Kanchanpur
district. The reported malaria cases keep on declining. However, it
is important to notice that the probable malaria cases are going up
continuously with 20 737 in 1998 to 63 933 in 2002. During 2004,
total 4637 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with 745 (16.1
percent) _P. falciparum_ cases. However, the probable malaria cases
during the same period were reported as 49 087."
From a map of Banke district in Nepal, it is clear that the district
is located in the Terai region, where malaria is
endemic/epidemic.

As mentioned in the earlier posting, there was flooding in the
affected region back in September and this most probably led to the
increase in mosquito breeding sites, which leads to an increase in
the mosquitoes and subsequent increase in transmission of
mosquito-borne disease.

More information from official sources would be very much
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
