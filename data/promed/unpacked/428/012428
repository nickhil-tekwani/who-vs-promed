An unknown disease has destroyed over 1000 ha of cashewnut crop at Mkuranga District in Coast [Pwani] Region, resulting in poor quality and lower quantity yields.

Coast Region Cooperative Union Chairman Juma Abeid said that it has been almost 4 years since the cashewnuts unknown disease broke out in their farms and destroyed the crops. "We are now harvesting 30 bags instead of 200 bags per 1000 ha. We ask the government to intervene in order to make sure the epidemic does not speed to other regions," he said.

Naliendele Agricultural Research Institute's Dr Lohisi Kasuga said the cashewnut infestation is a long time problem in the area. "I have done intensive research on this disease, but I found nothing. So, we are now looking forward to receiving experts from England to diagnose the cashew [disease] and find a solution," he said.

[Cashew (_Anacardium occidentale_) is a valuable tropical cash and food crop. Other members of the family (Anacardiaceae) include mango and pistachio. A number of fungal pathogens are known to cause problems in the crop (for examples see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below) as well as bacterial leaf spot.

A fungal leaf and nut blight of cashew has been reported in Tanzania earlier (see link below). In East Africa, including neighbouring Mozambique, the crop has been reported to be affected by powdery mildew (_Oidium anacardii_), causing significant yield losses (ProMED-mail post 20090604.2069), sometimes in combination with other factors.

Reliable diagnosis of the problem in Pwani region will be required to be able to devise effective control and/or management strategies.
