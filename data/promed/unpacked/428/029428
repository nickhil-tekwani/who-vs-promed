China is facing outbreaks of a debilitating virus in cattle that causes a condition called "lumpy skin disease", following an incident on a farm in the eastern province of Zhejiang this week, the agriculture ministry said on Wednesday [15 Jul 2020]. On its website, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said 5 cases [outbreaks, see comment] were found during June [2020] in the southern provinces of Guangdong and Fujian and the eastern provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui.

"The local area has effectively dealt with the epidemic," the ministry said of this week's incident. "It has killed 2 diseased cattle and disposed of them, and (the farm) has been thoroughly and completely disinfected."

The disease does not affect people and is thought to be spread by flies or mosquitoes, causing nodules to form on the skin, with accompanying symptoms such as much lower milk production, but it is rarely fatal.

Taiwan also reported its 1st case of the disease this month [July 2020] on Kinmen Island.

[According to a media report from Taiwan, dated 10 Jul 2020 (presented in 20200710.7561703), "In early June [2020], media reports informed the LSD spread [in mainland China] to Fujian, but OIE has not been notified."

An official notification of "nodular dermatosis" (index number 00020925M/2020-00256) in cattle from Fujian (China), written on 24 Jun 2020 and published on 7 Jul 2020, is available at http://www.huhhot.gov.cn/zwgk/zfxxgkzl/zfxxgkmlx/202007/t20200707_707878.html.

The start of China's 1st LSD outbreak (in Xinjiang, close to the border with eastern Kazakhstan) was dated 3 Aug 2019, according to China's immediate notification to the OIE (20190826.6641564). No additional outbreaks were reported during 2019, as apparent from China's semiannual report to the OIE, covering July-December 2019. No follow-up reports have been submitted to the present day; the 1st outbreak is still termed "continuing." According to the above media reports, 5 outbreaks (erroneously termed in the above report as "cases") took place during June 2020 in the southern provinces of Guangdong and Fujian and the eastern provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui. These, and any additional outbreaks throughout China since August 2019, are expected to be included, with their corresponding epidemiological details, in follow-up reports.

OIE's global LSD interactive map, presenting all reported outbreaks since 1 Jan 2019, is available at https://tinyurl.com/y7v29a4y. Subscribers are encouraged to visit the map and click on various clusters to center, then zoom in to the required resolution when necessary. The singularity of the Chinese outbreak, and the absence of (reported) outbreaks in Kazakhstan (view also its northern borders), are enigmatic.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD, nodular dermatosis) is a capripoxvirus disease of cattle characterised by fever; nodules on the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs; emaciation; enlarged lymph nodes; oedema of the skin; and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and death due to secondary bacterial infections. Transmission of LSD virus is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient. While LSD is endemic in most African and Middle Eastern countries, it has widely spread within Eurasia during the last decade, as apparent from the OIE map. LSD is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
