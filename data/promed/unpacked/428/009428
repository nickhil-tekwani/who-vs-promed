Having returned in July from a three year stay in Shanghai, I am here to
tell you that raw lobster is often served as a "treat" at banquets.
The lobster (supposedly imported from Australia) is first brought to the
table alive then returned to the kitchen and reappears as very thinly
shaved pieces on a pile of ice with lemon on the side...

The lobster sushi controversy recalls a description of lobster sashimi,
ordered in ignorance by the wife of a Japanese friend. As she described
it, the lobster arrived on the plate alive, and her husband ate it.
I find this hard to believe, although she is not a "kidder" and her
husband did not deny it.

An internet search (AltaVista) for "lobster sushi" generates 29 pages;
a search on "lobster sashimi" generates 49: somebody must be eating it.

{This is a non-controversy. It started because of the report of a
cholera-like vibrio killing lobsters in Maine, USA, and the fear that
this might be transmissible to man.
Lobster illness identified - USA (Maine) 990122231936
According to Dr Andrew Yuan, the lobster eaten as sushi (and sashimi) is
the spiny, warm-water Pacific lobster, which does not have unpalatable
tendons, and not the cold-water Atlantic lobster, which must be eaten
cooked. Since no one eats raw Atlantic lobster, nobody is going to get
infected from it.
So, yes, Japan, lobster sushi does exist. This thread is now closed -
