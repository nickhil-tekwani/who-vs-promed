The Ministry of Health of the Nation and the Ministry of Public Health of Salta issued an epidemiological alert for the increase in cases of paratyphoid fever (caused by a strain of salmonella bacteria) in the province, in order to inform about the risk situation and intensify prevention and control activities.

The alert arises from a report prepared by the epidemiology areas of Salta and the Nation, the Malbr√°n Laboratory and the Department of Sanitary and Nutritional Surveillance of Food, INAL-Anmat, published in recent days. The document ensures that, in the province of Salta, since epidemiological week 47 of the year [2021], 2017 cases of paratyphoid fever have been registered, with an increase in notifications every year and marked seasonality.

The isolates were confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory (LNR) as _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Paratyphi B.

In the National Health Surveillance System, from epidemiological week 1 to 45 of 2021, 1088 notifications of typhoid and paratyphoid fever were registered, of which 1069 correspond to residents in the province of Salta, mainly in the capital city and its surrounding municipalities.

The highest number of cases occurred in the 1st weeks of the year, decreasing until autumn/winter, and a sustained increase in cases was registered since epidemiological week 32, with around 45 [to] 100 notifications.

Paratyphoid fever is a systemic bacterial disease, characterized by onset with continuous fever, severe headache, general malaise, anorexia, relative bradycardia, splenomegaly, non-productive cough in the early stages of evolution, and constipation more common than diarrhea in adults.

The document issued by the Ministry of Health of the Nation indicates that, although cases have been registered in all age groups, 63% of those notified this year [2021] have been among children under 15 years of age.

Faced with this situation, the national and provincial portfolios recommended that all health teams strengthen the clinical-epidemiological suspicion of paratyphoid fever in people who meet the case definition and inform and sensitize the population about prevention measures and early warning against the appearance of symptoms. The objectives of epidemiological surveillance are to detect cases early to implement diagnosis, treatment and control actions, and allow and direct epidemiological research aimed at interrupting the transmission of the disease.

The Salta Ministry of Health recommended, given the increase in temperature before the arrival of summer, to take precautions in the handling of food, since bacteria enter the body through the ingestion of contaminated water or food such as [beef and poultry], eggs, milk or mayonnaise, as well as fish and shellfish.

[Paratyphoid fever is similar to typhoid fever in that both are enteric fever types of disease, although the former can be, but is not necessarily, less severe. The paratyphoid salmonellas are divided into A, B, and, rarely now, C. _Salmonella_ Paratyphi, also referred to as _S. enterica_ serotype Paratyphi, types B and C, also have species, now serotypes, Schottmuelleri and Hirschfeldii, respectively. Like typhoid, paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a zoonosis, with [only] humans as the reservoir, but the paratyphoid bacillus has been isolated from domestic animals and fish.

In India, paratyphoid A has become an increasing problem, accounting for up to 45% of cases of enteric fever in 1998 (1). Although initially quite sensitive to antimicrobials, strains have become more resistant to quinolones; in contrast, _S._ Typhi has manifested resistance for some time.

In a report regarding differential risk factors for typhoid and paratyphoid in Indonesia, the authors found that the infections seemed to have distinct routes of transmission (2). Typhoid was associated with factors within a household (recent case in the house, no soap for handwashing, sharing of food from the same plate, no toilet in the house), whereas paratyphoid was associated with sources outside the household, such as food from street vendors and flooding.
