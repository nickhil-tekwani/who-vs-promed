Flu virus identified in "unusual" New England seal deaths
---------------------------------------------------------
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is stepping
up an investigation into the cause of 146 harbor seal deaths along the
New England coast since September [2011] after influenza A virus was
identified in 5 of the seals. On 4 Nov [2011], NOAA announced it had
declared the seal deaths an "unusual mortality event," which
authorizes the federal agency to mobilize additional resources in the
investigation.

The declaration followed a consultation with the Working Group on
Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Events, a panel of international
experts established under the Marine Mammal Protection Act to monitor
and investigate marine mammal health concerns.

Between 1 Sept 2011 and 3 Nov 2011, 146 seal strandings were reported
in Maine, New Hampshire, and northern Massachusetts -- more than 3
times the average number of strandings for that time of year. Most of
the animals were harbor seals less than a year old.

Samples from 5 seals analyzed at the New England Aquarium tested
positive for influenza A virus. Test results for several other viral
pathogens and biotoxins were negative.

Additional evaluations were under way to determine whether the
influenza virus has played a role in the deaths.

An investigation team of marine mammal experts will work closely with
NOAA, New England Stranding Network partners, and the Working Group on
Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Events to identify and characterize
the specific type of influenza A virus found in these animals.

People were being advised not to allow their dogs to approach stranded
seals, as seals and dogs can infect each other with diseases, NOAA
noted.

[It would be important to know how many samples were tested for
influenza. If all 146 stranded seals were tested, and 141 resulted
negative, it is likely the virus might not be directly implicated. In
the past (1979-1983), influenza A virus was isolated from seals that
died from pneumonia in New England. It would be relevant to establish
if these stranded animals had pneumonia. - Mod.PMB]
