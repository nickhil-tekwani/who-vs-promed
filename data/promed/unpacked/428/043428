Newcastle disease strikes chickens
----------------------------------
OKAYAMA (Kyodo): About 4000 chickens will be destroyed at a poultry farm in
Ibara, Okayama Prefecture, after some 600 other birds died in an outbreak
of Newcastle disease, a highly contagious disease among birds, prefectural
government sources said on Saturday.
The birds to be destroyed were in the same building as the 600 that died
and will be killed to prevent the disease from spreading. The farm has
about 12 000 chickens, they said. The outbreak was discovered after a
livestock-health hygiene center found a hen breathing abnormally during an
inspection on Tuesday, according to the sources. No abnormalities have been
found among chickens at poultry farms nearby, they added.
Newcastle disease is a destructive virus affecting birds, especially
domestic fowl. It affects the digestive, respiratory, and nervous systems.
It is not contagious to humans.
