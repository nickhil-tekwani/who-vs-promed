CDC health advisory: influenza-associated pediatric mortality and
_Staphylococcus aureus_ co-infection
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC [the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control] is requesting that
states report all cases of influenza-related pediatric mortality during the
2007-2008 influenza season. This health advisory contains updated
information about influenza and bacterial co-infections in children and
provides interim testing and treatment recommendations.

Background
----------
Since 2004, the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance
System, part of the Nationally Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, has
collected information on deaths among children due to laboratory-confirmed
influenza, including the presence of other medical conditions and bacterial
infections at the time of death. From 1 Oct 2006 through 30 Sep 2007, 73
deaths from influenza in children were reported to CDC from 39 state health
departments and 2 city health departments. Data on the presence (or
absence) of bacterial co-infections were recorded for 69 of these cases; 30
(44 per cent) had a bacterial co-infection, and 22 (73 per cent) of these
30 were infected with _Staphylococcus aureus_.

The number of pediatric influenza-associated deaths reported during 2006-07
was moderately higher than the number reported during the 2 previous
surveillance years; the number of these deaths in which pneumonia or
bacteremia due to _S. aureus__ was noted represents a 5-fold increase. Only
one _S. aureus_ co-infection among 47 influenza deaths was identified in
2004-2005, and 3 co-infections among 46 deaths were identified in
2005-2006. Of the 22 influenza deaths reported with _S. aureus_ in
2006-2007, 15 children had infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus
(MRSA).

The median age of children with _S. aureus_ co-infection was older than
children without _S. aureus_ co-infection (10 years versus 5 years, p <
0.01) and children with co-infection were more likely to have pneumonia and
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Influenza strains isolated from
these children were not different from common strains circulating in the
community, and the MRSA strains have been similar to those associated with
MRSA skin infection outbreaks in the United States.

Recommendations
---------------
Health care providers should test persons hospitalized with respiratory
illness for influenza, including those with suspected community-acquired
pneumonia. Health care providers should be alerted to the possibility of
bacterial co-infection among children with influenza, and request bacterial
cultures if children are severely ill or when community-acquired pneumonia
is suspected. Health care providers should be aware of the prevalence of
methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ strains in their communities when
choosing empiric therapy for patients with suspected influenza-related
pneumonia. Clinicians, health care providers, and medical examiners are
asked to contact their local or state health department as soon as possible
when deaths among children associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza
are identified.

CDC requests that state health departments report all cases of pediatric
influenza-associated deaths to CDC through <http://sdn.cdc.gov> about
bacterial pathogens isolated from sterile sites and/or from sputum or
endotracheal aspirates be completed on the Influenza-Associated Pediatric
Mortality Surveillance System case report form. If the influenza death was
complicated by _S. aureus_ infection, state health departments are asked to
please contact the clinical agency that reported the case to determine if
the _S. aureus_ isolate is available. CDC will receive _S. aureus_ isolates
in order to better characterize those _S. aureus_ isolates from children
who have died from influenza.

If you have any questions about this health advisory notice, please call
the Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch at 404-639-3747.

[Respiratory disease in childhood may be associated with infection by
several different viral pathogens. For example severe respiratory disease
in infancy is more often a consequence of infection with respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV). It would be appropriate to extend this survey to
determine the consequences of co-infection with _S. aureus_ on the outcome
of infection by another viral respiratory pathogen such as RSV. - Mod.CP

Bacterial pneumonia is a well-recognized complication of influenza, and can
also follow measles and varicella. Bacterial pneumonia in these settings
has been attributed to loss of mucociliary clearance and increased
adherence of bacteria to virus-infected epithelial cells. Bacterial
pneumonia that occurs following influenza is most often due to
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Hemophilus pneumoniae_, and _S. aureus_. _S.
aureus_ is an otherwise unusual pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia
(it more commonly causes hospital-acquired pneumonia), but can cause a
severe, necrotizing pulmonary infection following influenza that has a
relatively high case-fatality rate -- for example, 33 per cent during the
1968-69 influenza pandemic (Schwarzmann SW, Adler JL, Sullivan RJ, Marine
WM. Bacterial pneumonia during the Hong Kong influenza epidemic of
1968-1969. Arch Intern Med 1971; 127: 1037-41).

_S.aureus_ pneumonia has been infrequently encountered in healthy children.
In addition, methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA), a relatively common
cause of pneumonia in the hospital setting, has been an unusual cause of
community-acquired pneumonia. However, Schultz and colleagues (The changing
face of pleural empyemas in children: epidemiology and management.
Pediatrics 2004; 113: 1735-40) and Buckingham and colleagues (Incidence and
etiologies of complicated parapneumonic effusions in children, 1996 to
2001. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2003; 22: 499-504) reported the relatively
recent emergence of MRSA as a cause of pediatric empyema and
community-acquired pneumonia. During the 2003-04 influenza season, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported severe bacterial
pneumonia caused by MRSA after influenza virus infection or influenza-like
illness in previously healthy children and adults
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EiD/vol12no06/05-1141.htm>. Most of the MRSA
isolates carried the gene for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL, an exotoxin
that induces lysis of host macrophages, thus impairing host response and
facilitating tissue necrosis); were the pulse-field gel electrophoresis
subtype USA300, the predominant strain responsible for community outbreaks
of MRSA skin disease in the United States; and carried the staphylococcal
cassette chromosome mec type IVa, characteristic of community-associated
MRSA (CA-MRSA).

Reports of pediatric mortality associated with bacterial co-infections with
influenza virus infection had been uncommon
<http://www.jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/297/19/2070>). However,
pediatric influenza deaths have only been nationally notifiable in the US
since 2004. Although skin and soft tissue infections remain the most common
infection caused by CA-MRSA, (Fridkin SK, Hageman JC, Morrison M, et al.
Active bacterial core surveillance program of the Emerging Infections
Program Network: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus disease in
three communities. N Engl J Med 2005; 352:1436-44), CDC anticipates
increasing cases of complicated pneumonia due to this organism, especially
in children.

The presence of preceding staphylococcal skin disease among persons with
staphylococcal pneumonia has been described previously during an influenza
pandemic (Goslings WR, Mulder J, Djajadiningrat J, Masurel J.
Staphylococcal pneumonia in influenza in relation to antecedent
staphylococcal skin infection. Lancet 1959; 2: 428-30). The index of
suspicion for MRSA community-associated pneumonia, therefore, should be
increased in patients with a history of MRSA infection, or close contact
with an MRSA-infected person, or in communities where CA-MRSA infections
have been identified.

Other than beta-lactams, CA-MRSA isolates usually are susceptible to a wide
range of antibiotics, including clindamycin, gentamicin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and some fluoroquinolones.
That phenotypic CA-MRSA antibiotic susceptibility pattern, however, may not
persist for long. Recently, some CA-MRSA USA300 have accumulated multiple
drug resistance genes resulting in resistance not only to beta-lactam
antibiotics, but also resistance to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline,
macrolides, clindamycin, and mupirocin (see ProMED-mail post
20080119.0232). - Mod.ML]
