West Nile virus in birds in the Vladivostok Region
--------------------------------------------------
[The following report, provided by Dr Valery B Loktev, records the
isolation of West Nile virus from a vulture in the Vladivostok Region of
Russia. - Mod.CP]
West Nile virus found in a dead Cinereous Vulture in the Far Eastern region
of Russia in 2003. VA Ternovoi, SI Zolotykh, EV Protopopova, MA
Shestopalov, VB Loktev, State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology
"Vector", Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Region, Russia; GN Leonova, Research
Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, SB RAMS, Vladivostok, Russia;
EV Radiulov, Khasan Natural Park, Primorye Region, Russia.
Summary: Between 1999 and 2003, up to 220 dead cinereous vultures
(_Aegypius monachus_) were found near Vladivostok during the autumn-winter
period. A frozen sample from a dead bird was collected in the Khasan
region, near Lotus Lake, in 2003, and, was analyzed by anti-WNV
MAb-modified immunoenzyme assay for antigen detection and RT-PCR (reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). The sample was positive in ELISA
(enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) and RT-PCR. Sequencing of a 400 bp
fragment of the E protein gene showed 99 per cent homology with the
WNV/LEIV-Vlg99-27889 strain of WNV (isolated in Volgograd, Russia, in
1999). These results confirm that WNV is circulating in the Far Eastern
region of Russia at the present time.

[It is not clear whether there is presumed to be any connection between the
death of the vultures and the presence of West Nile virus. Further
information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
