Police Officers Stricken With Nausea at G-8 Summit Site;
Officials Rule Out Food Poisoning
------------------------------
Dozens of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers working at the site
of this week's G-8 summit became nauseous early Monday, and 3 were
taken to a Calgary hospital.
Constable Rob Dunnett of the RCMP said the officers at Nakiska camp,
inside the security zone at the Kananaskis resort where the summit
begins Wednesday, fell ill during the night. He said about 30 were
treated at Nakiska camp. RCMP Constable Charlene Lewis said only 3
officers were hospitalized, and one had been released while the other 2
were being treated for dehydration.
The cause of the outbreak was unknown. Officials initially said the
symptoms were consistent with food poisoning, but authorities later
ruled that out.
"The regional health authority, the RCMP medical team, and the
(Department of National Defense) medical team has taken a look at
what those officers had to eat and they believe they could not find any
source of contamination there in Kananaskis," Calgary police Insp.
Murray Stooke said. "And so it's an open question as to where that
source of contamination arose."
Thousands of police and soldiers are in the Kananaskis area to provide
security for the 2-day summit of world leaders, including President
Bush.
Security concerns have brought extraordinary attention to detail in
planning the summit, with samples of food to be served the 8 heads of
state being frozen for testing in case any of them get sick.

[The plot thickens. I wonder why they aren't testing the frozen food
samples before serving -- alternatively, they could irradiate it all.
Conspiracy theorists please note; if this was a bioattack, then it was 36
hours premature & the disability rate was only 30 out of several
thousand police & soldiers. - Mod.JW]
