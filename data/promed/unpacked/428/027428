FMD and Bluetongue: update to integrated strategy
-------------------------------------------------
Defra has confirmed that a 3rd animal has tested positive for
bluetongue. This is on a premises near Lowestoft [Suffolk}. At this
stage, there is not sufficient evidence to confirm an active outbreak
of bluetongue by the internationally-recognised definition. It cannot
yet be demonstrated that the disease is circulating or [whether]
alternatively it is the result of a single incursion of infected
midges from abroad.
Epidemiological investigations are underway to establish whether
bluetongue disease is circulating in the UK.
Active discussions with key stakeholders are continuing to determine
what the appropriate measures would be, should an outbreak of
bluetongue be confirmed. Any action will be in line with the UK
Bluetongue Control Strategy, published in August [2007], but will
also take account of the current FMD restrictions.
Meanwhile the risk-based contingency plans for FMD and bluetongue are
being followed in an integrated way. In the light of the 3rd infected
animal being found it has been agreed that it would not be
appropriate to allow farm to farm movements in the area surrounding
the premises from 3:30 pm today [25 Sep 2007]. This area is Norfolk
and Suffolk.
Essex is also considered to be at risk of Bluetongue, but as it is
also in the FMD Risk Area, farm-to-farm movements would not be
permitted in any case.
Chief Veterinary Officer, Debby Reynolds, said, "Whilst foot and
mouth Disease and bluetongue are present in the country, all animal
keepers should proceed with caution. To provide clarity on movement
restrictions, farming leaders, the veterinary profession, Defra and
all of those concerned will continue to provide a constant flow of
information as this is a dynamic situation. If in doubt, people can
consult a wide range of sources of information."
