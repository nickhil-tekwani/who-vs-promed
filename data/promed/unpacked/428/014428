Abstract
--------
In Mauritania, several mosquito-borne viruses have been reported that can cause devastating diseases in animals and humans. However, monitoring data on their occurrence and local distribution are limited. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne virus that causes major outbreaks throughout the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. The 1st Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in Mauritania occurred in 1987, and since then, the country has been affected by recurrent outbreaks of the disease. To gain information on the occurrence of RVFV as well as other mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors in Mauritania, we collected and examined 4950 mosquitoes, belonging to 4 genera and 14 species. The mosquitoes were captured during 2018 in the capital Nouakchott and in southern parts of Mauritania. Evidence of RVFV was found in a mosquito pool of female _Anopheles pharoensis_ mosquitoes collected in December [2018] on a farm near the Senegal River. At that time, 37.5% of 16 tested Montbeliarde cattle on the farm showed RVFV-specific IgM antibodies. Additionally, we detected IgM antibodies in 10.7% of 28 indigenous cattle that had been sampled on the same farm one month earlier. To obtain information on potential RVFV reservoir hosts, blood meals captured engorged mosquitoes were analyzed. The mosquitoes mainly fed on humans (urban areas) and cattle (rural areas), but also on small ruminants, donkeys, cats, dogs, and straw-colored fruit bats. Results of this study demonstrate the circulation of RVFV in Mauritania and thus the need for further research to investigate the distribution of the virus and its vectors. Furthermore, factors that may contribute to its maintenance should be analyzed more closely. In addition, 2 mosquito pools containing _Aedes aegypti_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes showed evidence of dengue virus (DENV) 2 circulation in the city of Rosso. Further studies are therefore needed to also examine DENV circulation in Mauritania.

Author summary
------------------
In Mauritania, various mosquito-borne viruses responsible for devastating diseases in livestock and/or humans occur, threatening both human and animal health. One of these viruses is the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV), which is widespread throughout the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. The 1st outbreak in Mauritania occurred in 1987, and epidemics have recurred since then. However, little is known about the maintenance of RVFV during inter-epidemic periods, in the absence of reported outbreaks, and although there is evidence of an active circulation of the virus during these times, only limited data are available on the abundance of RVFV and its vectors in Mauritania. Therefore, this study aimed to collect and examine mosquitoes in different areas where outbreaks have already occurred. Additionally, blood of collected blood-fed mosquitoes was analyzed to identify feeding patterns and thus wildlife potentially acting as RVFV reservoir hosts. Furthermore, the collected mosquitoes were analyzed for the presence of other neglected viruses in order to participate in an elucidation of the circulation of different viruses within the mosquito population in Mauritania and to be able to better prevent disease outbreaks.

Discussion [abridged]
-------------
To conclude, evidence of RVFV as wells as DENV was found in mosquitoes collected in Mauritania in 2018. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that mosquitoes feed on fruit bats, which are suspected to be involved in RVFV maintenance. In order to gain a thorough understanding of RVFV ecology, further in-depth studies are required to investigate factors promoting RVFV maintenance.

[This study provides additional evidence that Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is endemic in Mauritania. As the authors indicate, additional field studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of inter-epizootic persistence. Circulation in populations of wild vertebrates is one possibility. Transovarial virus transmission in _Aedes_ spp. that would carry the virus through several mosquito generations is another. The authors indicate that many _Aedes_ spp. may have been underrepresented in this study due to the collection method used. This is an important avenue to explore further in Mauritania. The authors do not indicate if the cattle they sampled for antibody detection had been vaccinated against RVFV. Presumably they had not, and antibody presence indicates natural RVFV infection. - Mod.TY

In East Africa, an increase in rainfall has been known to precede RVF epizootics, and a vector-related mechanism for the inter-epizootic persistence of RVFV has been established. Such phenomenon has not been observed at a similar rate in Mauritania; since its 1st considerable epizootic (1987), RVF activity has been recorded also during periods of drought and years not associated with extensive rainfall. This underlines the need for further studies. - Mod.AS
