Yellow fever - Liberia (North): WHO confirms: alert 20000824.1409

From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

We have received a report from a usually reliable source of a suspected
outbreak of yellow fever in Liberia. So far 81 suspected cases and 4 deaths
have been reported. A laboratory report stated that seropositive IgM
results were observed in one out of 5 samples. We understand that a
vaccination campaign is planned.

[The low case:fatality ratio, together with the observation that only one
in 5 samples scored IgM positive, casts doubt on the reliability of the
identification of the cause of the outbreak. Diagnosis based on IgM
seropositive results alone is inherently uncertain. Perhaps other causative
agents should be considered before an expensive vaccine campaign is
initiated? For example, Lassa fever has been reported from Liberia in the
recent past. Further information and an update on the current situation in
Liberia would be welcomed. -Mod.CP
