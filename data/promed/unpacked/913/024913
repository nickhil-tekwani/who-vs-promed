The [classical] swine fever [CSF] virus recently detected at a pig farm in the city of Gifu is a type that had not been found before in the country, the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization has said.

The virus type, seen in other parts of Asia and in Europe, was confirmed through genetic analysis, the institute said Friday [14 Sep 2018], adding that it is highly likely that the virus came from abroad.

Also, on Friday [14 Sep 2018], the Gifu prefectural government said the dead body of a wild boar found about 8 km [0.6 mile] from the pig farm on Thursday [13 Sep 2018] has tested positive for swine fever, also known as hog cholera.

[The new CSF event in Japan was initially reported by ProMED-mail on 9 Sep 2018. The comment included the following: "Available information on the source of infection and epidemiological statistics are expected in the due official OIE notification."

On Mon 10 Sep 2018, Japan submitted an immediate notification to the OIE; it included epidemiological statistics and comments. The current media report, presenting information from Japan's National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, adds that, according to genetic analysis, the current CSF virus "highly likely came from abroad." Luckily, the introduced disease agent is not African swine fever [ASF], against which vaccine is not available. Sequencing results may hopefully shed more light upon the specific geographic origin of the introduced CSF virus strain. Such information may help improvement of the control measures on international trade and on passengers, to prevent the introduction of ASF. - Mod.AS
