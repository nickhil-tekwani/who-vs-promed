Wildlife Smuggling, a U.S. Border Problem
-----------------------------------------------
When it comes to smuggling animals across the U.S.-Mexico border,
U.S. Wildlife Inspector Ed Marshall has seen it all: exotic birds
given Valium or tequila so they stay quiet through customs
inspections, sleeves moving with hidden reptiles, wildcats stashed in
trunks. Last week [4th week June 2005], the Border Patrol seized 2
white tigers on their way to Mexico. And in 2001, an African elephant
was smuggled across the Gateway International Bridge on a truck.
"They call it the 'Dumbo Case,'" Marshall said, shaking his head.

The contraband is part of a global trade in endangered wildlife,
estimated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at USD 4.2 billion a
year, 2nd only to illegal drugs. "People don't realize how serious
and how important this is and that this is linked to organized
crime," said Crawford Allan of the World Wildlife Fund. Experts say
the trade depletes endangered species and spreads diseases such as
avian influenza, because the smuggled animals are not examined and
quarantined. Many of the animals do not survive the trip.

The trade works both ways on the U.S.-Mexico border, and it is
believed that Latin drug kingpins with private zoos or exotic game
camps are business for breeders operating clandestinely on Texas
ranches. "It's a macho drug culture thing," said Pat Burchfield,
deputy director of Brownsville's Gladys Porter Zoo. "They're
attention-getters, it's a status thing. Very rarely is the best
interest of the animal involved." Seized animals that are now part of
the zoo's collection include mantled howling monkeys, pygmy
marmosets, Amazon parrots, a leopard and a pair of lions named Mario
and Juana, in honor of their discovery during a marijuana bust.

The United States and Europe are some of the biggest markets for
smuggled animals, with enough people who can afford to own something
rare, according to the World Wildlife Fund. China is another big
market because of interest in traditional elixirs such as ground
rhinoceros horn, believed to have aphrodisiac qualities. Although
more than 160 countries have signed on to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species, which is aimed at
safeguarding endangered plants and animals, enforcement is a problem.

The tiger cubs found last week [4th week June 2005] were believed to
have a value of USD 50 000 apiece, but the driver was fined USD 500.

"There is a big demand for wildlife, but there are very small risks
in terms of penalties," Allan said. "Profit margins are actually even
larger than the drug trade." Many countries simply don't have the
resources to enforce the laws. "They're just so poor, everything
slips through the holes," Marshall said. "Everybody's paid off." In
some cases, the animals and drugs come in together. Smugglers have
been known to hide clear pouches of liquid cocaine in fish tanks, or
bags of cocaine in live snakes. "Do I have to open up every one of
the snakes to see if there's cocaine? I usually do," Marshall said.
"But there's people doing this that are scared to death of snakes."

["The United States and Europe are some of the biggest markets for
smuggled animals." Read that and weep. This illegal trade is a threat
to us all. The Northern Hemisphere pandemic of Newcastle disease in
1970-73 was a direct result of a demand for pet parrots, which was
met by parrots being smuggled north out of South America and Africa.
There are repeated scenarios like this all the time. And the animals
that reach their sales points are but a trivial fraction of the many
captured that die en route, quite apart from the adults shot to
capture the youngsters. They come with their infections and internal
and external parasites. The same applies to the illegal tropical fish
industry. - Mod.MHJ]
