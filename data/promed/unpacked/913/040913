An Amherst veterinarian is urging pet owners to always be aware of their animal's surroundings. This after 3 dogs in 5 days came down with a sudden illness having brought about seizures.

"The 1st case involved a dog walking with its owner at the golf club and on the way home in the car began to seize. It was put in a drug-induced coma and just got well enough to go home," Carolyn Hollis said. "It was a long process and it was a close call."

Just as the 1st dog was recovering, someone came in with 2 more dogs experiencing seizures, one was in full seizure and the other was simply tremoring. The veterinarian said staff were able to evacuate the bowels of the dog experiencing tremors.

Upon investigation by one of the owners, it was determined there was something at the golf course making the dogs sick. "One of the owners retraced her steps and found an open plastic lunch container with rotten food in it that someone had disposed there," Hollis said. "It was in the woods away from one of the tees. It was just left there."

The veterinary hospital hasn't determined for sure if the food container is the cause. Hollis said many would not understand the danger presented to animals by leaving open containers of food lying around. In this case, the food was rotten, and the dogs were attracted to it. When they ingested it, they took in some pretty powerful neurotoxins that easily could have killed them.

"Rotting food and things like the mold that comes with it can be extremely toxic to animals," she said. "Composting food is very dangerous."

She estimates it was 30 minutes from the time the dogs ingested the food until they began experiencing seizures. The veterinarian said the dogs were saved by the owners' quick thinking in getting the animals to the veterinary hospital.

In no way is she blaming the golf course since it is private property, and any spraying it would've done would've been completed several months ago, but she is urging those who use the course and public areas around the community to be aware of what they do with items of food after they're finished.

The golf course is sometimes popular with people walking their dogs, at least until deep snow prevents it. With a lack of snow so far this winter, the club has been used by dog owners since their pets can run free and get some exercise.

"There are lots of garbage receptacles at the golf course just as there are around town; please use them," she said. "Owners also need to be aware of where their dogs are at all times and what they may be getting into or eating."

The best advice, she said, is to keep their dog on a leash unless they are absolutely aware of the surroundings.

[While several fungal metabolites may cause this intoxication, current research supports penitrem A as the primary mycotoxin involved. The fungi most commonly associated with penitrem A, _Penicillium_ species, grow on meat, cereals, nuts, cheese, eggs, fruits, processed/refrigerated food, refuse, and compost (https://todaysveterinarypractice.com/practical-toxicologytremorgenic-mycotoxin-intoxication-dogs/).

Roquefortine and penitrem A are tremorgenic mycotoxins associated with decaying organic matter, moldy walnut hulls, and spoiled dairy products. These toxicoses are associated with muscle tremors, salivation, vomiting, and clonic-tonic convulsions. Differential features are the lack of miosis (or lack of constriction of the pupil of the eye) and the general absence of respiratory signs.

A mycotoxin, penitrem A is produced by several _Penicillium_ spp., _Aspergillus_, and _Claviceps_. Ingestion results in severe generalized tremors, opsoclonus [uncontrolled eye movement], and seizures in dogs. Numerous sources associated with the production of mycotoxin include mold contamination of cream cheese, macaroni and cheese, walnuts, bread, rice, and compost. Tremors occur approximately 2 to 3 hours following the ingestion. The severity of the tremors may be related to the amount of mycotoxin ingested. Vomiting often precedes tremors.

Clinical signs typically begin to appear within 30 minutes of toxin ingestion but can be delayed for several hours (rare). Early signs of restlessness, panting, and excessive salivation often progress to include mild to moderate whole-body muscle tremors. In high-dose exposures, the tremors may become severe, and seizure activity is not uncommon. Poisoned patients often display hyperresponsiveness to external stimuli (e.g., touch and noise). Untreated muscle tremors lead to hyperthermia, exhaustion, and dehydration, along with possible metabolic acidosis (mild) and rhabdomyolysis (rare).

In asymptomatic animals, decontamination procedures should include induction of emesis followed by oral administration of activated charcoal and an osmotic cathartic. Symptomatic patients should be sedated or anesthetized, and gastric lavage performed to remove the ingested material. This procedure should be followed by instillation of activated charcoal and a cathartic. Diazepam can be used to control agitation, muscle tremors, or seizure activity. Methocarbamol (either intramuscularly or intravenously) or barbiturates have been used successfully to control tremors and seizures when the patient does not respond to diazepam. A venous port should be established to provide intravenous fluids for the first 24 hours.

The majority of poisoned patients recovers uneventfully following aggressive therapy within 24 to 48 hours; however, with excessive exposures, clinical signs can be prolonged for up to 4 to 5 days (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/penitrem-a).

Be aware of where you are and what your pet is consuming. Dead and spoiled items can contain toxins and bacteria capable of sickening or even killing your pet. These animals were fortunate, as the owners sought rapid treatment for their pets. - Mod.TG
