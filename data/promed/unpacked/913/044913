Texas animal health officials have confirmed 2 more cases of equine infectious anemia (EIA), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on [13 Jul 2018]. "Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials confirmed EIA in one Dallas County standardbred horse and one McLennan County quarter horse," the EDCC said. "The positive horses have been euthanized and the premises will remain under quarantine until requirements for release have been met. TAHC staff is working closely with owners and veterinarians to monitor potentially exposed horses and implement biosecurity measures."

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to a noninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies, and more rarely through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA, and most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Obvious clinical signs of the disease include progressive loss of condition along with muscle weakness and poor stamina. An affected horse also could show fever, depression, and anemia. There is no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed positive for EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards away from other unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.
