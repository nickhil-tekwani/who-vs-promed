On Friday the State announced that 3 horses had tested positive for West
Nile virus (WNV). These are the first confirmed cases of WNV infection in
horses in Connecticut. The horses are from Danbury, Hebron, and Milford. Two
horses have been euthanized and the third is recovering from the illness.
Last year Connecticut had no cases of WNV in horses.

14 Sep 2000
Results of human testing to date are as follows:
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 31 residents have been, or
are in the process of being, tested for the presence of WNV To date, 2
tests were positive, 12
were negative and 17 are pending. These individuals either had symptoms or
signs that met the established WNV testing criteria, or exhibited most of
the
symptoms and are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the
virus have been discovered.
New Jersey's positive human cases include a 43-year old Jersey City man
whose test was verified by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) on 1 Sep 2000. In addition, a 54-year old man with dual
residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside Park, Bergen County, has tested
positive for WNV. The 54-year old man became ill on 31 Aug 2000, was
admitted to a New York City hospital on 4 Sep 2000, and remains hospitalized
in stable, but improving, condition. His WNV test was
conducted by the New York City Health Department and verified by the CDC on
12 Sep 2000.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing: To date, 726 birds (725 crows and a cockatiel)
found in 15 counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive
birds have been found in Bergen (162), Burlington (2), Cape May (1), Essex
(80), Gloucester (1), Hudson (59), Hunterdon (1), Mercer (5), Middlesex
(148), Monmouth (114), Morris (15), Ocean (2), Passaic (52), Somerset (5)
and Union (79) Counties. The tests were conducted at the Department of
Health and Senior Services' lab in Trenton. A total of 1377 crows have been
accepted for testing this year.
Mosquito & House Sparrow Testing: Eight mosquito pools collected in Bergen
(5), Middlesex (2) and Monmouth (1) Counties have tested positive for the
presence of WNV. More than 1580 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have
been collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested
by the Department of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC. In addition
to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from 541 house
sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late July 2000.
No
sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
Sentinel Chicken Testing: Blood samples taken weekly from sentinel chicken
flocks placed in all 21 counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture have all tested negative for the presence of WNV to date.
Horse Testing: Two horses from Atlantic and Cape May Counties have tested
positive for WNV. The tests were conducted by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture's animal health laboratory in Trenton and were confirmed by the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced that three
additional individuals have tested positive for West Nile virus in New York
City: a 77 year-old man from Florida who was staying in Canarsie, Brooklyn,
is hospitalized in stable, and improving condition; a 54 year-old man who is
known to spend time in both Sunset Park, Brooklyn and Cliffside Park, N.J.
is hospitalized in stable, and improving, condition; and a 40 year-old woman
from Castleton Corners, Staten Island, who has been released from the
hospital and is recovering at home.
The laboratory results tests were performed at the New York City Department
of Health's laboratories, & specimens have been sent to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further confirmation. There is now
a total of 11 people who have been diagnosed with West Nile virus in New
York City in 2000.
The Florida resident who was staying in Brooklyn became ill on 27 Aug 2000,
was admitted to the hospital with encephalitis on 3 Sep 2000, and remains
hospitalized in stable, and improving, condition. The man who has been known
to spend time in Sunset Park, Brooklyn and Cliffside Park, N.J. became ill
on 31 Aug 2000, and was admitted to the hospital with encephalitis on 4 Sep
2000. He remains hospitalized in stable, but improving, condition. The
Staten Island woman became ill on 2 Sep 2000, was admitted to the hospital
on 5 Sep 2000 and was released from the hospital on 11 Sep 2000.
Mosquito findings: The positive West Nile virus findings announced today
include 4 mosquito pools from Staten Island: 3 from Grasmere (one pool was
collected on 8 Aug 2000, one pool on 25 Aug 2000, and one pool on 26 Aug
2000), and one pool from Rossville (collected on 25 Aug 2000). All of these
areas were sprayed subsequent to these findings.

The US Department of Agriculture has compiled a complete listing of all West
Nile virus-positive findings covering the period 1 May 2000 to 9 Sep 2000.
The listing is by State, Couty, host, and vector species where known. The
listing includes some information not previously available. For example,
the three additional bats found to be positive for WNV infection in New York
are identified as a big brown bat found in Albany County, and 2 little brown
bats found in Ontario County. [These are legitimate common names for
particular species of bat, not vague descriptors - Mod.JW. [Another three
positive bats are included in the New York State Report of 15 Sep 2000 (2 in
Albany and 1 in Saratoga)
bringing the total to 9, but no (further) details of species are given -

Update: West Nile Virus Activity Northeastern United States, 2000
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Surveillance data reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) indicate
intensified transmission and geographic expansion of the West Nile Virus
(WNV) outbreak in the northeastern United States. Increasing reports of WNV
infections in American crows, other avian species, and mosquitoes are being
accompanied by reports of neurologic disease caused by WNV in humans,
horses, and other mammals. The MMWR report updates human data through 12 Sep
2000 and animal data through 9 Sep 2000.
[clip
Editorial Comment: WNV primarily circulates between birds and mosquitoes and
probably only incidentally infects humans, horses, and other mammals. As a
result, WNV activity in birds and mosquitoes in a specific area generally
precedes WNV infection in humans and horses. In 2000, the WNV surveillance
system documented epizootic WNV infections in birds and mosquitoes as
sentinel events before reports of severe neurologic WNV infection in humans
and prompted immediate implementation of mosquito control. This confirms the
pattern suspected in 1999 when an epizootic among American crows preceded
the outbreak of 62 humans identified with WNV encephalitis and meningitis in
the New York City metropolitan area. Many counties with intense WNV activity
in mosquito and avian populations during the summer of 2000 have not
reported WNV infections in humans or other mammals. This is probably a
result of a combination of intensive mosquito control activities and
variable mosquito feeding behaviors, reservoir host behaviors, human outdoor
activities, and use of protective measures. However, the 12 patients with
severe central nervous system disease caused by WNV probably represent a
small proportion of humans infected with WNV this season. Not all persons
with neurologic WNV infection may have had the condition diagnosed or
reported. Most persons with WNV infection are asymptomatic or have only
nonspecific symptoms for which WNV testing is not performed routinely. A
serosurvey in Queens, New York City, after the 1999 outbreak indicated that
less than 1% of WNV-infected persons developed severe neurologic disease.
Health-care providers in areas with documented epizootic activity should
consider WNV infection in persons with suspected viral meningitis
(especially among adults) or encephalitis (regardless of age). Although
severe WNV central nervous system disease may be more common in the elderly,
eight of the 12 persons in this report were aged less than 65 years. In the
1999 WNV outbreak in the New York City area, the youngest patient was aged 5
years.
WNV and other arboviruses (Eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis
encephalitis, and California serogroup viruses) can cause disease in the
northeastern United States through the end of October and later in more
southern locations. The recent diagnosis of a WNV-infected horse in southern
New Jersey (Cape May County), a major stopover for birds migrating south,
underscores the need for enhanced avian morbidity and mortality surveillance
in areas south of New York City and New Jersey. If ongoing local WNV
epizootic activity is detected, public health measures should be enhanced to
reduce the risk for human infection.
