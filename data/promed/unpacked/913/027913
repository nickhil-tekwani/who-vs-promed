At least 30 people have fallen ill after eating at a restaurant in Finland during the end of January 2021.

An investigation by public health officials in the town of Kokkola, also known as Karleby, found salmonellosis was behind the illnesses. The 1st infection was recorded on 27 Jan 2021, and no patients have been reported since 29 Jan 2021. The most common symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain.

Sigrid's restaurant carried out cleaning and extensive disinfection after the suspicion of an outbreak was raised. Operations at the eatery are continuing as normal. Initially, no _Salmonella_ was found in food and surface samples. Additional samples were taken in the restaurant, from staff and of the food. Preliminary results show the suspected source of infection is a frozen product for use in commercial kitchens. Findings will be confirmed later in February 2021 after further investigations are completed. Sales of the implicated product have been suspended in the country, according to officials.

Two other, different _Salmonella_ outbreaks were reported in Finland in December 2020. The 1st outbreak in the city of Rovaniemi affected 20 people, but a source was not found. The 2nd incident in the city of Mikkeli led to 8 illnesses and was caused by contaminated chopped zucchini from Spain that was used in salad.

Typing was done at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), and the incidents were also reported to the Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto). In 2019, 200 salmonellosis cases were reported to THL in which the infection was acquired in Finland.

Food contaminated with _Salmonella_ bacteria does not usually look, smell, or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection. Infants, children, seniors, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC.
