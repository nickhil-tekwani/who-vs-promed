_Groundnut ringspot virus_: an Emerging _Tospovirus_ Inducing Disease
in Peanut Crops
-----------------------------------------------
Diseases induced by tospoviruses cause great losses in agriculture
worldwide. In Argentina, _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV),
_Groundnut ringspot virus_ (GRSV) and _Tomato chlorotic spot virus_
(TCSV) have been identified by molecular techniques as pathogens of
various crops. Moreover, these viruses have been reported infecting
some vegetables and ornamental plants. The occurrence of GRSV in
peanut has only been reported in South Africa.

Peanut is a legume crop grown extensively in tropical and subtropical
areas. In Argentina, 96 percent of peanut production is concentrated
in Cordoba province. Plants showing symptoms typical of those caused
by tospoviruses were observed, including stunting, smaller and
distorted leaves showing severe chlorosis and concentric ringspots,
which were initially thought to be caused by TSWV.

Peanut plants were collected and tested to identify the causal agent.
_Tospovirus_-like particles were observed by electron microscopy, and
GRSV was identified by double antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). Partial nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) gene indicated a high degree of
identity with other GRSV sequences. Thus, the virus was found to be
an isolate of GRSV, named GRSV-AR. This is the 1st report of GRSV
occurrence on peanuts in Argentina.

GRSV is efficiently transmitted by the thrips species _Frankliniella
schultzei_ and _F. occidentalis_ and by _F. gemina_ under
experimental conditions. However, in spite of the importance of the
vector-virus relationship for understanding how virus spread occurs,
in Argentina there is a lack of information concerning the presence
and transmission efficiency of thrips vectors in peanut crops. The
potential damage by tospoviruses underscores the need for
epidemiological studies to understand how the virus spreads in peanut
crops. Because of the worldwide distribution and emergence of
tospoviruses, the identification of GRSV in the peanut-producing area
of Argentina is important for future work in peanut-breeding programs.

[_Groundnut ringspot tospovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_, was 1st
reported on peanuts during a survey of the viruses of this crop in
South Africa in 1966. Thus far, this virus has been detected on
peanuts and soybean in South Africa, where it is relatively common,
and on tomatoes (and possibly solanaceous weeds) in Brazil and
Argentina. It spreads in Argentina, Brazil and South Africa causing
high economic losses. Apparently, this is not only the 1st report of
GRSV on peanuts in Argentina but on peanuts anywhere outside South Africa.

Tospoviruses are an extremely important group of plant viruses
capable of infecting a large range of important crops. The type
member, _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV), has one of the broadest
host ranges among plant viruses and has had a serious impact on many
crop species worldwide.

Tospoviruses are transmitted exclusively by thrips, which are found
worldwide. Transmission occurs in a circulative propagative manner,
meaning that the virus multiplies in the vector. Nymphs must emerge
on an infected host plant to be able to acquire the virus, which is
then spread by the adult insects. Thus, tospovirus epidemiology is
complex. GRSV and TSWV could also be transmitted experimentally to
_Arabidopsis thaliana_ (a weed species used frequently in virus
research) by mechanical inoculation.

Research on this important virus group has increased dramatically,
and many new tospoviruses are being found. They often originate in
developing countries, and some appear to occur only in these
countries. The lack of resources in these regions may hamper the
discovery of even more new tospoviruses.
