[Ref: E Chiunga, JPT Valkonen: First Report of Five Viruses Infecting Potatoes in Tanzania. Plant Disease (2013) 97, 1260; DOI:10.1094/PDIS-02-13-0143-PDN]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is an increasingly important crop in Tanzania. Potato production is concentrated in the southern highlands and mainly carried out by smallholder farmers. A certification system for seed potatoes does not exist in the country.

In 2011, occurrence of the most common, globally distributed potato viruses, _Potato leaf roll virus_ (PLRV), _Potato virus A_ (PVA), _Potato virus M_ (PVM), _Potato virus S_ (PVS), _Potato virus Y_ (PVY), and _Potato virus X_ (PVX), was determined in 219 potato plants in 16 fields. Potato crops, 1 to 3 months old, consisted sometimes of mixtures of varieties and were located in the regions of Mbeya and Rungwe [southwest Tanzania]. Virus-like symptoms observed in most fields included yellowish-green mosaic, leaf rolling, and veinal necrosis. Symptoms in tubers were not studied.

10 symptomatic and 3 symptomless plants were sampled from each field and tested by (DAS)-ELISA. PVS and PLRV were detected in 55 percent and 39 percent of the samples, respectively, and in all fields sampled. PVX and PVM were found in most fields and in 14 percent and 5 percent of the samples, respectively. PVA and PVY were only detected in 2 localities. Co-infection with PVS and PLRV was detected in 14 percent of the tested plants. Mixed infections involving 3 or 4 viruses were detected in 5 percent of the plants.

A total of 20 samples ELISA-positive for one or several viruses, were analyzed by RT-PCR and all tested positive. 4 and 5 samples ELISA-negative for PVX or PVA, respectively, were positive when tested by RT-PCR, suggesting that the actual incidence of these viruses may be higher than detected by DAS-ELISA.

The PCR products from 3 to 5 samples per virus were sequenced and revealed few if any differences among isolates. Sequences were compared with viruses from other countries, and similarities suggested that viruses might have been introduced to Tanzania through trade or with new cultivars without adequate indexing.

These results suggest the need for the development of virus control schemes in potato crops, including the nascent, domestic certified seed potato production in Mbeya.

[Around 40 viruses have been reported to affect potato worldwide. A number of them can be spread by aphids, but since the crop is vegetatively propagated, many of them are also disseminated in tubers. Some viruses may only have a minor effect on yield if they are the only infecting virus species. However, if virus-infected seed tubers are used, the virus population will gradually build up during every crop cycle, both in number of co-infecting (possibly synergistic) virus species and in amounts of infectious units per species. This invariably leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield.

Disease management of potato viruses (and viroids) relies largely on clean planting material, but reduction of available virus reservoirs and vector numbers may also be useful. Control of viruses and reduction of high virus levels in regional crops may be extremely difficult since insect vectors and solanaceous pathogen reservoir hosts are often widespread. The important role that tubers play in virus and viroid spread is recognised by the strict requirements for certified seed potato production in many countries worldwide. It is vital for national potato industries to establish seed tuber certification and quarantine indexing.

Pathogen surveys like the one reported above are important tools. They provide valuable information for managing national agriculture systems to increase food security, as well as for national and international biosecurity.
