-------------------------------------------------------
Pan American Veterinary Labs has been utilizing an ELISA1 as an aid
in diagnosing _Pythium_ infection in equines, canines, and felines
since 1995. Following is incidence data we have accumulated.

1995-2003: 158 cases (all species)
2004: 72 cases (all species)
2005 (Jan-Aug): 102 cases (all species)
2010: 752 cases (all species)

We think the increased number of cases is due to increased awareness
in the veterinary community and availability of diagnostic services.

in awareness leading to the diagnosis of an increasing number of
cases. - Mod.TG/JW]
