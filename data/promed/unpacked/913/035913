[Classical swine fever (CSF) is a viral disease with severe economic consequences for the swine industry. Except for Australia, North America, and Europe, the infection is endemic in most other parts of the world with swine farms. The Eurasian wild boar (_Sus scrofa_) is equally susceptible to infection with CSF virus as domestic pigs, and the course of the disease is comparable in both. In areas with domestic pigs and wild boar, the infection is frequently transmitted from domestic pigs to wild boar and vice versa. CSF virus has no known reservoir or animal vector other than swine. - Mod.PMB
