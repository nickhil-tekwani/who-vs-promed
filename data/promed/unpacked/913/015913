Kanjarai leaf spot in banana is caused by a fungus, _Mycosphaerella musicola_. Occurrence of the disease is severe in Tiruchi [Tiruchirappalli], Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari, Tuticorin [Thoothukudi], Erode, Coimbatore, Theni, and Dindigul districts of Tamil Nadu.

Fields without proper drainage are severely affected. Closer spacing, heavy weed, or grass cover, frequent irrigation, and failure to remove suckers increase the relative humidity in the plantation, favouring rapid buildup of the disease.

Affected leaves should be removed immediately and destroyed. This helps in reducing the population of the fungus. Depending on the severity of the disease, 3 to 4 sprays with fungicides at 20 days interval may be done. Spraying on the lower surface of the leaves is effective for control.

[Yellow sigatoka (YS; sigatoka leaf spot) is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella musicola_. The related _M. fijiensis_ (black sigatoka, BS; black leaf streak) as well as a number of fungal pathogens in other genera cause similar leaf spot symptoms on banana in various
regions of the world. YS occurs in most banana growing areas and was first reported from Java in 1902, long before BS appeared in Fiji in 1963. In areas where more than one leaf spot pathogen is present, it is often difficult to distinguish between them under field conditions,
and laboratory analysis may be needed for a clear diagnosis.

Symptoms and epidemiology are similar for YS and BS. YS symptoms appear mainly on older leaves and, therefore, less damage is caused to photosynthetic tissue than by BS. There are more cultivars of banana and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS. YS is more adapted to cooler temperatures and is often dominant at higher altitudes. The pathogens are spread by water, wind and with plant material, including suckers, and can cause yield losses of up to 50 percent. Fruit produced on diseased plants can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment causing further losses. Disease management includes frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary measures and cultural practices (as mentioned above).
