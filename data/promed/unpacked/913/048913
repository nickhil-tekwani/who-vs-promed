The tally of people who got sick after eating food from Hinerwadel's
Grove in Clay [Onondaga County] earlier in September 2008 rose to 236
Monday [23 Sep 2008], but public health officials say the outbreak is
leveling off. "The numbers have really slowed down and I do not
expect this to significantly increase," said Dr Cynthia Morrow,
Onondaga County's health commissioner. She said 3 of the people who
got sick were hospitalized, but they have recovered and been discharged.

Lab tests have identified a germ, _Campylobacter_, which could be a
major cause of the outbreak. Evidence of that bacterium was found in
6 of 7 stool samples collected from people who got sick. The germ is
one of the most common causes of diarrhea, affecting more than 2.4
million Americans every year, according to the CDC (US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention).

The bacterium is most commonly found in poultry, but 10 to 15 percent
of clams and oysters can be contaminated with it. People usually
become infected by eating undercooked chicken, beef, or seafood.

Public health officials suspect raw mahogany clams caused the
outbreak of gastrointestinal illness among Hinerwadel's patrons
because the vast majority of people who got sick said they ate them.
That link, however, has not been proven because results of lab tests
on the clams, being conducted in Albany and Long Island, will not be
available until later this week, Morrow said. Other bacteria also may
be involved in the outbreak, she said.

Hinerwadel's stopped serving mahogany clams after the outbreak
investigation began and switched to little neck clams. Hinerwadel's
purchased the mahogany clams from a supplier in Maine who is being
investigated by the state Health Department and Department of
Environmental Conservation.

The Health Department has not found any evidence of wrongdoing at
Hinerwadel's, Morrow said. The department has interviewed more than
550 people who were exposed to the outbreak. She advised anyone who
ate at Hinerwadel's and became ill between 4 to 16 Sep 2008 to call
the Health Department. Morrow also advised people not to eat raw
clams because doing so increases the risk of getting sick.

[As reviewed (1), raw bivalve mollusc ingestion has long been
recognized to be a source of outbreaks of bacterial and viral enteric
diseases. Typical pathogens involved are the typhoid fever bacillus,
hepatitis A virus, Norwalk virus, and both _cholera_ and
_parahaemolyticus_ species of _Vibrio_. The risk of contamination of
shellfish in coastal waters is increased after periods of heavy rain
and flooding and is especially high if shellfish are harvested from
uncertified, sewage-contaminated waters. Since steaming or other
forms of cooking do not always kill enteric viruses in clams (2), CDC
recommends that the most effective means of preventing
clam-associated illness is to adequately depurate them (1).
Depuration involves cleansing the molluscs by holding them in a tank
of recirculating clean seawater for at least 42 hours.
Campylobacteriosis as well as shigellosis are rarely associated with
eating raw clams or oysters. One cluster of cases with
campylobacteriosis associated with raw clams was reported in the USA
in 1983 (3).
