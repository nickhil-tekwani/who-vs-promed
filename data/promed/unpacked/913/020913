Ten people may have contracted the [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease CJD as a
result of a serious breach of infection control at a Melbourne hospital,
the Victorian parliament was told today. Health Minister John Thwaites said
the breach involved a neurosurgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital [RMH who
treated a patient with dementia who may have CJD.
"I understand that equipment used on the patient was incorrectly allowed to
be reused in a clear breach of an established protocol," he said. The
equipment was possibly re-used on 10 other patients. "The protocol that is
for any brain biopsy where there is a risk of CJD, equipment should not be
reused until a CJD diagnosis is excluded." The equipment was sterilised but
the risk of CJD not eliminated by normal cleaning and sterilisation.
"I am advised by the RMH that while the risk to these patients is very low,
there is no test to determine whether a patient has caught CJD," Mr.
Thwaites said.
The hospital would launch an inquiry into the breach, he said.

Doctors yesterday defended a Melbourne hospital's decision to tell nine
patients they may have been exposed to a deadly condition, linked to mad
cow disease, saying the people had a right to know.
The Royal Melbourne Hospital made the decision despite a warning from a
Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) disease expert that the information could cause
serious distress among some people, leading to suicide attempts. Colin
Masters, director of the National CJD Registry, advised the Royal Melbourne
Hospital against informing 10 patients of the remote risk of infection,
fearing it would cause unnecessary alarm. However, AMA [Australian Medical
Association Victorian President Michael Sedgley yesterday disagreed,
saying he could see no reason for keeping the information secret. "I think
you can't keep things like this from people. The thing is to alleviate
their distress over time," Dr. Sedgley said.
Ten patients were potentially exposed to the incurable disease between 20
April 2000 and 28 April 2000 after inadequately sterilised equipment was
used during neurosurgery. The equipment was used earlier on a dementia
patient, who had since been diagnosed as possibly suffering from CJD. One
of the 10 patients potentially exposed to CJD has since died of an
unrelated condition.
The other nine patients face a wait of up to 30 years to find out whether
they have contracted CJD because there is no accurate test for the disease
prior to symptoms surfacing.
Professor Masters said yesterday that while he accepted the hospital's
decision, he had recommended against notifying patients because of the
small risk of infection, lack of definitive tests and effective treatments.
The likelihood of the nine patients developing CJD has been put at one in 1
million.
Professor Masters said the danger was that not all patients would
comprehend how remote the chances were of developing the disease, even with
extensive explanations and counselling. "There can be one person who does
not understand and becomes very distressed, and we have had people who have
committed suicide," he said.
A hospital spokeswoman said the issue of telling the patients of their
potential exposure to the disease was a "difficult ethical question". Each
year in Australia there are about 20 cases of CJD recorded. Victorian
Health Minister John Thwaites said yesterday the patients and the public
had a right to know about such breaches of infection control procedures.
"It was inevitable the information would have become public at some stage,"
Mr. Thwaites said. "If patients, staff and the public had heard of the
infection control breakdown by other means, they would have been extremely
concerned. It would have also led to a potential panic or fear among other
patients at the hospital."

[This may be a tempest in a teapot, given that no definitive diagnosis of
CJD has been made on the "index case". What is really instructive
(fascinating to me) is the contrast between the way the similar situation
in England was handled. The same reasons for withholding information
(potential for suicide among those warned, need-to-know basis for informing
patients who may have been exposed) were discussed and advice given to
withhold information from the patients. However, the President of the AMA
held sway and the patients have been informed; the ethical approach taken.
