Stepping back a bit from details of the virus and other related viruses to
possible means of exposure...
Being an avid backpacker, bushwacker and orienteer myself in the States, I
wonder if anyone has looked at the backwoods shelters/cabins these men (and
others) might have stayed in, especially on a following year around the
time of their exposure (rodents like to be warm and dry just like the rest
of us).
Also, it is common practice here in the States to drink water, albeit
filtered (using a backpacking pump/filter meant for that purpose), from
wild sources. Many viral contaminants are frequently too small to be
filtered by these units (especially if one removes or does not have one
that purports to be a "viral guard", which is prone to clogging by any
larger particulates).

[I do not know the details of the study in Sweden but I can assure our
readers that the people involved are as good a group of scientists as one
can find, so I have complete confidence that they have looked at as many
eventualities as possible, including the obvious ones.
As for drinking water with particulates in it: I try to avoid that. Here
in the Rocky Mountains we do not worry so much about viruses emanating from
mountain springs but worry more about _Giardia_ and things that might grow
nicely in an elk carcass floating in a lake. When I backpack with my wife,
I carry the fishing gear and she the 6-pack of Coke and the Gray Poupon. -
