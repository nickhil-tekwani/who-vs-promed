Record Number of Malaria cases in Namibia
------------------------------------------
Malaria in Namibia has killed a record 608 people in the first 6 months
of this year, while 177 613 cases were reported.
Health Minister Libertina Amathila told the cabinet the deaths this year
represented a significant increase -- around 70% compared to last year,
while reported cases had shown a 32% increase. Amathila informed
cabinet that investigations revealed that the malaria crisis was caused by
inadequate funding, poor vector control measures and poor epidemic
preparedness and response.
Cabinet approved the allocation of additional financial resources for
malaria control programmes in the Caprivi, Omaheke, Otjozondjupa,
Kunene, Oshikoto, Oshana, Omusati and Ohangwena regions in
preparation for the malaria spraying season. The spraying of houses is
expected to start in the middle of this month.

[The report indicates that there is both a problem with treatment failure,
which could be due to resistance against chloroquine, and an increase
in transmission. Chloroquine resistance is a problem in southern
Africa, and although it is not mentioned in the report, treatment was
presunably with chloroquine. HIV may increase the severity of malaria
and it remains a possibility that a high rate of HIV positivity may
contribute to the situation. - Mod.MPP, EP
