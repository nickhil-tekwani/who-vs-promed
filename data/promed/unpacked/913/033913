KZN upset about horse sickness
------------------------------
KwaZulu-Natal horse owners have slammed agricultural and veterinary
authorities for failing to react to an outbreak of African horse sickness
[AHS] which has killed over 1000 horses in northern KZN alone, despite
being aware of the virus for more than 3 months. They say that tragedy and
huge financial losses could have been avoided if State authorities had
reacted in good time.
The provincial agricultural department issued a horse travel ban on
Thursday [21 Apr 2005] after media reports about the severity of the
illness earlier this week. Experts responded by saying the virus is not
contagious and that as such the ban is ineffective.
Horses are currently banned from entering the "free zone" around Kenilworth
race course in the Western Cape until completion of the 3-week quarantine
period in the protection zone.
The virus was first picked up on Midlands equestrian Charlotte Houston's
horse farm outside Midmar in mid-January 2005 when 4 horses died. 6 weeks
ago, a polo horse from Brad McGivven's farm near Otto's Bluff raised
national, but not provincial, awareness when it died after travelling to
Plettenberg Bay. Veterinarian Brian Baker sent tissue and blood samples to
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute in Tshwane, which revealed that the
virus was the particularly virulent number 5 strain.
Although the state vet urged horse owners not to move their horses in or
out of KZN, The Witness is aware of at least 6 truckloads of horses
travelling to Gauteng for the annual Yearling sales. About 80 horses have
shown signs of having the virus in the Hilton, Merrivale and Karkloof area,
with a 75 per cent mortality rate, according to Spurwing Horse Feeds's
Gilly Arathoon.
"We need a vaccination which works," said Natal Equine Physiotherapy
centre's Sally Hurst on Thursday.
Gold Circle Racing CEO Michel Nairac was optimistic at the beginning of the
week that their vaccinations did work and that the epidemic held no
implications for his horses. On Thursday, though, he had changed his
opinion. "If there is a new strain of virus then we are extremely
concerned," he said, adding that so far stabling horses at night, when the
midges are most active, had proved effective in preventing an outbreak.

Scientists are trying to find out why more than 50 vaccinated horses in the
KwaZulu-Natal Midlands were struck by horse sickness within weeks. On
Wednesday even the state vet's office in Pietermaritzburg did not know why
the expensive vaccine did not work.
Some vets point out that the only conclusion they can come to without
having seen the outcome of blood tests is that a new strain of the midge
virus attacked the horses. But another vet with many years' experience said
that it could be an old strain, which the vaccine did not neutralise.
Vets said that the serum [sic; should read vaccine] needed for the
vaccination comes in 2 bottles. "In one bottle are 5 strains of the virus
and in the other 6 strains. This means that there are at least 11 strains
which should be covered by the vaccination," said the vet.[This statement
is questionable; 9 antigenically distinct serotypes of AHSV are known to
have been identified so far in South Africa. For the vaccine composition,
see commentary. - Mod.AS]
The acting state vet in Pietermaritzburg, Dr Bonnie Byebwa, said he
understood that over the last few weeks 50 cases of horse sickness were
reported to his office. He said that private vets have sent blood samples
from horses to Onderstepoort Laboratories near Pretoria for testing. "I
have no idea what agent this virus has that has struck the horses," said
Byebwa.

[A recent commentary (20050411.1044) from the Reference laboratory in
Onderstepoort indicated that AHS serotypes 5, 7 and 2 have been identified
during the current year from affected regions; AHS is endemic in South
Africa's subtropical north, the virus moving a variable distance down to
the temperate south each season. The distance moved depends on climatic
factors favoring the vector and the immune status of the population.
Reportedly, the laboratory has recovered isolates from 6 of the 9 provinces
in South Africa.
The following text appears on the package inserts, accompanying the
attenuated AHS Onderstepoort vaccine: "Freeze-dried, polyvalent, live
attenuated horsesickness virus strains for the prophylactic immunisation of
horses, mules and donkeys against horsesickness. The vaccine is presented
as 2 separate injections with different horsesickness virus types. First
administer combination I and at least 3 weeks later combination II. Store
the vaccine in a refrigerator at a temperature of 4 to 8 C. Do not use the
vaccine after the expiry date printed on the bottle.
Recommendations for use
-----------------------
Foals born of unvaccinated dams can be inoculated at any age, but foals of
immune dams should not be vaccinated until they are at least 6 to 7 months
old. Animals should preferably be immunised during early summer.
Immunisation of mares should be avoided during the first 3 months of
pregnancy. Annual immunisation is recommended.
It takes up to 2-3 vaccinations for horses to become immune to all the
serotypes in the vaccine. It is therefore important to combine vaccination
with the control of the _Culicoides_ midges which transmit the disease.
Horses can be protected from midge bites by stabling them from dusk to
dawn, using insect repellents and keeping animals away from low-lying vlei
areas or other surface water during the day". (see
http://bigfive.jl.co.za/pdf_files/p2063.pdf>.).
According to OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial
Animals (updated 23 Jul 2004), the attenuated Onderstepoort vaccine is
composed of 2 quadrivalent vaccines, constituted by mixing equal volumes of
serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5 and 2, 6, 7, 8 respectively. It further states that
AHSV serotype 5 was withdrawn from this vaccine.
Regarding the immunity rendered by the vaccine, the Manual states:
"Immunity is known to persist for at least 4 years. However, in the light
of possible interference between the individual serotypes in each
quadrivalent vaccine, annual revaccination is advocated in enzootic
regions. Vaccination with monovalent vaccine stimulates a practically
lifelong immunity".
An update of the current composition of the commercially available AHS
vaccine(s) would help. - Mod.AS]
