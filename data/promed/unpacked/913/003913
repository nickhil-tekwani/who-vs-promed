On 29 Jun 2011, the Wyoming Department of Health was notified of 2
laboratory-confirmed cases of _Campylobacter jejuni_ enteritis among
persons working at a local sheep ranch. During June 2011, 2 men had
reported onset of symptoms compatible with campylobacteriosis. Both
patients had diarrhea, and one also had abdominal cramps, fever,
nausea, and vomiting. One patient was hospitalized for 1 day. Both
patients recovered without sequelae. During that month, both patients
had participated in a multiday event to castrate and dock tails of
1600 lambs. Both men reported having used their teeth to castrate some
of the lambs. Among the 12 persons who participated in the event, the
patients are the only 2 known to have used their teeth to castrate
lambs. During the multiday event, a few lambs reportedly had a mild
diarrheal illness. Neither patient with laboratory-confirmed illness
reported consumption of poultry or unpasteurized dairy products, which
are common sources of exposure to _C. jejuni_ (1). The patients
resided in separate houses and did not share food or water; none of
their contacts became ill.

Both patients provided stool specimens for laboratory testing; _C.
jejuni_ was isolated from each. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) patterns of the isolates were indistinguishable when restricted
separately by 2 enzymes, SmaI and KpnI. This PFGE pattern had never
been reported among 667 specimens from which _C. jejuni_ was isolated
in Wyoming and is rare in CDC's PulseNet database, with a frequency of
0.09 per cent (8 of 8817). The low frequency of this PFGE pattern
suggests that both patients were infected from a common source.

Animals at the ranch included sheep, cattle, horses, cats, and dogs;
none were ill during the site visit on 19 Oct 2011 when investigators
obtained fecal samples from 5 lambs. _C. jejuni_ was isolated from 2
lambs; one isolate had a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from the human
isolates. _C. jejuni_ is transmitted via the fecal-oral route; this is
the first reported association of _C. jejuni_ infection with exposure
during castration of lambs (2). The PFGE pattern identified in these
cases had not been associated with animal exposure. Ranch owners and
employees were advised to use standardized, age-specific techniques
for lamb castration (for example, Burdizzo, rubber rings, or surgery)
and to wash their hands thoroughly after contact with animals (3).

[Although only 2 cases occurred, the method of exposure (one unknown
to this city born and raised moderator) is noteworthy. - Mod.LL

Between 10 and 15 per cent of human bites are estimated to become
infected. I wonder what happened to the lambs. A HealthMap interactive
