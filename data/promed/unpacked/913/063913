A Comment on the Stated Reasons for the Supply Crisis
-----------------------------------------------------
Henry Wilde wrote in the previous post (Rabies immune globulins, equine,
supply crisis 20010416.0755) that: "We have just been informed that the
last of the 3 large international firms making purified and pepsin-digested
equine rabies immune globulins has ceased production and none will be
available after a few more months. The reasons give for this are: actions
by animal rights activists who demonstrated against horse farms used for
plasma donations, [increased costs, and complex new regulatory rules".
This is the second time in about 5 months that I have heard via second-hand
sources that "animal rights activists...demonstrated against horse farms
used for plasma donations," but I have been covering the animal rights
movement for various news media for more than 25 years, and have been
covering animal protection full-time since 1988, without ever once hearing
of any protest against the use of horses for plasma donations.
