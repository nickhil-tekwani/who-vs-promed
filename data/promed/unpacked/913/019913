Two samples from wild ducks around the area of Kamerik, Woerden [Utrecht province], in the Netherlands, have tested positive for a highly pathogenic H5 strain of avian influenza, Rijksoverheid.nl [Dutch government's website] confirmed in a statement last night (1 Dec 2014) [see comment].

[According to the official notification cited above, the sampling in Kamerik (Utrecht province, central Netherlands) is part of the investigation into the possible role of wild birds in the spread of bird flu in the Netherlands.

In addition: an analysis by the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) led to the conclusion that the 3 HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in Hekendorp, Ter Aar, and Kamperveen occurred independently. This was informed to the parliament in a letter from Sharon Dijksma, State Secretary of Economic Affairs. Such a finding underlines the role of wild birds as a source of infection.

The letter from the State Secretary and the press release above are available (in Dutch) at http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/nieuws/2014/12/01/vogelgriep-aangetroffen-bij-wilde-eenden.html. The revised control measures, addressed in the letter, are presented in item [3] below. - Mod.AS]

Excrement from 2 wigeons, a variety of wild duck, was tested for the virus at the Netherlands ecology institute and found to have the highly-infectious H5 variant of avian flu.

It is not yet known if it is the same N type as the virus found in the 5 outbreaks recorded in the Netherlands over the past 2 weeks, Trouw reports.

"We now know that these wigeons carry the avian flu virus, but there could also be other kinds of migratory birds which are infected," virologist Ron Fouchier told broadcaster Nos.

It is not clear how the virus was transferred to chickens kept in sheds but Fouchier says it is possible that wigeon droppings were carried from fields into the sheds on the shoes of farmers.

The most recent outbreak in the Netherlands was discovered on [Sun 30 Nov 2014] at a chicken farm in Zoeterwoude [South Holland province].

Researcher Henk van der Jeugd told Nos radio that the intensive poultry sector will remain vulnerable to bird flu.

"We need to think about how we will deal with it in the future because it will keep coming back," he said. Meanwhile, poultry sector organisation Nepluvi said on [Tue 2 Dec 2014] that now it appears wild duck are to blame for spreading the disease, the government needs to change its approach.

In particular, the rules on moving poultry and eggs should be relaxed in areas without large expanses of water where wild ducks congregate, the organisation said.

Sector representatives are due to discuss the economic impact of the recent bird flu outbreak with government officials later on [Tue 2 Dec 2014].

[Sharon] Dijksma, State Secretary for Economic Affairs, addressed today (2 Dec 2014) ) in a letter to the parliament, an adapted package of measures to combat avian influenza in the Netherlands. The new measures go into force Thu 4 Dec 2014 at 00:00 am.

Dijksma: "We are doing everything possible to combat the spread of bird flu in the Netherlands. In addition, I rely increasingly on the latest data and expert opinions. For the industry, this means that a number of drastic measures remain in force, but where possible these are customized."

Introduction of bird flu research
The recent discovery of the highly pathogenic avian flu virus in 2 wigeons is an indication that avian flu has entered the Netherlands by means of these wild ducks. Furthermore, experts conclude that in all regions there are sporadic infections with the virus.

Measures
The measures in the 10-km [6 mi] zone around the infected farms remain in force. Also in the west of the Netherlands (region A), where most infections have been found, all restrictive measures such as a total ban on movements of poultry, eggs, poultry manure, and used bedding are to be maintained. The prohibition of hunting is maintained as well.

Focus on hygiene
In other regions, repopulation of culled farms is permitted and the hunting ban lifted. The 'collecting ban' will be maintained [banning the transport of poultry to and the holding of concentrations of animals such as in markets, auctions, exhibitions, etc., [as well as visitors schemes.] Transporting vehicles will be allowed, during the coming period, to visit only one poultry farm/plant per voyage, followed by cleaning and disinfection of the vehicle. To prevent the introduction of avian influenza into poultry houses, drastic hygiene measures should be applied. To facilitate this, discussions about the arrangements will be held with the sector.

No bird flu virus has been detected on the farms within the 10-km [6 mi] zone around the infected holding in Zoeterwoude.

[There are 16 hemagglutinin (H1-16) and 9 neuraminidase (N1-9) subtypes of influenza A virus. The diagnostic techniques applicable for their identification in collected samples as well as other, extensive information on avian influenza diagnosis and vaccines is available in OIE's terrestrial manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf.

Results of the laboratory tests of the samples collected from widgeons' droppings from Kamerik, identifying the N type, are requested. - Mod.AS
