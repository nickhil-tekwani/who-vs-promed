Germany warns of dangerous pesticides in Turkish pears
------------------------------------------------------
The agriculture ministry in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg
warned on Monday [19 Oct 2009] against eating Turkish pears, after
tracing dangerously high levels of insecticide. The problem affected
Turkish pears across Germany, the Stuttgart-based ministry said,
adding that they had passed on the alert to a Europe-wide warning system.

The agriculture ministry carried out tests on 8 samples, which all
revealed more than the permitted 0.01 milligrammes per kilogramme
(0.01 ppm) of the forbidden pesticide Amitraz. The highest
concentration was a record 15.7 milligrammes per kilo(15.7 ppm).

Excessive consumption of Amitraz could damage the health of young
children, leading to a risk of speech impediments, tiredness or low
blood pressure.

Food monitoring officials removed the pears from shops in
Baden-Wuerttemberg and destroyed them. Amitraz has been banned in
Germany for several years and was outlawed by the EU in 2008.

[Amitraz is most often an insecticide and an acarcide. It is a member
of the amadine class of insecticides with its mechanism of action
similar to that of other alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist including an
inhibition of monoamineoxidase. Consequently sedation, and analgesic
effects as well as cardiovascular depression are most prominent.

The chemical is only slightly toxic and it would take a large dose,
even at these levels to be dangerous. Nevertheless, it should not be
in food. - Mod.TG]
