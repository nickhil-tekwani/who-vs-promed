1st Report of Peach latent mosaic viroid and Hop stunt viroid
Infecting Peach Trees in the Czech Republic.
M. Hassan and P. Rysanek, Department of Plant Protection, Czech
University of Agriculture, Prague, Czech Republic; and F. Di Serio,
Institute of Plant Virology, CNR, Bari, Italy. This work was
supported from the grant QC1359 of the Ministry of Agriculture of the
Czech Republic. Plant Dis. 87:1537, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-1002-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 12 Sep 2003.
Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) and Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) are
known to naturally infect stone fruits, but their contemporary
presence in peach trees has been reported only recently (3).
During a field validation of detection methods developed for sanitary
screening of propagation material, PLMVd and HSVd, alone or in mixed
infections, were detected in peach trees grown in the trial orchard
of the Czech University of Agriculture in Prague.
Leaf samples were collected in September 2002 from symptomless trees
of peach cultivars imported from the United States (cvs. Sunhaven,
Redhaven, Fairhaven, Cresthaven, Dixired, Halehaven, and NJC 103),
Slovakia (cv. Luna), and a tree of Chinese wild peach, _Prunus
davidiana_, and analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR).
PLMVd cDNA was amplified as previously reported (2) or by using 2
sets of primer pairs designed to amplify partial cDNAs, one reverse
primer R: GTTACTACGGCGGTACCTGA, complementary to the nucleotide
positions 204 to 223 and forward primers F1:CGTATCTCAACGCCTCATCA,
homologous to the positions 109 to 128, and F2: CTGCAGTTCCCGCTAGAAAG,
homologous to the positions 15 to 34 of PLMVd reference sequence (2).
The 2 pairs using the R sequence produced the expected size PCR
products of 115 and 209 bp, respectively. RT-PCR for HSVd detection
was performed as reported (1). The same total RNA preparations were
also analyzed by molecular hybridization with nonisotopic riboprobes
specific for each viroid. With minor exceptions, both methods gave
similar results.
Of 66 tested trees, 5 were infected with PLMVd, 46 were infected with
PLMVd and HSVd, and 15 were free of both viroids. Viroid free plants
included cvs. Luna, Cresthaven, Dixired, and Halehaven and the
species _P. davidiana_. The high number of infections by both viroids
was unexpected because mixed infections are generally rare (3). Most
likely, mixed infections occurred during field manipulations and
propagation of infected materials.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of PLMVd in the Czech
Republic. Although further investigations are needed to ascertain the
spread of stone fruit viroids in the Czech Republic, our results also
report an unusually high incidence of mixed infections of peach trees
in this country. These results stress the need for a certification
program to help control the spread of stone fruit viroids in the
Czech Republic.

[Viroids are extremely infectious pathogens. These circular,
single-stranded covalent circles share extensive intramolecular base
pairing, which confers resistance to nucleases in plant tissues.
PLMVd is transmitted by grafting and by aphids (_Myzus persicae_) but
not by mites or pollen. HSVd causes a severe disease in hop (_Humulus
lupulus_), and strains of the viroid have been recognized in
cucumber, grapevine, citron, peach, and plum. Both viroids are also
easily transmitted by grafting or by use of contaminated pruning
tools, but evidence of their transmission by vectors is apparently
lacking for HSVd. Viroid disease management depends upon sanitation;
plant viroid-free trees, sterilize shears after pruning each tree,
and eradicate infected trees.
