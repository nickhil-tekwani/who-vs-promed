Tests have failed to uncover the mysterious deaths of 22 swans in
Southport's Marine Lake. [Map:

Scientists from the RSPCA and Environment Agency said they still had
no idea why 37 birds had been struck down in less than 3 weeks.
Initial fears were that the swans had died from feeding off disturbed
sediment at the bottom of the lake while it was being dredged by
Sefton Council. Post-mortems showed no trace of poisoning and experts
now believe the birds have been passing a disease between them.
Heather Holmes of the RSPCA said: "We have tested for arsenic, lead,
zinc and avian botulism, but it is coming back as negative. We will
now check for bacterial and viral infections in the water. The lake
contains geese, coots and ducks, but they all seem to be unaffected."
She added that the rate of deaths had slowed down in recent days, and
the dredging of the lake, which lasted 2 weeks, finished on Friday
[27 Jan 2006].
A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency, which took away samples of
the lake for testing, said: "There was nothing in the water that
could have caused the swans to die, so it doesn't seem that any water
pollution was the cause." Members of Southport Swan Rescue visit the
lake, which contains about 140 swans, twice a day. They first noticed
something was wrong on Wednesday, 11 Jan 2006, when 2 birds became ill.
One died quickly and the other was taken to the RSPCA's Stapeley
Grange wildlife hospital in Nantwich, Cheshire, where it died 4 hours later.
Since then, 22 swans have died and a further 15 are being cared for
at the hospital, which has also been carrying out the post-mortems.
Gwen Barton, swan rescue coordinator, said: "We are devastated
because we look after these birds very well, and when you see them
dying, it is sickening. We still think it's down to the lake being
dredged and all this work going on, but at the moment we just don't
know exactly what's happening."
Sefton Council regularly dredges the lake to reduce banks of mud and
silt, which can be hazardous to sailors and windsurfers.
A council spokesman said: "It still remains a mystery. As soon as we
know if there is anything we can do, we will put it right."
Swans are protected by the Royal Charter and owned by the Queen. Her
swan keeper dispatches the birds around the world, sent as gifts in
the monarch's name.
