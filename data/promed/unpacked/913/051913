[The 6 new confirmed and 2217 suspected cases (up from 3 confirmed and up to 2289 suspected cases from 2217 cases in the previous report) indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing but perhaps with reduced incidence. Nigeria is still well within the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (1 Jan-17 Mar 2019) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There are 123 confirmed deaths, up one from 122 in the previous reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 17. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states, and the number of affected LGAs remains at 81.

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY
