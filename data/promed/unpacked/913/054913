The small grain harvest is underway from Georgia to Oklahoma. Winter
wheat is at normal crop development stage in the central plains. Most
of the spring grain in the northern plains is at average maturity.
Wheat stem rust in southwestern Georgia.
----------------------------------------------------------
In mid-May, light wheat stem rust was found in southwestern Georgia
plots at Plains. To date wheat stem rust has been reported at sites
in southwestern Georgia, north-central Texas and southwestern
Louisiana.
Wheat leaf rust in the northern Great Plains.
--------------------------------------------------------
In mid-May, light leaf rust was found in fields and plots in central
Kansas. During the 3rd week in May, 1 percent severities were
observed on flag leaves of susceptible cultivars in northeastern
Kansas plots. In mid-May, light leaf rust was found on lower leaves
of wheat plants in research plots in central Nebraska. Hot dry
weather slowed leaf rust development in the southern and central
Great Plains the last part of May. On May 26, 5 percent severities
were found on flag-2 leaves in susceptible winter wheat plots in
Dakota County in east-central Minnesota. In mid-May, 60 percent
severities were found in susceptible soft red winter wheat cultivars
in northern Alabama plots. By mid-May, wheat leaf rust was
widespread and severities up to 65 percent were reported on
susceptible cultivars McCormick [Lr24] and USG3209 [Lr26], in plots
on the eastern shore of Virginia, which may result in significant
losses in the area. This year wheat leaf rust development is greater
than normal in the Mid-Atlantic states. In mid-May, leaf rust
severities up to 80 percent were observed in susceptible cultivar
plots in Kern county and Madera County, California late in the season.
Wheat stripe rust is light in the Great Plains.
-----------------------------------------------
On 22 May, traces of wheat stripe rust were found on the flag leaves
of susceptible cultivars in plots at Manhattan, Kansas. On May 26,
10 percent stripe rust severities were found on flag leaves of
susceptible winter wheat in east central Minnesota plots. At both of
these locations spores were deposited with rain showers in the past 2
weeks. In late May, hot dry weather slowed rust development in these
areas. In mid-May, wheat stripe rust was found in Limestone county
plots in north-central Alabama. In mid-May, hotspots of stripe rust
were found in wheat plots in the eastern shore of Virginia and
Maryland. Heavy stripe rust was reported in commercial fields in the
Albermarle/Pamilico Sounds region in east central North Carolina in
early May. By late May, wheat stripe rust was severe throughout the
Central Valley of California. The 2 most widely grown cultivars,
Summit and Blanca Grande, are now both fully susceptible to the races
of stripe rust that occur in California. Statewide, yield losses to
wheat stripe rust may approach 15 percent this season. On 22 May,
stripe rust was found in a field in Franklin County, in southeastern
Idaho, which is about 6 miles north of the Idaho-Utah border.
Pustules were just beginning to show on the flag leaves and entire
plants had small chlorotic areas that could develop into a severe
outbreak.

[There are 3 main rust diseases of the cereal crop plant wheat (bread
wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_), all
caused by species of the fungus Puccinia: wheat stem rust (_P.
graminis f.sp. tritici_), wheat leaf rust (_P. triticina_ aka _P.
recondita f. sp. tritici_) and wheat stripe rust (_P. striiformis f.
sp. tritici_).
Severe losses due to wheat stem rusts have abated in the USA since
the 1960s due to effective resistance breeding. Severe losses are
still a possibility with leaf rust. The USDA Cereal Disease
Laboratory in St. Paul, MN publishes regular reports on cereal rusts
in the USA during the crop season. Each report gives detailed
state-by-state information, including a summary map, all in pdf file
format (see link to main article). Information for rusts other than
those that infect wheat is not included in this ProMED-mail posting
but others are described in the full report.
In this the 6th report for 2006, most observations are as expected,
and deal with observations of disease in susceptible lines, often in
experimental plots. It is noted that wheat leaf rust development is
greater than normal in the Mid-Atlantic states in 2006. It is also
noted that 2 wheat cultivars commonly grown in California, Summit and
Blanca Grande, are now both fully susceptible to the races of stripe
rust that occur in that state. If conditions in California are
favorable to stripe rust in future years then alternate varieties may
need to be grown.
