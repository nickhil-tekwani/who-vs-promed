Around 6 tons of hamburger and kebab meat distributed and sold across Sweden may have been contaminated by intestinal bacteria which could have been caused by animal excrement. The meat, which has been on sale across the country for the past 4 months, has been found to contain traces of the potentially life-threatening _E. coli_ bacteria. The contaminated meat was brought to the attention of the authorities when 2 children fell ill in Vasteras in eastern Sweden in January 2013.

"It's one of the most severe types of food poisoning that you can suffer from," said Helena Storbjork Windahl at the Stockholm Food Safety Authorities.

The beef has been traced to the distributor Sven P in Stockholm but is originally from a slaughterhouse in the Netherlands. During the slaughter process, the feces from the animals can infect the meat.

"If there are 12 tons coming in, then you don't take a test on every little bit. One has to take a certain number of samples," said Yvonne Bjorling, Sven P's CEO to the newspaper.

Of the shipment of 12 tons, some 6 have to date been sold as ground beef and made into hamburgers or kebab meat, Bjorling said. The remaining 6 tons have now been recalled.

[Although not specifically stated in this post, the _E. coli_ is certainly likely to be serotype O157:H7 or one of the non-O157 serotypes of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ enteropaths.
