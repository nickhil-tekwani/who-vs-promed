Another H5N1 death reported in Indonesia
----------------------------------------
A 38 year old Indonesian man from a town near Jakarta recently died of H5N1
avian influenza, according to an Associated Press (AP) report citing his
family and health workers. Indonesia has said it will no longer immediately
report new H5N1 cases and will instead provide periodic updates. However,
details about the man's death were reported yesterday by the AP, which
cited the man's brother-in-law and anonymous health workers as its sources.

The man was said to have died on 10 Jul 2008 after experiencing a high
fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. "The doctor told us he died of
bird flu. The tests came back positive from Jakarta," the man's
brother-in-law said.

The 38 year old man was from Belendung, a village 24 miles west of Jakarta,
the AP reported. Residents of the area said ducks and chickens roam the
streets freely, but none were reported sick or dead. A relative told the AP
that officials obtained blood samples from the man's relatives and
neighbors and that they have not culled any birds.

Lily Sulistyowati, a health ministry spokeswoman, told the AP she couldn't
confirm the man's death. "But we'll let the public know when we release our
report at the end of the month," she said.

Under the International Health Regulations, countries are obligated to
promptly report human H5N1 influenza cases and other diseases regarded as a
potential global health threat to the World Health Organization (WHO),
which posts announcements about them and keeps an official count of
illnesses and deaths. It is not clear, however, if Indonesia's health
ministry has informed WHO of the case. If WHO recognizes the man's
infection, it will be listed as Indonesia's 136th H5N1 case and 111th death.

Indonesia's last 2 H5N1 cases were confirmed by WHO on 19 Jun 2008, and
both reflected a delay in reporting the cases. The 2 patients were a 16
year old girl who died on 9 May 2008 and a 34 year old woman who died on 3
Jun 2008. [See the ProMED-mail report: "Avian influenza, human (55):
