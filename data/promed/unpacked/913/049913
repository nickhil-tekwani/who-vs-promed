In northern India in recent years, rice root knot has emerged as a major problem in flooded and irrigated rice. Farmers are not able to recognize this disease because specific symptoms on roots remain hidden in the soil. As a result, its identity is misjudged, and fertilizer or an inappropriate pesticide are applied, which give no economic return [and cause] environmental contamination.

Root-knot of rice is caused by a nematode (_Meloidogyne graminicola_). The crop has reduced tillering, and yield is severely affected. Consequently, farmers plough the field and discard the crop. Rice varieties grown in India are generally susceptible and exhibit significant yield loss [of up to] 100 percent in heavily infested fields.

The disease can be controlled by nematicides available in the country. The control measures should be taken in the nursery bed as well as the main field. Farmers are advised to thoroughly plough the nursery beds and remove weeds and crop debris. [Seed or] seedlings should be disinfested. Biopesticides as seed dressing, soil treatment in nursery beds, or root-dips may help. However, the best option is crop rotation [with] maize, pearl millet, vegetables and cucurbits as per climatic suitability.

[The rice root knot nematode _Meloidogyne graminicola_ is a damaging pathogen of upland, lowland and deepwater rice. Symptoms include characteristic hook shaped galls on roots, distortion of blades and margins of newly emerging leaves, as well as stunting and overall chlorosis of plants. Heavily infested plants flower and mature early. Seed germination is inhibited, and infected transplants usually die.

_M. graminicola_ is well adapted to flooded conditions and can survive in waterlogged soil in egg masses or as juveniles for long periods. The nematodes are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). They cannot invade rice in flooded conditions but quickly invade when infested soils are drained. They can also survive in roots of infected plants, and the population increases with the growth of susceptible rice plants. Once they have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them.

Disease management is, therefore, usually aimed at keeping nematode levels below an economic threshold. This requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary (exclusion, disinfestation) and cultural measures (long rotations with non-host crops as mentioned above, water management, soil solarisation) and nematicides. Biocontrol agents and rice cultivars with reduced sensitivity are being developed.

Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) attack a wide range of plants and cause significant economic losses in many vegetable and fruit crops. The genus contains around 70 species and is found worldwide in tropical and sub-tropical regions in many types of soil.
