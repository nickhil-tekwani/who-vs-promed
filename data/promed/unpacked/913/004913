Yellow fever alert: monkey deaths along Colombia-Venezuela border
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The strange death of 22 monkeys of a species that lives along the border
between Colombia and Venezuela raised alert among the health authorities of
the region, who fear that yellow fever may have reached the area, as has
occurred in the provinces of Meta and Guaviare [Colombia]. These were the
declarations of Tahiz Ortega, mayor of Tibu, as she explained that the
animals were found in an area close to her town and the Venezuelan town of
Casigua. The dead animals were sent to Cucuta [Colombia] for the required
laboratory tests.
