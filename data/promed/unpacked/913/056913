South Korea has seen no fresh outbreak of the fatal livestock disease, foot
and mouth disease (FMD) for almost a month, but the Agriculture Ministry
said it will take at least a year to get a clean bill of health from
international authorities.
Officials have destroyed more than 2,000 livestock, mostly cattle, and
undertaken a major campaign in which more than 840,000 livestock have been
vaccinated. Over 700,000 pigs have been vaccinated, although the disease
has yet to affect pigs, a ministry official said.
Officials say the country will have to go another year without any further
outbreaks before the Paris-based Office International des Epizooties (OIE)
will verify Korea has eradicated the disease. That approval is needed to
restart a pork export industry that has been put on ice since the outbreaks
began.
"It is actually too early to say when (it will end)," a ministry official
said. "It could be a year, or even two."
"The focus right now is on ending the battle with the disease as soon as
possible," he said.
South Korea and Japan in late March reported outbreaks of FMD and have
taken measures ranging from destroying animals to bans on transporting
livestock in order to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease.
Japan reported two fresh outbreaks on Thursday.The disease, which is
harmless to humans but fatal to hoofed animals such as cattle, pigs, goats
and deer, has sparked bans on both countries' meat exports.
South Korea exports no beef but had hoped for $400 million in pork exports
this year.
Despite the devastating impact on pork exports, South Korean officials said
they had opted for the slower vaccination approach over merely slaughtering
animals within 10 km (6.25 miles) of all 15 confirmed outbreaks. A ministry
official said slaughtering all animals within a 10 km radius of the
outbreaks would allow Korea to regain OIE approval in just 3 months but
that approach would cause environmental damage.
"We don't export beef and we export only 10 percent of a total home-bred
pork so we decided on vaccinations," the official said.
Korea has had no outbreaks since 17 Apr 2000 and all have been limited to
the northwest corner of the country. Korean authorities said in early April
that it was considering inoculating all 11 million cattle and pigs
nationwide to contain the disease.
"If there are more outbreaks, we may inoculate animals nationwide," the
ministry official said.
The ministry had imposed bans on transporting livestock in a 20 km radius
of 6 areas where the outbreaks occurred and have reduced 5 of these to 10 km.
"After 30 days from the completion of the first vaccination, we will have
blood tests on the vaccinated animals. If they are negative, we can lift
the (10-km) bans," an official with the agriculture ministry said.
"However, we will still watch those animals vaccinated in a 10-km radius
even after the bans are lifted," the ministry official added.
