[Florida] State Agricultural officers are inspecting all dogs and other animals coming out of the Florida Keys. They're looking for signs of a screwworm infection that is killing the endangered key deer. The New World screwworm, is threatening the key deer that live solely on the islands from Little Pine Key to Sugarloaf Key [Monroe County] and a few small surrounding islands. The screwworm, or fly larvae, are attracted to animal wounds where eggs are laid and worms hatch inside the wound. A devastating infection follows and key deer are the most vulnerable.

Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsey's deputies get calls about sick key deer. "You see the top of the key deer's head like a bowl shape like someone carved it out. You can tell it is suffering, wandering, bashing walls. It breaks your heart. It is so sad," said Ramsey. The tiny deer, a tourist favorite found only in this part of the world, are usually discovered with the infection after it is way too late. 60 deer have died already.

The task at hand is to keep the screwworm spread isolated to the Florida Keys. That's why inspectors are making sure they look at any warm-blooded animal coming out of the area and heading north.

The next move includes agricultural officials releasing sterile screwworm flies to fight the spread. "They are not modified or engineered in anyway other than to be sterilized," said Florida commissioner of agriculture Adam Putnam. This means the flies mate but produce no eggs and for good reason. If the screwworm spread to Florida's cattle industry, the state would face economic disaster. "It could impact the rest of the state with quarantine, if it spreads into the remainder of Florida," said Putnam.

New World screwworms are fly larvae (maggots) that infest warm-blooded animals, including people. They most often enter through an open wound and feed on the animal's living flesh.

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has established an Animal Health Check Zone at mile marker 91 south. Animals traveling north will be given health checks at a station located at mile marker 106 to ensure that they do not have screwworm. Residents with warm-blooded animals, like pets and livestock, are urged to watch them carefully and report any potential cases to 1-800-HELP-FLA (1-800-435-7352). Non-Florida residents can call (850) 410-3800.

Screwworms infecting wild deer in the Florida Keys have captured headlines, and experts with the University of Florida [UF] Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences [IFAS] and UF's College of Veterinary Medicine say livestock and pet owners in the state should keep a watchful eye for signs of infection in their animals to aid the eradication effort.

Florida residents who own cattle, horses, goats, sheep, dogs, cats, poultry, exotic birds, or other warm-blooded animals should know the symptoms animals exhibit when infected by the larvae of the New World screwworm fly, said Dr Jack Payne, UF senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources. "We have every reason to believe that the current outbreak will be contained and eradicated," Payne said. "... Having said all that, we need state residents to provide an extra measure of protection, just by observing their animals."

Dr James Lloyd, dean of the UF veterinary college, explained that screwworm infestations occur when an adult female screwworm lays eggs on an open wound or mucous membranes in a warm-blooded animal. When the eggs hatch, screwworm larvae burrow into the host animal's flesh to feed. Infestations can strike otherwise healthy animals, he noted. "The signs of a screwworm infestation might include a festering wound or sore or an unexplained lump under the skin, particularly if there's a discharge or foul smell associated with it," Lloyd said. "Also, you may observe fly larvae on the animal or in its quarters."

A veterinarian should evaluate any animal with a suspected screwworm infection immediately, said Wendy Mandese, a clinical assistant professor with the UF veterinary college's Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences. "Open wounds and unexplained lumps can indicate serious health issues other than screwworm infection, so the key point is to get treatment for the animal as soon as possible," Mandese said.

Time is of the essence because delayed treatment gives screwworm larvae more time to develop and cause damage to the host animals, said veterinary entomologist Phil Kaufman, an associate professor with the UF/IFAS Entomology and Nematology Department. "The pest we're talking about, the New World screwworm fly, _Cochliomyia hominivorax_, is not something you can ignore because there's no such thing as a tolerable infestation," Kaufman said. "The larvae of this species consume healthy tissue -- they create wounds. They are also capable of burrowing deep into the host's body tissues to reach previously uninfected areas. Untreated cases can lead to death within a matter of weeks, maybe less."

Clinical treatment of infected animals typically involves the application of medication to the animal's wounds to kill the larvae, larvae removal, administration of antibiotics and general supportive care, Mandese said. "When caught in time, screwworm infections are treatable," she said. "Even if it turns out your animal has a different health issue, immediate attention is appropriate for any unusual wound, sore, or persistent discomfort you notice in a pet or livestock animal."

[The adult screwworm fly is about the size of a common housefly, or slightly larger, but different in color and appearance. The screwworm fly has orange eyes and a metallic dark blue to blue-green or grey body. It also has 3 dark stripes running down its back, with the middle stripe shorter than the outer 2 (see photo at http://cdn1.sempretops.com/wp-content/uploads/Cochliomyia-hominivorax.jpg).

A female screwworm fly typically mates once in her lifetime and lays her eggs on or near an open wound or the mucous membranes of an animal's nose, mouth, or ears. In her lifespan, the screwworm fly can produce thousands of offspring. The eggs hatch into larvae within a day and then feed on the animal's tissue for 5 to 7 days before maturing. The mature larvae then tunnel into the ground and emerge as adults, ready to mate and continue the cycle.

While they can fly much farther under ideal conditions, adult flies generally do not travel more than a couple of miles if there are suitable host animals in the area. New World screwworm is more likely to spread long distances when infested animals move to new areas and carry the pest there.

In the 1950s, USDA's Agricultural Research Service developed a new method to help eradicate the pest using a form of biological control, called the sterile insect technique. Infertile male flies are released in infested areas. When they mate with local females, no offspring result. With fewer fertile mates available in each succeeding generation, the fly, in essence, breeds itself out of existence.

USDA began using this technique in Florida in 1957 and eradicated the flies from the entire south eastern United States by 1959. The technique applied to the more extensively infested south west in 1962. By 1966, self-sustaining screwworm populations were eliminated from the United States. However, there were still infestations in Mexico, and animals crossing the border were causing some re-infestations in the United States. USDA worked with Mexican officials to reduce the flies in that country. After 1982, there were no more re-infestations in the United States, and Mexico was officially declared free of screwworms in 1991. USDA then partnered with the countries of Central America to eradicate New World screwworms. Today, USDA and its partners maintain a permanent sterile fly barrier at the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia to prevent the establishment of any screwworm flies that enter from South America.

So from the 1st article above we know that help for key deer and other potentially infected animals is on the way. Check all your animals carefully for maggots or tiny rice looking grains on the hair or skin. Be sure to look in the ears, around the eyes, between the toes and pats on cats and dogs, between the front and rear legs, and in any folds of skin such as a bulldog or shar-pei dog may have.
