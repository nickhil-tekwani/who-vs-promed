On Tue 25 Jan 2010, the Ministry of Health (MoH), Cameroon reported
one case of yellow fever in Kumba district in the country's
south-western [Sud Ouest] region, close to the border with Nigeria's
Cross River State.

The index case was identified as a 16-year-old female student in Kake
High School. She presented with a clinical picture of fever and
jaundice. Onset of symptoms started on 11 Jan 2010 with fever. She
had no history of yellow fever vaccination and survived. The index
case was identified through routine yellow fever surveillance system.

Laboratory specimens from this case were found to be IgM positive by
ELISA method at the National Laboratory in the Institut Pasteur,
Yaounde, Cameroon and confirmed positive by plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT) -- a more specific test for yellow fever
-- at the regional reference laboratory for yellow fever at the
Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.

Following identification of the index case, an outbreak investigation
was conducted in the area. The investigation identified one person as
symptomatic (fever). Laboratory tests by the ELISA method of serum
samples for this and 50 other contacts were found to be negative.

Cameroon conducted a yellow fever mass vaccination campaign in 62
at-risk districts covering a population of 7.4 million in May 2009.
The 2 districts of Kumba and Muyuka were, however, not part of the
campaign, as they had no history of yellow fever cases in the past 50
years.

The Ministry of Health plans to vaccinate 345 592 people in Kumba and
Muyuka districts. The country has requested support from the
International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision
(YF-ICG), which manages the global emergency stockpile of yellow
fever vaccine. The ICG has approved support for the vaccination
campaign, which will be funded by the GAVI Alliance through the World
Health Organization. This support is part of the global Yellow Fever
Initiative which aims to prevent devastating yellow fever epidemics
and secure adequate yellow fever vaccine supply for Africa.
