Health officials in Colorado have issued a warning to residents in Boulder County that the bubonic plague has been found in fleas taken from a prairie dog. Notices posted on fence posts around a 44-acre open-space property say that "wild rodents and other small mammals" including squirrels, prairie dogs and rabbits "may be infected with plague." The signs recommend people treat their pets with anti-flea medication, avoid open spaces where the plague has been confirmed and avoid contact "with all sick or dead rodents."

Other advice:

- Avoid fleas. Protect pets with flea powder or drops, or a new flea collar. Keep pets on a leash and out of wild rodent habitats.

- Avoid all contact with wild rodents, including squirrels; do not feed or handle them.

- Prevent rodent infestations around your house. Clear plants and material away from outside walls, reduce access to food items and set rodent traps.

- Treat known rodent sites around your home with flea powder or a suitable insecticide.

According to KUSA-TV, it is the 1st confirmed case of plague in Boulder County since 2011, when a domesticated cat and a dead squirrel tested positive for it. According to the Boulder County Public Health Department, 2 squirrels had been tested for plague earlier this year [2014], but those tests came back negative.

"The fleas don't travel large distances, so it's nothing we're seeing spread or becoming an epidemic," Lane Drager, consumer protection coordinator for Boulder County Public Health, told the Daily Camera. "It's confined to that one area. But if pets are going into these areas, they are risking exposure for themselves and for those pet owners."

Still, locals should be on the lookout for signs of plague ("sudden onset of fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, general feeling of systemic [whole body] illness, extreme pain and swelling in the lymph node") and seek immediate treatment.

Plague can be treated with antibiotics, the officials added, but treatment is "most successful when the disease can be diagnosed quickly."

A wild rabbit in eastern El Paso County [Colorado] died as a result of contracting bubonic plague, the El Paso County Health Department announced Friday [22 Aug 2014]. It is the 1st confirmed presence of plague in El Paso County this season, the department said. The rabbit was found dead near a prairie dog burrow on private property near Yoder. Testing was completed on the animal Thursday [21 Aug 2014] and confirmed the rabbit had plague.

The health department says a public health specialist went door-to-door to notify area residents of the presence of plague. The department warns the public not to try to catch, feed, handle, or kill prairie dogs, squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, or any other type of wild animal. Plague can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected flea.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection. Dogs and cats may bring infected fleas to their homes, so flea control is advised for dogs and the house environment. - Mod.PMB
