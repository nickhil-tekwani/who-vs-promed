I would like to correct an assumption in this article on behalf of UK farmers.

Unpasteurised milk is NOT widely available to the UK public. Many
dairy farmers drink unpasteurised milk, but they do not sell it to
others. However, domestic animals like cats can quite easily access
unpasteurised milk if they roam on to farms, as there will often be a
container of colustrum from freshly-calved animals, which cats may
gain access to.

I do agree with your comments that the risk to humans and other
animals of bovine TB is being underestimated by the UK authorities.
My children are not offered any kind of immunisation for TB despite
the fact that they come into contact with unpasteurised milk and cows
which might develop bovine TB. My local health authority gave me the
excuse that there was no point giving my children BCG as _M. bovis_
did not appear in milk until it was well advanced in the animal, by
which time the routine testing would have picked up the infection.
This may be all very well if milk is the only means of transmission,
but, as the disease spreads in this country, many of us are wondering
what other routes of infection may appear, such as from badgers
visiting gardens and infecting domestic animals [through urine
marking - Mod.MHJ].

[One would assume domestic cats and dogs on farms would be exposed to
_M. bovis_ as would other farm animals, e.g., exposure to the animal
reservoirs of _M. bovis_ (infected badgers, etc.) and their infected
excretions (urine, feces). These infected pets could transmit _M.
bovis_ to their owners via infectious aerosols, which has occurred
with _Y. pestis_. Farm families could also develop _M. bovis_
infection from contact with infectious aerosols from infected
livestock or their infected unpasteurized milk. However, the source
of _M. bovis_ infection for domestic cats and dogs in a more urban
setting is problematic, unless these pets had access to
urban/suburban animal reservoirs [notably badgers - Mod.MHJ]. Were
the domestic pets residing on farms or in cities? I don't think the
report said. [It didn't. - Mod.MHJ] - Mod.ML]

[While Mrs Jones is certainly broadly correct about the
unavailability of unpasteurised milk, there are still these sentinel
infected cats. And though I now live in the US, during my many years
in the UK, I doubt if I ever met a dairy farmer who was concerned
with the health of his or her feral or semi-domesticated barn cats,
at least sufficiently to underwrite their veterinary care. Put
another way, I would be surprised if any of the known infected cats
were barn cats, which is not to deny that barn cats may be infected.
Over the past 5 years, some 48 UK cats have been diagnosed with
bovine TB. This is a set of starting data for an investigation into
risk, and where it will take them will depend on how many were
domestic non-farm cats and how many were cats living on farms. The
necessary animal and human denominators will follow accordingly.
Thanks to kitty litter, a significant proportion of the domestic cat
population are now house bound; it just needs one of these to be
infected to indicate that the pathogen had to be brought into the
house, similarly if the garden was badger proof. While a dog will
confront a badger, a cat will not. Like Andrea, I am sure that the
non-bovine and zoonotic _M. bovis_ risk in the UK is significantly
under-appreciated. She predicts a big increase in bovine TB in the UK
over 2008, with other species such as camelids being infected. I fear
she may well be right. Our thanks to Andrea Jones for her input.

I should point out that respiratory Mycobacteria infections can and
do travel in 2 directions, from animals to humans and from humans to
animals. There are plenty of recorded instances of stockmen and
handlers infecting cattle and elephants with _M. tuberculosis_, and
therefore potentially with _M. bovis_. It should not be presumed that
if a cat and its owner are infected that the former infected the
latter. It could also have been a common source, maybe milk, or from
human to feline.

Anyone who has been actively involved in a livestock control
programme knows that bureaucratic claims of non-transmissibility --
as here over frequent testing catching all lactating reactors before
they shed _M. bovis_ organisms in their milk -- get denied on the
very next farm visit, however true it might be in general. If only
biology and herd management were that simple. - Mod.MHJ]
