West Nile virus found in bird-biting mosquitoes in 3 counties
-----------------------------------------------
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) announced today that
West Nile virus (WNV) has been detected in bird-biting mosquitoes collected
from north eastern Massachusetts, where significant WNV activity has been
confirmed in birds for several weeks. Six mosquito pools -- 5 _Culex
pipiens_ and one _Culex restuans_ -- were positive for WNV. Both of these
mosquito species feed mainly on birds. Three mosquito pools were collected
from Andover, 2 from Tewksbury, and one from Lowell (from 17 to 25 Aug 2001).
WNV has not been detected in mosquitoes that bite humans. Massachusetts
Department of Public Health continues intensive trapping of mosquitoes in
both the north east and south east (Middleboro and surrounding areas)
regions of the state, where WNV activity has been most prevalent in birds.
To date, 255 WNV-infected birds have been found in Massachusetts in 2001.
This year 64 cities or towns have had at least one WNV positive bird. No
human case of WNV encephalitis has been detected in Massachusetts.
