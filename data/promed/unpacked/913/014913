Researchers have identified a novel circovirus in a Kentucky horse with liver disease, although it is uncertain whether the virus was responsible for the animal's health problems.

Circoviruses are small viruses whose circular single-stranded DNA genomes are among the smallest known. They are associated with diseases ranging from symptom free to lethal in birds, pigs, elks, cows, dogs, panda bears, bears, bobcats, pumas, foxes, minks, palm civets, fur seals, numerous rodents, reptiles, and fish. The virus has also been detected in many bat species.

Alvin Hui and his fellow researchers, writing in the journal Viruses [ref.: Hui A, Altan E, Slovis N, Fletcher C, Deng X, Delwart E. Circovirus in Blood of a Febrile Horse with Hepatitis. Viruses. 2021; 13(5): 944; doi: https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050944], described analyzing pooled sera from 4 healthy and one sick horse, all from Kentucky.

DNA sequences from parvovirus-H, equus anellovirus, and some sequences distantly related to mammalian circoviruses were recognized.

Further testing revealed the circovirus came from a pregnant mare with a fever and hepatitis. The horse's serum was also positive for equine parvovirus-H, which could have caused the liver disease, but negative for the equine hepatic virus.

The complete genome of equine circovirus 1 strain Charaf (EqCV1-Charaf) was completed by the researchers.

EqCV1 showed 73-74% identity to pig circoviruses 1 and 2, and the elk circovirus. The closest capsid proteins were from the same ungulate circoviruses, with 62-63% identity.

The overall nucleotide identity of 72% to its closest relative indicates EqCV1 is a new species in the circovirus genus, they said, and the 1st reported in a horse.

Hui and his colleagues said the equine circovirus genome is most closely related to a Canadian elk circovirus, which has been reported once, and to pig circoviruses PCV1 and PCV2, which are distributed worldwide.

Four pig-related circovirus species are currently known that are either non-pathogenic (PCV1), pathogenic (PCV2), possibly pathogenic (PCV3), or still of unknown pathogenicity (PCV4).

PCV2 has been extensively studied due to its significant impact on pig health, often in the context of co-infections with other viruses.

"The common detection of PCV1 and PCV2 in pigs worldwide, therefore, provides a readily available source of virus from which the divergent EqCV1 may have evolved," they said. "Based on the estimated mutation rate of PCV2, the about-30% nucleotide genetic distance between EqCV1 and PCV1, PCV2, or ElkCV indicates that cross-species transmission between these ungulates may have occurred as long as centuries ago."

The author said the disease-causing ability of the new equine strain remains unclear.

The horse in question had a mild case of hepatitis, but it also had low levels of the equine parvovirus, which has also been linked to liver disease.

Although many symptom-free infections with the equine parvovirus have been reported, its detection in this horse does provide a conceivable explanation for its hepatitis.

Whether the equine circovirus played a leading, supporting, or no role in this case of hepatitis, or has the potential to cause other equine diseases, will require further work, they said.

[Circoviruses are widespread, so it is not entirely surprising to find some crossover. What may be concerning, and is unknown, is if the virus was responsible for the hepatitis, or if the 2 (the virus and hepatitis) are unrelated. If they are unrelated, then the finding of the circovirus may be simply present without causing disease. Unfortunately, there are more unknowns than knowns at the moment.

However, this particular virus and horses has been looked at as far back as 2001, as evidenced by an article in the Canadian Veterinary Journal. The abstract and citation are below:

"Abstract
Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a recently recognized agent that is consistently associated with postweaning multisystemic wasting disease in swine. There are conflicting data concerning the ability of this virus to infect and cause disease in other species. To determine if normal cattle, cattle affected with various illnesses, and normal horses in endemic areas of PCV2 infection in swine have had PCV2 infections, 100 randomly selected bovine sera, 100 equine sera, and 100 colostrum samples from clinically normal dairy cattle were examined for the presence of antibodies to porcine circoviruses by using ELISAs. All samples tested were negative for antibodies to porcine circoviruses. As well, a seronegative neonatal Holstein calf and 6 seronegative, 6-month-old beef calves that were experimentally infected with PCV2 failed to develop antibodies to the virus. These results suggest natural infection of cattle and horses with PCV2 does not occur, or is a rare event, in western Canada."
