Malepeque disease found in Cape Breton waters; no human health risk
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A common disease affecting the healthy growth of oysters has been
detected in the waters of St. Ann's Harbour and Orangedale in Cape
Breton, Canada, the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture announced today.

While there are no human health concerns related to this problem,
Malepeque disease is an infection that can cause damage to oyster
beds, creating issues for fishermen and oyster farmers.

The Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture is working
with the farmers, fishermen and First Nations, as well as government
agencies such as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the
Department of Fisheries and Oceans to gather and share information.

Harvesting of oysters for market is continuing because there is no
human health risk. All oysters removed for processing are sent to
facilities approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

The oysters may be safe to consume, but this moderator cannot find
evidence if it changes taste or texture. - Mod.TG]
