Sheep in Spain killed by bluetongue
-----------------------------------
A total of 30 sheep have died of bluetongue on 12 farms in the
northern Spanish region of Asturias. This has been confirmed by the
regional Ministry of Agriculture. The animals were vaccinated against
the serotypes 1 and 8. The vaccination campaign in the affected area
started last month [June 2008].

According to the government, there is evidence that the herd has been
recovering, which would prove that the vaccine is effective.
Technicians have collected samples in the region for further
investigation. That should clarify why the sheep died in spite of the
vaccination.

Bluetongue cases have been encountered also on 6 other farms within
the same surroundings, though without mortalities.

[Clinically suspected cases of bluetongue in Europe should be sampled
for laboratory confirmation: BTV-8 may continue its spread in
southern and eastern directions while BTV-1, currently present in the
Iberian peninsula and south-west France, may spread northwards and
eastwards. In addition, exotic BTV serotypes as well as other
orbiviruses such as EHD may pop up anywhere in Europe "from nowhere"
-- as BTV-8 did in July 2006 within the Belgian-Dutch-German triangle.

The laboratory results of the described serious cases, and an
explanation for their occurrence in vaccinated animals, are
anticipated with interest.
