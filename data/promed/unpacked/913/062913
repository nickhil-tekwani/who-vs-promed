The Austin American-Statesman reports that the state's count is at 54 cases, with Travis County having the highest number of cases, at 23.

A rise in Texas cyclosporiasis cases has officials warning shoppers to use caution when preparing produce in the kitchen.

The source of the parasite remains unknown, but cyclospora is typically found on imported fresh produce like berries and leafy greens.

The alert says reports of the illness have been high in Texas each of the past 3 summers, but state health department spokeswoman Carrie Williams said a surge like that over the last week is unusual. Williams said there were no known hospitalizations or deaths related to the illness.

Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness that is caused by the microscopic parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ and causes prolonged diarrheal distress. People can become infected with cyclospora by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the parasite. This outbreak comes months after a similar outbreak was blamed on fresh cilantro from Mexico.

[In 2013, an outbreak of infection with Cyclospora resulted in 631 notified cases in 25 states. The infection was linked to fresh cilantro imported from Puebla, Mexico. Case control studies exploring what people ate during the incubation period is needed to determine the most likely source of infection. - Mod.EP
