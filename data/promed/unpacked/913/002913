There are some historical aspects to the cases of blackleg in cattle
reported recently on ProMED-mail in the Peace River area of Alberta.
_Clostridium chauvoei_ was unknown in the Peace River country prior to
1973-74 when the first reported outbreak occurred on the Wanham Community
Pasture (in the vicinity of the towns of Spirit River and Fairview). This
was despite cattle farming in the area going back to the 1930's. Prior to
this first outbreak, producers seldom, if ever, vaccinated for clostridial
disease in the Peace River country. In fact, the first veterinarian to set
up a clinic in the town of Fairview (in 1969) had to return all the
clostridial vaccine he had ordered as no one wanted it. Following the
1973-4 scare, some producers started vaccinating, but many did not. The
next outbreak did not occur until 1991 when a single producer who had not
vaccinated his calves lost 26 of 100.
Between July 11 and Oct 14 of 1992, 11 herds within a 25 mile radius of the
1991 outbreak lost a total of 37 calves and 2 yearlings to _Clostridium
chauvoei_ infection. Of these herds, only one practiced any vaccination,
and the last vaccinations had been given 3 years previously. Even today,
many producers in the area are not vaccinating their cattle as they do not
consider the disease a serious threat. This is a shame, because the
vaccine is cheap enough and so effective that the cost of a single animal
will often provide a lifetime supply of vaccine for the herd.
