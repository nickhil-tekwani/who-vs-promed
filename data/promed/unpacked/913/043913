From: Michael McElvaine <MMCELVAINE@mailoce.oce.usda.gov>

I have been bothered by the way this story has been misreported and spun. I
have attached below the summary from the FSIS news release which is much
more accurate report on the data and their interpretation. The cautionary
statements about interpretation of the data have been lost from many or the
news reports.
The preliminary 1998 data is only from a portion of the plants covered by
the 1997 testing data. The preliminary data covers only the first six months
of 1998 versus the full 12 months of 1997 data. The so-called 1996 data was
from a completely different sampling protocol than the 1997 and 1998.
Therefore, I conclude that these preliminary 1998 data suggest a downward
trend in _Salmonella_ prevalence but cannot be generalized across the
industry until we have comparable datasets to more fully evaluate the situation.

First Progress Report on Salmonella Testing for Raw Meat and Poultry Products
------------------------------------------------------
Summary
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS) is releasing a progress report on its first 6 months of testing for
Salmonella in large meat and poultry plants. The final rule on Pathogen
Reduction and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems set
pathogen reduction performance standards for Salmonella that certain plants
must meet, and FSIS conducts testing to verify that these standards have
been met. FSIS is taking a conservative approach in interpreting and
presenting this data because it is preliminary and incomplete in many ways.
Nevertheless, the results are interesting as well as encouraging in light of
the Agency's goal to reduce, to the extent possible, pathogens that can
cause foodborne illness.
Results indicate that 88 percent of plants for which sample sets (a
pre-determined number of samples) have been completed have met the
Salmonella performance standards. Summary data indicate that Salmonella
prevalence for broiler carcasses dropped from 20.0 percent before the
Pathogen Reduction and HACCP rule was implemented to 10.4 percent
afterwards. For swine carcasses, prevalence dropped from 8.7 percent to 5.5
percent.
The data available are insufficient to generalize across the industry.
However, there is a general trend toward lower percentages of products that
are positive for Salmonella. Consumers should continue to properly handle,
prepare, and store all meat, poultry, and egg products in order to guard
against foodborne illness.

[We greatly appreciate Michael bringing the original report's summary to our
notice. Without double and triple checking every piece of news and
information that we get -- which would produce extensive delays and other
problems beyond our usual checks -- we have to depend on our members
to do as Michael has done when they believe that data or reports have been
misrepresented ... contact us immediately and put it right - Mod.MHJ
