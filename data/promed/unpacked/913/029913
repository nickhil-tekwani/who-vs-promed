Embrapa [Brazilian Enterprise for Agricultural Research], working
with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, has found that the
toxin citreoviridine, produced by a fungal contaminant of rice,
_Penicillium citreonigrun_, is one of the causes of the beri-beri
outbreak that killed 42 people in Maranhao state in 2006-2007. There
have been 550 cases, all in Maranhao except for one each in
neighboring Tocantins and Para states. The toxin inhibits the
absorption of vitamin B1, and the disease beri-beri is caused by lack
of that vitamin.
Embrapa analysed samples of rice produced on smallholdings in 29
cities in southwestern Maranhao, where most of the cases have been
registered.
"It was a surprise for us. This toxin was found in Asia in the 1st
half of the 20th century. This is the 1st time it's been found in
Brazil. We have to be very careful with the rice, which must be well
dried and stored to avoid a new outbreak," said Beatriz Pinheiro,
chief of Embrapa Rice & Beans [section].
Embrapa has sent a list of recommendations on how to combat the
fungus to the Ministry of Agriculture, which includes training of
[agriculture extension] agents, publicity on radio and TV, leaflets
and other means to orient small farmers on the correct handling of
rice.

[Citreoviridine has also been isolated from _Aspergillus terreus_
according to Angew. Chem. 92 (6), 484-486. Fuska, J., Fuskova, A.,
and Nemec, P. (1979).
This report calls the disease beri-beri, which is associated with a vitamin
deficiency disease in which the body does not have enough thiamine
(vitamin B1). - Mod.TG]
