China's CDC said yesterday [Sun 31 Apr 2013] in an extensive Q and A report posted in English that the source of the infections is probably poultry. It noted that H7 influenza infections in humans are uncommon but have been confirmed in people who have direct contact with infected birds, especially during H7 outbreaks. Between 1996 and 2009, human H7 infections were reported in the Netherlands, Italy, Canada, the United States, and England, with pathogens including H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7, the report said. Most of the infections involved conjunctivitis and mild upper respiratory symptoms.

The statement noted that H7N9 has previously been isolated only in birds, with outbreaks reported in the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States. David Halvorson, DVM, an avian health expert at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, told CIDRAP News that the subtype has infected poultry in the United States, but it's not likely to be from the same lineage as China's H7N9. He said evidence of exposure to low-pathogenicity H7N9 was detected in US flocks in 2007, 2009, and 2011. "I believe chickens and turkeys in Nebraska, Minnesota, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee were involved," Halvorson said.

Animal health officials in Shanghai today [1 Apr 2013] said tests on samples from some of the thousands of dead pigs that were recently retrieved from the Huangpu River were negative for avian influenza viruses, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported today [see http://english.cri.cn/6909/2013/04/02/2702s757201.htm].

China's CDC said information about the clinical course of the disease is limited, but so far it appears that an acute fever, high temperature, cough, and respiratory infection symptoms occur early in the disease. More severe manifestations appear 5 to 7 days later, including severe pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. So far, no subclinical infections have been found in blood testing of contacts. "But we cannot rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission until we know more about the virus characteristics and results from ongoing investigations," the Chinese statement said.

The 87-year-old man who died had 2 sons who were recently hospitalized with similar symptoms, but the Shanghai Health Bureau said neither had the H7N9 virus, Shanghai Daily, an English language newspaper, reported today [1 Apr 2013]. The sons had pneumonia. One, age 69, recovered and was discharged from the hospital, but the other, age 55, died from severe pneumonia and respiratory failure in late February 2013.

Antigenic and genome sequencing suggests that H7N9 is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors, and the drug's use in early infection appears to be effective, but more research is needed to determine whether the treatment's benefits are specific to H7N9 infection, China's CDC said.

The WHO in a February 2013 update on the development of vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness reported that there are 6 H7 candidates, but none of them are H7N9. The ones on the list include H7N2, H7N7, H7N3, and H7N1. Infectious disease experts are responding cautiously, but with some concern, to news of the H7N9 infections in China. Erin Burns, communications team lead with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Influenza Division, told CIDRAP News that the CDC is aware of the 3 H7N9 infections, is following the situation closely, and is coordinating with international partners and gathering more information. "At this time, it is too soon to speculate regarding the significance of these cases," she said.

Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), also said it's difficult to gauge how significant the development is, though the cases are a cause for concern. He said the strain could disappear or go on to cause more disease. "We just don't know," he said.
