Pneumonia Confirmed in Cinnabar Mountain Bighorn Sheep

Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks(FWP): Pneumonia Confirmed in Cinnabar
Mountain Bighorn Sheep

Fish & Wildlife - Region 3

Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks confirms the discovery of pneumonia in
the Cinnabar Mountain bighorn sheep herd near Corwin Springs earlier
this week. A report was made to FWP Monday about sheep coughing at
Cinnabar Mountain. An FWP field biologist responded by observing the
herd and evaluating the likelihood of the presence of pneumonia.
Following the observation, 2 lambs were lethally removed on site and
brought to the state wildlife lab in Bozeman for examination. Evidence
of pneumonia was present in lungs of both lambs.

Region 3 Supervisor Pat Flowers said today, "FWP is currently
assessing the extent of the affected sheep in order to determine the
appropriate response actions. Those actions might include culling in
order to prevent the spread of the disease to healthy animals."

There are no known vaccines to prevent pneumonia in wild sheep. In
extreme cases, pneumonia-related outbreaks can result in herd
"die-offs." Since 1984, there have been pneumonia related die-offs in
14 bighorn sheep populations in Montana. In the 1990's Montana lost
1400 bighorn sheep due to pneumonia. Over 600 Montana bighorn sheep
were lost to pneumonia in 2010 alone. Most pneumonia related die-offs
have occurred in transplanted herds. The Cinnabar herd is part of a
native population, and has never experienced a pneumonia outbreak.

FWP reminds hunters and others who might recreate in the area that it
is illegal to possess a bighorn sheep head picked up in the wild. If
dead or sick bighorn sheep are discovered, please contact FWP Region 3
Headquarters in Bozeman at (406) 994-4042.

[For a native herd to come down with this disease is very bad news.
While culling sick ones may save some, it did not seem to help herds
in 2010. Given the poor response to culling, one wonders when is the
appropriate time to try some other technique such as perhaps medicated
feed?

I know that bighorn sheep are unique and do not handle like
domesticated animals. I know rounding them up is difficult, but
clearly has been done or there would not be “relocated” herds. So
it seems to me that there should be a way to treat or prevent the
pneumonia, especially given the poor results of culling last year. –
