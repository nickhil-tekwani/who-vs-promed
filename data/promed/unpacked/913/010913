New Mexico Equine Vesicular Stomatitis Case Count Rises -----------------------------------------------------
More than 20 vesicular stomatitis (VS) cases have now been confirmed in New Mexico horses, according to a July 25 update from the New Mexico Livestock Board. The current outbreak began in late April when two horses in Otero County tested positive for the disease. "At present, there are in excess of 20 confirmed cases in New Mexico," the statement read. "Counties with (currently) confirmed cases include Rio Arriba, San Miguel, Sandoval, Socorro, Valencia, and Lincoln."

In June State Veterinarian Dave Fly, DVM, announced in a statement that the state's livestock board had implemented movement restrictions in response to the numerous confirmed or suspected VS cases. The full list of restrictions is available online. In the statement Fly said the restrictions "will remain in effect until New Mexico is declared free of vesicular stomatitis."

Additionally, "Be sure to check with the state of destination for livestock shipped out of state, because their requirements for New Mexico exports may have changed in response to the VS outbreak," the Livestock Board cautioned.

A viral, foreign animal disease that occurs sporadically in the United States, VS usually appears in southwestern states. The disease, thought to be transmitted by sand flies and black flies, can affect horses, cattle, and swine and occasionally sheep, goats, and deer. It causes blisters to form in the animal's mouth, on teats, or along the hooves, resulting in excessive salivation, lameness, or oozing sores. VS can incubate for two to eight days before clinical signs appear. It is rarely fatal and usually lasts about two weeks before clearing up.

[This infection when in species other than horses can be confused with FMD, which should always be kept in mind. In horses it will clear up on its own. Horses cannot be infected with FMD.

The outbreak of VS in New Mexico was noted in April 2012. New Mexico issued a release on 18 Jun 2012 for recommendations for owners. It may be found at http://www.nmlbonline.com/documents/VS%20Recommendations%206-18-12.pdf. This link does provide some helpful information, as does the USDA APHIS-VS fact sheet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/fs_vesicular_stomatitis_2012.pdf.

The state of New Mexico can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1EP1. A county map can be seen at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/new-mexico.shtml.]
