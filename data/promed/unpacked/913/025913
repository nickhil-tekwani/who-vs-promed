Sao Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, which has closed a score of public parks as a preventive measure to avoid a yellow fever outbreak after several monkeys died, today [6 Jan 2017] confirmed the 1st 2 human deaths from the disease in the metropolitan region.

According to a bulletin issued by the Regional Health Secretariat, laboratory tests confirmed yellow fever in 3 patients who were suspected of having contracted the disease, 2 of whom died, while the 3rd remains hospitalized.

These are the 1st human deaths confirmed in the Sao Paulo metropolitan region since the authorities began to adopt preventive measures this past October [2017] due to the increase of cases of monkeys dead of the disease in public parks.

The monkeys do not transmit the disease to humans but are hosts of the virus and can infect the 2 species of forest mosquitoes capable to transmitting the disease [virus].

Despite that the 1st victims were residents in the capital, the Health Secretariat suspects that they contracted the disease on trips to Mariporá, one of the municipalities in the Sao Paulo metropolitan region, and which has large areas of [forest] reserves, and which moreover has registered yellow fever cases in dead monkeys.

The coordinator of the disease control sector, Marcos Boulos, explained that the victims traveled to Mariporá to spend the Christmas and New Year's holidays, and, it seems, contracted the disease in this region. "Practically the entire population of Mariporá (some 90 percent) now has been vaccinated against yellow fever so that those who contract the disease are from other regions and travel to this municipality without vaccination," the official explained. "It is important that people who travel to Mariporá get vaccinated before [travel] and use repellants to avoid bites of the mosquitoes that transmit the yellow fever virus," he added.

This past October [2017], Sao Paulo city closed to public access 13 parks that had confirmed cases of yellow fever monkey deaths to avoid an outbreak [in humans], and in December [2017] prohibited entry into another 10 nature parks.

The largest city in Brazil and in South America also launched an intensive campaign to vaccinate the population in all the areas of risk against yellow fever, including various neighborhoods of Sao Paulo as well as other metropolitan areas such as Mariporá, Guarulhos and Itapecerica da Serra.

The concern about yellow fever outbreaks also obligated the Health Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro state to initiate intensive vaccination campaigns in the municipalities of Nova Iguazú, Tanguá and Miguel Pereira, close to nature reserves in which cases of monkeys dead from the disease were confirmed.

The intensified vaccination campaign was [done] as well in Brumadinho, a municipality in Minas Gerais state near Belo Horizonte, the regional capital, in which 2 human cases of yellow fever were confirmed, one of whom died.

The Ministry of Health this past August [2017] declared an end to the health emergency caused by an outbreak of yellow fever that affected the whole southeast region of Brazil that caused, between December 2016 and August 2017, 261 [human] deaths and another 777 proven cases of the infection.

A large proportion of the Sao Paulo population now has been vaccinated as part of the yellow fever outbreak prevention campaign registered in the 1st half of this past year [2017] and that also affected the states of Minas Gerais, Espíritu Santo and Río de Janeiro, all located in southeastern Brazil, the region most populated in the country.

The emergency due to that outbreak has been ended due to the Ministry of Health's registration of the last case in June [2017].

In order to meet the demand by the population, this past year [2017], the government distributed 36.7 million extra doses of the yellow fever vaccine.

[The dates that the 3 individuals became ill with yellow fever (YF), with the deaths of 2, are not given, but the fatalities may have occurred on or shortly before the announcement of YF confirmation. The park closures and vaccination campaigns in these areas of risk are urgent, since the virus continues to circulate in the forested areas. Brazil-wide, the WHO reported 779 confirmed cases and 262 deaths, a few more than stated above (see Yellow fever - Americas (66): PAHO/WHO 20171214.5504146). So far, none of these cases has been attributed to the urban _Aedes aegypti_ transmission cycle. All have been reported due to the sylvan (forest) cycle with related monkey deaths. The preventive measures are essential to prevent the virus reaching urban and suburban areas where _Aedes aegypti_ are abundant. The situation in Brazil illustrates the need to maintain routine YF vaccination in endemic YF areas in order to avoid health emergencies. - Mod.TY
