New endemic West Nile virus lineage 1a in northern Italy, July 2012. Euro Surveill. 2012;17(31):pii=20231.

Summary
-------
We report here the 1st blood donation positive for West Nile virus (WNV) by nucleic acid amplification testing collected in north-eastern Italy in July 2012. Partial sequencing of the WNV RNA demonstrated identity with a WNV lineage 1a genome identified in the same area in 2011 and divergence from the strain responsible for the outbreak in northern Italy in 2008-09. These data indicate that WNV activity in northern Italy is occurring earlier than expected and that different WNV strains are circulating.

Epidemiology of West Nile virus in Italy
----------------------------------------
WNV has emerged in recent years in central European, eastern European and Mediterranean countries, and epidemics in these areas have become increasingly frequent. In Italy, the virus was 1st identified in horses in 1998 in Tuscany, but no human cases were identified at the time. The first human cases of WNV disease were identified in 2008, in north-eastern Italian regions surrounding the delta of the river Po. In these areas, in 2008 and 2009, several human cases of WNV disease were identified, large outbreaks occurred among horses, and widespread WNV circulation was demonstrated by screening of birds and mosquitoes. Genome sequence analysis of WNV strains isolated in Italy in 2008 and 2009 showed they were closely related, suggesting the virus had overwintered and established an endemic cycle in Italy. In 2010, human cases of WNV disease were reported only in the region Veneto, where special surveillance programmes for West Nile fever had been activated, and virus circulation was recorded in more northern areas than those affected in previous years. In 2 blood donations from Veneto in 2010, typing was possible and WNV lineage 1 was identified by specific real-time RT-PCR, but due to the low viral load, viral genome sequencing was unsuccessful. In 2011, increased WNV activity was observed in Italy, involving a larger geographic territory in north-eastern regions as well as the regions Sardinia and Marche, where WNV circulation had not been reported before.

Phylogenetic analysis
---------------------
WNV RNA was amplified and sequenced from the plasma of the positive donor identified in July 2012. Fragments of the WNV E (278 nt), NS2B-NS3 (721 nt), and NS5 genes (182 nt) (GenBank accession number JX417422) demonstrated 100 per cent sequence identity with the WNV Livenza genome (GenBank accession no. JQ928174) that was detected in September 2011 in a blood donor resident in a nearby village, and fully sequenced. Both genome sequences belonged to lineage 1a and were related to WNV strains of the western Mediterranean subtype.

Discussion
----------
In 2012, as in previous years [1,11], the surveillance period for human cases of WNV disease in affected areas in Italy lasts from 15 June to 30 November, while the period for WNV nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) screening of blood, tissue, and organ donations lasts from 15 July to 30 November. Since most human cases of WNV infection detected in Italy so far have been identified during September, when mosquito activity is highest, and fewer cases in August and October, it was unexpected to find a WNV NAAT-positive blood donation as early as on the 1st day of blood screening on 15 July 2012.

Such an early detection of a human case of infection during the 2012 season might predict increased WNV activity, requiring strengthened surveillance. It is conceivable that the warm spring and very hot summer in north-eastern Italy may have favoured WNV spread due to increased mosquito density. This year, early detection of human cases of WNV disease has been reported also in Sardinia, in Greece, Israel, and the occupied Palestinian territory, and this trend might predict increased viral activity in the Mediterranean area.

In conclusion, this study reports a new endemic WNV strain detected in north-eastern Italy responsible for a human case of infection early in the summer 2012. This study also indicates the importance of WNV NAAT screening for the safety of blood, tissue, and organ donations.

Given the early evidence for transmission, it will be interesting to see if there is increased WNV transmission in the European Mediterranean basin as the authors suggest might happen this year (2012), and which WNV lineages are circulating and where and when they occur. WNV in these areas in southern Europe appears to be in the process of becoming endemic, as detection of the same lineage in 2011 and 2012 in the same area suggests.
