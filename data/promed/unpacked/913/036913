ProMED-mail correspondent Susan Baekeland

[OIE has no recorded ovine or caprine cases of anthrax back to 1997 and each year a significant proportion of the these flocks, over 85 per cent, are vaccinated. In fact vaccination is common, virtually universal, in all species, including horses. However cattle in 3 villages were affected in 2005; while only one was reported to OIE in 2006 3 districts were affected that year; a single bovine case was recorded in 2007; and two bovine cases each in 2008 and 2012. And there are human cases most years: 2005 (5), 2006 (0), 2007 (17), 2008 (12), 2009 (0), 2010 (1), 2011 (2), and 2012 (15).

So logically the risk of anthrax is ongoing in spite of the claimed livestock vaccination. The true incidence is unclear but the disease is sporadic and this always makes recognition problematic.

It is not unusual for animals to come down with anthrax on their way to or from the summer grazing on high ground. These are usually seen at choke points on the road or on the equivalent of livestock "motel" overnight holding pastures. They are stressed. - Mod.MHJ
