I must try to introduce some (true) facts to this debate. Nine out of ten
reptiles shed salmonellae in their faeces and attempts to treat reptiles to
eliminate salmonellae have proven ineffective.
One study (performed by a student) that I know of found salmonellae in
about 90% of recently imported snakes. This does not mean all reptiles
carry this organism at the high infection rate. It is commonly stated in
texts that "all reptiles carry _Salmonella_" yet few papers have supported
this extreme view. It is wise, however, to assume that this organism may be
present in the animal's faeces and to adopt sensible hygiene precautions.
No animal (even human) can be "cured" of enteric salmonellosis as we cannot
sterilise the gut.

Commercial distribution of small pet turtles was banned in the USA some
time ago for just that cause, and I see no reason not to extend the ban to
other reptiles in the interest of public health. - Mod. ES
The ban on small turtles was bizarre- apparently based on the size that
would fit into a child's mouth, whereas the fact is that it's the
contaminated water and faeces that are infective. And why just turtles?
Because of similar news stories just based on turtles....I completely
support the view that one should be careful and attentive to the risk of
zoonosis from all animals. Yet one must base the banning of reptiles on
science. One must also remember that children and those with compromised
immune systems, pregnant women etc. may also be at risk from cats with
_Toxoplasma_, dogs with worms (_Toxocara_ especially), birds with
_Chlamydia_ (psittacosis) or _Salmonella_, especially feral pigeons, that
there is a relatively high number of horses that carry _Salmonella_ too.
Yet no one
has suggested banning these animals despite the known risks.
We must be careful not to make judgements based on a tragic case and
excited headlines but highlight the risk and how to deal with them. I fully
support the view that reptiles are not pets for small children based upon
the needs of the animal as well as any disease risk and the drain on the
wild population to provide these pets is another important issue...

[Well, I thought I'd presented quite a few facts based upon CDC data and a
published paper. The ban on small turtles in the US may seem bizarre, but
it worked as a public health action. As indicated previously, a 77%
decrease in cases caused by turtle-associated serotypes of salmonellae was
observed. The CDC also reports that 7% of reported cases of salmonellosis
can be associated with handling reptiles. I think those numbers are based
on science. Why only turtles indeed? That was my point. Dogs and cats are
warm and fuzzy. Cats clean up after themselves pretty well, and most
pregnant women know that they shouldn't clean litter boxes. I would be in
favor of strict enforcement of pooper scooper laws for dogs kept in
residential areas. Are you listening, Mayor Menino (Mayor of Boston,
Massachusetts, USA)? I rented horse stalls for years when I owned a barn,
and spread the manure on hay fields and gardens. I guess my manure-handling
skills were OK since I don't recall getting sick. Don't get me started
about pigeons. - Mod. ES
[Reptiles, including ones that are apparently healthy, may intermittently
excrete _Salmonella_ in their feces, especially when stressed (such as when
they are placed in captivity). As a microbiologist and an infectious
disease specialist, I understand the points that ES makes. As someone who
has been a member of a number of herpetological societies, I understand
that there are appropriate actions that can be taken to minimize the risk
of transmission of _Salmonella_ from reptiles to humans and that these
animals make fascinating pets. It is clear that, as with all animals, there
is a finite risk of transmission of disease from reptiles to humans and
that education of the public to prevent this transmission is in the
interest of those in public health as well as those in the pet industry. I
will consider this thread closed. - Man. Ed. DS
