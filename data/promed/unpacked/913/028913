Raccoons with canine distemper spotted in city
----------------------------------------------
There have been reports in the past month of raccoons displaying signs of canine distemper throughout Winnipeg and in the rural municipality (RM) of Headingley. Dogs in Winnipeg and Headingley should steer clear of raccoons for the next little while.

Reports are coming from neighbourhoods that typically see large raccoon populations, including those around the Red and Assiniboine rivers, and Corydon Avenue, according to Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship. Canine distemper spreads easily between raccoons and dogs, and the disease leads to progressive deterioration of mental and motor skills in canines. Dog owners can protect their pets from canine distemper through routine vaccinations, and by making sure dogs do not come into contact with wildlife.

Infected raccoons will appear disoriented with crusted eyes, have mucus coming from their noses, and show shortness of breath. Residents who see raccoons that fit this description are advised not to make contact with them, even though humans are not at risk for catching the disease. Instead, residents are asked to call Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship at 204-945-5221.

[Canine distemper in raccoons starts slowly, initially appearing as an upper respiratory infection, with a runny nose and watery eyes developing into conjunctivitis (the most visible signs. As time wears on, the raccoon can develop pneumonia. The raccoon may be thin and debilitated and diarrhea is a clear symptom. In the final stage of the disease, the raccoon may begin to wander aimlessly in a circle, disoriented and unaware of its surroundings, suffer paralysis or exhibit other bizarre behaviour as a result of brain damage.

Many of these signs are indistinguishable from, and therefore often mistaken for, the signs of rabies which can be determined only by laboratory testing.

Raccoon distemper is cyclical and can spread and wipe out entire colonies of raccoons. The disease is transmitted through airborne droplets, direct contact with body fluids, saliva or raccoon droppings.

No treatment exists for canine distemper in raccoons (thereby increasing the need for prevention and control). Infected raccoons are usually euthanized. Control of distemper outbreaks includes the removal of dead animals' carcasses, vaccination of at-risk domestic species to decrease the number of susceptible hosts, and a reduction in wildlife populations which also reduces the number of potential hosts. The canine distemper virus is inactivated by heat, formalin, and Roccal R. Disinfection of premises with a dilution of 1.30 bleach will help to reduce spread.

Pet owners should insure their pets are vaccinated against rabies, and dog owners should include distemper as well as rabies. Canine distemper virus cannot be passed from dogs or raccoons to humans.
