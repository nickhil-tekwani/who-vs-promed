The Preventive Medicine Department reported yesterday [11 Jun 2011]
that since the beginning of this year [2011], the country has recorded
over 7300 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease with 26 deaths.

The department added that the number was 40 percent higher than
during the same period last year [2010] and most of the patients were
young children.

There have been over 1200 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease in 28
provinces and cities around the country in the last one week alone.

All the southern provinces and cities are presently facing an
epidemic of the disease, which has already resulted in 24 deaths.

The northern region has recorded 14 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease
without any fatalities.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is widespread in Viet Nam, and
has infected 7300 people with 26 deaths in 2011 as of 11 Jun 2011.
HFMD cases have been increasingly reported in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)
since April 2011. According to the information from the Institute
Pasteur in HCMC, samples from 174 HFMD cases in HCMC and from several
southern provinces were tested, and human enterovirus 71 (HEV 71) was
identified in 25 percent of cases and other enteroviruses in 52
percent of cases (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Hand, foot & mouth
disease - Viet Nam (05): Ho Chi Minh City 20110608.1741).

[The sub-genotype of HEV 71 is not mentioned. The previous report
(ProMED-mail archive no. 20110607.1739) indicated that sub-genotypes
C4 and C5 were circulating. These sub-types have been prevalent in
southern Viet Nam since 2003. The viruses involved in the 52 per cent
of the cases not due to HEV 71 would be of interest.
