From: Ojelabi Olufemi <femscop@gmail.com> [edited]


A nurse at the Federal Medical Center, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria, died over the weekend [17-18 Dec 2016]. Doctors suspected sepsis. The nurse is also a student at the Babcock University School of Nursing. 2 of her classmates are said to be critically ill also.

[Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria. The October 2016 Ministry of Health Epidemiological Bulletin indicated that there have been 10 reported Lassa fever cases in Ogun state this year. Occurrence of additional cases would not be surprising, but laboratory confirmation is important if these cases are to be added to the state total.

Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protection equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Since the deceased individual is a nursing student, it would be of interest to know if the student or her 2 classmates had been in contact with a Lassa fever patient in the hospital.

[2] Abeokuta: additional cases

Four months after Ogun State Government declared the state is Lassa fever-free, the viral disease, known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) has killed an assistant nursing officer, and a mortuary attendant, whose identity could not be ascertained as at the time of writing this report.

[The nurse] was said to have attended to a suspected Lassa fever patient, while the morgue attendant handled the corpse.

Worried about the successive death of the duo, the hospital management commissioned a test at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan. The result, yesterday [20 Dec 2016], confirmed Lassa fever killed them between [Fri 16 Dec and Sun 18 Dec 2016].

Daily Sun learnt that 2 others -- a doctor and a nurse are reportedly being attended to at the intensive care unit of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Idi-Aba, Abeokuta.

It was further learnt that the morgue attendant was a serving corps member who helped his father who manages the morgue at the FMC, in Abeokuta.

Meanwhile, activities at the hospital were put on hold, yesterday [20 Dec 2016], as nurses on duty and other workers refused to report for duty due to fear of contracting Lassa fever.

But, Commissioner for Health, Dr Babatunde Ipaye, in a statement, called on the management and staff of FMC not to panic over the case. Allaying fears of the staff, particularly the nurses, Ipaye said the situation does not call for unnecessary panic, and added that Lassa fever can only be transmitted by getting in contact with body fluid, unlike Ebola [virus disease], which can be transmitted through air and some other means.

He said the state ministry, in collaboration with the FMC, will set up an isolation centre in the premises, to attend to emergencies, and urged nurses to always attend to patients in the most hygienically, acceptable manner.

"We are going to immediately create an isolation centre here at FMC, to cater for unexpected cases and emergency on public health issues like Lassa fever, to include others communicable diseases and have set officers out to confirm the root of the cases," Ipaye said.

Meanwhile, Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, has confirmed the death of a health practitioner as a result of Lassa fever in Ogun State. Adewole also mandated the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to release a detailed brief as soon as it concludes it investigations.

But the minister called on members of the public to be calm, and seek care in health care facilities.

A statement by the ministry's Director of Media and Public Relations, Mrs Boade Akinola, quoted the minister as saying anybody with symptoms which include fever, headaches, vomiting, should report immediately at the nearest medical facility.

"Healthcare professionals are reminded to test before treating for suspected malaria and, if the test is negative for malaria, to maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever. Lassa fever is treatable when detected early. Medical personnel are, hereby, directed to report case of suspected Lassa fever immediately to the state epidemiologist, who has been provided with the commodities, by NCDC, to respond to cases."

The minister also urged the health workers to take the necessary precaution in treating patients.

Adewole also condoled with the Nigerian Association Nurses and Midwives on the death of their member.

[The assistant nursing officer mentioned above appears to be the same fatal case mentioned in the 1st report above. The dead morgue attendant and physician and nurse who are in the hospital ICU are new cases. Apparently, use of personal protective equipment was not in use in the patient care facilities where these cases occurred. Ogun state may have been declared free of cases in the past 4 months, but the virus is likely present in reservoir rodents continually. - Mod.TY]
