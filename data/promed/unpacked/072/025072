[This is the 6th case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection to
be recorded in Viet Nam in 2010. The cases remain sporadic, and so
far there have been only 2 fatalities in 2010. Overall since the
onset of the outbreak in 2003, there have been 118 cases and 59 fatalities.

Bac Kan province can be located in the map of the Northern Region of
Viet Nam at: <http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>. The

[There was a cluster of H5N1 human cases in Sumatra, Indonesia in
2006 where human-to-human transmission most likely occurred (see
Avian influenza, human (127): cluster, 2006 20070903.2894). The
above newswire does mention an additional 4 cases hospitalized with
high fever and cough from the same commune as the confirmed case of
H5N1 infection. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more
information on laboratory results on these additional 4 cases. - Mod.MPP]
