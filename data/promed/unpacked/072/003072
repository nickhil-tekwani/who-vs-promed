The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) received confirmation of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic disease linked to equine herpesvirus (EHV-1), in a Lamb County Quarter Horse on 10 Jan 2022. This is the 1st positive detection of EHM in Texas this year (2022).

The horse was tested after showing neurologic signs consistent with EHM. The premises has been quarantined, and TAHC staff are working closely with the owner and local veterinarian to monitor the infected horse and enforce biosecurity measures on the premises.

"While the horse showed clinical signs, it was kept home until transferred to a local veterinary clinic for treatment," said Dr. Angela Lackie, assistant executive director of Animal Health Programs. "The horse traveled back home after clinical signs resolved."

EHM is a neurologic disease of horses linked to the equine herpesvirus. Neurological signs appear as a result of damage to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include fever of 102 deg F [39 deg C] or greater (fever most often comes before neurologic signs), nasal discharge, lack of coordination, hindquarter weakness, leaning or resting against a fence or wall to maintain balance, lethargy, urine dribbling, head tilt, diminished tail tone, and penile paralysis.

It is important to remember these signs are not specific to EHM, and diagnostic testing is required to confirm EHV-1 infection. If you suspect your horse has been exposed to EHV-1, contact your local veterinarian.

The Wyoming State Veterinarian has reported a Park County horse has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) after exhibiting signs of neurologic disease. The horse was isolated, and the remaining horses on the premises were placed under a 10-day quarantine.

EHV 101
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/equine-herpes-virus-1-outbreak-in-california-41267/


US Equestrian released a frequently asked questions (FAQ) Friday [25 Feb 2022] to answer questions about the equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) outbreak at the Desert International Horse Park (DIHP) in Thermal, California:

What is equine herpesvirus?
Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is a virus is present in the environment and found in most horses all over the world. Horses are typically exposed to the virus at a young age with no serious side effects.

Are there different strains of EHV-1?
There are 2 strains of EHV-1:
- the wild-type (aka non-neuropathogenic) strain; and
- the mutant-type (aka neuropathogenic) strain of EHV-1.

It is important to note neurologic signs have been identified with both strains of the virus.

What is equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM)?
EHM is the neurological disease syndrome caused by the EHV-1. In this syndrome, the EHV-1 virus damages blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord, causing the various neurologic clinical signs.

How does the disease spread?
EHV-1 is spread by direct horse-to-horse contact. The virus may also be spread indirectly through contact with objects contaminated with the virus, such as clothing, human hands, equipment, tack, trailers, feed, water buckets, and wash rags. The virus can become airborne but only for short distances.

How many horses have tested positive for EHV-1 on the grounds at DIHP or associated with horses having been on the grounds of DIHP?
To date, 18 horses have confirmed positive for EHV-1. Some of these horses tested positive after leaving DIHP.

How many horses have tested positive for EHM that were on the grounds at DIHP?
To date [27 Feb 2022], 3 horses from DIHP have confirmed positive for EHM (EHV-1 infection with neurological signs). One of these horses had to be euthanized.

Is there a relationship between DIHP and the euthanized horse having competed at LAEC?
At this time, there is no known direct link between the DIHP and the euthanized horse confirmed positive for EHM (EHV-1 infection with neurological signs) that competed at LAEC.

Did horses leave DIHP and within 7 days compete at LAEC against LAEC's protocols?
We have reports 4 horses left DIHP and within 7 days competed at LAEC against their protocols. Those horses were removed when this became known to management. USEF is investigating these reports.

Is there a relationship between DIHP and the euthanized horse in San Juan Capistrano?
The euthanized horse in San Juan Capistrano confirmed positive for EHM (EHV-1 infection with neurological signs) had not been to DIHP but was exposed to other horses upon their return from DIHP. One of the returned horses confirmed positive for EHV-1.

[5] California: 2022 FEI Longines Jumping Nations Cup postponed
Date: Mon 7 Mar 2022

An outbreak of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) in California in the US has forced the postponement of many events, following an order from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA).

Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) has been detected in multiple horses in several counties in California, and at least 5 deaths have been reported.

Equine herpesvirus causes respiratory disease, abortion, neonatal death, and the neurological disease known as EHM. It spreads in aerosolized secretions, by direct contact, and by contact with surfaces containing infected secretions. Shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days.

To reduce disease spread, the California State Veterinarian recommends all hunter/jumper events (the most affected group) be postponed for the next 28 days, all equine events be postponed for the next 14 days, and all non-essential horse movements postponed for at least 14 days.

The recommendation considers an event when horses from different home premises are brought together at a single location and include, but are not limited to, competitions of any discipline (in state or out of state), rodeos, educational riding clinics, and any travel of horses to an outside facility for lessons or casual/social gathering, etc. Sanctioned horse racing tracks are exempt from this recommendation.

The outbreak has forced the cancellation of the 2022 FEI Longines Jumping Nations Cup event, which was to be held in San Juan Capistrano from 10-15 May 2022. The event was the 3rd qualifier in the Nations Cup series, and one of 3 North/Central America and Caribbean Division events. The cancellation by organisers Blenheim EquiSports has the full support of both the FEI and the US Equestrian Federation (USEF).

FEI Veterinary Director Goran Akerstrom said the FEI had been closely monitoring the development of the EHV-1 outbreak in California. "Stopping the movement of horses is key to prevent further spread of the virus," he said.

USEF CEO Bill Moroney said while the cancellation was disappointing for organiser and competitors, "the safety and welfare of our members and their horses is our top priority and most important responsibility. We are fully supportive of this decision while the mitigation and containment efforts for EHV-1 are still ongoing in California."

Horse owners must immediately isolate any horses exhibiting neurologic signs and consult their veterinarian under state reporting requirements. Owners must practice good biosecurity when they move horses in emergency situations or for veterinary care, avoid other horses, and don't share tack/equipment that hasn't been properly cleaned and disinfected, including farrier and veterinary equipment.

[6] Pennsylvania (Bucks County): Parx Track, horse euthanized
Date: Mon 7 Mar 2022
Source: DRF.com [edited]
https://www.drf.com/news/two-parx-barns-under-quarantine-after-suspected-equine-herpes-infection


Two barns at Parx racetrack outside Philadelphia have been placed under quarantine due to a suspected case of equine herpesvirus, a highly contagious disease, according to the track's racing secretary.

David Osojnak, the racing secretary, said the quarantines were put in place after a horse that exhibited signs of equine herpesvirus was euthanized at the track on Sunday [6 Mar 2022]. The track has not determined how long the quarantine will be in place, but the track is also not allowing horses to ship out for the time being, Osojnak said. [One could argue clinical signs were enough to warrant euthanasia, while others would say there should have been laboratory confirmation. However, the clinical signs, and perhaps the animal's deteriorating condition, the risk of infection to other very valuable horses, and not spreading the disease prompted the veterinarian and the owner to euthanize prior to testing. There are no details provided here on why euthanasia was elected over testing. - Mod.TG]

Additional tests are being performed on the dead horse to confirm the horse was positive for the virus, Osojnak said.

Parx is hosting 4 USD 100 000 stakes on Tuesday [8 Mar 2022], and several New York-based trainers said on Monday [7 Mar 2022] they intended to scratch their horses from the races. The track is also planning to have a mandatory payout of its jackpot-style bet, the Philly Big 5, on its Wednesday [9 Mar 2022] card. The carryover going into the Monday [7 Mar 2022] card was nearly USD 450 000.

On Sunday [6 Mar 2022], the New York Racing Association put in place a ban on shippers from Parx racetrack due to concern over the case.

"On Sunday morning, NYRA's director of veterinarians was informed of a possible neurological issue with a horse based at Parx," said Patrick McKenna, a spokesman for NYRA. "For precautionary reasons, NYRA will not be accepting entries from Parx-based horses until the investigation is complete and the issue is resolved to the satisfaction of NYRA."

Officials for Pennsylvania state racing commission would not comment when contacted on Monday [7 Mar 2022] or did not return phone calls.

Equine herpesvirus can sometimes be lethal, and it can easily spread among horse populations if it is not contained.

[The vaccine for EHV-1 does tend to decrease the severity of the neurological signs, but thus far there is no vaccine that prevents the neurological form of the disease.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their animals against EHV and use other core vaccines, such as those for eastern and western equine encephalitis (EEE, WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), tetanus, and rabies. Most of these are annual vaccines, except EEE, which needs revaccination approximately every 3-4 months in areas where the disease is prevalent.

The following is from the American Association of Equine Practitioners:

"Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4) infect the respiratory tract, the clinical outcome of which can vary in severity from sub-clinical to severe respiratory disease. Clinical infection is characterized by fever, lethargy, anorexia, nasal discharge, cough, and mandibular lymphadenopathy. Infection of the respiratory tract with EHV-1 and EHV-4 typically first occurs in foals in the first weeks or months of life, but recurrent clinical infections are seen in weanlings, yearlings, and young horses entering training, especially when horses from different sources are commingled. Equine herpesvirus type 1 can cause major outbreaks of abortion in naive mares, the birth of weak nonviable foals, or a sporadic neurologic disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy-EHM) secondary to lytic infection of endothelial cells resulting in the development of thombi in the small blood vessels supplying the spinal cord and brain.

"Both EHV-1 and EHV-4 spread primarily by the respiratory route, by direct and indirect (fomite) contact with nasal secretions, and, in the case of EHV-1 and infrequently EHV-4, by contact with aborted fetuses, placental and fetal fluids, and placentae. Like herpesviruses of other species, these viruses establish latent infection in the majority of horses, which become asymptomatic carriers of one or both viruses. Such horses may experience reactivation of either virus, resulting in replication in certain white cell elements in the blood and short-term shedding of the virus when stressed. Some pregnant mares in which reactivation of virus occurs, may abort. Existence of a carrier state seriously compromises efforts to control these diseases and explains why outbreaks of EHV-1 or EHV-4 can occur in closed populations of horses.

"Because both viruses are endemic in many equine populations, most mature horses have developed some immunity through repeated natural infection; thus, most mature horses do not develop serious respiratory disease when they become reinfected but may be a source of infection for other susceptible horses. In contrast, horses may not be protected against the abortigenic or neurologic forms of the disease, even after repeated infection, and mature or aged horses are in fact more commonly affected by the neurologic form of the disease than juvenile animals.

"Recently, a genetic variant of EHV-1 has been described (defined by a single point mutation in the viral DNA polymerase [DNApol] gene) that is more commonly associated with neurologic disease (EHM). This mutation results in the presence of either aspartic acid (D) or an asparagine (N) residue at position 752. Molecular diagnostic techniques can identify EHV-1 strains carrying these genetic markers. The finding of a neuropathogenic variant of the virus can have implications for the management of EHV-1 outbreaks, or individual horses actively infected with these strains. It is important to understand that both virus genotypes can and do cause neurological disease. However, infection with D752 strains can result in a higher clinical attack rate and a higher case fatality rate. It is estimated that 80-90% of neurological disease is caused by D752 isolates, and 10-20% by N752 isolates. It is possible that 5-10% of all horses normally carry the D752 form (this estimate is based on limited studies at this time). In the face of an active outbreak of EHV-1 disease, identification of a D752 isolate may be grounds for increased concern about the risk of development of neurological disease.

"Primary indications for use of equine herpesvirus vaccines include prevention of EHV-1-induced abortion and reduction of severity and duration of signs of respiratory tract disease (rhinopneumonitis) in foals, weanlings, yearlings, [and] young performance and show horses that are at high risk for exposure. Many horses produce post-vaccinal antibodies against EHV, but the presence of those antibodies is not indicative of protective immunity. Repeated vaccination appears to reduce the frequency and severity of disease and limits the occurrence of abortion storms. As with all forms of equine herpes viral disease, biosecurity management is of primary importance for control of abortion caused by EHV-1.

"Please check with your state or provincial animal health office about which diseases are reportable.

"Vaccines
---------
"Inactivated vaccines
A variety of inactivated vaccines are available, including those licensed only for protection against respiratory disease, and 2 that are licensed for protection against both respiratory disease and abortion. Performance of the inactivated respiratory vaccines is variable, with some vaccines outperforming others. Performance of the inactivated abortion/respiratory vaccines is superior, resulting in higher antibody responses and some evidence of a cellular response to vaccination.

"Modified live vaccine
A single manufacturer provides a licensed modified live EHV-1 vaccine. It is indicated for the vaccination of healthy horses 3 months of age or older as an aid in preventing respiratory disease caused by equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1).

"EHM
None of the available vaccines have a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested that vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of EHM by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion that there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neuro virulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K(R) & Prodigy(R)), Calvenza(R), and the MLV vaccine (Rhinomune(R)).

"Vaccination schedules
----------------------
"Adult, non-breeding, horses previously vaccinated against EHV: frequent vaccination of non-pregnant mature horses with EHV vaccines is generally not indicated as clinical respiratory disease is infrequent in horses over 4 years of age. In younger/juvenile horses, immunity following vaccination appears to be short-lived. It is recommended that the following horses be revaccinated at 6-month intervals:
- horses less than 5 years of age
- horses on breeding farms or in contact with pregnant mares
- horses housed at facilities with frequent equine movement on and off the premises, thus resulting in an increased risk of exposure
- performance or show horses in high-risk situations, such as racetracks. More frequent vaccination than at 6-month intervals may be required in certain cases as a prerequisite for entry to the facility. See here for USEF Vaccination Rule (https://www.usef.org/forms-pubs/ANcxoLX1gNs/equine-vaccination-rule-gr845).

"Adult, non-breeding horses unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: Administer a primary series of 3 doses of inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 vaccine or modified-live EHV-1 vaccine. A 4 to 6 week interval between doses is recommended.

"Pregnant mares: Vaccinate during the 5th, 7th, and 9th months of gestation using an inactivated EHV-1 vaccine licensed for prevention of abortion. Many veterinarians also recommend a dose during the 3rd month of gestation, and some recommend a dose at the time of breeding. Vaccination of mares with an inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 vaccine 4 to 6 weeks before foaling is commonly practiced to enhance concentrations of colostral immunoglobulins for transfer to the foal. Maternal antibody passively transferred to foals from vaccinated mares may decrease the incidence of respiratory disease in foals, but infection is common in these foals and may result in clinical disease and establishment of the carrier state.

"Barren mares at breeding facilities: Vaccinate before the start of the breeding season and thereafter based on risk of exposure.

"Stallions and teasers: Vaccinate before the start of the breeding season and thereafter based on risk of exposure.

"Foals: Administer a primary series of 3 doses of inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 vaccine or modified-live EHV-1 vaccine, beginning at 4 to 6 months of age and with a 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. Administer the 3rd dose at 10 to 12 months of age. Immunity following vaccination appears to be short-lived, and it is recommended that foals and young horses be revaccinated at 6-month intervals. The benefit of intensive vaccination programs directed against EHV-1 and EHV-4 in foals and young horses is not clearly defined because, despite frequent vaccination, infection and clinical disease continue to occur.

"Outbreak mitigation
--------------------
In the face of an outbreak, horses at high risk of infection, and consequent transmission of infection, may be revaccinated. Administration of a booster vaccination is likely to be of some value if there is a history of vaccination. The simplest approach is to vaccinate all horses in the exposure area, independent of their vaccination history. If horses are known to be unvaccinated, the single dose may still produce some protection. It is essential to understand that strict quarantine, isolation, and monitoring protocols are more effective at controlling outbreaks than any vaccination protocol.

"Controversy persists among experts regarding possible association between frequent vaccination against EHV and the risk of developing EHM. The absence of any controlled challenge studies designed to examine this question makes it unwise to offer any definitive conclusion.

"Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: Horses with a history of EHV infection and disease, including neurological disease, are likely to have immunity consequent to the infection that can be expected to last for 3 to 6 months (longer in older horses). Booster vaccination can be resumed 6 months after the disease occurrence." - Mod.TG
