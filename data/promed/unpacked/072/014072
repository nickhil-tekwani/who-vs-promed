Measles genotypes D4 and G3 reintroduced by multiple foci after 15
years without measles virus circulation, Gipuzkoa, the Basque Country,
Spain, March to June 2011
----------------------------------
(By: Cilla G, Montes M, Artieda J, Pieiro L, Arriola L, Perez-Trallero
E.)

During a 3-month period in spring 2011, 23 cases of measles occurred
in 7 independent outbreaks in a region in Spain with around 700 000
inhabitants, where the disease had been eliminated since 1997. High
vaccination coverage and rapid diagnosis allowed implementation of
containment measures, and this prevented spread of the disease. Except
for the 1st outbreak which affected 10 cases, each of the other 6
outbreaks caused a maximum of 3 secondary cases.

In spring 2011, 23 measles cases were detected in Gipuzkoa, a region
in Spain bordering the south of France, where no measles cases had
been reported since the 2nd half of the 1990s [1]. The cases were not
grouped into a single outbreak but belonged to several outbreaks with
distinct origins. This report describes measles circulation in
Gipuzkoa from March to June 2011 and the control measures adopted and
implemented.

Gipuzkoa is a territory of the Basque Country in northern Spain, and
it has a population of around 700 000 inhabitants. Coverage of the
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been over 90 percent since
1987 for the 1st dose in children aged 12 months and since 2002 for
the 2nd dose in children aged 4 years, respectively. Since 2007,
coverage for the 2 MMR vaccine doses has been over 95 percent. Measles
is included in the mandatory disease notification system in Spain.

[Interested readers should access the original text at the source URL
for a description of the outbreaks and the control measures employed
and the list of references cited].

Discussion and conclusion: After more than a decade with no measles
cases detected in the region [1], 7 separate outbreaks were detected
within a few months in this area in the Basque Country. This striking
viral activity coincided with a substantial increase in measles
circulation in other European regions, in particular in neighbouring
France [5]. This report shows that imported cases of measles pose a
risk even to regions with high vaccination coverage in which endemic
measles has been eliminated. In Gipuzkoa, the spread of the disease
was probably contained by the high vaccination coverage in previous
years and the rapid response of the different partners involved in the
primary healthcare system and surveillance services. As in other
recent outbreaks in Europe [6], most affected individuals had not been
vaccinated, infection in persons who had received 2 vaccine doses
being exceptional. Four of the 7 outbreaks were related to groups who
were against vaccination.

Unvaccinated people pose a substantial risk to the general public, and
if they refuse vaccination, they should restrict their contacts with
the general population (school, day-care) in epidemic situations. In
one of the outbreaks in Gipuzkoa, there was resistance to comply with
the containment measures recommended. Notwithstanding the absence of
any legislation, the community has a responsibility to protect those
who cannot be vaccinated; this can be done by ensuring herd immunity.
More than half of the cases occurred in young persons without prior
contact with the virus who were born around the time when vaccination
campaigns started (1975-1990).

The D4 genotype, the main genotype detected, was predominant in recent
outbreaks in France, Spain and other European countries [5,7]. The G3
genotype was introduced in Europe in 2010, and one imported case has
been reported in Spain [8]. Despite an exhaustive epidemiological
investigation, we were unable to determine the origin of the outbreak
caused by the G3 genotype.

Reaching and consolidating high vaccination coverage (with 2 doses) is
essential to eradicate measles, a World Health Organization goal for
Europe by 2015 [9]. However, the risk of measles resurgence will
remain for as long as the virus continues to circulate in other
regions of the world. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and notification,
which allow implementation of containment measures, are crucial in the
fight against this disease.

[Measles virus has a single serotype, although 23 genotypes have been
identified by analysis of the sequences of the nucleoprotein (N) and
hemagglutinin (H) genes. Infection by any genotype induces life-long
immunity against all genotypes. No genotype has been associated with
greater virulence or persistence. Some genotypes may be associated
with specific geographic regions, although the majority cause
outbreaks and sporadic cases in any country. Therefore, knowledge of
the circulation of genotypes in different regions is important to
enable not only the follow-up of each case of measles but also the
evaluation of surveillance systems designed to achieve the elimination
of measles. Therefore, detailed study and characterization of each
case of measles found in a region, the search for its origin, and the
evolution of its variability over time are fundamental for the
elimination plans established in all regions. For a general account of
measles virus genotypes worldwide and a detailed account of the
molecular epidemiology of measles in Spain, see: Measles Virus
Genotyping and Circulating Genotypes. By Maria Mar Mosquera, Fernando
de Ory, Juan Emilio Echevarra and the Network of Laboratories of the
Spanish National Measles Elimination Plan. The Open Vaccine Journal,
2010, 3, 76-85;
http://www.benthamscience.com/open/tovacj/articles/.../76TOVACJ.pdf.

The vaccine viruses are genotype A viruses. D4 is widely distributed
and has been associated with multiple outbreaks in the Indian
subcontinent, East and Southern Africa, North America and Europe. G3
has been associated with transmission chains and importation from
Indonesia and Malaysia.

There have been 220 cases of measles so far this year [2011] in the
United States, more than triple the usual 60 to 70 cases per year,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Europe had more than 26 000 cases reported from January through July
of this year [2011], with 9 deaths, according to the World Health
Organization. So far, no deaths have been reported in the United
States this year.

The CDC found that of the 220 reported U.S. cases, 87 percent of the
people infected didn't get the vaccine, while the other 13 percent
were too young to get it. Most of these cases were people who traveled
overseas to Western Europe, Africa or Asia. Even though 91.5 percent
of the U.S. population is immunized, those who are not are putting
themselves and others at risk, says Patsy Stinchfield, Director of the
Infection Disease Department at Children's Hospital and Clinics of
Minnesota.

Two doses of the measles vaccine are estimated to be 98-99 percent
effective at preventing the disease and provide lifelong immunity. For
those who are unvaccinated and exposed to measles, they can be
expected to get measles at a rate on the order of 90 percent or
higher, according to the CDC.

Some adults are not vaccinated by choice or because they don't realize
they haven't been vaccinated. When it comes to teens and children, 72
percent aren't immunized because of their parents' religious beliefs
or personal reasons, according to the CDC. What parents don't realize
is that "measles is one of the leading causes of death among young
children," says Stinchfield, and she adds that measles can be
misinterpreted as simply a bad case of the flu. Children can suffer
the consequences of severe measles infection for years before they die
from the disease. Brain inflammation and neurological problems are far
more likely if a child gets measles disease. Encephalitis or
inflammation of the brain can lead to permanent neurological
problems.

To vaccinate against measles is far safer than declining or delaying
MMR vaccine, says Stinchfield. One in 1000 cases of measles disease
causes encephalitis in children, and one in one million doses of
measles, mumps rubella vaccine causes brain inflammation, according to
the CDC. Staying current with vaccines is the 1st line of defense
against measles. The recommended age for the 1st dose of the measles
vaccine is around 12 months and the 2nd dose is recommended between
the ages of 4 and 6, according to the CDC.

The CDC recommends that if babies between 6 and 12 months of age are
traveling to areas of the world with known measles outbreaks, they
should go ahead and get the 1st dose of the vaccine about a month
before travel is set to begin. This will allow the baby's body enough
time to build up protective antibodies. The CDC says if an infant gets
the measles vaccine before the recommended age of one, they will still
need 2 more doses of the vaccine.

For those who can't remember whether and when they were vaccinated,
it's important to talk with a doctor, especially before traveling
internationally. Initial symptoms of measles often appear like any
other childhood illness, for example, fever, runny nose, bloodshot
eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Then, the rash
typically associated with measles develops, usually starting on the
face and neck, and then spreads downward to the rest of the body.
Measles spreads very easily. "It's contagious for the 4 days leading
up to the rash, the day the rash appears, and 4 days afterwards," says
Stinchfield.

Health authorities say 90 per cent of 2-year-olds are up-to-date with
their jabs. Auckland's public health service has stopped tracking
people exposed to measles because there are now so many. And some
doctors are calling for a national mass vaccination to control the
spreading outbreak.

The central Auckland and Waitemata health districts have been worst
affected in an outbreak since May 2011. By last week, 250 cases had
been reported. Waikato has been affected since July 2011, with more
than 20 cases, and many other areas have had sporadic cases of the
highly infectious viral disease. Of the 29 new cases of confirmed or
probable measles reported last week, 19 were from the Auckland region.
The remainder were in 6 other health districts from Northland to
Southland.

"There has to be a serious look at the control of the current
outbreak," said paediatric infectious diseases specialist Professor
Diana Lennon, of Auckland University. "The main option is to do a mass
campaign, to consider vaccinating everybody from one year of age to
the end of school. "We've got to mop up the years and years and years
of poor vaccine delivery."

The director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre at Auckland
University, Dr Nikki Turner, agreed on the need for catch-up work to
fill in the gaps in the national coverage with measles, mumps and
rubella (MMR) vaccination. She said although New Zealand now had
reasonably high coverage of young children -- 90 per cent of
2-year-olds were up-to-date with their immunisations -- there were big
gaps among older children and young adults.

"So throughout New Zealand, we've got pockets of people who are not
immunised who can transmit measles. A lot of people still have this
myth that measles is a disease of young children, but we're seeing
measles in adults, young adults, older adults, older kids. The
clinical director of primary care at the Auckland and Waitemata
District Health Boards, Stuart Jenkins, said the regional public
health service had ceased tracing measles cases because the boards had
decided it was now better to increase vaccination.

Under what the DHBs call an "enhanced immunisation programme," they
urge everyone born in 1969 or later who hasn't been vaccinated -- or
who isn't sure -- to talk to a GP about receiving the state-funded MMR
vaccination. People born before 1969 are expected to have been exposed
to measles and are considered immune.

Asked if a national mass campaign to fill in the vaccination gaps was
being considered, a Ministry of Health official said the ministry
already funded vaccination of those born in 1969 or later. "For the
past few months, the ministry ... has been encouraging general
practitioners to increase measles immunisation as much as they are
able to," said deputy public health director Dr Darren Hunt. The
ministry's Immunisation Handbook recommends children be given 2 shots
of MMR, generally at 15 months and 4 years of age, although the 1st
can be given earlier and the 2nd a month later.

So far, there have been 358 cases reported nationally this year
[2011], 250 cases in the Auckland region since May 2011, and 64 cases
nationally have needed hospital treatment this year.

The rate of confirmed measles cases in the Auckland region has slowed.
Fourteen more were confirmed in the past week, compared to 20 the week
before. There have been 262 confirmed or probable cases of measles in
the region since late May 2011. Of those, 53 people have been
hospitalised.

Judging by the number and content of the measles virus reports now
being received by ProMED-mail, it seems probable that the outbreaks
are diminishing in intensity and being brought under control by
enhanced vaccination programmes in countries with developed economies.
