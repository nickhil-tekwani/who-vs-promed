A puppy testing positive for rabies on [Thu 29 Aug 2019] has state health departments in the Dakotas seeking individuals possibly exposed to the fatal virus.

On 29 Aug 2019, a puppy tested positive for rabies in South Dakota. While very little is known about the puppy, it last resided in Agency Village, south of Sisseton, [Roberts County], SD. The puppy had at least 3 littermates.

"Our concern is the littermates have been exposed to rabies and may develop rabies and expose their new owners," said Alicia Torfin, epidemiologist with the North Dakota Department of Health [NDDoH]. "It's possible some of the new owners may be North Dakota residents."

[A photo of the puppy that tested positive for rabies is available at the source URL. Littermates will most likely resemble this puppy, which looks a bit like a dachshund. - Mod.TG]

Rabies is a viral infection that affects the central nervous system, a NDDoH release said. It is almost always fatal for animals and people. People who are exposed to rabies need to begin a series of rabies vaccinations as soon as possible after the exposure.

The following recommendations can reduce the risk of rabies to people:
- Routinely vaccinating pets
- Avoiding contact with wild animals
- Washing bite wounds thoroughly with soap and water
- Beginning the series of rabies vaccinations as soon as possible after an exposure

A rabid fox in Lexington attacked at least 3 people before someone shot it, according to the Davison County Health Department.

At about 8 a.m. Friday [6 Sep 2019], 2 children were waiting to get picked up for school at a bus stop at the American Children's Home when the fox came out of the woods and tried to bite them. The fox punctured one of the victim's shoes, and the other child's backpack was torn up. The attack did not break the skin.

The house parents brought the kids inside and called 911. After, the fox ran off and bit another person. It was then shot and killed. The bite victim was referred to a medical provider for a follow-up.

The health department says this is the 5th case of rabies in Davidson County this year [2019].

The county is warning the public who have had contact with wild animals to not handle animals with bare hands since people can be exposed to rabies through saliva in an animal's fur.

The Davidson County Health Department asks anyone who sees stray dogs, cats, or wildlife in their neighborhoods to call Animal Control at (336) 249-0131.

A crazed raccoon that attacked 3 people was killed by a resident with a shovel after a rabid romp through the village on Sunday [8 Sep 2019], Westchester County health officials said.

The raccoon was confirmed to be rabid, the County Department of Health announced Tuesday [10 Sep 2019].

"Stay alert and closely supervise children and pets when outside," commissioner Sherlita Amler said in a statement. "If you see an animal that is acting aggressively, stay away from it and contact local police immediately."

At just after 2:30 p.m., the raccoon attacked a woman at the corner of Halstead and Madison avenues, according to a health department news release. It bit a man nearby on Halstead Avenue, then attacked another man in a backyard on Willett Avenue, the release stated.

The final victim's father killed the raccoon and contacted the village police department, which picked up the animal for rabies testing.

All 3 people are receiving preventative rabies treatment, according to the health department.

The health department issued a robo-call to notify residents in the area of the attacks of the positive rabies test. Officials warned residents who see stray or wild animals acting strangely to avoid contact and alert the authorities.

Any physical contact with a wild animal should be reported to a health care provider, officials said. Animal bites or contact with animals suspected of having rabies should be reported to the county health department at 914-813-5000.

Officials are also urging that residents keep pets' rabies vaccinations up-to-date. For more information, visit https://health.westchestergov.com or call the rabies infoline at 914-813-5010.

Massachusetts animal control officials say a skunk that attacked a 2-year-old girl in her grandmother's backyard has tested positive for rabies.

The child's grandmother says the skunk latched onto her granddaughter leg near the back door of her Weymouth duplex on Monday night [9 Sep 2019]. The girl's mother picked up the girl and tried to shake the animal off.

The girl had scratches on her hands and leg, as well as a bite on her leg. She was taken to the hospital, where she was given the 1st dose of rabies prevention treatment.

A firefighter who responded to the scene killed the skunk with a shovel. The dead skunk was sent to a state lab that confirmed rabies on Tuesday [10 Aug 2019].

[5] South Carolina: puppy, human exposure

Health officials say 18 people may have been exposed to rabies by a puppy testing positive for the disease in Dorchester County. Officials with the Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC] say those people have been referred to their healthcare providers.

According to a report, the potential exposures happened between 22 Aug 2019 and 6 Sep 2019 when the victims were either bitten, scratched, or exposed while having contact with the animal.

DHEC officials say the puppy was described as a small black and brown shepherd mix and was rescued near Interstate 95 close to Mount Zion Road and Bruce Road in Saint George. The report states the puppy was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 7 Sep 2019 and was confirmed to have rabies on 8 Sep 2019.

DHEC officials say if you have reason to believe you, your family members, or your pets have come into contact with this puppy, or another animal potentially having rabies, contact DHEC's Environmental Affairs Charleston office at (843) 953-0150 during normal business hours (M-F, 8:30-5:00).

According to DHEC, the puppy is the 3rd animal in Dorchester County to test positive for rabies in 2019.

There have been 102 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2019].

According to a report, since 2013, South Carolina has averaged approximately 108 positive cases a year. In 2018, none of the 100 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Dorchester County.

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite, which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal. However, saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose, or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said David Vaughan, director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division. "To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space. If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator."

DHEC said it is also important to keep pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family, and your pets from this fatal disease.

"Be sure to immediately wash any part of your body that may have come into contact with saliva or neural tissue with plenty of soap and water and seek medical attention," DHEC said. "To report a bite or exposure on holidays and/or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number, (888) 847-0902."

[Rabies is a deadly disease. Bites by any stray or wild animal should be taken seriously and thoroughly washed with soap and water; medical attention should be sought immediately.

Vaccinating your pets is critical to helping build a barrier of protection between you and the disease. Keep the vaccines up-to-date. Some counties have rules of one-year vaccines, while others allow for 3-year vaccines. It is generally based on the rabies burden in the county.

Vaccination is important for all your animals, including dogs and cats, but also horses, cattle, goats, and sheep. Wild animals can bite these large farm animals, who can then attack humans with deadly consequences. It is worth the cost of the vaccine to immunize all your animals. - Mod.TG
