3 people have died in a dengue fever outbreak that has affected more
than 200 people in Cilacap regency, Central Java over the last 5 months.
"The rate of infection is higher than [last] year [2006]. [when] only
one patient died, and 37 people were affected," Mariah Chilfati, head
of the communicable disease prevention unit at the Cilacap Health
Office, said Wednesday [9 May 2007].
Mariah blamed the severity of this year's [2007] outbreak on the
number of rain-filled potholes in the regency, which provide an ideal
breeding ground for mosquitoes. She said authorities had ordered a
massive fumigation campaign across the regency to halt the spread of
the disease.
"Fumigation has been carried out over the last 2 months. We
immediately send a team to fumigate the moment we receive a report of
new dengue patients."

[Until _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites are reduced, fumigation to kill
adult mosquitoes will provide only limited long-term control of the
vector. ProMED thanks Brent Barrett for sending in the same report.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) has revealed worrying trends
about dengue. For the 1st 4 months of this year [2007], the number of
dengue hot spots has reached 96. This is double what was recorded
over the same period last year [2006].
NEA is concerned about this and wants the public to do more to bring
down the rising numbers. In April 2007, some 15 000 mosquito larvae
were found in homes, a 3-fold jump compared to about 4600 found in
February 2007.
Some 400 homes were found to be fertile breeding grounds in April
2007, more than twice the number recorded in February 2007, when
about 140 homes were identified as mosquito breeding sites. It is not
even mid May, and already, there are over 1300 (1308) cases of dengue
[as of 5 May 2007].
This is high, considering that the total number of cases reported for
the whole of last year [2006] was about 3120, the lowest since 2004.
That year, the number of dengue cases was 9459, while in 2005, some
14 209 cases were recorded. NEA added that the number of weekly cases
is also going up.
Satish Appoo, Director, National Health Department, National
Environment Agency said: "Perhaps our success last year [2006] to
keep the cases low could have lulled the residents into a sense of
complacency, but I think we should very quickly snap out of this
slumber and get into action and make sure that there is no place in
the homes for mosquitoes to breed. What we would like residents and
others to do is to take immediate action to reduce breeding in their homes."
So the NEA has started the 2nd part of what it calls its "Intensified
Source Reduction Exercise," in which officers will target homes in 44
areas which are prone to outbreaks. The 1st part of the exercise,
which targets common areas outside HDB flats, showed an improvement
in the number of breeding habitats found outside homes.
The NEA, however, has urged homeowners not to wait until its officers
come knocking on their doors before they take action. It says that
home owners should remain vigilant at all times and get rid of
stagnant water in common breeding areas such as flower pots and pails.
As of 8 May 2007, 25 dengue clusters -- places where there are active
dengue transmissions -- have been recorded. The largest clusters are
at Jalan Songket / Hougang St 21, with 19 cases reported so far, and
Balestier Road / Martaban Road, with 9 cases.

[ProMED will be interested in updates on the progress of the source
reduction program. In the past, Singapore has had success in reducing
mosquito vector breeding sites through community action. The
situation reported here illustrates the difficulty in maintaining
community vigilance and action to reduce breeding sites in the
absence of a dengue outbreak. One hopes that the current effort is successful.

Health officials in the Cook Islands are confident that an outbreak
of dengue, which has affected over 700 people, is on the decline.
A medical officer, Dr. Henry Tikaka, says health officials are
confident the worst is over. "For the month of April [2007], [there]
has been a dramatic fall in [the] number of cases. We can see that
[the] cases [at] the moment are really sporadic cases, so we really
hope that the trend will go right down and then disappear completely."
Heavy rain in the region since the beginning of the year [2007] has
increased the number of mosquito breeding grounds and is thought to
be the main reason for the increase in the infection rate.

[The approximately 700 dengue cases represent a relatively high
proportion of the 21 388 (July 2006 estimate) population of the Cook Islands.

The WHO (World Health Organization) describes dengue fever as a
severe, flu-like illness that affects infants, young children, and
adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical features of dengue fever
vary according to the age of the patient. Infants and young children
may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash (although some
infants and very young children may develop shock syndrome, with
sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and
adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical
incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe
headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] is a potentially deadly complication
that is characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often
with enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory
failure. The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in
temperature accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific
constitutional symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues
for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly
with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF
cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In
severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after
a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical
state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no
specific treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical
management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the
lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy,
mortality may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue at:
