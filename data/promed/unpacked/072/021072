Two people died while 6 are in critical condition following suspected food poisoning in Elmaine village, Ilchamus, in Baringo South on Friday evening [13 Dec 2019].

A total of 17 people, who were working in a farm in the Baringo South village, were rushed to Baringo County Referral Hospital after complaining of stomach pains and vomiting, after taking a meal.

Baringo County health executive Mary Panga told Nation the 2 succumbed while undergoing treatment at the hospital. "We are managing this situation to ensure the victims are stabilised," Dr. Panga said.

Preliminary reports had indicated the poisoning might have been from aflatoxin in the githeri meal they ate. She said the police are investigating the incident.

Baringo County commissioner Henry Wafula on Friday [13 Dec 2019] evening said the food samples had been taken to the government chemist for further tests.

"We are treating this as a police case, as the victims were in good health before they ate the meal. We have commenced investigation to establish what happened," said the administrator.

[Githeri, also called muthere or mutheri, is a Kenyan traditional meal of maize and legumes, mostly beans of any type mixed and boiled together [1]. The maize and beans are mixed together in a sufuria or pot; water is then added, and the mixture boiled until the food is cooked and ready to eat [2]. It was and still is the staple food of the Gikuyu, Meru, and Embu people in the Central province of Kenya, but it is also eaten in other parts of the country. Githeri is also popular among the Kamba people of Eastern province of Kenya [1]. The beans and maize can either be fresh or dry. Most people prefer the fresh ingredients because of the taste. It is easy to access because maize and beans are readily available in these areas since they are mostly obtained from the farm.

Githeri is eaten as a maize-and-bean mixture (murugarugio, or one-by-one). It can also be made into a stew with the addition of vegetables, meat, and potatoes. Githeri is also used to make mukimo after the addition of potatoes, bananas, and greens and mashing up the mixture. Lately there has been an upsurge in the consumption of githeri due to the health benefits associated with the dish. Secondary schools are also credited with the popularization of this dish because it is the main meal served to students since the 1920s. Eating githeri has also become trendy with young people. Many hotels in Kenya also serve githeri [1].

Aflatoxin is not always noted for such a quick death. The levels must have been really high if the poison was aflatoxin. We are not told what kind of treatment these individuals were receiving.

Unfortunately, unlike some of the temporary signs and symptoms of food poisoning stemming from a run-of-the-mill virus, aflatoxin is extremely poisonous in the short and long term, and the symptoms of aflatoxicosis can last.

Aflatoxins can cause
- Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain;
- Convulsions;
- Pulmonary edema, which is fluid buildup (edema) in the lungs;
- Cerebral edema, which is fluid buildup in the brain;
- Blood abnormalities, such as an increased risk of bleeding out;
- Severe damage to the liver [clotting factors are made in the liver as well, so with less clotting ability the patient may be in more danger. - Mod.TG];
- Damage to the kidneys and heart; and
- Death.

Which signs and problems occur all depends on the level of exposure. If someone consumes a lot of the toxins all at once, the person will likely experience the aforementioned signs, especially if the person is a child or is pregnant, old, or already sick with something else. If someone eats only very small quantities but over a very long period of time, the person may not feel any immediate ill effects but over the long run may get liver cancer.

There is also the possibility that someone inhaling mold particles contaminated with aflatoxin over a long period of time, such as workers handling lots of grain products as part of a job, will get lung cancer. In fact, aflatoxins are considered to be one of the most potent natural carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) known to us.

"Aflatoxins are toxic metabolites produced by certain fungi in/on foods and feeds. They are probably the best known and most intensively researched mycotoxins in the world. Aflatoxins have been associated with various diseases, such as aflatoxicosis, in livestock, domestic animals, and humans throughout the world. The occurrence of aflatoxins is influenced by certain environmental factors; hence the extent of contamination will vary with geographic location, agricultural and agronomic practices, and the susceptibility of commodities to fungal invasion during preharvest, storage, and/or processing periods. Aflatoxins have received greater attention than any other mycotoxins because of their demonstrated potent carcinogenic effect in susceptible laboratory animals and their acute toxicological effects in humans. As it is realized that absolute safety is never achieved, many countries have attempted to limit exposure to aflatoxins by imposing regulatory limits on commodities intended for use as food and feed.

"Fungal growth and aflatoxin contamination are the consequence of interactions among the fungus, the host, and the environment. The appropriate combination of these factors determines the infestation and colonization of the substrate and the type and amount of aflatoxin produced. However, a suitable substrate is required for fungal growth and subsequent toxin production, although the precise factor(s) that initiates toxin formation is not well understood. Water stress, high-temperature stress, and insect damage of the host plant are major determining factors in mold infestation and toxin production. Similarly, specific crop growth stages, poor fertility, high crop densities, and weed competition have been associated with increased mold growth and toxin production. Aflatoxin formation is also affected by associated growth of other molds or microbes. For example, preharvest aflatoxin contamination of peanuts and corn is favored by high temperatures, prolonged drought conditions, and high insect activity, while postharvest production of aflatoxins on corn and peanuts is favored by warm temperatures and high humidity.

"Humans are exposed to aflatoxins by consuming foods contaminated with products of fungal growth. Such exposure is difficult to avoid because fungal growth in foods is not easy to prevent. Even though heavily contaminated food supplies are not permitted in the marketplace in developed countries, concern still remains for the possible adverse effects resulting from long-term exposure to low levels of aflatoxins in the food supply.

"Evidence of acute aflatoxicosis in humans has been reported from many parts of the world, namely the 3rd-world countries such as Taiwan, Uganda, India, and many others. The syndrome is characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, pulmonary edema, convulsions, coma, and death with cerebral edema and fatty involvement of the liver, kidneys, and heart.

"Conditions increasing the likelihood of acute aflatoxicosis in humans include limited availability of food, environmental conditions that favor fungal development in crops and commodities, and lack of regulatory systems for aflatoxin monitoring and control.

"Because aflatoxins, especially aflatoxin B1, are potent carcinogens in some animals, there is interest in the effects of long-term exposure to low levels of these important mycotoxins on humans. In 1988, the IARC placed aflatoxin B1 on the list of human carcinogens. This is supported by a number of epidemiological studies done in Asia and Africa that have demonstrated a positive association between dietary aflatoxins and liver cell cancer (LCC). Additionally, the expression of aflatoxin-related diseases in humans may be influenced by factors such as age, sex, nutritional status, and/or concurrent exposure to other causative agents such as viral hepatitis (HBV) or parasite infestation.

"The economic impact of aflatoxins derives directly from crop and livestock losses as well as indirectly from the cost of regulatory programs designed to reduce risks to animal and human health. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 25% of the world's food crops are affected by mycotoxins, of which the most notorious are aflatoxins. Aflatoxin losses to livestock and poultry producers from aflatoxin-contaminated feeds include death and the more subtle effects of immune-system suppression, reduced growth rates, and losses in feed efficiency. Other adverse economic effects of aflatoxins include lower yields for food and fiber crops.

"In addition, the ability of aflatoxins to cause cancer and related diseases in humans given their seemingly unavoidable occurrence in foods and feeds make the prevention and detoxification of these mycotoxins one of the most challenging toxicology issues of present time." http://poisonousplants.ansci.cornell.edu/toxicagents/aflatoxin/aflatoxin.html.

Aflatoxins are a huge challenge in developing countries as they affect crops, animals, and people, and people and animals consuming the crops or drinking milk from affected animals. It should be noted that this is not the 1st time Kenya has experienced this situation from aflatoxin. We hope the authorities are able to track down and remove the contaminated product and render appropriate medical care for the affected individuals. - Mod.TG
