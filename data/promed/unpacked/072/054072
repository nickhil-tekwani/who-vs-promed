As of Fri 4 Aug 2006, 9 people from 2 related native families from the
Tzotzil ethnic group died after a family gathering where they ate poisonous
mushrooms of the _Amanita virosa_ and/or _Amanita verna_ [either of these
may be commonly known as death cap or destroying angel] species.
A 10th person, an 8 year old boy, remains in hospital in a serious
condition in the Tuxla Gutierrez Pediatric Hospital.
The deceased included a 5 year old girl, her mother and father; the brother
and sister-in-law of the father with their 3 year old daughter and their
older children aged 4, 10, and 12 years. The 8 year old boy that remains
hospitalized is a member of to the first family. Both families were
residents from the community of Cototle, municipality of Tenejapa, in the
State of Chiapas.
A relative of the deceased said that they had bought the mushrooms in the
local market, and eaten them last Saturday (30 Jul 2006). On Sunday some of
the children and adults started with symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, high
fever, nose bleeding, convulsions, and unresponsiveness. On Monday morning
they presented to the local hospital San Cristobal de las Casas where some
of them were admitted. The second couple with their 3 year old daughter
refused admission to the hospital and returned to their community, where
they later died.
The local and regional health authorities have began a public health alert
and social promotion campaign, centered in the Altos de Chiapas area, to
educate the public and request they abstain from collecting, selling, and
eating wild mushrooms. This is especially important since some toxic
species, including _Amanita virosa_, resemble edible varieties known
locally as "yuyo", and used in traditional dishes to complement the local
diet due to its high protein content.
This is the rainy season in the area with an increase in the consumption of
wild mushrooms by the native peoples of the region. In July 2005 at least
16 people suffered intoxication and 8 died from the Zapatista communities
of Polho, Chenalho, San Andres Larrainzar, and San Juan Chamula, all in the
Altos de Chiapas area. The Mexican authorities then prohibited the
consumption of wild mushrooms and seized over 100 kilograms of mushrooms
for sale in markets and public places.
_Amanita virosa_ is a 5-10 cm white-capped mushroom; it grows in humid
forests of deciduous or coniferous trees in the summer and fall. Its most
potent toxins include faloidine and amatoxines. The toxic symptoms after
ingestion are dose-dependent and begin after a latency of 6-30 hours. They
include an acute phase with profuse choleriform diarrhea, vomiting,
dehydration, and metabolic acidosis. After this acute stage, around the 3rd
day, the patient develops hepatotoxic features due to acute and massive
hepatic necrosis, including icterus, hypoglycemia, bleeding, hepatic
encephalopathy, convulsions, coma, and death.

[Amanitin poisoning is likely to be a very bad experience. The toxin is
contained in all parts of the mushroom. With the exception of a few
squirrels or rabbits, this mushroom is not consumed by wildlife, yet it
looks like the edible varieties.
The toxin contains cyclic amines, which is probably why the intoxication is
diagnosed late, treatment is delayed, and death ensues. The patient may be
in severe distress for as long as 10 days. The hepatic and renal systems
are most severely affected. As these systems shut down, the circulatory and
cardiac systems are affected, and the body as a whole shuts down and the
patient dies. Unfortunately, there is no recognized antidote. Early
supportive care may be beneficial, but it must occur early in the
intoxication to prevent the toxin from being fatal. - Mod.TG]
