Union International Food Co. of Union City, California, is recalling
15-pound and smaller size packages of the Lian How brand spices [a
complete list of the products and sizes can be found at the original
URL - Mod.LL]) and Uncle Chen brand white pepper and black pepper
(whole and ground) in 5-ounce retail containers, because it has the
potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_.

Officials investigating a multi-state salmonellosis outbreak isolated
the organism from an open container of Lian How White Pepper, which
was found at a restaurant where some outbreak victims ate.

The Lian How brand spices are distributed in the states of
California, Oregon and Washington to wholesalers, distributors,
restaurant suppliers and restaurants. The Lian How brand products are
packaged in 10- or 15-pound boxes with plastic liners, 5-pound
plastic jars or 5-pound plastic bags (and 2.2-pound foil bags of
Wasabi powder). The Lian How brand products are not generally sold
directly to the retail consumer. The Uncle Chen brand white and black
pepper products (whole or ground) are sold at retail in 5-ounce
containers. Only the products on the attached list are included in this recall.

Union International Foods Company has ceased the production and
distribution of these products as the FDA, California Department of
Public Health and Union International Foods Co. continue the
investigation as to nature and full extent of this potential contamination.

[It is not specifically stated that the specific serotype and
genotype affecting patients were isolated from the spices. It is most
likely that transmission occurred from the spices (such as salt and
pepper) that are added to food after it is cooked. - Mod.LL]

Sonoma County health officials are urging consumers to avoid spices
manufactured by the Union City food company tied to an outbreak of an
unusual type of salmonellosis. 2 elderly women from Sonoma County are
among the 42 people in 4 states who have become ill from _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Rissen, said Mary Maddux-Gonzalez, Sonoma County
health officer.

The products linked to the outbreak, white and black pepper, are made
by Union International Food Co. and are packaged under the Lian How
brand name, according to a statement released by the California
Department of Public Health. Of the 42 cases, 33 have been reported
in Northern and Central California. No deaths have been reported.

Maddux-Gonzalez said one of the elderly women became ill last
September 2008 and the 2nd woman fell ill earlier this month [March
2008]. Both women also had "other medical conditions," she said.

Every year, an average of 47 cases of salmonella are reported in the
county. So far in 2009, 16 cases have been reported, she said. But it
was the rare nature of _S._ Rissen that likely raised flags among
state and federal health officials, she said.

Incidents of salmonella illness are reported by the county to the
state, which in turn reports them to federal health officials. State
officials said most of the people involved in the unusual outbreak
had eaten at Asian restaurants that were using black and/or white
pepper purchased from Union International Food Co.
