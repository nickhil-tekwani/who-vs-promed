Description of affected population: the infected animal has been determined
to be a Charolais cow 81 months of age, born on 21 Mar 1998 on the same
premises. There are 110 cows on the premises, 25 of which are from the
birth cohort. Additional birth cohorts have been traced to 7 other premises.

3.Laboratories where diagnosis was made
National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD)
Winnipeg, Manitoba
Diagnostic tests used: immunohistochemical test
Date: 11 Jan 2005
Results: positive
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures:
A. Undertaken: quarantine.
B. To be undertaken: stamping out.
Treatment of affected animal: no.
Other details/comments:
Plans are under way for evaluation, depopulation, sampling and testing
during the week of 17-21 Jan 2005.
The infected animal was born on 21 Mar 1998. It is suspected that the
animal most likely became infected through the consumption of contaminated
feed at an early age.
No part of the animal entered the human or animal food systems. The
affected carcass was placed under quarantine before being transported to a
federal laboratory for incineration. A comprehensive epidemiological
investigation is under way.
In accordance with Article 2.3.13.5. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code,
the progeny born to the infected animal within the previous 2 years and the
birth cohort of the positive animal (animals born between 1 Jan 1997 and 31
Dec 1999 and which may have been exposed to the same feed sources) are
being traced. All such animals remaining alive will be detained, their
movements controlled and, when slaughtered, they will be sampled for
testing and completely destroyed.
Of the 349 animals from the birth cohort of the positive animal, 28 died at
birth, 162 were sold as calves, 43 were sold as yearling bulls, 91 are
currently being traced and 25 are alive on the premises. These 25 animals
remain under quarantine on the farm.
In parallel a thorough investigation of feed sources on the farm is under way.
(1) TSE: transmissible spongiform encephalopathy
(2) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

[A 2nd case adds a dimension to the outbreak. As mentioned in the postings
referenced below, we do not expect a large number of cases, even under the
intensive scrutiny presently applied to follow up the first case. However,
a 2nd case obviously raises the ante in terms of the potential impact of
this outbreak. - Mod.PC]
