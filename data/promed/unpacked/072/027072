Systemic anthrax in an injecting drug user: Oslo, Norway April 2000
---------------------------------------------------------
A man who had injected drugs long term died from systemic anthrax in Oslo,
Norway, in early April 2000 (1,2). He first developed a soft tissue lesion
in his buttocks. This was suspected to be an abscess, but no pus was
detected after incision. Two days later he was found comatose, suspected to
have taken an overdose, and admitted to hospital.
He did not respond to treatment with an opiate antagonist. Abundant Gram
positive rods were detected in his cerebrospinal fluid. He died three days
later from a haemorrhagic meningoencephalitis despite treatment with high
dose penicillin. The isolate was confirmed by standard microbiological
methods to be _Bacillus anthracis_ - it was non-haemolytic, non-motile, and
capsulated after growth in defibrinated horse blood and on 0.7% bicarbonate
agar (3). Since then, we have confirmed the diagnosis by finding the
isolate to be positive for the lethal factor gene (lef) and the protective
antigen precursor gene (pag) from the pX01 plasmid and the capsular gene
(capA) located on plasmid pX02 (4,53) by polymerase chain reaction.
Anthrax occurs rarely and sporadically in animals in Norway. The last two
sporadic cases were in cattle in 1990 and 1993. Norway has a human
population of 4.45 million; the last human case of anthrax was an
insignificant skin infection in a veterinarian in 1967.
We suspect that the infecting bacteria in the recent fatal case may have
come from contaminated heroin. If this is true further cases may occur in
Norway and elsewhere. The dose needed to cause symptoms and signs of
anthrax may depend on whether the inoculum is injected intravenously or
into soft tissue. If a small number of viable spores are unevenly
distributed in the substance to be injected, and hosts have varying
abilities to fight infection, disease may only rarely occur. The origin of
the suspected drug is unknown, but further investigations are under way.
