Polio has been detected in New York City wastewater, suggesting that the virus that causes the disease is probably circulating in the city, the health authorities said on Friday [12 Aug 2022].

The announcement came 3 weeks after a man in Rockland County, N.Y., north of the city, was diagnosed with polio that left him with paralysis. Health officials fear that the detection of polio in New York City's wastewater could precede other cases of paralytic polio.

The spread of the virus poses a risk to unvaccinated people, but a 3-dose course of the vaccine provides at least 99% protection.

Most adults in the United States were vaccinated against polio as children. In New York City, the overall rate of polio vaccination among children 5 and under is 86%. Still, in some city ZIP codes, fewer than 2/3 of children in that group have received a full regimen, a figure that worries health officials. (The citywide vaccination rate dipped amid the pandemic, as visits to pediatricians were postponed.)

Although many people who become infected with polio do not develop symptoms, about 4% will get viral meningitis and about 1 in 200 will become paralyzed, according to the health authorities. Parents of children who have not yet been fully vaccinated should see that they do immediately, officials said.

"The risk to New Yorkers is real but the defense is so simple -- get vaccinated against polio," Dr. Ashwin Vasan, the New York City health commissioner, said in a statement. "With polio circulating in our communities, there is simply nothing more essential than vaccinating our children to protect them from this virus, and if you're an unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adult, please choose now to get the vaccine."

"Polio is entirely preventable and its reappearance should be a call to action for all of us," he added.

While the polio virus had previously been detected in wastewater samples in Rockland and neighboring Orange Counties, the announcement on Friday [12 Aug 2022] was the 1st sign it had been found in New York City.

The city's health department did not provide details about where exactly in the 5 boroughs polio had been found in the wastewater, nor did officials provide dates for when the virus was detected or say how many samples had tested positive.

The last case of polio to be found in the United States before the one in Rockland County was in 2013. Before the introduction of vaccines, the virus was a source of dread, especially during summer months, when the potential for it to spread tended to peak. In those days, preventive steps included closing public swimming pools, and asking that parents keep their children indoors.

In 1916, polio killed 6000 people in the United States and left at least another 21 000 -- most of them children -- with some permanent disability. New York City, and Brooklyn in particular, were hit hard. An outbreak in 1952 caused paralysis in more than 20 000 people, and left many children enclosed in iron lungs. The 1st effective vaccine emerged just a few years later, and the virus began to recede.

Today, polio is endemic in only 2 countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and has been kept at bay elsewhere through the wide use of vaccines.

New York state health authorities announced Friday [12 Aug 2022] that polioviruses have been found in wastewater from New York City, further widening the range of areas in the state at risk of seeing polio cases.

It's unclear if the viruses found in New York City are genetically linked to those that are circulating in Orange and Rockland counties, to the north of Manhattan. In July [2022], state authorities announced the detection of the country's 1st paralytic polio case in nearly a decade, a man in his 20s from Rockland County.

"The NYC samples didn't contain enough genetic material to determine if they were linked to the case patient," a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told STAT by email.

It's possible the viruses are linked, suggesting some neighborhoods of New York are now part of a transmission network linked to Rockland and Orange counties.

"I think we don't know for sure that they're not linked in some sort of way to the Rockland County stuff. It's not linked yet," said Kim Thompson, a polio expert who is director of the not-for-profit organization Kid Risk.

Or the New York City detections could be a new importation or importations of vaccine viruses from other parts of the world.

"We live in a global society, and despite our high national vaccination coverage, it only takes only 1 traveler with polio to bring the disease into the U.S.," Jos√© Romero, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a statement.

Linked or unlinked, the presence of vaccine-derived viruses in sewage samples signals that there is transmission of polio in parts of New York City and in the 2 counties north of it, which means unvaccinated children or adults are at risk of being infected and potentially becoming paralyzed.

Most people who are infected with polio do not develop symptoms. But for the unlucky few -- estimated to be between 1 and 5 people out of 1000 infected -- neurological symptoms will occur, including meningitis or paralysis.

"Polio is not gone, in spite of the fact that we've been able to enjoy not seeing a lot of transmission for the past couple of decades," said Thompson. "But it's still around and it's still a risk and those who are unvaccinated are rolling the dice in terms of whether or not they might become infected and might become paralyzed."

A total of 6 positive sewage samples were collected in June and July [2022] in New York City. The state health department did not indicate in which part of the city the positive wastewater samples were drawn and its press office had not replied to questions from STAT at the time of publication.

The viruses detected in the wastewater samples were type 2 Sabin viruses, which come from oral polio vaccine. Oral polio vaccine has not been used in the United States since 2000, which means the viruses were brought into the country in the intestinal tract of someone who had received oral vaccine elsewhere in the world, or someone who had encountered the vaccine viruses elsewhere.

The U.S. uses inactivated polio vaccine. The viruses in it have been killed, so there is no risk of those vaccine viruses circulating and infecting others. Oral poliovirus vaccines use weakened forms of the virus that, if allowed to spread in a population with low immunization rates for a prolonged period of time, can regain the power to paralyze.

"The detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in New York City is alarming, but not surprising," State Health Commissioner Mary Bassett said in a statement. "Already, the State Health Department -- working with local and federal partners -- is responding urgently, continuing case investigation and aggressively assessing spread."

Bassett and New York City Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan urged people in the state who are not vaccinated to do so. "Polio is entirely preventable and its reappearance should be a call to action for all of us," Vasan said. "The risk to New Yorkers is real but the defense is so simple -- get vaccinated against polio."

In addition to the positive samples in New York City, analysis of more wastewater samples from Rockland County and adjacent Orange County revealed that the vaccine viruses have been circulating in this area at least since May [2022]. The 20 positive samples detected in the 2 counties are genetically linked to the virus that paralyzed an unidentified man in the Rockland County case.

Polio vaccination rates in Rockland and Orange Counties are dangerously low. State health department data show that in Rockland County, only 60% of children have received the recommended 3 doses of polio-containing vaccine by age 2. In Orange County, the figure is 59%.

Walter Orenstein, a polio expert at Emory University, was dismayed to hear that the viruses have been circulating in Rockland County for that long.

"If it's detected in May, June, and July [2022], that's very concerning," he said in an interview. "We don't use oral polio vaccine and to see this much detection of type 2 [vaccine-derived] virus raises concern about whether there's ongoing transmission of that in the U.S."

The fact that there is virus circulating in New York City ups the ante, Orenstein suggested, because of the size of the city's population and the potential for ongoing transmission there. He suggested the city's health department should consider doing "stool surveys" -- collecting stool specimens and checking them for polioviruses -- in parts of the city where transmission is suspected to try to figure out where and among whom polioviruses are spreading.

London kids to be offered polio shot after more virus found
-----------------------------------------------------------
Children ages 1-9 in London were made eligible for booster doses of a polio vaccine Wednesday [10 Aug 2022] after British health authorities reported finding evidence the virus has spread in multiple areas of the city but found no cases of the paralytic disease in people.

Britain's Health Security Agency said it detected viruses derived from the oral polio vaccine in the sewage water of 8 London boroughs. The agency's analysis of the virus samples suggested "transmission has gone beyond a close network of a few individuals."

The agency said it had not located anyone infected with the virus and that the risk to the wider population was low. The decision to offer young children boosters was a precaution, it said.

"This will ensure a high level of protection from paralysis and help reduce further spread," the agency said.

The agency said it is also expanding surveillance of sewage water to at least another 25 sites in London and nationally.

Most people across Britain are vaccinated against polio in childhood. According to the World Health Organization, only 1 in 200 polio infections leads to paralysis; most people don't show any symptoms.

The Health Security Agency said it was working closely with health authorities at the WHO and in the United States and Israel to investigate any links to polio viruses detected in those 2 countries.

Kathleen O'Reilly, a polio expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the polio virus circulating in London was "genetically related" to recent cases identified in the U.S. and Israel.

"Further investigation is needed to fully understand how they are connected, but it does illustrate that this virus has the potential to cause disease," O'Reilly said in a statement.

Polio is a disease often spread in water that mostly affects children under 5. It has mostly been wiped out from developed countries, but outbreaks remain in Pakistan, Afghanistan and parts of Africa.

Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, and muscle stiffness. Among people paralyzed by the disease, death can occur in up to 10% of cases when their breathing muscles become paralyzed.

In rare cases, the live virus contained in the oral polio vaccine used in the global effort to eradicate the disease can mutate into new forms potent enough to trigger new outbreaks. The vaccination booster effort in London will use injected polio vaccines that do not carry that risk.

Experts called the finding of polio spread in London "concerning" and said the virus posed a significant risk to anyone not vaccinated.

"If (polio) continues to spread, it will result in cases of paralysis," said Nicholas Grassly, a professor of vaccine epidemiology at Imperial College London. "It is therefore of paramount importance that children are up to date with their polio vaccines."

Grassly said the injectable polio vaccine was less effective against stopping virus transmission than the oral vaccine and that it was possible it might be necessary to reintroduce the oral vaccine to eliminate the virus.

All children aged 1 to 9 in London should receive a polio vaccination in the coming weeks, public health experts have said as a new booster programme is announced.

The UK Health Security Agency said that, since early February [2022], 116 polioviruses had been identified in 19 sewage samples from boroughs in north-east and central London including Barnet, Camden, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest.

Experts say it is unclear how many people may have been infected but that, to date, no cases of polio -- or related paralysis -- have been reported.

With signs of community transmission of the virus, public health officials are hoping to curb its spread, and strengthen protection against paralysis, by ensuring all young children receive a polio vaccine in the next 4 to 6 weeks.

The newly announced booster programme for children aged 1 to 9, recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), is set to run alongside a previously announced polio vaccine catchup campaign, and will begin in boroughs of London where poliovirus has been detected and vaccination rates are low.

Parents and carers are advised that the programme will be offered via GPs, and that they will be contacted when it is their child's turn to receive a vaccination.

Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said that for the majority of the population who are fully vaccinated against polio the risk was low.

"But we know the areas in London where the poliovirus is being transmitted have some of the lowest vaccination rates. This is why the virus is spreading in these communities and puts those residents not fully vaccinated at greater risk," she said.

Saliba added that while polio was a serious infection that could cause paralysis, as a result of vaccinations the last case in the UK was in 1984.

"It is vital parents ensure their children are fully vaccinated for their age. Following JCVI advice, all children aged 1 to 9 years in London need to have a dose of polio vaccine now -- whether it's an extra booster dose or just to catch up with their routine vaccinations. It will ensure a high level of protection from paralysis. This may also help stop the virus spreading further," she said.

While a small number of polioviruses are detected in sewage in the UK each year, the large number detected over recent months is unusual, and appears to reflect transmission of the virus in the community.

Public health experts said it appeared such transmission was asymptomatic, and was likely to have been caused by an individual recently vaccinated with live oral polio vaccine (OPV) entering the UK. OPV generates excellent gut immunity against polio; however, people who have been recently vaccinated can shed vaccine-like virus in their faeces.

While this weakened form of the virus does not cause illness, the concern is that if it circulates it can gain mutations that increase its virulence, resulting in vaccine-derived poliovirus -- which has the potential, albeit rare, to cause paralysis in those who are unvaccinated.

The UKHSA said that while most of the isolates from London sewage had so far involved vaccine-like poliovirus, some contain vaccine-derived poliovirus.

The UK switched from using OPV to an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in 2004. While IPV is very effective in preventing polio disease, it does not produce as good gut immunity as OPV, meaning it is possible fully vaccinated individuals could have an asymptomatic infection.

While public health officials believe that, combined with good hygiene, the IPV vaccine will be able to interrupt transmission, the Guardian understands that if this is not successful the use of OPV, which is not approved in the UK, may be considered.

In addition, sewage surveillance to track the spread of the virus is set to increase, with an additional 15 sites in London to begin sewage sampling this month [August 2022] and a similar number across England set to follow suit.

Dr Kathleen O'Reilly, an expert in polio at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said she welcomed the booster programme.

"News of the booster vaccine against polio will add extra protection to children under 10 in London where we now have considerable evidence of poliovirus circulation," she said.

"The fact that polio has been detected in sewage gives us a critical opportunity to prevent polio disease -- the sewage testing and vaccination response is a really worthwhile public health action that I hope will be highly effective."

British health authorities have announced they are working with their counterparts in Israel and the United States to trace the source of polioviruses found in sewage samples from areas in North and North East London, and are launching a vaccination campaign to boost children's immunity.

In June [2022], authorities announced that they had detected traces of a form of polio derived from a vaccine strain at a sewage treatment plant in north-east London.

Since then, the virus, eradicated in the United Kingdom in 2003, has been detected in 8 boroughs of the capital, with "genetic diversity" suggesting "virus transmission", according to the health services.

"No one has been diagnosed with the virus and the risk to the population is low," Health Minister Steve Barclay said in a statement.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), only 1 in 200 polio infections leads to paralysis; most people have no symptoms.

The British health agency said it was "working closely" with the authorities in New York, but also in Israel, to study possible links between "recent incidents" reported.

Israel's Health Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation.

Last month [July 2022], authorities in New York announced that they had detected polio in an Orthodox Jew in Rockland County, marking the 1st case of polio in the United States in nearly a decade.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative said on [28 Jul 2022] that this case was genetically linked to virus samples found in London and at the Sorek sewage treatment plant in Israel.

Officials in Rockland and Orange counties, areas north of New York with large and growing haredi populations, later said traces of the virus had been found in sewage samples.

Israel diagnosed its 1st case in decades in March [2022], in a 4-year-old child from Jerusalem. Several other asymptomatic cases were found in other children, and health officials launched a nationwide vaccination campaign that they say has raised the immunization rate to 96% among infants.

No link has been confirmed between the virus samples and the Jewish community. However, authorities in New York and the United Kingdom have noted that the virus has been found in areas with lower vaccination rates. "We know that the areas of London where poliovirus is transmitted have some of the lowest vaccination rates," said Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency. "This is where the virus spreads in these communities and it puts residents who are not fully vaccinated at greater risk.

[I've been trying to think about possible epidemiologic links where this virus may have originated, waiting for laboratory genetic studies and can't help but wonder if perhaps Ukraine might be involved. The 1 Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) case and geographic location of positive environmental samples suggest the ultra-orthodox Jewish community is involved (Rockland County, parts of NYC although the exact location(s?) within NYC have not been announced. In 2021, Ukraine identified 2 AFP cases associated with cVDPV2. There are pilgrimage sites that ultra-orthodox communities around the world visit in Uman Ukraine, the former home of a revered Rabbi known for rejuvenating the ultra-orthodox movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. (see https://sacredsites.com/europe/ukraine/sacred_sites_of_ukraine.html for a discussion and map of holy sites in Ukraine).

That being said, it appears as though the UK had circulation of the virus since February 2022, predating the USA by 2-3 months (1st circulation noted in May 2022), so travel between the UK and many countries in Africa or outside of Africa (including Pakistan and Afghanistan) where cVDPV2 outbreaks have been identified in 2021 and 2022 (see "see also" below) is a possibility. Hopefully, genetic testing will clarify the journey of the involved virus, but the major point here is that importations have occurred into countries with pockets of unvaccinated individuals and the virus(es) are being easily transmitted in these pockets.

Note, that while the case in Israel occurred in March 2022, the virus involved was officially reported as a cVDPV3 (see Poliomyelitis update (11): global cVDPV2, cVDPV3, RFI 20220311.8701925). I am now wondering if this is a 2nd event, or a further clarification of the earlier event and the virus identified.

My semantic question is with the continued identification of positive environmental samples for VDPV2 in the USA (New York state now including NYC) and other parts of London, at what point can we refer to this virus as a cVDPV2?

[Similar to the week before, this past week has been an active week for poliovirus identification. There are multiple positive WPV1 isolates from ESs in Pakistan and 1 in Afghanistan, cVDPV1 AFP case in Mozambique and positive ES in Madagascar, and cVDPV2 AFP casaes in the DR Congo and Yemen and positive ES samples in Algeria and Ghana.

This is a reminder that the presence of cVDPVs occurs when there are lower than protective vaccine coverages and a sign that if a poliovirus (be it a WPV or a VDPV) is introduced, it can easily be transmitted in the communities.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP
