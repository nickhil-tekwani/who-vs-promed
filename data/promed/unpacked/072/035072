The following important points of correction and clarification are
being provided in relation to the subject posting.

Brucellosis has NOT been detected in the 3 BC-origin cows that were
slaughtered in the US, nor in the 2 cattle herds in southern BC from
which these 3 cows originated. At this time, brucellosis is suspected
but it is NOT detected or confirmed.

The 2 slaughtered cows were classified as reactors on serological
tests for brucellosis, meaning their status is brucellosis-suspect.
The remaining serum samples from these cows (no tissue samples were
taken) have been sent to the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) reference laboratory for brucellosis which is located in the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) laboratory in Ottawa. Here,
additional laboratory investigations are being carried out on these
samples in order to further characterize the nature and cause of the
serological test results obtained in the US.

The 2 herds from which the 3 suspect cows originated are quarantined
while further investigations, including whole herd tests, are carried
out in these herds. The purpose of these investigations is to
ascertain the true infection status of these herds 'and to establish
the absence or presence of brucellosis. An essential element of these
investigations is a thorough examination of all possible routes by
which these herds could have been exposed to _Brucella abortus_,
including all trace-ins to these herds. Cattle removed from the herds
(trace-outs) are being identified.

These 2 cattle herds are located very close to one another in
southern BC and at a considerable distance from any known reservoirs
of _B. abortus_ infection; and at an even greater distance from known
reservoirs of _Brucella. suis_ infection (which could cause the
observed reactions). Canada has not practiced vaccination for
brucellosis for more than a decade; and import controls are in place
to prevent the introduction of the disease from other countries.

Although the last confirmed case of brucellosis in cattle in Canada
occurred more than 20 years ago, Canada has maintained a high level
of vigilance for this disease. Robust surveillance programs for
brucellosis have remained in place. These programs detect a small
number of brucellosis suspect reactor cattle, not unlike these three
cows, each year. Every finding of a suspect reactor under these
programs has triggered a comprehensive trace-back investigation of
all herds associated with the reactor animal, similar to the
investigations being undertaken for these three reactor cows. Since
1989, each and every one of these investigations has confirmed the
absence of brucellosis infection in these herds and in Canadian
livestock.

The investigations into these 3 suspect reactor cows are being
undertaken with the same diligence and thoroughness as is employed
for all suspect brucellosis investigations in Canada. The laboratory
tests and field investigations that are required to definitively
answer the question "has brucellosis been found in Canada?" are being
carried out as expeditiously as possible. I would be pleased to
provide an update once we have the answer.
