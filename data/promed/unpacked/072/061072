Foot and mouth disease diagnosed in the Palestinian Authority
-------------------------------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease, which affects small ruminants and cattle and
prescribes their destruction, has been diagnosed today (Wednesday) in
two sheep and goats flocks in the Ramallah district, within the areas
of the Palestinian Authority. The FMD virus was located and
identified by examinations of samples from the two flocks.
The [Israeli] veterinary services have said that they plan to supply
the PA all vaccines required to stop the disease spreading.
The veterinary services further said that all cattle, small ruminants
and pigs in Israel are routinely vaccinated against the disease. They
said that all steps required following the detection of FMD will be
taken, including swift completion of vaccinations in areas adjacent
to the infected locations. Animal movement restrictions will be
applied as required.
Foot and mouth disease affected cattle in Israel, and cattle and
small ruminants in the PA, during 1998 - 1999. The disease is
extremely infectious; should the preventive steps not be taken
swiftly, it may cause the destruction of entire flocks.

Foot and mouth disease found in two Palestinian villages
--------------------------------------------------------
Cattle from two Palestinian villages, Ein Yebrud and Der Dabwan, in
the Ramallah area were found to be infected with foot and mouth
disease, Israel Radio reported Wednesday.
Israel's veterinary service transferred vaccinations against the
disease to the Palestinian Authority to treat the infected herds and
other stock.
Cattle, sheep and goats in Israel are vaccinated against foot and
mouth, as such there is no concern of the disease spreading.

[The two sources do not mention the FMD virus type, allegedly
identified. Israel and the PA carry out, traditionally, annual mass
vaccinations in cattle and small ruminants, applying a trivalent
vaccine in cattle (serotypes A22, O, Asia 1) and a monovalent,
serotype O vaccine in small ruminants. FMD virus serotype O was the
only strain identified in Israel and the PA since 1990. Stamping out
may be considered only if the FMD strain involved is exotic to the
region or not covered by the vaccines routinely applied; thus the
phrases "prescribes their destruction" and "cause the destruction of
entire flocks", in the first item, are somewhat overstated.-Mod. AS].
