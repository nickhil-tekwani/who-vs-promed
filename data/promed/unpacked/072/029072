Bluetongue, sheep - Italy (Sardinia): OIE report 20000901.1479
Date: 26 Sep 2000
From: Manlio Fadda <manfadda@ssmain.uniss.it>

The outbreak of Bluetongue disease in Sardinia are [consists of more than
1200 cases. The measures for disease control, i.e., control of insect
vectors, control of animal movement inside the country, stamping out (on
the basis of clinical diagnosis, therefore sheep and goats) and screening,
are largely ineffective.
The main vector _Culicoides imicola_ is widely scattered on the island.
Serotype 2 appears involved. Furthermore some seropositive cattle were
found on the Lazio region. More information can be found at the specific
site of IZS: Blue Tongue or the local daily newspapers Unione Sarda
(Boolean query: lingua and blu) La Nuova Sardegna Internet.
