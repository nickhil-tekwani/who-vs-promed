Outbreak of Salmonella bongori 48:z35:- enteritis in Sicily
Introduction:
_Salmonella bongori_ 48:z35:- was first isolated from a lizard in Chad in
1966 and was classified as a biochemically atypical strain of the subgenus
I of Kauffmann (1).
Successively, some additional strains with different antigenic formulas but
similar
biochemical properties were identified and assigned to the 'bongor group'
of the genus _Salmonella_ (2). More recently, _S. bongori_ has been
established on the basis of its genetic and biochemical characteristics as
a separate salmonella species (3).
_S. bongori_ appears to be rare worldwide (4). Strains of such salmonella
species have been infrequently isolated in different countries, mainly from
cold blooded animals. Human cases of infection are rare (4,5). _S. bongori_
48:z35:- has only appeared in the Enter-net database as a cause of human
enteritis in Sicily.
Eighteen strains of _S. bongori_ 48:z35:- were identified in Sicily between
1984 and
1997. Eight were isolated in Messina between October 1984 and May 1985 from
cases
of enteritis in children aged 0 to 3 years (6). Two strains were isolated
from pigeon
faeces in Messina and in Palermo in the same period of time; the remaining
eight
isolates were identified in Palermo, Messina, and Catania between 1987 and
1997 from
children under 3 years of age with infections that appeared to be sporadic
(7).
Between July and October 1998 S. bongori 48:z35:- was isolated from seven
cases of
acute enteritis in babies aged 1 to 13 months. They lived in the provinces
of Agrigento and Palermo in western Sicily. All were admitted to the
paediatric hospital 'G. Di Cristina' in Palermo with severe diarrhoea and
fever. A further unconfirmed case was in the twin brother of one of the
confirmed cases. In June 1998 two further strains of _S. bongori_ 48:z35:-
were isolated from two sewerage plants in the province of Ragusa in eastern
Sicily.
The purpose of this study was to identify probable sources and vehicles of
transmission and to look for possible associations with the isolates
previously
identified in Sicily.
Methods:
Characterisation of the strains was performed at the Southern Italy Centre
for Enteric Pathogens (CEPIM, Centro per gli Enterbatteri Patogeni
dell'Italia Meridionale, Palermo). Biochemical properties of the salmonella
strains were determined by commercial tests (API 20E, BioMerieux, La
Balme-les-Grottes, France). Antigenic formulas were determined by slide
agglutination with commercial antisera (Diagnostics Pasteur, France).
Ribotyping was carried out after digestion of DNA with HincII restriction
endonuclease (8).
In December 1998, an epidemiological investigation was performed in an
attempt to
identify possible mechanisms of transmission. Telephone interviews were
conducted
with the parents of cases and of all children aged under 13 months admitted
to the G.
Di Cristina hospital from May to October 1998 with enteritis caused by
serovars of
salmonella other than _S. bongori_ 48:z35:- (excluding Typhi and Paratyphi
A and C). A standardised questionnaire was used to collect data on
demographic characteristics,
parental occupation, house type and setting (urban or rural), day-care or
nursery
school attendance, pets at home, and feeding practices, including past or
current
breastfeeding. Parents were also asked about enteric symptoms among household
contacts before or at the same time as the child became ill.
Results:
All strains were identified as _S. bongori_ 48:z35:-. HincII ribotyping of
the 1998 isolates showed identical patterns to those of the strains
previously identified from pigeons and from the cases of enteritis in
Messina in 1984 and 1985 (6,7).
Fifteen subjects with non-Bongori enteritis were identified and compared
with the seven cases with _S. bongori_ enteritis. The two groups were
similar in sociodemographical characteristics and day-care or nursery
school attendance. One case of _S. bongori_ enteritis and none of the other
cases had a pet at home. Three of the seven cases with _S. bongori_
enteritis and 11 of the 15 cases with other-serovar enteritis were weaned.
This was consistent with the age distribution of the two groups: four of
the seven and four of the 15, respectively, were aged under six months.
Within these last unweaned infants, three different brands of infant
formula were shared by both groups. No commercial or home-made food was
preferentially consumed by the _S. bongori_ enteritis cases. Only one
contact with symptoms was identified among cases of _S. bongori_ enteritis,
he was a twin brother of a case. In the other group two foodborne outbreaks
within the household had occurred.
Discussion:
This study confirms that the circulation of _S. bongori_ 48:z35:- persists
in our
geographical area, but the prevalence remains low (4). _S. bongori_
48:z35:- has been
very infrequently identified by the passive surveillance system on enteric
pathogens.
However, since 1984 this serovar of salmonella has proved to be the
causative agent of two small outbreaks and a limited number of apparently
sporadic cases of serious
enteritis in childhood. Moreover, isolation from pigeons in 1984 and, more
recently,
from two sewage plants support the hypothesis of a persistent endemic
circulation of
this microrganism in our region. Such a finding is so far an
epidemiological peculiarity of Sicily.
It is noteworthy that these latest human cases have occurred exclusively in
children
aged 1 to 13 months, following a previously observed distinctive feature of
this serovar (4,6,7). Unfortunately, epidemiological investigations of
these cases did not contribute to the identification of sources and routes
of infection, nor a putative animal reservoir, but the age of these cases
is more consistent with person to person transmission.
Monitoring of spread of _S. bongori_ 48:z35:- needs to be continued in our
geographical area. Further investigations are to be performed to look for
animal reservoirs in urban settings and to understand the peculiar
epidemiological features of this _Salmonella_ species, such as the
apparently exclusive endemic presence in Sicily and why it seems pathogenic
only in early childhood.
