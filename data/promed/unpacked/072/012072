[1] Cholera - Malawi (Chikwawa District)

The cholera outbreak continues to wreck havoc in Chikwawa district with reports from the district's health office indicating that the number of cases has increased to 281 from 239 the previous week. 3 lives have so far been lost. Initially, the outbreak affected people from areas of Ngabu, Lundu, Ngowe, Kasisi and Chapananga. But fresh reports indicate it has also hit areas of Chiefs Katunga and Makhuwira.

According to the District Environmental Health Officer Thomson Kajombo, there is need for speedy interventions to contain the outbreak.

"We have received and treated 6 new cases from Chipwaila, Makhuwira and Gumbwa under chief Kasisi. We are intending to do door-to-door sensitization activities in order to urgently stop the further spread of the cholera outbreak," he said.

Other organizations like Medecins Sans Frontieres, UNICEF and WHO are also supporting health authorities to contain the outbreak. Meanwhile, MSF has constructed an additional cholera unit at the district hospital to speed up the treatment process.

Recently, nongovernmental organizations asked health authorities to establish stringent measures to ensure that the outbreak does not hit camps of flood survivors.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi County)

4 more people have died and nearly 100 hospitalized following the cholera outbreak in Kibera slum, Nairobi. 1 person found dead at Muthurwa market on Friday, 8 May 2015, had symptoms of acute diarrhoea and dehydration, St John Ambulance said. "Overpopulated areas with poor drainage and sanitation such as Mathare, Kibera, and Eastleigh are the most affected," Communications director Fred Majiwa said in a statement.

Majiwa said heavy rains and flash floods in Nairobi and its environs have promoted the spread of the disease. He urged patients to drink plenty of lightly salted water to replace lost fluids and seek treatment. "Cholera is highly treatable but can cause death quickly due to acute dehydration," he said.

4 others from Kibera died at Mbagathi District Hospital on Tue, 5 May 2015.

"Poor drainage and sewerage systems, dirty water and food are the main causes of this outbreak," said the hospital's CEO Andrew Suleh.

Suleh said some patients are sharing beds and that they may be forced to set up tents in the compound to accommodate the rising number. "We have only 4 wards here and each ward has 6 beds. This means we can only accommodate 24 patients at a time," he said.

Governor Evans Kidero said health workers were on high alert and asked residents to observe good standards of food hygiene.

[3] Cholera - Kenya (Nyeri County)

Nyeri County Public Health department has issued an alert over a possible outbreak of cholera, which has already been reported in neighboring counties of Murang'a and Kirinyaga. School heads have been asked to remind pupils to wash their hands with water and soap in order to keep away the disease.

In a circular to schools, the County Director of Medical Services Dr. Nelson Mburu urged schools heads to control hawking of foodstuffs around their schools. Mburu called for reporting of any cases of unusual diarrhea, while medical workers have also been put on alert to look out for symptoms of the disease.

"Patients presenting with profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, circulatory collapse and shock should be treated as suspect and reported to the county health team as quickly as possible," said the doctor.

[Nyeri County is in central Kenya and can be found on a map at: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyeri_County#/media/File:Nyeri_County_location_map.png. The town of Nyeri is a 2.5-hour auto ride north of Nairobi.

Mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluids and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2015 (in press):

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that it was found that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in refugees from war-torn Bangladesh, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally based on glucose or rice powder, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose- or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
