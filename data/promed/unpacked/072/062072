[The 13 new confirmed and 4209 suspected cases (up from 4099 suspected cases in the report of week ending 13 Oct 2019 indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing. Nigeria should be in the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3 (at the source URL above), but more cases are still occurring. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again next year (2020).

The number of confirmed deaths is increased by 2 at 156 over week 41 (6-13 Oct 2019) reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 19, a likely indication that effective barrier nursing and the use of personal protective equipment are being employed. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 23 states, and the number of affected LGAs remains at 86. ProMED-mail readers may wish to see the maps and graphs (Figures 1-6) that are available at the source URL above.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/

There is no mention in the plans above of public education for avoidance of contact with these rodents and their excreta. - Mod.TY
