Clinical experience with rabies in the Philippines
--------------------------------------------------
I read with interest Dr. Sasaki's questions. I may have some insights as I
have just come back from a month there researching clinical cases of human
rabies (I am a medical resident at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in
Philadelphia with an interest in Tropical Medicine).
The Filipino people are quite aware of their rabies problem, after all, it
ranks as third in the world (on a per population basis) for incidence of
rabies cases. They have on the order of 400 to 500 reported cases [of
human rabies per year.
About one-third of those cases are treated at San Lazaro Hospital in
Manila, where I did most of my research. Obviously, people with symptoms
are just treated supportively - IV fluids and some sedation. The families
of these patients are sufficiently scared into receiving prophylaxis, which
costs about 60$ (U.S.) for the series of 5 shots (mostly purified duck
embryo vaccine is used or the vero vaccine). I have not seen the human
diploid cell vaccine used - it is too expensive. They also receive equine
anti-rabies immune globulin after undergoing skin testing [presumably for
allergy to equine proteins - Mod.ES.
San Lazaro also serves as an animal bite treatment center, with about 200
patients a day, presenting for treatment of animal bites. A lot of the
bite victims are children, since they are the ones playing with the dogs in
the streets. About 98 percent of rabies cases there come from dogs, with
about 2 percent from cats.
There was 1 case of a rat with rabies biting someone which created some
sensation over there as it is an extremely uncommon vector. There were no
cases of bat induced rabies at all. Patients come from all over the main
island of Luzon as well as the surrounding provinces/rural areas, because
San Lazaro is nationally known. Indeed, even villagers I met in the rural
areas had heard of San Lazaro. I was informed by the local experts there
that about 10 percent of all dog bites in the Philippines are from rabid
dogs.
Fortunately (or unfortunately as the case may be) only about 50 percent of
rabies infected bites progress to clinical rabies without treatment. WHO
estimates that more than 90 percent of cases can be prevented merely by
washing vigorously with soap and water. The Filipino people are pursuing a
program of education and have the intention of wiping out rabies from their
7100+ islands by 2020.
They are doing it on an island by island basis by vaccinating dogs and
mandating leash laws. 2005 is their target date for their first island.
Also, San Lazaro which is a government hospital has produced a video called
"Rabies Kills" with the help of a grant from the Japanese government. This
documentary broadcast nationally on Filipino TV and led to a dramatic
increase in the consultation rate at San Lazaro. [This is definitely a
good thing since the incubation times for rabies can range up to 19 years
post - exposure (see Mandel - Principles of Infectious Diseases).
Patients presenting to San Lazaro with dog bites are screened as to when
the bite took place, where on the body the wounds were inflicted, what
specific area of the Philippines the attack took place, what was the
condition of the animal (was it acting strangely, or worse did it die), and
whether the attack was provoked or unprovoked. The timing and location of
the bite or injuries are important as it has to do with delivery of virus
to the nervous system - closer to the head/CNS and more highly innervated
organs (i.e. the hand) are of greater urgency in receiving appropriate
treatment than more distal or less innervated sites (i.e. the foot).
Unprovoked attacks and sick or dead dogs are more worrisome. Also, within
certain areas of the Philippines there are pockets of high disease
prevalence in the dog populations - a clue for clinicians. The doctors
there make the diagnosis of rabies based on the history and physical
including signs of hydrophobia and aerophobia (fear of water and wind
respectively). Of the dozen patients with rabies that I saw, no one
survived more than 24 hours after the onset of hydrophobia. It really is a
terrible disease.
San Lazaro also has an animal brain processing lab on their campus, so you
can bring your dog, terminate it and look for yourself at direct
fluorescent antibody stains of its hippocampus for the presence of rabies
antigen. More than one patient I met brought their dog for just such
analysis.
I think one take home point for practicing physicians is to know about the
risks of rabies for their traveling patients, as the recent case in England
highlights. It is recommended to consider vaccination for rabies for
travelers spending more than 1 month in an endemic area.
I would be happy to talk about rabies with anyone else who is interested -
please contact me. [Responses to this invitation should be sent directly to

[Dr. Scholand, we appreciate your insight. Indeed, rabies is a horrible
disease in people, but it is equally horrible for the animals. It is great
news to learn they have a goal of eradication of rabies [in the
Philippines. Certainly massive vaccination campaigns of dogs and cats is
needed.
There are at least 2 forms of rabies, a dumb or quiet type and a furious
type. The furious type is what is most often thought of with the aggressive
or salivating animal. However, the dumb or quiet type presents as a change,
cowering or retreating from normal activities, and later on this quiet
animal may also salivate. Rabies vaccinations are key to reducing the
number of rabid animals and controlling the situation. - Mod.TG

There are approximately 10 dogs for every human in the Philippines.
275 cases of human rabies were reported in 1978. 479 cases were reported
in 1994 - 37.8% were below age 15, and most cases were acquired from dogs.
230 cases were reported in 1995; 337 in 1996 (all from dogs); 325 in 1997
(all from dogs); 362 in 1998 (all from dogs); 398 in 1999.
27 502 postexposure treatment courses were administered in 1988; 3680 in
1994; 11 338 in 1996; 39 015 in 1997; 42 760 in 1998.
828 rabid animals were reported in 1993 (including 825 dogs); 1040 in 1994)
1039 dogs and 1 cat); 767 in 1996 (749 dogs); 1966 in 1997 (1957 dogs, 8
cats, 1 ruminant); 1828 in 1998.
