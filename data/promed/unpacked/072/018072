First Case of Human Ehrlichiosis in Mexico
---------------------------------------------
Ehrlichiosis is a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans through the bite of
infected ticks. The first recognized human ehrlichial infection, Sennetsu
fever, was described in Japan in 1954. The first case of human ehrlichiosis
in the United States was recognized in 1986 and was reported in 1987.
The disease is caused by intracellular gram-negative bacteria of the
_Ehrlichia_ genus. The bacteria can be found in the monocytes and
granulocytes of peripheral blood. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is caused by
_E. chaffeensis_, and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis is caused by _E. equi_
or E. _phagocytophilia_, which was first recognized in 1994. Most cases
occur between April and September, and the
reservoirs are field animals such as rodents, deer, and dogs. The clinical
spectrum of the disease is similar to that of other febrile illnesses;
without adequate and timely treatment, approximately 5% of the patients die.
In the United States, more than 400 cases of serologically confirmed _E.
chaffeensis _ infection have been documented since 1996. No cases have been
reported in Mexico.
In February 1997, we evaluated a 41-year-old male patient from Merida. The
patient had been exposed to ticks during activity in a rural area 1 week
before the onset of illness. Clinical manifestations included frequent
hyperthermia [fever, rash, myalgia, headache, anorexia, fatigue, and cough.
Physical examination showed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, and a chest
radiograph showed an interstitial bilateral infiltrate... No antibodies
against rickettsia, dengue virus, B-19 parvovirus, or HIV were detected. A
serum sample gave a positive reaction by indirect immunofluorescence
assay against _E. chaffeensis_ at titers of 1:64 on week 2 and 1:128 on week
3. No infected monocytes or granulocytes were observed in peripheral blood.
Remission of the clinical manifestations began on week 4 and was completed
on week 6.
This case indicates the existence of human ehrlichiosis in Yucatan, Mexico.
Reactivity to _E. chaffeensis_ suggests human monocytic ehrlichiosis;
however, as antibody testing was not performed with _E. phagocytophila_ or
_E. equi_, the possibility of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis cannot be
excluded. In any event, case reports indicate the need for deliberate search
for cases.
Dengue is endemic in this area of Mexico, and ehrlichiosis should be
considered as a differential diagnosis.
