Experts to monitor mango disease
---------------------------------
Authorities will keep a close eye on mango orchards in the Kimberley,
following the 1st discovery in Western Australia of mango scab, which was
detected at an isolated orchard at the Bidyadanga community, south of
Broome, last year [2004].
Subsequent surveys of the property and others in the Broome area found no
trace of the disease, which already affects the industry in the Northern
Territory and Queensland.
Department of Agriculture spokesman Satendra Kumar says a survey team will
return to the Kimberley in April [2005] to check that there has been no
recurrence of the disease. The disease is a minor one, not reported to be
causing any economic damage, but authorities hope that the disease can be
kept out of the state.

[The fungus associated with mango scab in Queensland has been compared with
the type collection of _Sphaceloma mangiferae_, and found to be conspecific
with that taxon. Morphological characteristics indicate that it is placed
incorrectly in _Sphaceloma_, and the new combination _Denticularia
mangiferae_ is proposed. Pathogenicity to mango leaves has been
demonstrated with a culture isolated from mango in Queensland, and with
inoculum taken directly from sporulating leaf lesions. _Elsinoe mangiferae_
has also been reported to cause a similar disease in Australia in January
1997 as a result of intense investigation into severe scarring and
distortion of mangoes in the Darwin rural area of the Northern Territory.
Both pathogens can cause severe infections, resulting in development of
scar tissue and fruit drop. Mango scab is usually not important in
commercial groves, because fungicides containing copper also control scab.
Infection in nurseries can be prevented by frequent sprays of neutral
copper on young leaves.
