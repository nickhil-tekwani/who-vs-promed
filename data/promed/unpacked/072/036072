Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease (FMD), a viral ailment, have been
recorded in livestock in more than a dozen districts with the
beginning of the hot season and increasing movement of animals.
Officials said FMD, which is also called hoof-and-mouth disease, is
gripping different districts from the Himalayan district of Manang to
far eastern districts like Ilam and districts in western Nepal.

"With the soaring mercury levels, reports of FMD cases have been
pouring in for the last couple of weeks. Even districts with a cold
climate such as Manang are witnessing the disease," Baikuntha
Parajuli, head of the Animal Health Directorate, told myrepublica.com.

"We have been receiving applications from farmers to extend them
support to control the disease."

With reports of the outbreak still trickling in, the exact number of
infected animals is unknown.

Parajuli said FMD -- or _Aphtae epizooticae_ in scientific parlance
-- is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease that
affects cloven-hoofed animals including domestic animals such as
cows, bulls, water buffalo, sheep, goats and pigs as well as animals
in the wild like antelope and bison.

"As herds of domestic animals are moving upward from lowland pastures
with the onset of the hot season, such animals are acting as carriers
of the disease," Parajuli added.

The disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly
after 2 or 3 days, blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive
secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling, and blisters on
the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.

Veterinarians also said [that] infected adult animals may suffer
weight loss from which they do not recover for several months, and in
the case of cows, milk production can decline significantly.

However, he said the directorate has been delivering necessary
antibiotics to the affected districts in addition to technical
support to control the disease.

Though the fatal disease occurred in the past also, the government
has failed to formulate any concrete program to fight it.

"We had devised a plan a few years ago to combat the disease with
some suggestions including massive vaccinations in dairy pocket areas
and restriction on the movement of animals in the disease outbreak season.

"However, the plan is collecting dust due to lack of interest in
coming up with a special plan against the disease," added Parajuli.

[FMD is endemic in Nepal. According to Nepal's annual reports to the
OIE for the years 2005-2008, serotype O has been identified during
all those years, while serotypes A and Asia1 were present during
2006-2007. Information on the identity of the FMD virus, currently
spreading, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
