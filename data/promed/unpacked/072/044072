Compared to 184 005 BSE cases recorded in the UK so far, 5003 cases have
been recorded in the 23 other -- mostly European -- countries. The updated
numbers so far, and the OIE data on 2003 annual incidence rates (number of
indigenous cases per million bovines aged over 24 months) from the
5 (ex-UK) countries with highest numbers of confirmed cases, are the
following:
Ireland (1447; 57.81), France (934; 12.01), Portugal (923; 137.19), Spain
(455; 46.31) and Switzerland (455; 24.86). During 2004, an increase in the
number of recorded BSE cases is being observed in Poland, Slovakia, the
Czech Republic, and probably in Slovenia and Japan. In other countries the
previously observed decrease has been continuing during the current year;
Germany might be an exception. The decrease in Portugal deserves special
attention; see item 2. - Mod.AS]

[2] Portugal: lifting export restrictions
Date: Fri, 1 Oct 2004

BSE: all restrictions on Portuguese exports lifted
------------------------------------------------
The EU Member States today accepted a proposal from Commissioner Byrne to
lift the embargo on Portugal and remove all restrictions on the export of
cows, beef and related animal products. The embargo was adopted in November
1998 because of the high rate of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in
Portugal at that time combined with inadequate management of the disease.
Since then, Portugal has taken firm risk management action and the
incidence of BSE has consistently decreased.
David Byrne, Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, said
"Portugal has made very significant efforts to deal with its BSE situation
and will now reap the rewards of resumed trade. As I approach the end of my
term in office, I am very pleased to see that consumer confidence in beef
has finally returned as a result of the effective efforts made by all EU
countries in the management of BSE."
In 2001, harmonised EU-level legislation for the management of BSE was put
in place in all Member States. The regulation targets all animal and public
health risks resulting from TSEs (of which BSE is the best known) and
governs the whole chain of production. An inspection by the FVO [EU's Food
and Veterinary Office] in February 2004 showed that Portugal has fully
implemented the rules and taken all the actions required by the
legislation. Currently, the BSE incidence rate in Portugal, calculated over
the previous 12 months, is well below the upper limit for countries with a
moderate BSE risk as defined in the International Animal Health Code.
Furthermore, the test results indicate that the BSE incidence rate is on a
downward trend. It is therefore appropriate to repeal the embargo and
remove all restrictions on trade for Portugal. Of course the same rules on
BSE management and controls continue to apply to Portugal as with all other
Member States.
The decision to lift the embargo was agreed today [21 Sep 2004] by the
Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, consisting of
representatives of the EU Member State and chaired by the European
Commission. During the coming weeks, the legal texts will be formally
adopted by the European Commission and published in the Official Journal,
after which they will immediately enter into force.
Background to the Portuguese embargo:
In 1998 an embargo was placed on all exports of live bovine animals and
derived products from Portugal to the rest of the EU. Following this
embargo, Portugal immediately took action to control the risk of human
exposure and the risk of further spreading BSE through animal feed.
The main actions taken were a ban on specified risk materials (like spinal
cord, brain, etc) in both human food and animal feed and the so-called
"feed ban" preventing the use of mammalian protein and fats being used as
animal feed. Both these actions were introduced on 4 Dec 1998. In addition,
a centralised national system for the identification and registration of
bovine animals was introduced in Portugal on 1 Jul 1999.

[Portugal is currently the most seriously BSE-affected country, though a
significant decrease of the number of confirmed cases has been observed
during 2004. Its 2003 annual incidence rate (see in previous item -- 2) was
137.19, compared to 122.44 in the UK. - Mod.AS]

[3] Atypical BSE cases in bovines

Atypical cases of BSE
----------------------
[In addition to previous cases in Japan (20031007.2511), Italy
(20031022.2649) and France (20040107.0076)], confirmations of "new"
atypical BSE cases have recently been received from Belgium, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Poland.
The Belgian case is described in The International Journal of Applied
Research and has similarities to the Japanese cases.
<http://www.jarvm.com/articles/Vol2Iss1/DEBOSSCHERE.htm>
The Danish case is published by the Danish Food and Veterinary institute
and has similarities to the Italian cases.
<http://www.dfvf.dk/Default.asp?ID=8147&M=News&PID=89507&NewsID=792> in
Danish, dated 19 Aug 2004.
The Dutch case was confirmed by the Centraal Instituut voor Dierziekte
Controle in Lelystad and seems to be similar to the French cases described
by Thiery Baron et al.(Biacabe AG, Laplanche JL, Ryder S, Baron T: A
molecular variant of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. International
Conference on Prion Disease: From basic research to intervention concepts.
Gasreig, Munchen, 8-10 Oct 2003.)[see further].
The Polish case (with similarities to Italian cases, described in PNAS, by
Casalone et al.)[see further] was confirmed to me by the National
Veterinary Research Institute in Pulawy.

varying molecular signature, deserves further research into their
epidemiological and zoonotic significance, as well as their possible
relevance to different scrapie strains. -Mod.AS]

[4] Japan: testing policy reassessed.

BSE inspection policy
---------------------
An expert panel of the Food Safety Commission reviewing Japan's mad cow
controls has given a virtual green light to a proposal to exclude young
cattle aged 20 months or less from mandatory testing for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). The panel's recommendation will probably pave the way
for an easing of tough anti-BSE standards now in place that require tests
on all cattle for the brain-wasting disease. This testing regime was
introduced soon after Japan's 1st mad cow case was revealed in 2001.
BSE is caused by the accumulation of misshapen proteins called prions in
body tissue, especially the brain. Since prion accumulation occurs
gradually, it is difficult to detect BSE infection in young cattle using
current testing techniques. This is why the European Union tests only
cattle over 30 months old.
In Japan, 11 of the roughly 3.5 million animals tested to date were
infected with the disease. 2 were aged 21 months and 23 months [Since this
publication date, the total number of cases has become 13. - Mod.AS]. But
the amount of abnormal prions in their bodies was very small, somewhere
between 1/500th and 1/1000th of the quantity typically found in infected
adult animals. The fact that these amounts are close to the minimum that
can be detected through testing apparently led the panel to reason that the
risk of human infection would not rise if cattle below 20 months old were
excluded from testing.
The government originally planned to adopt the EU's testing standards. But
it eventually decided to screen all cattle out of concern that distributing
beef from both tested and untested animals could cause market and consumer
confusion and anxiety.
In the 3 years since rigorous testing was introduced, there has been no
rise in the number of new BSE cases. Meanwhile, more anti-BSE measures have
been implemented. The time is probably ripe for a review of the test-all
policy, and the case for that is also supported by the experience in EU,
which does not test young cattle.
Obviously, a comprehensive approach is essential for securing beef safety.
First of all, brain, spinal cord and other body parts in danger of
containing large amounts of prions must be eliminated from the beef made
available to consumers. But in separating such parts, infected tissue could
come into contact with uninfected meat.
That is why all beef must be tested for BSE infection before being put into
the food chain. It is vital that all these steps be taken assiduously to
prevent any error.
The proposed testing review echoes growing calls within the government to
lift the ban on U.S. beef imports. Some policy makers clearly hope the
panel's recommendation will help break the impasse in bilateral talks over
the import ban. There are, however, several problems that must be sorted
out before resuming beef imports from the United States.
It is possible to trace the place of origin and the age of every animal
raised in Japan. But that is not easy in the United States, where cattle
are typically managed in herds. So accurately identifying beef cattle
younger than 20 months to exclude them from testing would be a big
challenge in the United States.
Another problem concerns the elimination of risky body parts. While all
cattle are subject to this requirement in Japan, only those aged 30 months
or older are handled this way in the United States. Although the United
States stresses it has dramatically increased the number of cows tested,
the fact is that U.S. testing failed to detect animals showing possible BSE
symptoms this spring.
A review of Japan's test-all approach would not sharply narrow the wide gap
that exists between the 2 countries. The step would not allay Japanese
consumer fears about the safety of American beef. Japan should urge the
United States to adopt beef safety standards similar to those in this
country. That should be our bottom-line demand in talks over resuming
imports of U.S. beef.

[Japan's comprehensive testing policy, covering all bovines sent for
slaughter -- irrespective of age (in EU terminology, "Healthy slaughtered
cattle") -- is impressive, if not extreme. Initially, the testing policy
did not seem to adequately cover the most vulnerable group, namely "Risk
animals" (fallen stock, bovine animals with clinical signs at ante-mortem
and emergency slaughter). As experienced in Europe, the detection-rate of
BSE in such animals is more than 3000-fold higher compared to that observed
in healthy slaughtered cattle. It will be interesting to see figures
pertaining to the number of such animals tested annually in Japan. A new
Japanese law which went into effect 1 Apr 2003 states that all the cattle
over 24 months found dead on farms should be checked for BSE (see
20030426.1019). However, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry
(MAFF), responsible for this segment, said that they could not check all
the dead animals in 17 prefectures, and that total test numbers would be
only about half of the expected 80 000. - Mod.AS]
