I found this information interesting in comparison with the Australian
situation. The USA has a different food culture than Australia, with more
dependence on beef and pig meat. My comment may not be important, but in
Australia pork is not considered a true red meat and falls within the
category of protein food sources most prone to spoilage and implicated in
human and domestic pet food poisoning (i.e., in Veterinary Public Health we
are taught the relative life of fresh unrefrigerated proteins in ascending
order is: dairy, fish, poultry and pork/veal, goat(chevon)/venison, lamb,
mutton/beef -- I think this also reflects modern processing methods).
The reason for writing is to suggest that the authors of The New York City
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Issues Health Advisory on
Food-Borne Illnesses may wish to clarify their advice re pork and processed
pig meats (some of which are specifically mentioned later in the advisory)
if this has the potential to cause confusion among New Yorkers and mislead
them into taking less caution with pig meat in future.

[ProMED thanks Mark Groves for his comments. According to the USDA
Hotline, they do not distinguish pork from beef with regards to storage
times. Pork is considered to have the same spoilage rate as beef, which is
lower than that of poultry. In addition, Dr. Jim Dickson, Department
of Animal Science, Iowa State University, communicated to me that intact
pork muscle has a shorter shelf life than intact beef muscle, using the
example that refrigerated (at or below 5 C) beef exported to Japan (the
longest US shelf-life situation) is typically stored for 60 days, while
refrigerated pork has a shelf life of 38-42 days. He added that in a
blackout situation, where temperatures could be much higher, it would
probably be hard to detect any real difference in spoilage rates between
beef and pork. Additionally, Dr. Dickson added that it is possible to
detect a difference in controlled laboratory settings, but he suspects that
the difference would be in minutes, not hours. - Mod.LL]
