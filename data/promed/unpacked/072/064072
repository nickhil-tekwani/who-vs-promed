At least 200 people were taken ill due to food poisoning after consuming "prasad" at a religious function in Hojai district of Assam, officials said on Thursday [19 Aug 2021]. Some of the patients have been admitted to hospital in Hojai and Nagaon towns, they said. Over 200 people, including women and children, had consumed "prasad" (religious offering) and other eatables at the event in Ward 7 of Lanka town on Tuesday [17 Aug 2021], the officials said. All of them complained of fever and vomiting from Wednesday [18 Aug 2021].

"Some people went to Hojai and Nagaon for better treatment in private hospitals. So far, no one has been seriously ill, and we are monitoring the situation," an official said.

The foods eaten are not stated, and it is not clear what the incubation period and length of illness were to help decide which pathogens might have been involved. Most often prasad is vegetarian food consumed by worshippers after worship. - Mod.LL
