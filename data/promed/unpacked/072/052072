An outbreak of Newcastle disease [NCD] has been registered in one of
the biggest Estonian chicken farms in Tallin. The republic's
veterinary and food service reported that tests of chickens indicate
the presence of this deadly virus. The specimens were taken after low
egg productivity was observed.

The definitive diagnosis is expected after the results from a
UK-based laboratory [most probably VLA, the reference laboratory in
Weybridge] arrive. The future of 200 000 chickens depends on the
results of these tests. In the worst case, all the birds will be
culled and shipped to a rendering plant.

This is the 2nd case of an NCD outbreak in Estonia during the last 50
years. The previous one was registered in the south of Estonia, where
the total population of chickens has been destroyed [see commentary].

Though the agent is not dangerous to humans, products from chickens
are not allowed for sale. The use of these products is allowed only
after special treatment, which cannot be applied at home, specialists
of the food department explained.

[Estonia submitted to the OIE a report about an outbreak of NCD
(subclinical infection) on 31 Jul 2007. A flock of laying hens in
Polde, Abja, Viljandi was found infected and all 5122 birds
destroyed. On 4 Sep 2007, Estonia reported that no additional
outbreaks had followed, and the disease was regarded as resolved; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5848>.

It is not clear whether the current newswire relates to a new
outbreak or is rather a repetition; clarification will help.

According to the information provided to the OIE by Estonia for the
year 2005, as published in the WAHID interface, NCD was not present
in Estonia during 2005, while its last report was indicated to be
1962. However, the report for 2006 says that the disease is present,
specifying: "Confirmed infection (no clinical disease)." This may
mean that the circulation of the virus has already been detected by
laboratory tests during 2006 but that no clinical cases were
observed. A clarification will be helpful.

The July 2007 outbreak in Estonia was reported also to EU's Animal
Disease Notification System (ADNS). Four additional member-states
reported NCD during the 1st 10 months of 2007, namely Belgium,
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Romania. - Mod.AS]
