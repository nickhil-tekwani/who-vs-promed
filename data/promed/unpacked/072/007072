Viet Nam: 2007 H5N1 virus same as 2005 virus
--------------------------------------------
Samples of this year's H5N1 virus have proved to be different to
those of 2004 but the same as in 2005. The samples testing the gene
code [genome sequence?] taken from Vietnamese bird flu patients were
recently received back from the US Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), Dr. Nguyen Tran Hien, director of the National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology stated during a meeting of the
National Steering Board of Bird Flu Control and Prevention.
Dr. Hien said that the test results from the CDC were the same as the
results he had found when carrying out the tests here in Viet Nam.
His institute will work together with the CDC to decode the H5N1
virus gene [genome?] and keep track of its transformation
[evolution?].
Deputy Health Minister Trinh Quan Huan further said that doctors must
keep a close eye on their H5N1 patients this year, that they must be
wary of human-to-human transmission.
This year, since early May [2007], bird flu has hit 18 cities and
provinces nationwide. There have been 5 human bird flu cases, in
which 2 patients died and 3 fully recovered. A 19-year-old H5N1
patient Ha Van Nguyen from the northern mountainous province of Thai
Nguyen, yesterday [5 Jul 2007] went home from the Ha Noi-based
National Institute for Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases
after 39 days of treatment.

[The wording of this press report is too imprecise to allow accurate
interpretation. The statements suggest that the genome of the H5N1
avian influenza virus which have been isolated from patients in Viet
Nam in succeeding years do not exhibit any directional variability.
It should be noted that as of 29 Jun 2007 the World Health
Organisation has confirmed only 2 of the 5 human cases reported to
have been isolated in Viet Nam since November 2005 (see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2007_06_29/en/index.html>). The confirmed
cases are a 29-year-old male now deceased and the 19-year-old
recovered patient described above.
Further clarification of the situation would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
