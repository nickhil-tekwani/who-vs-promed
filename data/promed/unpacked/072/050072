More dead and diseased abalone have been found in coastal waters near Portland [Victoria].

Abalone viral ganglioneuritis (AVG) was first detected in the area on May 1 [2021], more than 10 years since it was last recorded.

It had been hoped it was an isolated outbreak, but more affected clusters have now been found at Murrell's and Jones Bay reefs, west of Portland, within the control area established by Agriculture Victoria.

AVG affects the nervous system of abalone, resulting in curling of the foot and swelling of the mouth leading to weakness and death, with about 90 per cent of affected abalone dying.

The viral disease wiped out up to 80 per cent of wild abalone in the Western Zone Abalone Fishery after being detected in 2006, affecting more than 300 kilometres [186 mi] of coastline before slowly dissipating.

Harry Peeters, executive officer with the Western Abalone Divers Association, previously told the ABC that the outbreak was still fresh in the minds of those involved in the industry.

"Our industry was decimated back in 2006 by the outbreak of AVG and over the past 15 years we've gradually rebuilt, so this is a real kick in the guts for us," he said.

"No one expected this. I guess it was always in the back of our mind that it could happen, but things have been looking good and the abalone reefs have been looking healthy."

The control area extends along the coastline from Bridgewater Bay in the west to past Narrawong in the east.

Fishing is prohibited and boats cannot be anchored in the control area, although vessels can pass through.

Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Graeme Cooke could not say how long the control area would be in place.

"Surveillance results will better shape our understanding of the extent of disease spread, with dive surveys taking place across reef areas in the control area," he said.

[Abalone are prized by fishermen and typically among the very highest per pound value of all seafood. Abalone viral ganglioneuritis (AVG) is an acute, fatal disease first documented in farmed abalone in late 2005 in Victoria, Australia. It was reported for the 1st time in a population of wild abalone in Taylors Bay, Victoria, in May 2006. It is caused by the abalone herpes virus (AbHV).

The virus causes inflammation of the nervous tissue, resulting in the edges of the foot curling inwards, swelling and protrusion of the mouth, and excess mucus production. Infected animals lose muscle control and slide or fall off their home scars on the reef. The lesions in AVG cases are present within nerve tissue especially nerves innervating the mouth parts of the abalone, resulting in the clinical signs of swelling and prolapse of the mouth, loss of foot adhesion, and eventual death. The lesions are centred on the cerebral, pleuropedal, branchial and buccal ganglia, the cerebral commissure, and the peripheral nerves arising from these, with some extension of inflammation into adjacent mouth tissues. The virus is transmitted horizontally through direct contact between infected and healthy abalone. - Mod.PMB
