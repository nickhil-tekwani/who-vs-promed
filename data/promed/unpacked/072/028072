State and federal biologists plan to euthanize wild bighorn sheep in central Washington to curb the spread of a deadly pneumonia outbreak.

Biologists will spend the next several weeks removing sheep from the Tieton herd, about 10 miles [16 km] west of Naches and 20 miles [32 km] northwest of Yakima. The herd is currently estimated at between 35 to 50 animals.

Almost all of the animals will likely need to be euthanized, because most of them are believed to be infected with the disease that causes pneumonia, said Richard Harris, wildlife manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Recent surveys showed a majority of the live sheep to be in poor condition, he said, with about a third of those animals coughing or showing other signs of the disease.

"We hate to have to take this action, but we believe it's necessary to stop the spread of a disease that could devastate adjacent herds of wild bighorn sheep in the area," Harris said in a statement Monday [1 Apr 2013].

The disease is often fatal in wild bighorns and can affect the survival rate of lambs later born to animals that survive the disease. There is no treatment or preventative vaccine.

The Yakima area is home to about a third of the state's 2000 wild bighorn sheep, divided into 4 separate herds.

The disease has already significantly reduced the size of the Tieton herd, which once numbered as many as 200 animals. So far no dead or sick bighorn sheep have been found outside the Tieton herd, the statement said.

Wildlife managers took similar steps in 2010 to stop the spread of the disease in the Yakima River Canyon.

Past outbreaks among bighorn sheep have been linked to contact between wild sheep and domestic sheep or goats that carry, but are unaffected by, the bacteria that cause the disease.

However, Harris said there is no evidence there was contact between domestic and wild sheep in the Naches area.

[The decision of culling to stop the spread of a disease is a measure of management that may be useful in some particular cases of specific pathogens that are transmitted by direct or indirect contact. However, it has seldom been evaluated as a management tool for the conservation of a species. Recently, this strategy was used to control the Tasmanian devil (_Sarcophilus harrisii_) infectious cancer, devil facial tumor disease. Selective culling of infected individuals neither slowed rate of disease progression nor reduced population-level impacts of this debilitating disease. Culling mortality simply compensated for disease mortality in this system. On the basis of this experience, it was suggested that disease-management programs for threatened wildlife populations are developed on the principles of adaptive management and utilize a wide variety of strategies with regular reviews and adaptation of strategies undertaken as new information is obtained.

Bighorn sheep pneumonia is multifactorial, and it is also caused by multiple pathogens. A clear, invariant relationship between a single agent and field outbreaks has not yet been documented, in part due to methodological limitations and practical challenges associated with developing rigorous study designs. No single pathogen appears to be either necessary or sufficient cause. Due to their complexity, multifactorial phenomena like these, usually require integrated and sustained research efforts to be unveiled. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

The bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation seems to have an important environmental component. Recent die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggest that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant. If so, culling ill animals may be counterproductive.
