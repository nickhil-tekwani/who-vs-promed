Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been spreading in Chieng Hoa and Nam
Gion communes, Muong La and Chieng Sinh districts, in Son La province
from [12-25 Feb 2010], according to the local Animal Health Department.

Total cattle infected with the disease included 235 buffalos and cows
and 180 pigs. The locality is carrying out measures to prevent and
combat the disease.

At present, 4 provinces -- Nghe An, Dien Bien, Tien Giang, and Son La
-- have not met the 21-day deadline to declare themselves free of the disease.

[Viet Nam sent on 23 Feb 2008 a final report to the OIE on its FMD
outbreak, caused by FMDV serotype Asia 1, announcing it as becoming
"endemic", and indicating that no further reporting should be
expected. The annual report for 2008 mentioned serotypes Asia 1 and O
as present. No semi-annual or annual OIE reports from Viet Nam on
2009 are yet available. The serotype involved in the current
outbreak, now covering 4 provinces, has thus not been notified to the OIE.

However, according to the data of the World Reference Laboratory for
FMD at Pirbright, samples sent from Viet Nam during 2009 have been
found to include FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, a strain known to be
spreading in the region, including Thailand and China. A Molecular
Epidemiology Report on 6 Vietnamese isolates, collected from 4
cattle, one pig, and one water buffalo during January-February 2009
and submitted to Pirbright in October 2009, is available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009/WRLFMD-2009-0000D-Vietnam-A.pdf>.
16 additional samples were received at Pirbright on 5 Feb 2010, but
their results are not yet available.

Updated epidemiological data from Viet Nam, including details on the
availability -- or otherwise -- of an efficient vaccine and its
application, are requested. - Mod.AS]
