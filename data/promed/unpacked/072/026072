About 28 children have died of lead poisoning in Angwan Maijero and Angwan Karo, Madaka District in Rafi Local Government Area (LGA) of Niger State in northern Nigeria. A statement by the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development on [Sun 17 May 2015] in Abuja said that the lead poisoning was due to the activities of illegal miners in the state.

The statement said that the number of casualties was more of children, 15 of them, but the Ministry of Health, Niger State reported that the death toll had increased to 28 children, while many were still sick. "A case of lead poisoning purportedly resulting from the activities of informal miners in Angwan Maijero and Angwan Karo, Madaka District, Rafi LGA, Niger State, was reported by our Federal Mines officer In-charge, Niger State on [13 May 2015].

"The report contained a detailed investigation on the incident and measures taken to forestall further deterioration of the situation," the statement said, which noted that a high point of the report was the initial report by the field officer of 15 casualties, made up of mainly children, linked to the poisoning caused by the activities of these miners.

"The report also contained efforts by the Ministry in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Health and the Niger State Ministry of Health in putting in place a technical team which visited the affected areas on a scoping mission to verify the occurrence of the outbreak, its causative agents, magnitude, and dimension.

"A report received on 7 May 2015 from the State Ministry of Health contained an increased number of sick children, under the age of 5, and the deaths of about 28 children.

"A series of meetings have been held by stakeholders and are still ongoing in the process of addressing this issue, especially that comprising the Federal Ministry of Health, Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, World Health Organization, Civil Society Organization, Ministry of Water Resources, and others," the statement said.

According to the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, the particular activity that gave rise to this outbreak of lead poisoning, as in other cases in the past, has been that of informal mining, which involves the adoption of unsafe mining practices, giving little or no regards to personal health, that of the general public, and of the environment.

[This article contains nothing more than that the mining practices, which may be illegal, have caused the deaths of 28 children and there are others ill, so the death toll may rise. How these children were exposed, or what the mining company is doing is not explained.

Lead poisoning occurs when lead builds up in the body, often over a period of months or years. Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children under the age of 6 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.

The signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in children may include: developmental delay, learning difficulties, irritability, loss of appetite, weight loss, sluggishness and fatigue, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and hearing loss.

Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust, but human activity -- mining, burning fossil fuels, and manufacturing -- has caused it to become more widespread. Lead was also once a key ingredient in paint and gasoline and is still used in batteries, solder, pipes, pottery, roofing materials, and some cosmetics.

Exposure to even low levels of lead can cause damage over time, especially in children. The greatest risk is to brain development, where irreversible damage may occur. Higher levels can damage the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults. Very high lead levels may cause seizures, unconsciousness, and possibly death.

Doctors usually use a simple blood test to detect lead poisoning. A small blood sample is taken from a finger prick or from a vein. Lead levels in the blood are measured in micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL). A level of 5 mcg/dL or higher indicates your child may have unsafe levels of lead in their blood and should have their blood tested periodically. If levels become too high -- generally 45 mcg/dL or higher -- your child should be treated.

The 1st step in treating all degrees of lead poisoning is to remove the source of the contamination. If you can't remove lead from your environment, you may at least be able to reduce the likelihood that it will cause problems. For instance, sometimes it's better to seal in rather than remove old lead paint. Your local health department can recommend ways to identify and reduce lead in your home and community.

For children and adults with relatively low lead levels, simply avoiding exposure to lead may be enough to reduce blood lead levels.
For more severe cases, your doctor may recommend:
- chelation therapy. In this treatment, you take a medication that binds with the lead so that it's excreted in your urine.
- EDTA therapy. Doctors treat adults with lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL of blood with one or more of 3 drugs, most commonly a chemical called ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, or edetic acid). Depending on your lead level, you may need more than one treatment. In such severe cases, however, it may not be possible to reverse damage that has already occurred.

Children may need chelation therapy at lower levels than adults do.
