Scientists worried by mass turtle death
---------------------------------------
Scientists have been unable to identify what has caused a mass death of green sea turtles at Upstart Bay south of Townsville in north Queensland. An aerial survey has found 70 turtles died this month [June 2012].

Marty McLaughlin from the Environment Department says authorities are worried. "The thing that's concerning for us is that we don't really know at this stage. The early tests haven't shown any obvious answers with what's happening with the turtles," he said. "The live ones are obviously sick. They're disorientated, they tend to get washed up into the beach, and are unable to get back into the water."

The green sea turtles are well nourished and almost all adult females. That eliminates the likelihood of the deaths being linked to last year's [2011] starvation deaths after Queensland's summer of natural disasters. Authorities are now awaiting toxicology results.

[The green turtle (_Chelonia mydas_) is a large sea turtle distributed throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN [International Union for Conservation of Nature] and CITES [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora] and is protected from exploitation in most countries.

In past stranded turtles, the diseases found have been pneumonia, hepatitis, meningitis, septicemic processes, and neoplasma (fibropapillomatosis).

Hopefully information gathered from postmortem exams and tests will reveal the culprit.
