A self-described athletic man, a Stillwater resident who ran 5 miles a day and could often be found working around the yard, was recently taken seriously ill by a single bite from a tick. 2 weeks after the initial bite, the 77-year-old man spiked a 104-degree fever, went into kidney and liver failure, could not recognize his family, couldn't hold a cup or dress himself, and lost the ability to walk. After spending 2.5 weeks on intravenous medication in the hospital and an additional 3 weeks in rehabilitation to learn to walk again, he is now at home recovering, albeit slowly.

By now, many people may know to be wary of ticks and use prevention to avoid getting bitten by one since they carry Lyme disease. However, many people may not know that 2 other obscure tick-borne diseases, anaplasmosis and babesiosis, are on the rise, causing much worse symptoms than Lyme disease.

Although Lyme disease is the most common of all tick-borne infectious diseases in New Jersey -- 2589 people were diagnosed in 2014 alone -- anaplasmosis and babesiosis are starting to "newly emerge," said Dr. Donald Allegra, the infectious disease specialist for Newton Medical Center.

Both are tricky to diagnose. Anaplasmosis affects organs in the body and does not show a visible rash where the tick was attached. Babesiosis produces malaria-like symptoms in some patients and no symptoms in others.

Babesiosis disease is caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells, causing patients to come into the emergency room with severe anemia.

According to Allegra, co-infections are also on the rise where a tick can become infected with 2 diseases from a variety of hosts it feeds on before it attaches to a human, causing the human to develop 2 infections. This can make a person sicker and may take them longer to recover, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. "I don't have specific numbers on cases coming into the ER, but I have a strong feeling that (diagnosis of both diseases) is certainly increasing," Allegra said.

A cause for the increase in diagnosis can be due to a multitude of reasons, such as doctors reporting the diseases more often than other years, but Allegra believes that the warmer weather may have something to do with it. With a mild fall and an even more mild start to winter -- temperatures have reached record highs for this time of year in Sussex County -- people have been spending more time outdoors, hiking and walking their dogs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ticks can survive through temperatures that are above freezing.

As for the case of the Stillwater resident, he was diagnosed with anaplasmosis at Newton Medical Center in late October 2015 after he had just completed blowing leaves outside his house on a mild fall day. The robust man, who chose to remain anonymous, had just completed blowing the leaves off his lawn and went inside his house to take a shower. During his shower, he noticed a tick on his side and his wife promptly removed it. 2 weeks later, he traveled to Morristown Medical Center for a routine appointment to check a large cyst on his kidneys.

The appointment concluded that he was in no medical danger from the cyst, which he has had for 5 years. He called his wife on his way home and, according to her, said he was starting to feel ill. As he pulled into the family's driveway, he drove his vehicle into the side of the garage, knocking off his side mirror. Immediately making his way to bed, he started to feel worse. "He had actually, at 1 point, fallen off the bed and was sleeping in an odd spot between the bed and the nightstand," his wife said. That's when his wife called a few local neighbors to bring him to Newton Medical Center. Doctors found his liver and kidneys to be failing and he was placed on antibiotics.

A day later, her husband's illness took a turn for the worse. "He had a fever of 104 degrees and the doctors had to cover him in ice blankets," his wife said. For 4.5 days, her husband's memory was lost and he did not know who anyone was, even his wife. "I came into the room and he said to me, 'Who are you? I don't know who you are, get my daughter; she just left my room,'" his wife recalled. "But our daughter wasn't there at all; she lives in North Carolina." When his condition did not improve and his wife feared she might lose her husband, hospitalist Dr. Ping Liu came in to observe him and, after discussing the tick bite with his wife, ran a series of blood tests.

Doctors had initially believed that his kidneys were in failure due to a burst cyst -- the one that had just been checked -- but doctors came back with a positive result for anaplasmosis, a disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. According to Allegra, anaplasmosis will often cause severe flu-like symptoms, ranging from tiredness to a fever, but a rash is never present. In many cases, anaplasmosis can damage many organs, especially the heart, lungs, kidneys and nerves, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Transmitted through the same black-legged tick as Lyme disease, anaplasmosis can be fatal if not treated correctly or not found early enough, even in healthy individuals.

Her husband, whom she described as incredibly active -- he ran 5 miles a day with the family dog -- was so weak from the disease that he was unable to hold a cup or feed himself. "He couldn't do anything himself, not even get dressed," his wife recalled. Eventually, while still in the hospital, he started to lose the feeling in the lower part of his body and was unable to stand or walk. After 17 days on intravenous doxycycline at Newton Medical Center, he was taken to Bristol Glen Nursing Home, where he spent the next 21 days in rehabilitation.

He spent 46 days away from home while undergoing treatment. The doxycycline eventually started to battle the anaplasmosis and, with physical therapy twice a day, he started to feel better. "Doxycycline is the best treatment for a tick-borne disease, whether it is Lyme or anaplasmosis," Allegra said.

The man has been home since 4 Dec 2015. A nurse still comes by to take blood and check his organs, especially his kidneys and liver, which are starting to recover, according to his wife. "Things are looking up. Although he was a bit confused when he first came home, he is now able to get around with a cane and walk the dog slowly," his wife said. His wife is spreading awareness and has handed out information on her husband's illness to more than 20 homeowners on their street. "I told them there is a new tick on the block and to be careful," she said. "It's important people in Sussex County know about this debilitating illness."

To prevent infection, Allegra recommends preventative measures to ensure no contact is made with ticks, including wearing long pants and long socks outdoors. "Ticks like to enter through the legs," he said. Infection can occur if a tick has been attached for 24-36 hours. If taken within 48 hours of a tick bite, a double dose of doxycycline from your doctor can reduce the risk of getting Lyme disease by about half, Allegra said.

According to the state Department of Health, 69 cases of anaplasmosis were reported between 29 Dec 2013 and 3 Jan 2015, with 7 of them in Sussex County. Babesiosis had a total of 171 cases during that time period, with 5 in Sussex County.

[_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the causative agent of anaplasmosis (a.k.a. human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), and _Babesia microti_, the causative agent of babesiosis, are transmitted to humans in wooded areas of the northeastern United States by the same tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) that transmits _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Typically, the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/. Patients may be concurrently co-infected by these pathogens.

An increased incidence of anaplasmosis and babesiosis can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, but also better recognition and reporting of these diseases may contribute to the increases in the number of reported cases.

Some individuals infected with _A. phagocytophilum_ do not become ill or experience only very mild symptoms and do not seek medical treatment. The symptoms tend to be most severe in aged or immunosuppressed people. Risk factors for severe babesiosis also include asplenia [anatomical or functional absence of the spleen]. In infected persons who are symptomatic with anaplasmosis, illness onset occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. Initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care, and the disease can be fatal. Severe infections can include prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, hemorrhages, and death.

The presence of hemolytic anemia suggests babesiosis. Some patients also have splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or jaundice. Severe cases can be associated with marked thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic instability, acute respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, renal failure, hepatic compromise, altered mental status, and death.

Their diagnoses are based on specific antibody tests, detection of specific nucleic acid (DNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microscopy of thick and thin blood films. In babesiosis, manual (non-automated) review of Wright-stained peripheral blood smears or buffy-coat preparations can demonstrate intra-erythrocytic ring forms. Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between _Babesia_ and _Plasmodium_ (especially _P. falciparum_) parasites. Cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of vacuolar microcolonies of _A. phagocytophilum_ within neutrophils can be found in 20 to 80 percent of patients with anaplasmosis, unlike the rarity of visualizing organisms within circulating mononuclear cells in patients with human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Weinberg G: Laboratory diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Pediat Infect Dis J 2001; 20: 435-7).

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ and _B. microti_ are found in the blood stream, infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ Transmitted Through Blood Transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57: 1145-8. October 2008 [date cited] Available from human granulocytic anaplasmosis human granulocytic anaplasmosis http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm).

Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously for 10 days for all symptomatic patients suspected of having anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimal total course of 10 days. This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme disease, but is not effective therapy for patients who are co-infected with _B. microti_.

Most asymptomatic persons with babesiosis do not require treatment. For ill patients, babesiosis is treated for at least 7-10 days with a combination of either: atovaquone plus azithromycin, or clindamycin plus quinine (this combination is the standard of care for severely ill patients).

Sussex County is the northernmost county in the U.S. State of New Jersey. Its county seat is Newton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex_County,_New_Jersey). It is part of the New York City metropolitan area. - Mod.ML
