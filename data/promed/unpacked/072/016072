Kidney disease in the dry zone has become the subject of renewed discussion after the submission of the final report by the World Health Organization. The key findings of this report identify long-term exposure to arsenic and cadmium as the cause of the disease. It rules out drinking water as the possible source of exposure but points to the food chain as a possibility.

A recent study reported that arsenite uptake through the skin is 29 times higher than arsenate uptake and cautioned that dermal exposure resulting from standing in contaminated water in rice fields may be grossly underestimated. Elimination of water as a source comes as a surprise to many because high levels of 20-200 microgram/L were reported (http://www.arsenic.lk in Sinhala) in drinking water sources of patients. Drinking water containing high arsenic levels is generally accepted as the source of arsenic in kidney patients in Bangladesh.

Rice, being the staple food in the country, has received due diligence as a possible source in the food chain. Arsenic content in rice has increased from below 100 microg/kg in 2004 to 500 microg/kg in 2011 (http://www.arsenic.lk in Sinhala). [This is a huge increase in a relatively short period of time. - Mod.TG] However, unlike water, rice from the dry zone is consumed all over the country but it has not been implicated in kidney disease in the wet zone.

When drinking water and staple rice are not possible sources of arsenic, the search for overlooked possibilities or a missing link has to begin in earnest. Absorption through the skin -- as an overlooked possibility -- is the route discussed here.

Most of the published past research conclude that the absorption of arsenic through the skin is negligible. However, recent research has begun to contradict this. Arsenic exists in several organic and inorganic forms. The most dominant are the inorganic forms; trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate. The arsenate form gets reduced to arsenite under anoxic conditions found in paddy fields and deep reservoirs.

A recent study reported that arsenite uptake through the skin is 29 times higher than arsenate uptake and cautioned that dermal exposure resulting from standing in contaminated water in rice fields may be grossly underestimated.

Arsenite is more toxic than arsenate and also more soluble. Removing arsenic through reverse osmosis is successful with arsenate but only partially with arsenite. At neutral and acidic pH found in the environment and the human body, arsenate is largely ionised while arsenite is not. This difference is mostly responsible for the difference in behaviour of arsenate and arsenite.

Lesions on the feet and hands are a primary symptom of arsenic poisoning. Once lesions develop on the skin the uptake of arsenic could increase well above the uptake through intact skin and result in a spiraling effect. This hypothesis of arsenite absorption through the skin as the mode of arsenic uptake by the human body requires further testing and verification. The practice of treating all forms of arsenic as equal has to change to form specific analysis. Protective wear for feet and hands could be introduced and its effect could be studied to expedite the potential remedial strategy.

[There are a number of ways that products can enter the body: inhalation, absorption, ingestion, and injection. Absorption is often thought of as products being absorbed through the GI tract, but it is especially important through the skin. The integument is one of the largest organs of the body.

There are different forms of arsenic. There are 2 forms of inorganic arsenic: the reduced or trivalent arsenic(+3) or arsenite, and the oxidized or pentavalent (+5) form known as arsenate. Both of these forms can be absorbed and accumulated in tissues and body fluids.

There are also organic arsenics, but these are generally regarded as less harmful, by orders of magnitude.

This article makes the statement that lesions on the hands and feet are primary symptoms of arsenic poisoning. That may be the case with absorption through the skin, but it not usually what we think of as signs and symptoms of arsenic poisoning. However, if the skin is interrupted in some fashion, a lesion, a blister or other types of interruption in the integument, then absorption may occur more rapidly as there is a much more direct route into the body.

As this article indicates, this is something to be looked into and is not presented here as the cause of these people's renal failure. - Mod.TG]
