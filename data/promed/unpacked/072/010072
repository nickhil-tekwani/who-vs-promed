Preliminary laboratory results indicate avian cholera caused a recent
waterfowl die-off at the Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area (WMA) in
northern California. While avian cholera is lethal to waterfowl and
other water birds, it does not affect humans.
"All indications from the history of the area, the weather, the time
of year, and the concentrations of ducks was that we had an avian
cholera outbreak," said Dr. Pam Swift, Department of Fish and Game
(DFG) wildlife veterinarian. "Even so, the Department and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) collected samples from birds
involved in the die-off and submitted them to both to state and
national laboratories to test for a variety of diseases -- including
avian influenza -- to confirm our assessment."
Avian cholera (not related to human cholera) is a relatively common
disease of North American waterfowl. It is caused by a bacterium and
spreads rapidly from bird-to-bird and can kill thousands of birds in
a single outbreak. A bird infected with avian cholera dies quickly.
Avian cholera die-offs in waterfowl commonly occur during the winter
months in California, especially during cold spells and fog.
DFG received a report of ruddy ducks, wigeons, coots, and other
waterfowl dying at the Butte Sink WMA (part of the Sacramento
National Wildlife Refuge Complex) from Service personnel on 9 Jan.
More than 500 birds have been collected to date by Service personnel.
DFG personnel sampled birds and submitted swabs and carcasses to the
California Animal Health and Food Safety Lab for necropsy and avian
influenza testing which is standard protocol for any wild bird
die-off. The Service separately submitted carcasses to the National
Wildlife Health Center in Madison, WI for diagnostics.
Samples submitted to the California laboratory were negative for the
highly pathogenic avian influenza. Service sample results are still pending.
"Our field biologists routinely deal with avian cholera in wild birds
every winter, generally around the time that the temperature drops
below freezing," said Kevin Foerster, Manager of the Sacramento
Refuge Complex. "We are undertaking standard disease control
operations and following all established safety protocols to limit
the spread of cholera within the wild bird population."
Over the last 30 years in California, documented bird losses due to
diseases ranged from a low of 10 500 in 1977-78 to a high of 169 300
in 1991-92. The majority of the bird losses in 1991-92 consisted of
150 000 eared grebes that died due to avian cholera at the Salton
Sea. Average annual loss of migratory birds to disease in California
is about 25 000 birds. These figures are for birds actually picked up
and disposed of, and the actual losses are greater. In 2005, the last
full year of available data from the National Wildlife Health Center,
of the nearly 12 000 birds picked up in California, most diagnosed
causes of mortality were: petroleum spills (5000); salmonellosis
(2400); botulism (1800) and starvation (1500).
DFG and the Service are working closely and quickly in responding to
this die-off, and are poised to rapidly investigate and collect
samples for necropsy and avian influenza testing if other die-offs
should occur in the Central Valley or elsewhere in California.
