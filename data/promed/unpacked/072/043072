Date: 10 Oct 2000
From: Douglas, Ian <DouglaI@prose.dpi.qld.gov.au>

The report of 4 Oct 2000 that related a Australian Broadcasting Corporation
story on tuberculosis in Queensland and attached comments, have given a
misleading view of events.
A lesion was detected at slaughter in a single 8-year old cow by the
Australian (National) Granuloma Submission program. Tuberculosis
eradication had been undertaken on the property involved with the most
previous lesion found in 1991.
The cow was one of approximately 11 000 animals taken from 2 paddocks on
this property. In addition to those slaughtered immediately, some animals
moved to several other properties in 2 other ownerships. These animals have
been traced and isolated and future activities affecting them and the
original property are currently being finalised.
There is no indication that the disease has spread to other properties, and
there are no other known infected animals. Occasional, single infected
animals have been anticipated in the period after eradication. They have
been very few in number. The National Granuloma Submission Program
continues to operate so that these odd, residual animals are detected and
the appropriate responses made. While this latest finding will necessitate
actions on a large number of cattle from this property, there is no reason
to believe that it will have a detrimental affect on Queensland's freedom
from this disease.
