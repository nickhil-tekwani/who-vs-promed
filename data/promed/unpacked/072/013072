A norovirus outbreak which has seen visitors barred from 9 North East hospitals was caused by someone taking shellfish onto a ward - health bosses have revealed. A spokesperson for the Northumbria Healthcare trust says the NHS body believes the outbreak started when a visitor brought mussels for an inpatient at Wansbeck General Hospital. Oysters, mussels, scallops and clams can harbour the highly contagious bug.

Around 180 visitors and staff have been affected by the bug at 4 hospitals, with 7 wards closed altogether across North Tyneside and Wansbeck hospitals.

The trust has now banned visitors, except where the patient is receiving end of life care, from its 9 hospitals across North Tyneside and Northumberland in a bid to stop the spread of the winter vomiting bug.

These are the hospitals where the visitor ban is in force:
Northumbria Special Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington
Hexham General Hospital
North Tyneside General Hospital
Morpeth Cottage Hospital
Wansbeck General Hospital
Alnwick Infirmary
Berwick Infirmary
Blyth Community Hospital
Haltwhistle War Memorial Hospital

[A variety of enteric infections and intoxications can be acquired from bivalve mollusks. The following is a recent review related to norovirus contamination of shellfish in the UK:

Hassard F, Sharp JH, Taft H, et al: Critical review on the public health impact of norovirus contamination in shellfish and the environment: A UK perspective. Food Environ Virol. 2017;9: 123-141.

"Abstract
---------
We review the risk of norovirus (NoV) infection to the human population from consumption of contaminated shellfish. From a UK perspective, risk is apportioned for different vectors of NoV infection within the population. NoV spreads mainly by person-to-person contact or via unsanitary food handling. NoV also enters the coastal zone via wastewater discharges resulting in contamination of shellfish waters. Typically, NoV persists in the marine environment for several days, with its presence strongly linked to human population density, wastewater discharge rate, and efficacy of wastewater treatment. Shellfish bioaccumulate NoV and current post-harvest depuration is inefficient in its removal. While NoV can be inactivated by cooking (e.g. mussels), consumption of contaminated raw shellfish (e.g. oysters) represents a risk to human health. Consumption of contaminated food accounts for 3-11 percent of NoV cases in the UK (approximately 74 000 cases/year), of which 16 percent are attributable to oyster consumption (11 800 cases/year). However, environmental and human factors influencing NoV infectivity remain poorly understood. Lack of standard methods for accurate quantification of infective and non-infective (damaged) NoV particles represent a major barrier, hampering identification of an appropriate lower NoV contamination limit for shellfish. Future management strategies may include shellfish quality assessment (at point of harvest or at point of supply) or harvesting controls. However, poor understanding of NoV inactivation in shellfish and the environment currently limits accurate apportionment and risk assessment for NoV and hence the identification of appropriate shellfish or environmental quality standards."
