An adolescent with human rabies in the Federal District [DF], Brazil, remains in serious condition after more than a month in the ICU.

According to the folder, he [the victim of the bite] is between 15 and 19 years old and was infected on 21 May 2022 after being scratched by a cat. With this case, Saúde anticipated the rabies vaccination campaign for animals in the DF, and reinforces the importance of human immunization, which can be done in 24 locations [listed at the source URL above - Mod.TG].

The only notification of human rabies in Brasília until this year was in 1978. A child aged between 5 and 11 years old was attacked by a dog and died of the disease.

According to the directorate of health surveillance of the DF, Fabiano dos Anjos, on 15 Jun 2022 the teenager who is currently in the ICU began to feel fever and pain in the body, eyes, and joints. He was hospitalized 5 days after the symptoms.

The Health Department informed only that the young man is a resident of the federal capital but did not give other details.

The Health Department advises anyone who has been bitten [or scratched - Mod.TG] by a dog or cat should first wash the wound with soap and water and then go to the nearest vaccination post. Preventive application is recommended only for those who work with animals.

The SES-DF has 24 rooms of rabies vaccination for humans but promises to triple the number in 2 weeks, getting to 67 rooms.

The anti-rabies serum and vaccine for humans is available, free of charge, at the locations listed. [The lengthy list of addresses and hours is available at the source URL. - Mod.TG]

[2] Alabama (Autauga County): fox, dog, human exposure
Date: Fri 8 Jul 2022
Source: Alabama News Network [edited]
https://www.alabamanews.net/2022/07/08/rabid-fox-bites-prattville-resident/


The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) has confirmed a Prattville resident has been bitten by a rabid fox.

ADPH says the bite happened 1 Jul [2022] when the fox was attacking the resident's dog. Prattville police and wildlife officials captured the fox.

ADPH says the resident has begun treatment and will be taking the dog to the veterinarian for a booster rabies vaccination.

Rabid animals have been found several times in the past year in Prattville and other parts of Autauga County:
Rabid cat found in Prattville - July 2021
Rabid cat bites person in Prattville - November 2021
Rabid fox attacks person, pets near Prattville - April 2022
Rabid dog bites person in Autauga County - May 2022

"This is another reminder to get your pets vaccinated against rabies regardless of where you live. We have found rabies positives in both domestic animals and wildlife very close to the most populated parts of Autauga County this year," Dr. Dee Jones, state public health veterinarian, said.

Rabies is found primarily in raccoons, with the raccoon strain being the most common threat to domestic animals.

"Further testing will confirm if this fox was infected with the raccoon strain, which is helpful for biologist and wildlife agencies when trying to best to control it, but the most important message is that vaccinating pets is the best practice for protecting public health," Jones said.

It is very common for domestic animals and pets to have contact with a wild rabid animal. Alabama state law requires dogs, cats, and ferrets 12 weeks of age and older be current with rabies vaccination. Rabies vaccines are also available for horses and other livestock if recommended by a veterinarian.

[3] California (El Dorado County): skunk, cat
Date: Thu 7 Jul 2022

El Dorado County Animal Services is reminding residents to keep pets current on rabies vaccines and immediately notify Animal Services of any animal bite to a human or pet. In early July [2022], Animal Services identified a family pet, a domestic cat, testing positive for rabies.

"While we do not often see cats, dogs, and other domestic animals with rabies due to strong local rabies vaccination programs, it's important to emphasize any mammal can be exposed," said El Dorado County Animal Services Chief Henry Brzezinski. "Rabies can be fatal to both animals and humans, so keeping pets current on rabies vaccinations, including cats, dogs, and livestock, is critical."

According to Brzezinski, the cat did not have a rabies vaccination and is believed to have been exposed while roaming outside of its residence on Viking Road in Greenwood in mid-June [2022].

Animal Services has identified rabid skunks in the Greenwood area in the past and most recently identified a rabid skunk near the family's home in mid-May [2022], when the family's dog had contact with the skunk. The dog wasn't current on its rabies vaccine, so he was vaccinated, and is being quarantined for 6 months at home in a double enclosure. He is currently showing no signs of illness.

When the cat suddenly passed away at home, the owners took it to the veterinarian, who then suggested the cat be tested for rabies, given the recently identified rabid skunk near the home. The family and veterinarian's office consulted with Animal Services on any other actions needed regarding their potential exposure.

Rabies is endemic in all 58 counties in California, including El Dorado County. Animal Services identifies rabid animals each year, though there have been no reports of rabid domestic pets in El Dorado County for at least the past 10 years.

The California Department of Public Health's statewide data reports show the following domestic animals identified with rabies from 2014 through 2021 in multiple California counties:

2021: 1 cat Humboldt
2020: 1 cat Amador; 1 dog San Joaquin
2019: 1 cat Fresno; 1 cat Tuolumne
2017: 2 dogs Amador; 1 dog Trinity; 1 cat Sacramento
2016: 3 cats -- 1 Contra Costa, 1 Humboldt, 1 Sacramento; 3 dogs: 1 Amador, 1 Butte, 1 Humboldt
2015: 1 cat Mendocino; 1 cat Monterey
2014: 2 cats: 1 Amador, 1 San Joaquin; 1 dog Sacramento

In 2021 Animal Services identified a total of 11 animals (3 bats and 8 skunks) testing positive for rabies in El Dorado County. Between the months of March and June 2022, a total of 7 rabid animals (6 skunks and 1 bat) were found in El Dorado County. Two rabid skunks were found in Placerville, 2 in Garden Valley, 1 in Georgetown, and 1 in Greenwood. The rabid bat was found in Somerset.

Rabies is a virus spread through the saliva of an infected animal, typically through a bite to its victim. It is usually fatal to pets and humans if not treated shortly after exposure. While any mammal can become infected with the rabies virus, bats, skunks, and foxes are the animals most commonly found to carry the virus. Comprehensive vaccination programs in the United States have meant rabies among domestic pets is now uncommon.

To prevent the spread of rabies:
- maintain current rabies vaccinations for dogs, cats, and livestock;
- keep property free of garbage, stored bird seed, and leftover pet food to avoid attracting wild animals;
- keep pet doors closed at night to prevent entry of wild animals into the home;
- never approach, pick up, feed, or interact with unfamiliar dogs, cats, or wild animals;
- don't approach an animal that appears sick or aggressive. Report it to Animal Services;
- don't touch a dead animal with bare hands;
- call Animal Services if a domestic or wild animal shows sign of rabies (such as staggering, confusion, lack of fear, or aggressive behavior);
- notify Animal Services immediately if a person or pet is bitten or exposed to a suspected rabid animal;
- maintain your property's attic, foundation, and ventilation system to ensure they are properly sealed to prevent wildlife infestation;
- immediately notify Animal Services if you find a bat alive or dead in your bedroom.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed a fox in Laurens County tested positive for rabies. According to DHEC, the fox was found near Fairview Road and Henderson Lane.

Officials said one person was exposed and has been referred to their healthcare provider. They also said one dog was exposed and will be quarantined as required in the South Carolina Rabies Control Act.

The fox was taken to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 18 Jul 2022 and the rabies was confirmed the following day [19 Jul 2022].

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals plenty of space," said Terri McCollister, rabies program team leader. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it, and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer, wildlife control operator, or wildlife rehabilitator."

If anyone believes they have come in contact with this fox or another animal that might have rabies, call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Greenwood's office.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control is warning about a rabid fox found in the Aiken area. DHEC says the fox was found near Talatha Church Road and Cinnamon Road and has tested positive for rabies.

DHEC says one person was potentially exposed and has been referred to their healthcare provider. One dog was also exposed and will be quarantined. This quarantine is required by South Carolina Rabies Control Act.

The fox was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 19 Jul [2022] and was confirmed to have rabies on 20 Jul [2022]. This fox is the 3rd animal in Aiken County to test positive for rabies in 2022.

What are the signs of rabies?
A rabies exposure is defined as direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected animal.

If your pet is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider your pet may have been exposed to rabies.

DHEC wants the community to be attentive to themselves and any pets. If you believe that you, someone you know, or your pets have come in contact with this [fox] or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Aiken office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday) or after hours and on holidays.

How to keep your pets safe
It's important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, which is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease.

[6] Minnesota (Polk County): skunk, puppies
Date: Wed 20 Jul 2022
Source: Fox 9 New [edited]
https://www.fox9.com/news/litter-of-puppies-exposed-to-rabid-skunk-in-nw-minnesota


A litter of puppies in northwestern Minnesota is now in quarantine after one of the 7 puppies was recently carried away by a rabid skunk.

According to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, the owner of the puppies heard a commotion in their yard on 11 Jul [2022] and saw one of the puppies being carried away by a skunk. Two other puppies were barking at the skunk, and the other 4 had scattered by the time the owner intervened.

The puppies were 8 weeks old and were not yet rabies vaccinated. The owner submitted the skunk to the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which confirmed it as rabies-positive on 15 Jul [2022].

The Board of Animal Health recommended the owner euthanize the puppy bitten by the skunk and submit it for rabies testing. Brain tissue samples are required for rabies testing and can only be collected from deceased animals.

Results of the rabies test on the euthanized puppy are pending. The other 6 puppies in the litter must remain quarantined on the property for 6 months and monitored for signs of rabies.

During the Board of Animal Health rabies investigation, officials learned that one of the puppies had been sold on 14 Jul [2022]. The new owners were contacted by the state to discuss the potential rabies exposure. The state recommended the puppy be euthanized and tested for rabies out of an abundance of caution because the puppy was unvaccinated and it's unknown if it ever had contact with the rabid skunk. Results are pending.

Rabies signs
Signs of rabies in animals include staggering, walking in circles, paralysis, agitation, lethargy, lameness, behavioral changes, fearfulness, depression, and attacks on other animals, people, or objects.

The Minnesota Department of Health determined no people were exposed to the skunk and did not advise rabies virus post-exposure treatment. There are also 2 currently vaccinated adult dogs and some livestock on the property.

Rabies vaccines for pets

All dogs, cats, ferrets, and horses should be currently vaccinated against the rabies virus. In the event an animal is exposed or potentially exposed, pets should receive a rabies vaccination booster within 96 hours of exposure.

[Rabies is a disease that knows no borders. It will attack and possibly kill any mammal, including humans. Please note that in the Brazil case, the individual was scratched. Scratches, especially from cats, can transmit the virus. This seems to be the case because of how cats groom themselves.

Wild animals harboring this disease can transmit it to other animals, wild or domestic, or to humans. It is important to be aware of your surroundings. Bites and attacks from wild animals or affected domestic animals can happen anywhere. You do not need to be out in a field or in the countryside. There are numerous cases of individuals being bitten by wild animals while in their own yards or walking along busy streets.

Affected animals can transmit this deadly virus to other animals, even domesticated pets.

Stop rabies in its tracks. Be sure all your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccination. This protects your pets, and ultimately helps protect you. Even indoor animals need their vaccines, and rabid animals can quickly and easily dash in a door or come in through a pet door.

If you are bitten or scratched, be sure to wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention. The wound may need additional attention, and the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and immunoglobulin may need to be administered.

Unfortunately, bats can bite you without you knowing it, especially when you are asleep. A bat found in a room where you sleep is reason to visit your physician immediately.

Please don't let yourself or your pets be a victim to rabies. Protect yourself and your pets. Get the pets vaccinated, and practice vigilance. - Mod.TG
