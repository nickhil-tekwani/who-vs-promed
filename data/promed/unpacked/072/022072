Giardia now affecting 46 people in Yorkshire, UK
-----------------
The number of people in Ilkley suffering from a gastro-intestinal
illness caused by the _Giardia lamblia_ parasite has risen to 46. Dr.
Martin Schweiger, consultant in communicable disease control at the
West Yorkshire unit of the Health Protection Agency, said: "Cases are
continuing to come to our attention -- there are now 46 people who
have tested positive for giardia.

"We are continuing to encourage people to contact their GP if they
feel unwell. If someone has already tested negative for giardia but
their symptoms persist, then they should go back to their GP to be
tested again.

[Giardiasis is an ubiquitous protozoan parasite, and outbreaks, like
the one reported here, are most probable due to contamination of the
water supply. Especially in areas where the source of drinking water
is surface water like rivers and lakes, contamination with Giardia
and Crytosporidia is a possibility. - Mod. EP]
