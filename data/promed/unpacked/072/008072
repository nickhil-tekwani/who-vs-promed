With the death of 4 more children, the toll due to the outbreak of
encephalitis in the North Bihar town of Muzaffarpur went up to 12, a
district medical officer said today [8 Jun 2010].

Having earlier shown symptoms of encephalitis, 4 children succumbed
during treatment in hospital since yesterday [7 Jun 2010], the
district civil surgeon AP Singh told reporters here [in Muzaffarpur].
In the past 2-3 days 8 children had died of the disease, after being
admitted to hospitals and nursing homes. At least 24 children were
undergoing treatment at the SKM and Kejriwal hospitals, Singh said.

The patients complained of excessive vomiting, loose motion
[diarrhea], high fever, all known to be symptoms of encephalitis. A
medical team has been formed.

[Japanese encephalitis virus infection has been the predominant cause
of serious encephalitis causing mortality in children in northern
India in recent years and is the most likely cause of this outbreak.
However other unidentified presumptive viral encephalitic diseases
have been prevalent in northern India in recent years (see archived
references below).

A similar outbreak of an unidentified encephalitis causing childhood
deaths was recorded in the Muzaffarpur district of Bihar in 2005 (see
ProMED-mail Encephalitis - India (Bihar): RFI 20050619.1727) and 10
years (in 1995) before that a similar outbreak of suspected viral
encephalitis occurred in the same district of Bihar. At that time,
preliminary laboratory and epidemiological data excluded Japanese
encephalitis virus infection as the cause of the outbreak, because of
an atypical clinical picture, a low prevalence of potential mosquito
vectors, and negative serology. That outbreak ended with the onset of
rains, which also ended a period of extreme heat. The current outbreak
bears some resemblance to the 2005 and 1995 outbreaks, and the results
of the current investigation are awaited with considerable interest.
