On 24 Aug 2014, there were 333 registered suspected cases of tickborne encephalitis [TBE], including 45 cases in children, which is more than 1.4 times higher than in the same period last year [2013], and 127 patients with viral encephalitis, including 9 children, which is more than 1.3 times higher than in the same period last year. One patient with tickborne encephalitis died.

From 18-24 Aug 2014, medical establishments of the Perm region have [attended to] 173 cases of feeding ticks, including 32 cases in children, which is more than 1.8 times higher than in the same period last year [2013].

The seasonal laboratories investigated 141 ticks for the presence of the TBE antigen, and in 8 cases, the samples were positive. More than 90 per cent of those who suffered from tick bites were not vaccinated against tickborne encephalitis.

Cases of feeding ticks were registered in gardening cooperatives: (77 per cent); in recreation areas (7.5 per cent) (Balatovsky Park); and in a cemetery (7.4 per cent) (North cemetery).

This year [2014] already 37 people, including 4 children, contracted TBE in the Chelyabinsk region, with 2 cases associated with the consumption of raw goat milk.

According to the agency "Ural-press-inform", the press service of the regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing], 20 391 people sought medical aid after tick bites this year [2014] in the South Ural, among them 4742 children. Last year [2013], the number of people affected by tick bites was one thousand less. This year, 157 891 people have been vaccinated against TBE, including 107 402 children.

The leader in the number of [TBE] cases is Ulan-Ude: 12 cases were recorded. As of 26 Aug 2014, 32 cases of TBE were recorded in Buryatia. The largest number -- 12 cases -- have been recorded in Ulan-Ude. This year [2014], almost 3500 residents of Buryatia sought medical aid after tick bites, including 1413 children, reported UlanMedia, with reference to the press service of the Administration of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing] in the Republic of Buryatia.

[Localities affected]: 5 cases of TBE were recorded in the Kabansk district, 4 in Tunkinsky, 4 in Zakamensk, one in the each in Zaigraevsky, Kyakhtynsky, Bichurinsky, Horinskom, Ivolginsk, Muhorshibirskii and Barguzin areas.

This year [2014], 2 lethal cases of TBE were recorded (these people were not vaccinated against TBE and did not seek medical aid after tick bites).

[In Buryatia, 18 of 22 administrative areas are endemic for TBE. In the 2013 epidemic season, 25 cases of TBE were recorded in the Republic of Buryatia, including 5 children under 17 years old. All diagnoses were laboratory confirmed. - Mod.NP]

[Late summer and autumn are the usual seasons for TBE virus transmission. Hard ticks (_Ixodes_) have acquired the virus from their rodent hosts and are reactively questing for late-season blood meals. Mod.CP noted: "Tick-borne encephalitis is now a vaccine-preventable disease. It is caused by closely related but distinct flaviviruses. Three subtypes are recognised by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy: a far-eastern subtype, a Siberian subtype, and a European subtype. The Siberian subtype is associated with Russian spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted predominantly by the tick _Ixodes persulcatus_ (see image at http://www.planktonik.com/museum/images/insects/0205dani01.jpg), whereas the European subtype causes central European encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_ (see image at http://www.biopix.com/photos/ixodes-ricinus-00078.jpg). The former causes the more serious disease, with mortality that can reach 25 per cent, whereas mortality in the case of the latter seldom reaches 5 per cent. Effective vaccines are now available against each subtype."

The types of TBE virus responsible for the above cases are not stated. The Perm and Chelyabinsk cases are most likely due to infections with the European subtype of TBE virus and the Buryatia cases due to the Siberian subtype virus.
