Health Surveillance of Campinas, Sao Paulo state, reported, on 14 Jul 2004,
the laboratory confirmation of 2 more cases of non-tuberculosis
mycobacteriosis, causing localized infection in women receiving silicone
breast implants, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 14.
Up to the present, 40 patients have reported problems with their implants:
the above mentioned 14 with laboratory-confirmed mycobacteriosis; 10 with
infection clinically compatible with mycobacteriosis, but lacking
laboratory confirmation; 6 cases of infection with other bacteria; 4 with
non-infectious post-surgical complications; and 6 still under investigation.
All the cases were operated on before April 2004, when the outbreak was 1st
reported. Investigations are continuing to attempt to locate the source of
the contamination.
