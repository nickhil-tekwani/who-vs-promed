Air Force Academy horses under quarantine with viral infection
--------------------------------------------------------------
The horses in the Air Force Academy's equestrian center have been
quarantined, after 140 animals were diagnosed with a viral infection.
The disease, vesicular stomatitis (VS), has symptoms similar to
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which has been eradicated in the United
States since 1929. VS causes blisters on animals' mouths, hooves, and
teats. The disease can affect horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and
deer.
No horses from outside the academy will be allowed on the base for at
least 30 days.
It is not very contagious, but the infection is spread by
animal-to-animal contact or by insects that carry it. People who
handle infected animals can contract the disease if they don't take
precautions.
No human cases of the infection have been diagnosed.

[This appears to be a different outbreak from the one reported from Colorado
in July 2004 -- see ref. below. Generally, the insects that carry the virus
die after the 1st killing freeze. It seems likely that there has already
been a killing freeze in Colorado. - Mod.TG/JW]
