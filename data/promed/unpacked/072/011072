An outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) is ongoing in Senegal, which was declared by health authorities after confirmation of the 1st case on 10 Nov [2021] by the Pasteur Institute of Dakar.

As of 18 Nov [2021] a total of 3 cases and zero deaths are reported in the health districts of Gossas and Diofior, in the Fatick region.

Rift Valley Fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that causes illness in animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels).

Most people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness with fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness. A small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop much more severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage (excessive bleeding), and encephalitis (swelling of the brain).

Most people recover within one week. Approximately 1% of people who get RVF die.

[Rift Valley fever occurs sporadically in Senegal and usually in domestic animals or, as in 2020, in antelopes. Interestingly, the above report of RVF human cases does not mention cases in domestic or wild animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes or by coming into contact with infected animals or their tissues or milk. There is a vaccine available for animals but not for humans. The only measures available to prevent RVF virus infection is to avoid mosquito bites or contact with infected animals and their products. - Mod.TY
