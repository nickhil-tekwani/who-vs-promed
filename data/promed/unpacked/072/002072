The Ebonyi State Government has declared a state of emergency regarding Lassa fever, as the disease has claimed 3 lives from 5 confirmed cases recorded, while 49 suspected cases were successfully treated.

The Secretary to the State Government, Professor Bernard Odo, who disclosed this yesterday [3 Mar 2016] in Abakaliki, said measures have been put in place to check its spread, especially in the rural areas of the state.

Meanwhile, a male doctor in the state was last month [February 2016] reportedly killed by the disease while performing his one year mandatory National Youth Service Corps. in Kaduna State.

Professor Odo said the state government would, within weeks, stop the spread of the disease with intensive media campaigns, public education, and immediate treatment of every suspected case.

He stated that the state government had begun immediate construction of a diagnostic centre, which would be completed within 3 weeks, and that relevant drugs, equipment and personnel for the centre would be put in place.

Odo said: "Before now, samples were taken to Edo State for tests, but the state governor has directed that we build a centre here at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki [FETHA], and work has already started on the building. In fact, work is going on there day and night, and it should be ready in 3 weeks time."

[Lassa fever reports are coming in from new locations this year (2016). The control campaign includes public education, but nothing explicit is mentioned about rodent control. Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures. Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.
