An article appeared in the New Scientist on May 3, 1997 regarding the
isolation of VRSA (Vancomycin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_) in Japan. A
brief follow-up piece appeared in The Independent, however no other
references to the event in Japan were available in a search I undertook
yesterday on Nexis.
The article provides an overview of historical problems with VRE
(vancomycin resistant enterococci) and MRSA (methicillin resistant _S.
aureus_), but contains no details on how the VRSA isolate was tested
and under what circumstances it was collected. The article indicates a
publication describing the emergence will appear in The Lancet.
No other substantive information was provided in the article. The web
site for New Scientist is:
