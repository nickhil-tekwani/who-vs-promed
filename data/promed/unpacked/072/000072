Main surveillance developments in week 11/2012 [12-18 Mar 2012]
---------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The 2011/12 influenza season started late and has been without any clear geographic progression. The following points are noteworthy this week:
- Decreasing trends were reported by 15 countries, 8 of which have reported such trends for at least 2 consecutive weeks.
- Of 1203 sentinel specimens tested, 502 (41.7 percent) were positive for influenza virus. The proportion of sentinel specimens testing positive for influenza virus has decreased over 3 consecutive weeks.
- Of the sentinel specimens that tested positive for influenza virus 82.9 percent were type A and 17.1 percent type B. The proportion of influenza B viruses reported has doubled over the past 3 weeks.
- There has been a degree of heterogeneity in the antigenicity of the A(H3) viruses this season and an imperfect fit with the A(H3) component in the seasonal vaccine.
- No resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) has been reported so far this season.

Comment
-------
The decrease in the proportion of influenza-positive sentinel specimens together with the growing number of countries reporting continuously decreasing trends in the incidence of ILI [influenza-like illness] or ARI [acute respiratory infection] indicate that the epidemic peak has passed in most European countries. As often observed late in the season, the proportion of influenza B viruses among the detected influenza viruses has been increasing over the past 5 weeks.

Sentinel surveillance of ILI/ARI: medium or low intensity was reported by 25 countries and decreasing trends were reported by 15 countries.

Virological surveillance: of 502 sentinel specimens testing positive for influenza virus, 416 (82.9 percent) were type A and 86 (17.1 percent) type B.

Hospital surveillance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI): Since week 40/2011 [3-9 Oct 2011], 7 countries have reported 1378 SARI cases, most of which were related to influenza infection.

Weekly analysis - epidemiology
------------------------------
During week 11/2012 [12-18 Mar 2012], 27 countries reported clinical data. Low intensity was reported by 9 countries, medium intensity was reported by 16 countries and Sweden reported high intensity (Data tabulated in original test). Spain has reported medium intensity for 10 consecutive weeks and 13 countries have reported medium or higher intensity for at least 3 consecutive weeks.

Geographic spread was reported as widespread by 13 countries (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, and Sweden) for the 2nd consecutive week, regional or local by 10 countries, and sporadic by 3. Poland reported no activity.

Decreasing trends were reported by 15 countries. Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Spain have reported decreasing trends for at least 2 consecutive weeks, suggesting that their influenza seasons have peaked.

Weekly analysis - Virology
--------------------------
In week 11/2012 [12-18 Mar 2012], 27 countries reported virological data. Of 1203 sentinel specimens tested, 502 (41.7 percent) were positive for influenza virus, of which 82.9 percent were type A and 17.1 percent type B. The proportion of influenza B viruses reported has doubled over the past 2 weeks (8.6 percent in week 9/2012 [27 Feb-4 Mar 2012]). This represents 3 consecutive weeks with significant decreases in both number of detections and proportion of positive sentinel specimens, suggesting the peak of the epidemic at the EU/EEA level has passed.

Of the 1950 influenza viruses detected from sentinel and non-sentinel sources during week 11/2012, 1858 (95.3 percent) were type A and 92 (4.7 percent) were type B. Of the 410 influenza A viruses sub-typed, 405 (98.8 percent) were A(H3) and 5 (1.2 percent) were A(H1)pdm09.

Of the 25 388 influenza virus detections in sentinel and non-sentinel specimens since week 40/2011, 24 174 (95.2 percent) were type A and 1 214 (4.8 percent) were type B viruses. Of 11 787 influenza A viruses sub-typed, 11 503 (97.6 percent) were A(H3) viruses and 284 (2.4 percent) were A(H1)pdm09. The lineage of 160 influenza B viruses has been determined: 87 (54.4 percent) were B-Victoria and 73 (45.6 percent) were B-Yamagata lineage.

Since week 40/2011 [3-9 Oct 2011], 627 antigenic characterisations of viruses have been reported, of which 525 (83.7 percent) were A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like.

Since week 40/2011, 716 genetic characterisations of viruses have been reported, 621 (86.7 percent) of which have been A(H3) viruses; 408 (65.7 percent) of which were A(H3) viruses falling within the A/Victoria/208/2009 clade, genetic group 3 represented by A/Stockholm/18/2011. Viruses falling within this genetic group are antigenically diverse and therefore there is an imperfect match with the current vaccine virus A/Perth/16/2009. This is consistent with the decision of WHO to recommend changes in the strain selection for next season.

Between week 40/2011 and week 11/2012, antiviral susceptibility data was reported from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, and the UK. None of the A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses tested for neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility were resistant. All A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses screened for M2 susceptibility to the adamantane class of antivirals were resistant.

No zoonotic influenza infections of humans (that is, viruses not usually infecting and circulating among humans) within EU/EEA countries have been reported to ECDC this week.

In week 11/2012, 19 countries reported 464 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detections. Since week 52/2011 [26 Dec-1 Jan 2012], the number of RSV detections has decreased continuously.
