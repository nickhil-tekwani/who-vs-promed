WHO says 2 suspected Ebola cases in Mali, 57 contacts sought
------------------------------------------------------------
Two people are suspected of having Ebola after coming into contact with a 2-year-old girl who died of the disease in Mali last week, according to data from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control [CDC].

An epidemiological presentation by both agencies, given on Thursday [30 Oct 2014] and seen by Reuters on Friday [31 Oct 2014], breaks down the girl's journey from Guinea to Mali with her grandmother, 5-year-old sister and her uncle, and shows she may have had contact with 141 people in all, 57 of them yet to be identified. One of the 84 contacts who have so far been traced is suspected of having Ebola but has not been tested, the presentation shows. Another 4 suspected cases have been tested; 3 showed negative results, with one result yet to come in.

[2] Liberia: cremation

Liberia: Ebola cremation ruling prompts secret burials
------------------------------------------------------
Treatment centres are half-empty as families keep infected at home to avoid a presidential decree that Ebola victims must be cremated. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf decreed in August [2014] that the bodies of Ebola victims in the Monrovia area be cremated. The government brought in a crematorium and hired experts. The order came after people in neighbourhoods of the capital had resisted the burial of hundreds of Ebola victims near their homes.

Even as Liberians fall ill and die of Ebola, many beds in treatment centres are empty because of the governmental order that the bodies of all suspected Ebola victims in the capital be cremated. Cremation violates values and cultural practices in this western African country. The order has so disturbed people that the sick are often kept at home and, if they die, are being secretly buried. Cremations in the capital, and burials of Ebola victims in body bags outside Monrovia without relatives present, means there will not be a place to honour deceased relatives. Decoration days, where people flock to cemeteries to clean and decorate the graves of relatives, will find that many do not [know] the location of the remains of their loved ones. People will find it hard to accept that they will never see the graves of those killed by the disease. We know that cremation is not part of our culture in our country, but now we have this disease, so we have been asked to change our ways, Tolbert Nyenswah said. We understand that there are secret burials taking place in some communities, he said. We must stop that and report sick people and get them treated.

A recent analysis of bed space at Ebola treatment units concluded that out of 742 spaces, only 351 were occupied, said assistant health minister Nyenswah, who heads the governmental Ebola response. Mortuaries and coffin makers have lost business under the new regulations. For the last 2 months it has been difficult to sell even one casket a day, said Titus Mulbah, an owner of the Talented Brothers Casket Centre. And this is because all bodies now are considered Ebola bodies, as if other diseases are not killing people here. There had been complaints that people who died of something other than Ebola had been cremated or buried anonymously. Television journalist Eddie Harmon said the body of his sister-in-law was added to the bodies of Ebola victims and cremated, even though the family believes she died of hypertension. It is still paining us today because it was unjust and unfair, he said.

Sierra Leone different
----------------------
In neighbouring Sierra Leone, where families often picnic in cemeteries and clean graves on New Year's Day, there have been 1259 Ebola deaths, according to the latest WHO count. Unlike Liberia, the government has not ordered cremations. Ebola treatment units in Sierra Leone have often been full. Still, there is the possibility that loved ones might be buried in unmarked graves and some families still observe traditional practices in which mourners wash and lay hands on the body.

Ebola is spread through contact with bodily fluids. Anthony Banbury, head of the UN Mission on Ebola Emergency Response, said people must change. People are dying every day, and there may be unsafe burial practices, he said in Freetown, the Sierra Leone capital. A commentary on a website, Sierra Leone News Hunters, suggested that a memorial site be built to honour Ebola victims not buried traditionally. It said: "The erection of a monument bearing the names of all Ebola victims would not take away the sad memories but it would at least pacify the broken heart somewhat."

[3] West Africa: Ebola epidemic ending?
Date: Wed 29 Oct 2014

Is the Ebola epidemic ending in Africa?
--------------------------------------
No one knows exactly what is going on in West Africa. Several medical groups, like Doctors Without Borders [MSF], are reporting that they suddenly have far more beds than patients. In some cases, there are empty beds at centers where, just a few weeks ago, people were dying on the streets outside because there was no room.

The trend is especially noted in Liberia, the hardest-hit country. Laboratories are getting fewer samples to test. Ambulance crews are picking up fewer bodies. The World Health Organization confirmed that new cases were dropping. But health authorities are warning that it is too early to celebrate. It is important to remember that this happened once before, on a smaller scale. In March [2014], after alarming reports from Guinea that a rural outbreak had reached the capital, the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] sent experts in to help. The epidemic spread to Sierra Leone, and then to Liberia. But cases grew only slowly, and by May [2014], most of the experts were withdrawn. In early August [2014], the chief scientist for Britain's foreign aid agency said the "end of the epidemic was in sight." He was optimistic. About 800 people were known to be dead then. Cases had actually begun to explode in July, and now about 5000 are dead.

There are some theories as to why the numbers seem to be going down. The leading one is that more West Africans now believe that Ebola exists, are afraid of it, and are touching each other less. In that way, it is like lung cancer, only on a speeded-up time scale. It took 30 years for Americans to fully accept that smoking caused lung cancer. Once they believed, fewer started smoking. Deaths from lung cancer are now much lower than they used to be because many Americans in their 50's and 60's didn't start as teenagers, or quit. But you wouldn't say that the lung cancer epidemic is over.

Because poor West Africans often have many people sleeping in one room, Ebola spreads in households. Because the incubation period is up to 21 days, it often kills the family slowly, one by one. But for each other family that keeps the virus from entering its household, that can mean 5 or 6 fewer deaths.... [Now] tens of thousands of home-care kits have been handed out. They contain gloves, bleach, a bucket, plastic bags and a bleach sprayer. Using them around the sick, and especially during burials, may have helped. Alternatively, hospitals may be empty because more people are dying at home. In Liberia, it has been reported that families are refusing to bring in their relatives because, if they die, they will be cremated.

Another report is that taxi and minibus drivers are refusing to take passengers who are bleeding or vomiting to hospitals. That forces them to die at home -- which is cruel, but could slow the spread of disease to other passengers. [Somebody must be cleaning contaminated taxis and minibuses, yet we haven't heard of a lot of drivers dying. - Mod.JW]

It is also important to remember that epidemics typically come in waves. The reasons for some are obvious, like the weather: flu cases rise in winter, polio cases rise in summer. Pox diseases like smallpox, measles and chickenpox used to surge every few years after a new set of young children was born. For other diseases, the reasons are not clear. Ebola may simply be having a moment between waves.
