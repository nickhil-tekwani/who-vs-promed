Three more people suspected of having DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever) were
hospitalized last Friday, 3 Apr 1998, in Realengo, in the western zone of
the city of Rio.
Their platelet counts were as follows:
F 36 (female age 36) 49,000 (normal = 170,000 to 200,000)
M 25 69,000
F 45 100,000
One of the WHO criteria for DHF is a platelet count of less than 100,000
per ml of blood [lack of platelets leads to bleeding.
The total numbr of cases of DHF is now 5 for the city and 7 for the State
of Rio de Janeiro.

[It is surprising that all these new patients are adults. DHF is usually
more serious in children - Mod.JW
