The Japanese Government has issued an interim report on the origin of the
avian influenza outbreak in the Ibaraki Prefecture in August 2005. The main
findings are:
1) The virus is suspected to have been spread by a vehicle from a meat
processing plant which visited several chicken farms, later found infected,
on the same day.
2) The virus was found to have 97 percent identity with a Guatemalan strain
from 2000-2002.
3) No officially authorised and commercially available AI vaccine is known
to include the said virus strain. It might be concluded that the vaccine,
illegally applied in Japan, might have been an unauthorised one, produced
abroad and smuggled into Japan.

[The vaccine involved in the Ibaraki outbreak included a live H5N2 virus,
which means a deficient inactivation process and lack of post-production
testing.
Control of production, testing, and distribution of animal vaccines is an
essential part of animal disease control programmes; governments are
responsible for their approval and certification. Chapter 1.5.2. of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code deals with risk analysis for veterinary
vaccines. The specific requirements for each vaccine are laid down in OIE's
Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. A new
version of chapter 2.7.12 thereof, dealing with avian influenza, was
adopted by the General Session in May 2005; see
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00037.htm>.
Japan experienced a similar situation in August 2004, when the Ministry of
Agriculture discovered that an outbreak of classical swine fever in
Kagoshima Prefecture had been caused by an unauthorized vaccine.
In view of the vital role vaccines play in disease control and the risks
related to the use of unauthorised vaccines, intensification of law
enforcement, coordinated internationally, deserves prioritisation. - Mod.AS]
