FMD in Majdal Shams
-------------------
On Tuesday afternoon, 19 Nov 2013, a suspected outbreak of FMD in a beef cattle corral, located in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, was confirmed. The virus has been isolated at the Virology Division of the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit Dagan. Serotyping pending.

The affected pen includes 20 head of beef cattle (16 female, 3 male calves), all bearing official eartags and registered as vaccinated. The clinical signs were observed in 3 male and 2 female calves, including lameness, salivation, interdigital ulcerations, and typical lingual and gingival lesions.

Quarantine measures have been applied within an area of 10 km [6.2 mi] diameter around the village.

[Majdal Shams is situated less than 1 km (0.62 mi) from the Syrian border; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams.

Results of the serotyping, expected soon, would be appreciated.

It would be helpful to note the date(s) of vaccination of the affected holding. All cattle, sheep, and goats in Israel are compulsorily vaccinated against FMD, at least once a year; bovines are vaccinated with a quadrivalent vaccine.

Israel's last FMD outbreak, caused by serotype O, was reported in March 2012 (resolved April 2012). During 2011, an extensive epizootic was reported.

Throughout the years, FMD was demonstrating in Israel a clear seasonal pattern, starting in January, peaking in April-May. The current timing is exceptional, and may reflect the situation in neighbouring Syria. Subscribers may recall the unfortunate zoosanitary situation prevailing there. - Mod.AS
