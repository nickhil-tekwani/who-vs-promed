Turkeys at a Lethbridge property have tested positive to a 2nd strain of the avian influenza virus. The birds are on a property within an existing restricted area in the Golden Plains.

The local government area has had 2 cases of avian flu at 2 free-range egg farms in the last fortnight. Another property at Bairnsdale has also tested positive.

Agriculture Victoria has confirmed the H5N2 strain is low pathogenic, but it can affect chickens, ducks, geese, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants and ostriches. Many wild birds can also carry the virus without any signs.

The good news for humans is neither the high pathogenic or low pathogenic strains of the virus are a risk, as they rarely affect humans unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds.

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has confirmed workers and biosecurity officers at the affected properties are taking all necessary precautions, including wearing protective personal equipment. There are also no food safety issues identified, as properly cooked poultry meat and eggs are safe to eat.

However, if someone has had contact with birds on an affected property and is experiencing cold or flu symptoms, the DHHS advises them to call a doctor or the DHHS for medical advice.

Agriculture Victoria said previously experienced incursions of avian influenza viruses have been successfully eradicated.

[Low pathogenic avian influenza can easily mutate to highly pathogenic avian influenza. Measures are being taken to hopefully prevent such an occurrence. Victoria's chief veterinary officer has ordered all poultry to be kept indoors, even for those people who have only a few in a backyard.

Tracing investigations have found a poultry farm near Bairnsdale that has tested positive for H5N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus on 10 Aug 2020.

"Movement controls have been put in place in around the property, which has been quarantined. These controls prohibit, until further notice, the movement of birds, equipment and products within and out of, the designated Restricted and Control Area, except under permit issued by Agriculture Victoria.

"To control the spread of avian influenza, birds on the 1st affected property have been destroyed. Agriculture Victoria has quarantined the 2nd property and is undertaking required depopulation, disposal, and decontamination.

"Agriculture Victoria has scaled up its surveillance and tracing efforts to determine other at-risk properties and contain the risk. Agriculture Victoria continues to sample birds throughout the expanded restricted area."
