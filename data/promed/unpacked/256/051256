This month [March 2018], a medical organization documented about 35 000 cases of infection with leishmaniasis in the countrysides of Idlib, Aleppo, and Hama governorates, in northern and central Syria. Leishmaniasis is a disease that affects the skin or internal organs. It is caused by the leishmania parasite and is transmitted by the bite of sandflies.

The head of the leishmaniasis department in the Mentor organization, Dr Mohammad al-Omar, told SMART that 2 kinds of leishmaniasis spread in the area: cutaneous (skin) leishmaniasis and visceral (internal organs) leishmaniasis. Dr al-Omar added that the disease spreads due to the displacement of the people, dead bodies under the rubble of bombed buildings, the spread of organic waste, and exposed sewers.

Dr al-Omar explained that the treatment for cutaneous (skin) leishmaniasis has 2 stages: topical and muscular. The 1st stage takes up to 8 sessions and the 2nd stage [20 mg/kg/day of pentavalent antimonials, IV or IM, for 20 days].

Last year [2017], visceral leishmaniasis, also known as the black fever, spread in the towns of Harem, Salqin, Darkoush, and Azmarin, northern Idlib, where about 70 cases of infection were registered. The Mentor organization centers monitored and treated the cases, and managed to contain the disease, according to Dr al-Omar, who added that the organization has more than 60 centers and mobile clinics specializing in the treatment of leishmaniasis, and the 27 mobile clinics are ready to head to affected areas on short notice. Dr al-Omar said that the organization has everything needed for the treatment.

This is not the 1st time leishmaniasis has spread among the people of northern and central Syria. [Poor sanitary conditions such as] build-up of garbage, lack of health care, and sewage water leaking into drinking water due via damaged pipes in the sewage systems [increase sandfly breeding and resting sites as well as rodent reservoirs, contributing to the spread of the disease].

[Leishmaniasis has been an emerging infection throughout the Syrian civil war, documented from inside Syria and from refugees. As pointed out here the lack of sanitation provides abundant breeding sites for the vector, the sandflies, and expansion of the small rodent reservoirs of the parasite. With no efforts to control the reservoir and the vectors of leishmania, both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis have been increasing in Syria since the start of the civil war. - Mod.EP
