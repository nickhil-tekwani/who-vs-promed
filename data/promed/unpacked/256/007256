The fatality was a female reported from Alkharj in Riyadh province/region. Both newly confirmed cases were classified as primary cases as was the fatality.

The Ministry of Health (MOH), represented by its Command and Control Center (CCC), has announced that the rumors about the existence of many cases of the Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Hail are absolutely incorrect. Besides, the CCC has pointed out that the number of recorded cases is only one, in addition to another case, which is still being diagnosed.

The MOH has highlighted that all information about MERS-CoV in the Kingdom is available and updated on a daily basis on the CCC website on the MOH Portal, and latest statistics on MERS-CoV cases in the Kingdom are published via the MOH's account on Twitter.

[In the previous update (MERS-CoV (47): Saudi Arabia (QS,HA) 20160327.4122030), I had made a comment re: 5 cases reported from Hail since the beginning of the year (2016). At that time, I was unaware of rumors circulating regarding other cases ongoing in Hail. I noted that 4 of the 5 reported cases were noted to be in critical condition, and the 5th was reported as a fatality at the time of initial confirmation report. While I did not state it, the reporting of all serious cases is suggestive of possible under-reporting of milder case presentations. Of those 5 reported cases, one was associated with the ongoing nosocomial outbreak in Buraidah; 3 were classified as primary cases (only one of whom had a confirmed history of contact with camels preceding onset of illness), and one other's risk factors were under investigation at the time of initial confirmation report. Dates of report of these cases were 25 Feb 2016, 12 Mar 2016, 13 Mar 2016, 19 Mar 2016, and 27 Mar 2016. The case reported on 25 Feb 2016 had a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, and the case reported on 13 Mar 2016 was the case associated with the nosocomial outbreak in Buraidah. The case reported on 12 Mar 2016 had been admitted to a hospital for other medical reasons on 9 Mar 2016 and on 10 Mar 2016 developed symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection.

It will be interesting to see the results of further investigations of possible risk factors in the other cases.
