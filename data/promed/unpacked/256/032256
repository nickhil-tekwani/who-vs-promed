Angola is officially free of Marburg hemorrhagic fever after the
outbreak of the [filoviral] disease that killed 227 of the 252 people
it infected over the last year, Health Minister Sebastao Veloso said.
"There have been no cases of fever since 27 Jul 2005," he said. He
revised downwards the toll taken by the outbreak. On 19 Sep 2005, he
and the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that the epidemic had
killed 329 people of 374 confirmed cases of infection. "16 nurses, 2
doctors and 5 healers" are among those killed, the Minister said.
The latest Angolan outbreak began in October 2004 in a hospital in
Uige province but was not formally identified until March 2005, by
which time the epidemic had prompted the deployment of dozens of
experts from the WHO and other organisations. There is no cure for
Marburg hemorrhagic fever, whose exact origin is unknown and which
was first detected in 1967, when West German laboratory workers in
the town of Marburg were infected by monkeys from Uganda. It spreads
through contact with bodily fluids such as blood, excrement, vomit,
saliva, sweat, and tears but can be contained with relatively simple
hygienic precautions, according to experts. The most serious outbreak
of Marburg until now had been in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
where 123 people died between 1998 and 2000.

[No human case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever has been reported in
Angola since July 2005. The final assessment appears to be that
during the course of the outbreak, there were 252 confirmed cases of
infection and 227 of those died. These figures have been revised down
from the 374 cases and 329 deaths reported by the WHO on 24 Aug 2005.
The Angolan outbreak remains the most serious outbreak of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever so far recorded. This thread is now cut. - Mod.CP]
