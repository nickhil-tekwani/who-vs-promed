The dreaded but rare viral zoonotic disease (from animal to man) caused by monkeypox virus has hit English speaking Cameroon, Andre Mama Fouda, Cameroon's Public Health Minister said on [Thu 17 May 2018].

Going by a press release issued by the Minister, monkeypox was detected in Njikwa, Momo Division, in the North West Region and Akwaya, Manyu, in the South West Region. The release states that the epidemiology surveilance system had recorded cases of human monkeypox in late April 2018. The few cases, the release went on was later confirmed in May with high suspicions of the virus circulating across several health districts.

Studies reveal monkeypox is a viral illness caused by a group of viruses that include chicken pox and smallpox [chickenpox is not in the group. - Mod.TY]. The virus has 2 types, the Central African and the West African types with the West African type being milder and having no records of mortality.

Given the serious consequences of the disease, Minister Mama Fouda urged Cameroonians to take adequate measures in order to reduce the risk of contracting the diseases. In his press statement, the Minister exhorted the population of the North West and South West regions to collaborate with health officials by staying away from sick animals. Persons with fever and rashes were equally urged to rush to the nearest health facility.

[The report does not indicate how many monkeypox (MPX) cases have occurred this year (2018) in Cameroun nor the source of the infections. Apparently, these cases occurred in 3 different areas. Report earlier this year in WMMR stated that, "since 2016, monkeypox cases have been reported and confirmed from Central African Republic (19 cases), DRC (more than 1000 reported per year), Liberia (2), Nigeria (more than 80), Republic of the Congo (88), and Sierra Leone (1) (Table); an outbreak in captive chimpanzees occurred in Cameroon. With 80 confirmed cases, Nigeria is currently experiencing the largest documented outbreak of human monkeypox in West Africa. The emergence of cases is a concern for global health security" (see Monkeypox - Africa (04) 20180327.5712702). This report does not mention human cases in Cameroun, but the cases in chimpanzees in that country indicate that the virus is present.

The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals in order to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occasional occurrence of cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
