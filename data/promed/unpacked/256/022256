Health bosses are urging people aged between 20 and 50 years to have the free measles vaccine following an increase in cases, which include that of a northern beaches man.

The father-of-3 from Allambie told the Manly Daily the disease was utterly debilitating and that it was "the worst" he had ever felt.

The 48-year-old thought he had been vaccinated as a child, although he couldn't confirm it because both his parents had died.

But, Dr Vicky Sheppeard, Director Communicable Diseases, NSW Health, said this week [week of Sun 15 Oct 2017] that most of the state's 29 cases were aged between 20 and 50 and the majority were unaware they were not completely vaccinated as children.

"People aged 20 -- 50 years may have missed out on the full vaccination program for measles, which was changed in 1998 to include a national school-based catch-up, and mistakenly believe they are protected against the disease," Dr Sheppeard said.

"The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective protection against measles, and is available for free for those aged one -- 51 at your GP [general practioner]. If you are unsure whether you have had 2 doses, it is quite safe to have another dose. Measles is highly contagious and is spread in the air through coughing or sneezing by someone who is unwell with the disease."

Symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body.

Dr Sheppeard said it was important for people to watch for symptoms, arrange to see the GP if concerned, and limit exposure to others until the GP has made a diagnosis.

"Vaccination is your best protection against this extremely contagious disease," she said.

NSW Health released a public warning after the Allambie man was diagnosed at the end of September [2017].

Unaware he had the contagious disease and before symptoms appeared, he had visited a number of places on the northern beaches including Warringah Mall and 2 skate parks.

The man told the Manly Daily yesterday [Sun 15 Oct 2017], he had fully recovered and was back at work. After he was 1st diagnosed he said his 3 kids were vaccinated against the disease as babies and urged everyone to get the jab.

A fresh case of measles has emerged in Ballarat that authorities have linked to a flight returning from Bali.

The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed on [Thu 19 Oct 2017] it was contacting all sites in Ballarat and Melbourne where the adult had visited while infectious.

It's believed the patient came into contact with another person carrying the infection on a Jetstar flight from the Balinese capital of Denpasar to Melbourne on [Thu 28 Sep 2017].

Measles is one of the most contagious airborne diseases in the world.

It has an incubation period of 7 -- 18 days, so anyone exposed to this new case in Ballarat may not develop symptoms until 3 Nov [2017].

A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services told The Courier that measles can cause serious illness, particularly in very young children.

"The illness usually begins with common cold symptoms such as runny nose, red eyes and a cough, followed by fever and rash," he said.

"The characteristic measles rash usually begins 3--7 days after the 1st symptoms, generally starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the body.

"Anyone developing symptoms is advised to ring ahead to their GP or hospital 1st and tell them that they have fever and a rash so that appropriate steps can be taken to avoid contact with other patients."

Most cases of measles in Victoria have been linked to international travel, with the disease more prevalent in many overseas countries, especially in Bali.

It comes after 2 people with measles attended Federation University on [Fri 8 Sep 2017], sparking a public health warning.

But that incident was not linked to this week's new case.

The measles vaccine is recommended for babies at 12 months and again at 18 months.

"It is important to continue immunising children because of the risk that infection can be brought in by travellers arriving from overseas," the spokesman said.

"Anyone who is unvaccinated is at risk of contracting measles."

[It is important to remind parents that even when a country has been declared measles-free, as Australia has, the virus may be introduced by travelers. Being free of measles according to guidelines established indicates that endemic measles virus transmission has been interrupted for a period of at least 36 months from the last known endemic case. - Mod.LK]

A deadly outbreak of measles in one of the poorest districts of Balochistan has alarmed the health department, with officials concerned to contain the damage before it spreads to other parts of the province.

Up to 11 children have died from the contagious infection during the past 3 days in Qadirabad area of Naushki district, while 40 are reportedly hospitalised - despite it being preventable with a vaccine.

Confirming the deaths, District Health Officer Naushki Dr Hameed Baloch said, "Medical teams have reached the measles-hit areas and children are being given anti-measles jab to stop the disease from spreading further."

"We visited the houses where deaths have been reported and asked the family members to show vaccination cards. [It was emerged] that a majority of the households had refused to allow the jab for their children," said the DHO.

"People who live in the area often visit neighbouring Afghanistan to meet their relatives without giving their children anti-measles vaccine," Dr Baloch said, adding, "They also do not cooperate with the government officials running anti-measles campaigns."

A new campaign has now been announced in the area following the outbreak of the disease, according to the doctor.

The WHO recommends that 95 percent of 2-year-olds are given the jab to contain any outbreaks, being one of the leading causes of death among young children globally.

Health officials believe many parents avoid getting their children vaccinated due to social and religious issues.

[The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. But Pakistan faces the same problem as many other countries where "vaccine hesitancy" leads to outbreaks of what is a vaccine-preventable disease. There is no reason for children to be dying from measles.

The HSE [Health Service Executive] has issued a warning to the public after 2 confirmed cases of measles in north Dublin.

An Outbreak Control Team has been called in to investigate and control the spread of the potentially serious illness.

The HSE say the source of the measles has not yet been identified.

An alert has been sent to all Emergency Departments and General Practitioners (GPs) in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.

All people identified as contacts of the 2 measles cases are being notified and advised of the risk by Public Health.

The best protection against measles is to be fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccine. If you have symptoms suggestive of measles you should stay at home, not go to school or work and phone your GP and explain that you may have measles.

People who have not been fully vaccinated with MMR vaccine or have not had measles in the past are at high risk of getting measles if exposed.

Those most at risk of catching measles are those who are not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine such as babies younger than 12 months who are too young to be vaccinated, and those with weakened immune systems.

Dr Deirdre Mulholland, Director of Public Health said: "Measles can be a serious illness and is highly contagious. The best protection is to be fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine."
