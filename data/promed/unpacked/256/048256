Authorities of the Social Security Health Service detected the presence of a new strain of _Clostridium difficile_, according to a report by Dr Javier Diaz, Head of Medical Services of the aforementioned institution.

Dr Diaz mentioned that _C. difficile_ is 'less lethal' compared to KPC [the KPC acronym likely refers to _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase-producing Gram negative bacilli]. This _C. difficile_ strain is different from the prevailing microorganism in Panama, since it appears after using antibiotics and another difference is that it may be transmitted through direct contact.

A total of 11 cases were reported last January [2012] and 8 cases in February.

[From a prior ProMED post Clostridium difficile, ribotype 027 - UK: (N. Ireland) 20080207.0498:

"_Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. Recent outbreaks of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased severity, high relapse rate, and significant mortality, have been related to the emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain in North America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain, which hyper-produces toxins A and B, is referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1 and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027. These epidemic strains are characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use of which is one risk factor for disease due to this ribotype (Drudy D, Kyne L, O'Mahony R, Fanning S: gyrA mutations in fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027. Emerg Infect Dis 2007; 13. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm)."

A prior ProMED-mail post (Clostridium difficile, fatal, nosocomial - Costa Rica: (SJ) RFI 20090522.1920) reported a highly virulent strain of _C. difficile_ that may have been ribotype 027 in neighboring Costa Rica in 2009. A similar strain of _C. difficile_ may now be spreading in Panama. More information about this strain would be appreciated.

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection control measures, including prompt patient isolation of patients with _C. difficile_-positive diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms are not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene and control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents (http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF).
