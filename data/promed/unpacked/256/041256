Avian flu discovered among Thailand's wild bird population
-----------------------------------------------
The government announced today [Mon 13 Dec 2004] that a recent survey of
wild birds in central Thailand had shown 6 species infected with bird flu.
The results came from a random sampling of more than 1000 migratory and
indigenous birds in 4 central provinces where infected poultry had
previously been discovered.
The head of the Avian Influenza Operations Center, Dr. Charal
Trinvuthipong, told journalists at Government House in Bangkok that, while
the source of the latest infection remained unknown, it would be the
subject of further close study.
The bird samples were collected in the provinces of Nakhon Sawan, Lop Buri,
Chachoengsao, and Saraburi.
Dr. Charal sought to allay public fears about the possible transmission of
the virus from birds to humans. "It has not been concluded yet that the
avian flu virus can be transferred from birds to humans," he said.
The infected local species were identified as the Little Cormorant, Asian
Openbill, Scaly-breasted Munia (Spotted Munia), Red Turtle-Dove, Black
Drongo, and pigeon.
Dr. Charal added that he would propose a more extensive survey, with a
random sampling of 6000 specimens of each kind of bird.
Meanwhile, the Livestock Development Department has announced that, as of 9
Dec 2004, 71 areas in 19 provinces have reported cases of the virus, with
new outbreaks in the southern provinces of Pattani and Narathiwat.
Since the country was hit by a 2nd-round bird-flu outbreak in July [2004],
Thailand has recorded 5 confirmed cases of bird flu among humans. 4 of the
victims died, while the last patient recovered.

Bird flu outbreaks detected in 2 more Thai provinces
-----------------------------------------------
Thai officials reported 2 more outbreaks of bird flu in the kingdom, saying
wild birds had also tested positive for the deadly virus in 4 provinces
already listed as outbreak zones.
Infected backyard chickens were behind the 2 new outbreaks in the southern
provinces of Pattani and Nakon Sri Thammarat, officials said, on Monday [13
Dec 2004], without indicating how many birds had succumbed to the virus,
which has killed 12 people in Thailand and 20 in Viet Nam in the past year
[2004].
The director of Thailand's bird flu center, Charal Trinvuthipong, said 10
wild birds had also tested positive in 4 northern and central provinces
during tests of 68 local and migratory birds. [10 positives out of 68
tested is indicative of an exceptionally high prevalence, but figures in
the previous item mention different data, namely, a random sampling of more
than 1000 migratory and indigenous birds. Clarification will help. - Mod. AS].
"We now have to check whether those birds got flu from chicken droppings or
somewhere else," Charal told reporters, adding that health officials
planned to conduct another 6000 tests.
The Thai livestock department said that, since Thursday [9 Dec 2004], it
had outbreaks in 19 of the 21 affected provinces under control.
Thailand's poultry export industry, the 4th largest in the world, had lost
up to 80 billion baht [USD 2 billion] in revenue since the start of the
outbreak in late 2003, representing a 1.2 percent loss in national
earnings, according to the government.

[If confirmed, this is a disappointing -- though not unexpected --
development. Thailand's last follow-up report to the OIE was sent on 9 Dec
2004 by Dr. Yukol Limlamthong, Director General, Department of Livestock
Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Bangkok. It stated
that between 2 and 9 Dec 2004, there were no new outbreaks of highly
pathogenic avian influenza in Thailand. The said follow-up report is
included in OIE's current accumulated update on avian influenza in animals
in Asia (type H5), dated 13 Dec 2004, which can be seen at
