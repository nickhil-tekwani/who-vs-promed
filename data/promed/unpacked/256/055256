A 2 week quarantine [has been] announced in the village of Minyalivka in Odessa region's Saratskyi district, where an outbreak of anthrax has been recorded. The State Emergencies Service and the police set up 6 checkpoints there. Sanitary services are carrying out disinfection in the village. Anthrax infection has been confirmed in one person among 5 local residents hospitalized, the TV news service TSN said on [3 Oct 2018].

As reported, officers of the National Guard of Ukraine are being deployed in the area. They are expected to cordon off the region, set up tents with rescuers, and arrange accommodation for people in case of their emergency evacuation. Veterinarians and doctors are monitoring nearby villages.

"We have vaccinated cattle in the 20 kilometer [about 12.4 mi] zone, as well as conducted complete medical examination of residents in the villages of Minyalivka, Furativka, Faraonivka, Petropavlivka, and Starosilia regarding the anthrax infection. No more cases have been confirmed except for these 5 local residents being hospitalized to the Sarata district hospital," chairman of Sarata District State Administration Anton Loban said. [Earlier in this report it is stated that only one person had been confirmed. I suspect that one had laboratory confirmation but that all 5 had typical cutaneous anthrax lesions. - Mod.MHJ]

People in the village are scared, but there is no panic. They are most afraid of the possible destruction of livestock that feeds many families. It is also reported the condition of the hospitalized residents of Minyalivka has improved. They are receiving the necessary treatment in the district hospital. Doctors say the 1st man who was diagnosed with anthrax will be discharged from the hospital in 2 days.

[The official response has been a mite over the top but this is a politically sensitive zone, where things are not always quite what they seem. And there may be concerns that this outbreak might have been facilitated. When handling an anthrax outbreak in livestock, there is no need nor use in slaughtering suspect animals. If they don't die, they recover, which can be aided by long-acting antibiotics. While latent infected animals are possible, they are best managed by annual vaccination of the herd which you will be doing anyway for the next 3-5 years. And one should remember that controlling a minor outbreak such as this is a very useful experience in reminding folk, private and public, what anthrax looks like, to be more aware and therefore better able to recognise any future livestock or human cases, and the control routines are fresh in folks' memories. If there is a "next time" it will go smoother because of this experience. It is not fun learning during an acute epidemic, believe me! - Mod.MHJ
