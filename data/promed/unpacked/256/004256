An outbreak of a cattle disease identified as contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) has struck Katsina state and killed 13 cows.

The outbreak was said to have been recorded over the weekend [20-21 Jan 2018] in Hayin Sheka, Sabuwar Kasa in Kafur local government area and Musawa local government with 10 and 3 cattle confirmed dead, respectively.

The Director, Veterinary Services in the State's Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Dr Isa Abba, who confirmed the development to Vanguard on [Tue 23 Jan 2018], said the outbreak occurred in the state as a result of some cattle herders who went on grazing and returned to the state with the disease. Dr Abba said that the government has since swung into action by intervening and has so far vaccinated about 3000 in-contact animals and all those in the surrounding villages of the affected areas. The animals were vaccinated [against] CBPP, [and received] tysoline and long acting antibiotics, albendazole, and multivitamin injections, among others.

According to Dr Abba, "We got information about the outbreak in Kafur from herder neighbors who told us the man went on greener pasture in Kwara state and came back with the disease. We isolated the animals to avoid the spread. We report to the state government, investigated and recommended some drugs and vaccination. The disease started when he was in that area. We don't know the casualties. But right here, he lost about 10 cattle before we intervened last week [week of 15 Jan 2018]. On that of Musawa, the owner of the cattle went for grazing in Bauchi and Kano states. He came back with the same signs. When we interrogated him, he said he spent about 8 months there."

On preventive measures to arrest future occurrence of such outbreaks, Dr Abba said: "We advised that the cattle rearer should inform the ministry whenever they are going for greener pasture so that we vaccinate them and give them a vaccination record. They should also report to the ministry on return in order to investigate the animals. We advise them to report promptly any strange disease and symptoms before it escalates. We advise them not patronize quacks but professional doctors of husbandry. They should desist from self-medication because there are fake drugs in the markets," the Veterinary Director cautioned the cattle rearers or herders.

Dr Abba said [that] in 2017, the government had vaccinated 800 000 cattle against CBPP, 1.2 million sheep and goats against peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and 2000 dogs against rabies to the tune of N40 million [about USD 111 000] while planning to carry out similar exercises by August this year [2018].

[A handful of CBPP outbreaks are notified annually to OIE, but this is the 1st official occurrence of the disease in Katsina state.

The way CBPP has propagated during this outbreak is classical: this disease moves to new areas at the occasion of return from transhumance in an infected area.

Fortunately, CBPP vaccine was available, and contact animals were vaccinated promptly. The use of antibiotics, however, should not be simultaneous to vaccination but reserved exclusively to animals suffering from clinical signs of the disease if the policy in the country does not envisage compulsory slaughtering of sick animals. - Mod.AB

As underlined by Mod.AB, this is the 1st officially reported outbreak of CBPP in Nigeria's Katsina state. Since the inauguration of OIE's WAHIS interface (in 2005), CBPP has been reported from 17 out of Nigeria's 37 main administrative divisions (states).

The states which have been reportedly affected, so far, by CBPP in Nigeria were: Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Cross River, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Kebbi, Kwara, Niger, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Sokoto Taraba, Yobe, and Zamfara. - Mod.AS
