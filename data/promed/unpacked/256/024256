[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 098 434 with 81 639 (7.4%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 016 795 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 209 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 82 918 cases when compared with the data on 2 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 32 095 (38.7%), Italy for 4585 (5.5%), Spain for 7134 (8.6%), and Germany for 6365 (7.7%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 92.6% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 25.2% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA, Italy, Spain and Germany have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 59 160 deaths have been reported, 55 834 (94.4%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Italy is number 2, and Spain is number 3. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Spain and Turkey have been accelerating. Turkey illustrates how rapidly things can increase: the 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 22 days the country has confirmed 20 921 cases and it now ranks number 9 out of 209 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Polio immunizations suspended; GPEI staff deployed for COVID-19 response
Date: Thu 2 Apr 2020
Source: News5 WCYB, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]
https://wcyb.com/news/coronavirus/polio-immunization-suspended-amid-coronavirus-pandemic


Health officials attempting to eradicate polio say they are being forced to suspend their mass immunization efforts amid the surging coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organization and partners decided that for the next 6 months, all polio activities including national vaccination campaigns and house-to-house surveillance "should be suspended to avoid placing communities and frontline workers at unnecessary risk".

The announcement came after a meeting last week [week of 30 Mar 2020] of the Polio Oversight Board, an expert body coordinated by WHO and partners. The experts noted that while halting efforts to stop polio is necessary given the speed at which COVID-19 is infecting people globally, it will undoubtedly result in the increased spread of the paralytic disease and the numbers of children paralyzed by the virus.

The mass vaccination campaigns -- which occur as frequently as every month -- are critical to stopping polio, as eradication requires that more than 95% of children under 5 be immunized.

The global effort to wipe out polio began in 1988 and was intended to eliminate the disease by 2000. But the initiative has been hobbled by numerous problems including resistance to the vaccines, outbreaks in some instances caused by the vaccines themselves, and little access to conflict areas in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.

It will be up to individual countries to decide whether to suspend their vaccination campaigns, according to a note released after the polio meeting. Officials warned that stopping polio efforts will require scaled-up work once immunization activities can resume.

Polio is endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan and continues to be a problem in about 10 other countries worldwide.

[The full statement of the Polio Oversight Board [POB] can be found at http://polioeradication.org/news-post/call-to-action-to-support-covid-19-response/. "The Polio Oversight Board (POB) has agreed that for the next 4 to 6 months, GPEI [Global Polio Eradication Initiative] programmatic and operational assets and human resources, from global to country level, will be made available to enable a strong response to COVID-19, while maintaining critical polio functions, such as surveillance and global vaccine supply management."

Personnel funded by the GPEI are being deployed to the COVID-19 response to assist with emergency operations and other needs including logistics and surveillance such as case detection and contact tracing.

This is a major collateral damage resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. At present there are 3 endemic countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria) and 17 countries with ongoing outbreaks and an additional 12 countries identified to be at risk of outbreaks. This will be a major setback for the global polio eradication effort. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights
----------
- One new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours: Malawi.

- Supporting and protecting older people is everyone's business: although all age groups are at risk of contracting COVID-19, older people face significant risk of developing severe illness. Read the statement by Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/statements/statement-older-people-are-at-highest-risk-from-covid-19,-but-all-must-act-to-prevent-community-spread.

- As cases start to climb in the South East Asia Region, the regional director Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh held a virtual meeting with health ministers of the region calling for a stronger whole-of-society approach. More information can be found at https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/03-04-2020-covid19-who-calls-for-stronger-whole-of-society-approach-in-south-east-asia-region.

- The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) launched an appeal yesterday [2 Par 2020] for funds towards priority public health measures to help Latin American and Caribbean countries. The funds will be used to implement PAHO's COVID-19 Response Strategy. Further information is available at https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15767.

- Ports, airports and ground crossings require careful monitoring. WHO has produced 2 online interactive courses to provide guidance for the management of ill travellers and for managing COVID-19 cases or outbreaks on board ships. Further details can be found in the 'subject in focus' section below.

Subject in focus: online interactive courses for points of entry
-----------------------------------------------------------------
WHO continues to provide technical guidance in the context of COVID-19 for ports, airports, and ground crossings, including for conveyances. This week 2 online interactive courses have been published on the WHO COVID-19 website. These are based on guidance documents already published that were developed with input from the International Maritime Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Air Transport Association as well as major industry associations.

The interactive courses highlight important information reinforce learning through active recall -- by engaging learners to answer short quizzes and respond to different scenarios in a safe learning environment.

- Online course for the management of ill travellers at point of entry
This interactive e-learning course is based on the WHO Interim Guidance for Management of ill travellers at Points of Entry -- international airports, seaports, and ground crossings -- in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. This course is intended for National IHR Focal Points, public health authorities, and operators at points of entry, conveyance operators, and other stakeholders. The course can be accessed through https://extranet.who.int/hslp/training/course/view.php?id=325.

- Online course for operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreaks on board ships
This course has been developed using the WHO Interim Guidance for Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreak on board ships. It is intended for any authority involved in public health response to a COVID-19 public health event on board ships, including IHR National Focal Points (NFP), port health authorities, local, provincial, and national health surveillance and response systems, as well as port operators and ship operators. The course can be accessed through https://extranet.who.int/hslp/training/mod/scorm/view.php?id=5774.

An online course for operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreaks in aviation is under development.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 205. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 51 countries (including 16 territories) from the Americas region, and 45 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 30 561 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 86.1% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (3.6%) and Brazil (3.7%). The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 38 802 (51.2% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 3499 (72.5%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 12.0% of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 20.9% of newly confirmed cases, Germany for 15.9% of newly confirmed cases, and the UK for 10.9% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 60.0% of newly confirmed cases in Europe. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 2875 new cases representing 70.7% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates represent 3.9%, 4.1%, and 5.2% respectively. In the African region, Algeria reported 24.8% of the newly reported cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon with 19.1% and South Africa at 14.6%. of the newly reported cases in the region. In the Western Pacific region, the Philippines reported 26.3% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Japan reported 19.0% of the newly confirmed cases, followed by the Malaysia at 17.0%. In South East Asia, India reported 59.1% of newly confirmed cases, followed by Indonesia at 20.3% and Thailand at 18.7% of newly reported cases.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [3 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve seems to show Europe plateauing, but the Americas are adding to the overall height of the curve.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
