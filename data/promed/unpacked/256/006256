Veterinarians are warning Las Vegas dog owners tonight about a dog lice outbreak. Doctors say there's been an unusually high number of cases in the past month or so.

"(Dog) lice isn't very common to see, but when we have a lot of cases coming in, we do get concerned," said Dr. Taylor Parker with Lone Mountain Animal Hospital.

Dr. Parker says Lone Mountain Animal Hospital is one of many animal hospitals across the valley seeing this issue.

"Dogs are coming in with a bunch of itching, scratching; some are losing some hair, and then when we look at the dog, we see some actual lice on the dog."

The bugs are either white or brown and lay white eggs.

"If dogs are in a small confined area and they are exposed to each other just by contact alone, they will get lice," said Dr. Parker. "And it can spread very quickly. We are seeing it most commonly in areas where dogs come together a lot."

Dr. Parker warns you to think twice about dog parks and doggie daycares during this time where we are seeing so many lice cases. She says that if you are going to continue to go to these places, make sure your dog has had some form of a topical treatment like Revolution or Frontline.

"It's so easy to pass it along," she said. "One dog can infest a bunch in one day."

Dr. Parker notes that our climate and geographical location make a dog lice outbreak unusual.

"It's crazy that in the middle of the desert in the summer, we're getting a huge infestation of it."

[Lice are species-specific, meaning dog lice are specific to dogs. These lice do not affect humans.

Lice have limited mobility; they can crawl, but are unable to jump, hop, or fly. Also, adult lice die in a few days if they fall off the host. Transmission must be through direct contact with another infested animal. Lice may be a threat wherever dogs congregate, such as daycare centers, dog shows, and parks.

You can see the parasite itself by parting the hair and examining the hair shaft. Adult lice are large enough to be visible to the naked eye, roughly the size of a sesame seed, about 3 millimeters [0.12 in], and are yellow to tan in color. They are sometimes mistaken for dandruff.

Dog lice are small, flat, wingless 6-legged insects that live in the hair and feathers of mammals and birds. Strong hook-like claws at the end of each leg allow them to hang on to the hair shafts. The claws are tailored to the specific size of the host's hair shaft or feathers, which is why lice are species specific. They survive on skin debris, sebaceous secretions, feathers, or the blood of the host animal.

There are 2 types of lice:
1) Chewing lice survive by eating skin debris and surface secretions. There are 2 species of chewing lice affecting dogs and wild canids -- _Trichodectes canis_ and _Heterodoxus spiniger_. _H. spiniger_ is found mostly in tropical regions and is rare in North America. These are characterized by a blunt, flat head.

2) Sucking lice need blood to survive. The species of sucking lice affecting dogs is called _Linognathus setosus_. Unlike chewing lice, these have a sharp pointed mouthpiece.

Chewing lice will move around more than the sucking lice, which, like ticks, embed their piercing mouthparts into the skin. If you suspect an infestation of dog lice, you might want to go over the area with a flea comb and examine the hair. One way to distinguish lice from dandruff is by shaking hair removed from the dog. If the small flakes fall off, it's dandruff. If they cling stubbornly to the hair, it's probably lice.

Other signs of lice infestations include:
- Scratching and itchiness
- Rough, dry, or matted coat
- Hair loss, specifically around ears, neck, shoulders, groin, and rectal regions
- Small wounds or infections from bites by sucking lice
- Anemia, in extreme cases or in small dogs and puppies
- Tapeworms and other bacteria or parasites that are spread by lice

Monthly flea and tick preventives have made lice infestations rare among well-cared for pet dogs. Today, lice are found mostly on animals who are old, sick, stray, or feral. To start, in severe infestations, matted hair should be clipped. You can also use flea combs to removed live and dead lice.

Many insecticides are effective treatments for lice in dogs. According to the Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC), Fipronil, imidacloprid, and selamectin are all effective. Topical permethrin can be used on dogs with good effect.

Caution should be exercised as these products are specific for a species. Do not use dog products on a cat. They can be toxic to a cat and can kill them. Only use products specific to the cat. Remember the lice are species specific so if your dog has lice, then those lice will not be on your cat. Cats have their own lice, which will not be on dogs.

What is not clear from this article is where the infestation has started, and how far in the area it has spread?

When animals come into a veterinary clinic displaying itching, then observations, lice combs and/or skin scrapings will take place. These are diagnostic tests necessary to determine why the animal is scratching and what the appropriate course of action is.

As mentioned above, there are products to treat specific parasite infections. Was the outbreak started by stray dogs? Was the outbreak maintained in strays or by owned pets who were not brought to a veterinarian for treatment?
