This alert advises of a possible outbreak of legionnaires’ disease associated with a hotel in Calpe, Costa Blanca, Spain. In the last week the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has received notifications of four confirmed cases of legionnaires’ disease and a probable fifth case associated with a hotel in this area. A further 16 possible cases are currently being investigated. The onset date of the probable case was 16th January and it is therefore possible for further cases to develop.

Clinicians are reminded that legionnaires’ disease is a notifiable disease and must be reported to the local authorities. They are also asked to consider:

- legionnaires’ disease as a possible diagnosis in patients who may present with flu-like symptoms and/or lower respiratory tract symptoms and who have returned from Calpe, Costa Blanca in the last two weeks;

- arranging urinary antigen testing of all suspected cases.

[For a discussion of legionellosis, see ProMED-mail post: Legionellosis - Spain (05): Madrid 20101115.4142. Dr Steve Berger has noted that rates of legionellosis have been increasing in Spain (http://www.gideononline.com/2010/06/12/legionellosis-in-spain/). It is not known if this is due to increased reporting or an actual increase in acquisition of this infection.

Costa Blanca refers to the over 200 kilometers of eastern Mediterranean coastline in the province of Alicante, Spain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Blanca). Calpe is a coastal town in Alicante province, 67 km north of the city of Alicante (http://wikitravel.org/en/Calpe#b). The province of Alicante is located in the southern part of the Valencian Community, one of 17 autonomous communities in Spain.
