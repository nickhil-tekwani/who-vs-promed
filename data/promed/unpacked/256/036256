HEALTH HAZARD ALERT --HICKORY FARMS BEEF STICK MAY CONTAIN DANGEROUS
BACTERIA
January 12, 1999
CFIA press release
OTTAWA -- The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is warning the public
not to consume two specific lots of Hickory Farms Beef Stick, beef
summer sausage imported from the United States. The sausage is sold
in a vacuum packed 375g package which does not bear a "keep
refrigerated"warning. In addition to the product label, each package
is identified with a clear plastic sticker bearing the following code
EST 222 8255 8258 or EST 222 8255 8257.
It is possible that the product contains the bacteria responsible for
Botulism in humans.
Botulism is a life-threatening illness caused by the build-up of
toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria.
Hickory Farms is recalling the two affected lots from the
marketplace. The product was distributed all across Canada.
[Does not mention the USA, but since the product was manufactured
there, I suppose it might also have been distributed there - Mod.JW

Food contaminated with _C. botulinum_ bacteria may not look or smell
spoiled. Consumers should dispose of remaining product immediately.
The product should not be consumed by humans or animals.
