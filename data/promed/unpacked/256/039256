[From a previous post: Many veterinarians have opted not to vaccinate for
leptospirosis at all, even though pre treatment with diphenhydramine
usually prevents allergic reactions. I am concerned about the possibility
of a decrease in herd immunity that could eventually put us in an outbreak
situation.
There is a growing trend in veterinary medicine to more carefully evaluate
the need for repeated vaccinations in general. What is the risk that is
imposed by not giving the Leptospira component of routine vaccinations? The
incidence of Leptospira in domestic pets is very low. Is this due to
vaccination? Not necessarily.
The Leptospira reported for the last 20 years have been primarily _L.
pomona_, _L. grippotyphosa_ and _L. bratislava_ which are not vaccinated
for. The incidence of these infections is very low and the low risk of
exposure and low infection rate is likely the cause of the low incidence
rather than vaccination.
There are large populations that do not receive vaccinations and these are
often the populations that are more rural and more likely to have exposure.
Are these populations protected by natural immunity?
The dogs that have reactions and have the Leptospira component eliminated
from their vaccines are usually very protected small breed dogs that are
very unlikely to have exposure. My suspicion is that they are not a great
risk for causing weakness in herd immunity.
I have had no deaths from several dogs with three serovars represented and
there are two publications mirroring this lack of mortality but typical
morbidity associated with infection and would like to correct the
overstatement of the severity of this infection particularly if identified
early and treated appropriately.
I think the economics of vaccination would be seriously evaluated if this
type of vaccination were proposed for people for a disease of similar
incidence, mortality, and contagion.
