The cheese producer Dischamp was informed yesterday morning, 4 Sep 2012, by the regional health agency that 48 people were infected by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Dublin from a batch of Saint-Nectaire farm cheese.

The lot no. D21950033 was sold between 10 Aug 2012 and 5 Sep 2012. It represents 3500 cheeses, that is, 5 tons of cheese.

Of the 6 clusters, 4 are linked to the Dischamp cheese. Distributors of this product have already been informed and it is being removed from displays.
