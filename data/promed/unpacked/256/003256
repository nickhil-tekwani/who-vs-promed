Taipei, March 20 (CNA)-- The Council of Agriculture (COA) announced a pork
export ban on Thursday following an outbreak of foot-and- mouth disease at
local hog ranches. COA Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung said the contagious
disease has hit 20 hog ranches in nine counties around the island, including
Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and
Pingtung.
The COA has formed a special task force together with the Board of Foreign
Trade and the Bureau of Commodity Inspection and Quarantine to address the
problem, Lin said.
Meanwhile, Lin said, the COA has informed Japan of the outbreak of the
disease at local hog ranches and of its decision to ban pork exports. Japan
has been the largest market for Taiwan pork. Taiwan exported US$1.55 billion
worth of pork last year, of which 99 percent went to Japan. Thousands of
hogs raised here have contracted the disease, also known as Aphthous fever.
It is an acute, contagious disease that can be spread through air and
infects mainly cloven-hoofed livestock and wild animals. Its mortality rate
is about 5 percent, but the rate can reach 50 percent among young animals.
Taiwan currently has about 20,000 hog ranches, which raise a total of 10.51
million hogs. The outbreak of the disease may kill about 500,000 young hogs,
or 5 percent of the total, COA officials said. The foot-and-mouth disease
broke out twice in Taiwan between 1913 and 1929, but did not hit here again
until recently. Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea are the only three Asian
countries not having been declared the disease-stricken areas. COA
officials suspect that the culprit of the current epidemic might have come
from mainland China or Southeast Asia. The officials worried that the
outbreak will deal a severe blow to Taiwan's hog industry, whose annual
production reaches about NT[New Taiwan]$89 billion (US$3.24 billion), or 21
percent of Taiwan's total annual agricultural output.
After the COA asked all customs offices to withhold pork exports early
Thursday morning, the domestic wholesale pork market nearly collapsed. In
the southern Taiwan area, wholesale pork plunged from NT$6,000 per 100
kilograms to NT$3,500 on Thursday, but few deals were struck. The pork
export ban will remain valid at least a year and may last even longer.
Taiwan exports about 6 million hogs to Japan annually. The export ban will
certainly cost Taiwan's hog industry dearly. As for its impact on Taiwan's
overall exports, Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said the adverse impact
will be limited because agricultural products, including processed items,
account for only 3 percent of Taiwan's total annual exports.
The disease was first found in Hsinchu county in northern Taiwan. About 100
infected hogs in the region have died in the past week. The stronghold of
Taiwan's hog industry is in the south of the island. The southern counties
of Pingtung, Yunlin, Tainan and Kaohsiung account for about 80 percent of
the island's total hog output. About 4,500 hogs in those regions have been
infected with foot-and-mouth disease, but the exact figure is still not
available.
To prevent the spread of the disease, the COA has banned all hog raisers
from removing their hogs. Agricultural and public health officials will
keep close watch on hog ranches to prevent all deceased or infected hogs
from flowing into the local market. All deceased and infected hogs will be
incinerated or buried properly in the next few days, while healthy hogs will
be inoculated. The COA will import a large quantity of the vaccine to meet
the demand.
With Taiwan's technology and experience, COA officials said, they are
confident that the disease will soon be controlled. The pork export ban
could be lifted one year after the last infected case is resolved, the
officials said.
