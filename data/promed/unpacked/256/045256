[ProMED-mail's attention has been drawn to the fact that an updated version
of the original CDC MMWR report on LCMV risk factors of 5 Aug 2005
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5430a3.htm>
was released as a Dispatch on 12 Aug 2005 and that this Update addresses
many of the concerns expressed by Drs. Peters and Calisher in "Human
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (03): risk factors 20050813.2376." An
edited version of the MMWR Update is reproduced below. - Mod.CP]

Update: Interim Guidance for Minimizing Risk for Human Lymphocytic
Choriomeningitis Virus Infection Associated with Pet Rodents
-----------------------------------------------
In May 2005, CDC received reports of illness in 4 solid-organ transplant
recipients who were later determined to have been infected with lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) from a common organ donor (1 ). 3 of the 4
organ recipients died, 23 to 27 days after transplantation. This report
updates information about the ongoing investigation and provides interim
measures for reducing the risk for LCMV infection from pet rodents
associated with this outbreak.
Epidemiologic investigation traced the source of the virus to a pet hamster
recently purchased by the organ donor from a pet store in Rhode Island.
LCMV testing of other rodents at the pet store identified 3 other
LCMV-infected rodents (2 hamsters and a guinea pig). All 4 pet rodents had
been supplied by a single distributor, MidSouth Distributors of Ohio.
Preliminary test results determined that 4 (3.4 percent) of 115 hamsters
sampled from the Ohio distributor had active LCMV infection. On the basis
of sequence analysis, the LCMV from the transplant recipients, the donor's
pet rodent, and from rodents obtained from the Rhode Island pet store and
the Ohio distributor were determined to have the same lineage (i.e., likely
to share a common source). Under the authority of the Ohio Department of
Agriculture, the MidSouth facility was quarantined. The MidSouth owner
voluntarily depopulated the facility; the premises also will be disinfected.
LCMV test results for the sampled rodents and records reviewed at the Rhode
Island pet store and at MidSouth Distributors indicate that LCMV-infected
pet rodents might have been transported from the Ohio facility to pet
stores in the northeastern and midwestern United States as early as
February 2005. Ohio authorities and CDC are working to determine which
stores and states have received potentially affected shipments from the
Ohio facility. CDC also is conducting an ongoing traceback investigation of
the breeding facilities that supplied MidSouth Distributors.
Background Information
----------
LCMV infection in humans with normal immune systems usually causes either
asymptomatic or mild, self-limited illness. Aseptic meningitis also can
occur in some patients, but the infection is rarely fatal (2). However,
LCMV infection during the 1st or 2nd trimester of pregnancy can cause
severe illness or developmental defects in the fetus, including
hydrocephalus, psychomotor retardation, blindness, and fetal death (3). The
frequency with which developmental defects occur after in utero LCMV
infection is not known. In addition, LCMV can be a serious infection in
persons with impaired immune systems.
Pet hamsters and guinea pigs are not known to be natural reservoirs for
LCMV. However, pet rodents can become infected if they have contact with
wild house mice (_Mus. musculus_) (e.g, in a breeding facility, pet store,
or home). Although infection of other animals with LCMV might be possible,
documented infections in humans have occurred only after exposure to
infected mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters (2,4). Most human cases are
associated with wild house mice, which are considered the primary reservoir
(5).
Serologic testing of pet rodent species for antibodies against LCMV has not
been reliable; the tests have not detected antibodies in animals with
active infections demonstrated by other tests (i.e., immunohistochemistry
staining of tissues and virus isolation). The unreliability of serologic
testing is of concern, because certain species of pet rodents infected with
LCMV can shed virus for up to 8 months without signs of illness and thus
can be a source of infection for humans (4,6).
A large outbreak of LCMV infection associated with pet hamsters sold by a
single distributor was reported in 1974, when 181 symptomatic human cases
were identified in 12 states; no deaths occurred (7). The outbreak was
controlled by voluntary cessation of the sale of pet hamsters and
subsequent destruction of the infected breeding stock. Stores were advised
that all caging material be decontaminated or destroyed before receiving
new animals. In addition, the public was informed of the risk for infection
from hamsters purchased during the outbreak at stores supplied by the
affected distributor (8).
Pet Stores with Potentially Infected Rodents in Stock
----------
2 national retail chains have temporarily stopped the sale of potentially
affected rodents (e.g., hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, rats, chinchillas,
and mice) originating from MidSouth Distributors since February 2005. Pet
stores that have received rodents from MidSouth Distributors since February
2005 should contact the appropriate authority in their states (i.e., state
health department or state department of agriculture) for additional
information and guidance.
Although LCMV is known to infect hamsters and guinea pigs, data are
insufficient to determine the potential for infection of other rodent
species (e.g., chinchillas, dwarf hamsters, or gerbils). However, husbandry
practices in breeding facilities, distribution centers, and pet stores make
cross-contamination with LCMV of other species a possibility. CDC is
working with retailers in the pet industry to consider appropriate testing
of these other rodent species.
Practices that can lead to cross-contamination of rodents include 1)
housing healthy rodents in the same room or bin or in cages near
potentially infected rodents (i.e., rodents from the MidSouth Distributors
facility in Ohio); 2) handling or caring for rodents without washing hands
or changing gloves after handling other rodents and between other
animal-care activities, such as cleaning cages; 3) placing rodents in cages
that previously housed other rodents without 1st decontaminating the cages
with bleach or other appropriate disinfectants; and 4) reusing materials
(e.g., water bottles, food dishes, bedding, or toys) that might be
contaminated by potentially infected rodents.
Pet rodents that did not originate from MidSouth Distributors of Ohio and
were not exposed to potential cross-contamination can be sold or
distributed as normal. In addition, non-rodent species (e.g., ferrets and
rabbits) can be sold or distributed as normal.
Pet stores are advised to work with state authorities to minimize the risk
for transmission of LCMV from affected rodents to humans. Options
considered by state authorities include 1) stopping sale or distribution of
all rodents originating from MidSouth Distributors of Ohio since February
2005, 2) stopping sale or distribution of hamsters and guinea pigs
originating from MidSouth Distributors of Ohio since February 2005, or 3)
allowing distribution (i.e., sale or adoption), provided that appropriate
educational material (e.g., state-approved informed consent or fact sheet)
is provided to purchasers of pet rodents originating from MidSouth
Distributors since February 2005. Educational material should disclose the
specific LCMV risk in this population of pet rodents and potential outcomes
in humans, including birth defects and fetal deaths. If sale of rodents is
allowed to continue, populations at high risk (i.e., pregnant women, women
who think they might become pregnant, and persons with weakened immune
systems) should be advised against purchasing a pet rodent (9).
Preventing LCMV Infection in New Supplies of Rodents
----------
Efforts are under way to ensure that animal facilities and equipment in
retail outlets are disinfected, that new supplies of rodents come from
sources free from LCMV, and that cross-contamination between new supplies
of rodents and potentially infected animals will not occur. Surfaces,
cages, and any reusable equipment that has been in contact with affected
animals, their waste, or bedding material should be cleaned and disinfected
by using a household disinfectant according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Persons who are pregnant or have compromised immune systems
should not engage in cleaning and disinfection related to these affected
animals or other rodents. CDC and other partners will work with breeders
and retailers in the pet industry to implement quality-assurance programs
to minimize the risk for LCMV infection in rodents that are sold to the public.
Previously Purchased Pet Rodents
----------
Testing of individual pet rodents in households is not a recommended
strategy to minimize risk for LCMV infection; the probability of any one
rodent in the United States being infected is low. The greatest infection
risk for a pet owner is likely to occur soon after purchase of a pet
rodent. Thus, most exposures likely already have occurred for existing
owners and substantial added risk is unlikely to result from continued
ownership of the rodent. However, women who are or who plan to become
pregnant and persons who are immunocompromised should avoid contact with
all rodents.
To prevent any possible infection of other rodents in stores, owners should
not return pet rodents from MidSouth Distributors to pet stores. For legal,
ethical, and wildlife conservation considerations, owners should not
release pet rodents into the wild. Persons who no longer wish to keep their
pet rodent should consult a veterinarian.
CDC continues to work with state public health officials and retailers in
the pet industry to educate the public regarding safe handling of pet
rodents and has prepared educational material for reducing the risk for
LCMV infection from pet rodents. Rodents and other pets from any pet store
pose some risk for transmitting certain infectious diseases and should be
handled appropriately. Additional information about reducing the risk for
infectious diseases from pets is available at
