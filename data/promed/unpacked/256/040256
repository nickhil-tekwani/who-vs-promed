With 1 more death reported from Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital, the number of encephalitis deaths has gone up to 24. Altogether, 123 AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] patients were admitted to the children's ward of the ANMMCH with AES symptoms. Of these, 35 of the patients were found suffering from Japanese encephalitis, the more deadly form of the disease.

Confirming 24 deaths due to AES this season, ANMMCH superintendent Dr SK Sinha said that 35 of the 123 AES patients admitted to the hospital this season tested JE positive. Giving a further breakdown, the superintendent said that of the 23 deaths reported this season, 8 suffered from Japanese encephalitis while the other 15 died due to AES.

Now that the temperature has come down and winter is beginning to set in, there was little likelihood of the disease spreading any further. Altogether 96 encephalitis patients have been discharged while another 4 were undergoing treatment in the children's ward of the hospital; 2 of the patients were discharged on Friday [13 Nov 2015] after satisfactory recovery.

The encephalitis survivors have suffered mild to severe mental retardation and physical infirmities, particularly weakening of the upper and lower limbs. Facilities for the rehabilitation of the AES survivors are not available in the hospital and as such the discharged patients have to fend for themselves. According to activist Brajnandan Pathak, the affected patients -- being very poor (almost all of them belong to the Mahadalit social group) -- cannot afford rehabilitation at centres outside the district.

As per available statistics, the maximum number of AES deaths were reported in 2011 when no fewer than 70 children died of encephalitis in ANMMCH alone. In 2009 too, 46 AES deaths took place. The numbers of affected children in 2011 and 2009 were 321 and 151 respectively.

Health officials claim to have undertaken a massive immunisation drive in the district to prevent [spread of] the deadly disease. But the claims have fallen flat after the outbreak of the disease which took almost epidemic form.

[This report gives definite numbers of cases due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infections. However, the etiology of the AES cases remains undetermined. A 22 Sep 2015 report indicated that there were 10 834 AES cases in 2014. That report describes AES as "a group of clinical neurologic manifestations caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals and toxins" (http://zeenews.india.com/news/health/health-news/india-had-over-10000-acute-encephalitis-syndrome-cases-in-2014_1800724.html).

Previous ProMED-mail posts have implicated Reye syndrome, consumption of lychees, and heat stroke, as well as JE virus infections, as responsible for AES. The above report indicates that a massive immunization drive has been taken in the district, but the type of immunization is not specified. Presumably, it is JE virus vaccine, since the etiology of the AES cases is not identified. Prevention and control of AES will be difficult until there is a clear indication of the etiologies involved in these cases. - Mod.TY
