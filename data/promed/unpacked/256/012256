A parent whose child was among those killed by yet to be identified disease that broke out at Government Science Secondary School [SS] in Kurfi has demanded explanation for the cause of his son's death. [The father], whose son, a 13 year old, was among the 8 that died, said, "We are being kept in the dark as to what was wrong before the death. I have reached out to the authorities and doctors to know the cause to no avail."

[The father] said although the dead could not be returned to life, knowing the cause of death could check future occurrences and calm the tensed atmosphere especially with parents whose children were in the affected school. "It's worrisome that we are still being kept in the dark. I have another child in the school," he said. Speaking of the late [son], [the father] said, "My son took ill overnight. He had severe body temperature and was rushed to the hospital the next day. I was with him as he kept holding his stomach. A doctor examined him and prescribed some drugs which were sent for. Before the medicines came, my son died in my presence."

Up till press time, the executive secretary of the Science Schools Management Board, Lawal Bosa, under whose purview the school is, had failed to respond to enquiries made to him. It could be recalled that an outbreak of a strange disease at the Government Science Secondary School Kurfi killed 8 students, prompting a closure of the school [Is this a separate event? - Mod.SH].

A strange disease described, as 'mysterious epidemic' on [Mon 19 Mar 2018], struck Government Science Secondary School, Kurfi, in Katsina State and killed about 8 students of the school. The development was said to have forced the State Board for Science and Technical Education to shut down the school indefinitely and send its students home.

A senior government appointee of the board, who preferred to be anonymous confirmed the outbreak in the school, said the board closed the school to avoid the spreading of the epidemic to other students. "We have closed down the school indefinitely to avoid the spreading of the epidemic to other students. Measures are on top gear to vaccinate students of other schools to stop similar incident," the source said.

This is even as the State Assembly slammed the Board for the closure of the school, saying the action of the Board was capable of spreading the epidemic. Kabiru Lawal, a lawmaker representing Kurfi constituency at the Katsina House of Assembly, who confirmed the incident to his colleagues during plenary on [Mon 19 Mar 2018], under Matters of Public Importance, called for urgent attention by government. He said, "I am urging the House to step in. The epidemic has now forced the school authority to close the school down and send students back home."

Other lawmakers in the Assembly also claimed that similar epidemic occurred in their constituencies. Garba Useini, representing Kafur Constituency and Bishir Mamman of Dutsin-ma constituency, informed the House that the epidemic has broken down in their respective constituencies, but they could not ascertained the numbers of casualties recorded.

Presiding over the plenary, Abubakar Kusada, the speaker of the assembly, directed the House Committees on Education and that of Health to conduct a thorough investigation on the incident and report back to the House for urgent action.

[Katsina State is located in north west Nigeria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsina_State). Kurfi, where the 8 students died of an undiagnosed disease, is one of 34 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Katsina State, with a population of 117 581 in 2006 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurfi). Kafur and Dutsin-Ma are other LGAs in Katsina State, where lawmakers (see news report #2 above) in the State Assembly also say "the epidemic has broken down in their respective constituencies". Jibia is another LGA in Katsina State, where 8 died of meningitis, the type not being specified in the news report (see news report #3 above). A map showing the location of LGAs in Katsina State and the location of Katsina State on Nigeria can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-Katsina-State-Showing-the-Location-of-Dutsin-Ma_fig1_263809397.

Earlier this month [March 2018], ProMED-mail reported a meningitis outbreak in the adjacent Jigawa State (ProMED-mail post Meningitis - Nigeria: fatal 20180307.5672461).

Northern Nigeria lies within the African meningitis belt, the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt, beginning in 2010, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other serogroups, notably serogroup C, and other bacterial species.

Although the organisms causing the current meningitis outbreaks in Jigawa State or in Jibia LGA in Katsina State are not given, it may very well be meningococcus serogroup C, which caused an outbreak in Nigeria in 2017 (see also's below). ProMed-mail would appreciate more details concerning the meningitis outbreaks in Jigawa State or in Jibia LGA in Katsina State and the undiagnosed outbreaks in Kurfi, Kafur and Dutsin-Ma LGAs in Katsina State from knowledgeable sources.
