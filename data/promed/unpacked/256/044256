The number affected by pneumonia in Murcia [province rises to 470;
analyses confirm that in 178 instances, the cause is legionella.
A total of 470 people, of whom 10 are in the ICU, have been tended to in
Murcia region for pneumonia most likely caused by the legionella epidemic
unleashed Friday in [Murcia city, informed Francisco Marques, Counselor of
the regional Health Authority [somewhat analogous to Health Minister, as
Murcia is an "Autonomous Region" in Spain.
The Counselor, appearing before the media in a conference where questions
were not allowed, detailed that 470 people had been examined, 400 remain
hospitalized, or 85.4 percent of the cases which are constituted primarily by
males older than 50 years residing in the center of town [not clear
whether this is of the total or the hospitalized.
Marques detailed that 10 people are in the ICU, "specifically 5 in
Morales Meseguer Hospital, one in La Arrixaca, 2 in La Vega, and another
2 in San Carlos," all in stable condition. The epidemic has already
caused one fatality.
The incidence rate per 100 000 inhabitants of the city of Murcia is 34.1,
which number rises to 124.9 affected in the area bounded by Juan Carlos I
Ave., Gran Via Ave., and the river.
The analyses undertaken to date, explained the Counselor, demonstrate that
178 people with symptoms of pneumonia were ill with legionellosis, while the
rest are pending confirmation, although he does not believe the final
number will "vary significantly."
Marques has indicated that due to the volume of cases examined today in
hospital emergency rooms, it is possible that the epidemic "finds itself
in the last phase of infection." [?
The Counselor has informed that inspectors continue "combing" the center of
Murcia city where there are 4 locations likely to be the focus of the
epidemic, one of these located in El Corte Ingles [Spain's largest
department store chain.
Technicians are still sending samples from the refrigeration towers [air
conditioning cooling units? to the laboratories, although the Counselor
has not revealed the names of the remaining places which were found
positive for legionella.
Marques underscored that "no hospitals are affected by this bacterium" and
that in any case, "only intrahospital infections could have been
possible" [not overly reassuring.
Insofar as the Corte Ingles premises, the Counselor pointed out that there
has been a complete disinfection of the air conditioning system.
Sources of El Corte Ingles informed today that the establishment reopened
its doors "with fans working, but no cooling" while waiting for
technicians to complete their tasks.
Sources of the company have detailed that "it seems difficult" to
unequivocally demonstrate that it was installations of El Corte Ingles
which caused the epidemic, as they were subjected to a disinfection last
4 Jul [2001?.

Source of Legionnaires' Outbreak Detected in Spain
--------------------------------------------------
Health inspectors have detected bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease
in air-conditioning towers in southeastern Spain, where an outbreak has
already occurred in 86 people [the prior article indicates 178 cases -
Mod.ES, officials said on Wednesday.
Murcia, in the southeast about 25 miles inland from popular Mediterranean
beach resorts, has been the focus of one of Spain's worst ever outbreaks of
the deadly disease, which is caused by bacteria that can be carried on
water vapor in air conditioning and drinking water systems. The disease has
symptoms similar to pneumonia.
One of the 4 towers affected was in a department store in the center of
Murcia, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said.
On Tuesday the number of confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease rose to
86 out of a total of 253 people suspected of infection.
The local government called for calm as tests of the city's drinking water
failed to show the presence of the bacteria.
In the past 5 years, Legionnaires' disease has killed 26 people in Spain
and infected 500, the daily newspaper El Pais reported.
