VIRAL OUTBREAK DEATH TOLL RISES TO 56
Taipei, July 3 (CNA) A deadly intestinal virus outbreak has claimed another
life in Taiwan, bringing the death toll of the epidemic to 56, the
Department of Health (DOH) reported on Friday.
H. M. Hsu, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease,
said the latest victim was an 11-month-old baby boy who died at Hsiuchuan
Memorial Hospital in the central city of Changhua on July 1, three days
after he was hospitalized.
According to hospital reports, the infant had shown symptoms of meningitis,
myocarditis and other clinical manifestations usually seen in those
infected by enterovirus.
Hsu said the DOH has finally completed examination of 108 cultured virus
specimens obtained from those suspected to have died of the viral
infections and those who had shown either severe or mild clinical
manifestations.
Among all these specimens, only 16 had shown positive reactions toward
intestinal virus, with 12 to enterovirus 71, two to Echo 6, and one each to
Coxsackievirus B-5 and Echo 4.
"The real infection sources of other patients remain unclear," Hsu said,
attributing the low success examination rate partly to deficiencies in the
specimens provided by major medical centers around the island.
Another reason might be related to defective refrigeration conditions in
the process of transportation, Hsu said. "The specimens must be kept at a
low-temperature environment," she added.
The intestinal virus mainly attacks children younger than five years old.
