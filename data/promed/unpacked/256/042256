CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup infections. Joint investigation efforts indicate that mangoes are a likely source of this outbreak.

Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of salmonellae obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

A total of 103 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Braenderup have been reported from 16 states. The majority of ill persons (78) have been reported from California. This number may change as more cases are confirmed. Most persons became ill during July 2011. Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 3 Jul 2012 to 11 Aug 2012. Ill persons range in age from 1 to 86 years, with a median age of 32 years old. 55 percent of ill persons are female. Among 69 persons with available information, 25 (36 percent) patients reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

This PFGE pattern has been seen before in PulseNet, and in the past typically caused 2 to 3 cases per month. Therefore, some reported cases may not be part of this outbreak. Illnesses that occurred after 5 Aug 2012, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
State public health officials are interviewing ill persons to obtain information regarding foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week before illness. Preliminary information indicates that mangoes are a likely source for the _S._ Braenderup infections. Approximately 70 percent of ill persons interviewed report consuming mangoes in the week before becoming ill. Among ill persons in California, approximately 80 percent are of Hispanic ethnicity. Many of the ill persons in California report purchasing mangoes from Hispanic markets or grocery stores. Investigations are ongoing to determine the specific type and source of mangoes that might be linked with illness.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. FDA is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation. CDC will update the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes available.
