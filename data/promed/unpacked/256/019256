The World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region Gonococcal
Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme is a multicentric long term programme
for continuous surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of
_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. In 1996 the programme examined the susceptibility
of 8,421 isolates of gonococci to various antimicrobials in 17 focal points.
A trend toward increased resistance noted in earlier years continued. The
proportion of quinolone resistant gonococci reported from most centres
either remained stable or increased. More than 50% of isolates in Hong Kong,
China, Korea, Cambodia and the Philippines had altered quinolone
susceptibility. Resistance to the penicillins was again widespread, and
chromosomal mediated resistance was of increasing importance. Penicillinase
producing _Neisseria gonorrhoea_ were present in all but one centre. All
isolates were sensitive to the third generation cephalosporins and only a
very few isolates were spectinomycin resistant. A high proportion of
isolates in a number of centres had high level tetracycline resistance, but
the proportion of tetracycline resistant _Neisseria gonorrhoea_ in most
centres was less than 10%.
