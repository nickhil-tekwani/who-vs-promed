A new strain of the potato disease "blackleg" has been confirmed in
Northern Ireland, agriculture minister Michelle Gildernew has said.
Infected plants were discovered after an examination of 62 local crops was
carried out by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) and the
agriculture department [DARD].

The department says the outbreak has been "fully contained," and that
measures have been put in place to prevent further spread. Any machinery
and equipment that may have come into contact with the crop must be
disinfected before coming into contact with other potatoes. The affected
crop will be disposed of under the supervision of DARD.

The minister said that growers must notify the department in advance if
they plan to import seed [tubers] into the country. Growers should
carefully consider the risks of introducing seed from areas known to have
_Dickeya solani_.

[2] _Dickeya_ stem and root rot, sweetpotato - China: 1st report,
(Guangdong Province)

[ref: LF Huang et al: First report of bacterial stem and root rot of
sweetpotato caused by a _Dickeya_ sp. (_Erwinia chrysanthemi_) in China.
Plant Dis. 2010; 94, 1503; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-06-10-0417]

Since 2006, stem and root rot of sweetpotato has been observed in fields at
a number of sweetpotato-production areas in Guangdong Province. Initially,
the leaves turn yellow, and a black, water-soaked rot occurs on the bottom
of the stems that gradually extends to the top of the stems. Finally, the
entire plant collapses and dies.

Bacteria were consistently isolated from stems of diseased seedlings.
Twelve representative isolates chosen for further characterization were
similar to _Erwinia chrysanthemi_. The [nucleotide] sequence of isolated
strain H12 was 99 per cent identical to _E. chrysanthemi_, 99 per cent
identical to _Dickeya dadantii_, and 98 per cent identical to _D.
dianthicola_. Recently, _E. chrysanthemi_ was transferred to _Dickeya_ gen.
nov.

Seedlings were injected with a bacteria suspension. One to 2 days after
inoculation, symptoms were observed in all inoculated plants and appeared
to be identical to those observed in the field. No symptoms were noted on
control plants. The bacterium was re-isolated from symptomatic stems of
sweetpotato plants.

This pathogen was previously reported on sweetpotato in the United States
in 1974. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a _Dickeya_ sp.
causing bacterial stem and root rot of sweetpotato in China.

[Blackleg caused by _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subsp. _atrosepticum_ can
cause severe losses in potato crops. However, an even more virulent form of
blackleg emerged in recent years as a major threat spreading in Europe and
Israel. The cause has been identified as a new bacterial species in 2009
(ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162), currently referred to as _Dickeya
solani_. Symptoms resemble "traditional" blackleg and include wilting of
plants and tuber rot, but the disease appears to be more aggressive and
causes damage under a wider range of conditions and at lower bacterial
loadings. Preliminary results from Europe indicate that the new species
will rapidly take over as the principal cause of blackleg-like symptoms in
potato crops.

The bacterium is spread with contaminated plant or other material
(including seed tubers), by mechanical means, and water. Disease management
includes seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting
material, and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the pathogen from
external sources. Low levels of seed tuber infection pose a major risk of
pathogen spread and appear to have been the cause for recent outbreaks in
Scotland (ProMED-mail posts 20100705.2229 and 20100528.1775), despite
quarantine measures, certification schemes and an alert issued to regional
growers (ProMED-mail post 20100208.0421).

_Dickeya_ stem and root rot of sweetpotato causes crop losses by destroying
plants and the fleshy roots. So far, it has only been reported from the USA
but is also suspected to occur in Central Luzon, Philippines.

_Dickeya_ species (as well as _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subspecies) also
cause bacterial soft rot of potato. They can also affect other crops,
causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice.
