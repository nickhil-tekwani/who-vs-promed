Wild yak deaths under investigation
---------------------------------------
The death of a group of wild yaks within a small area in Qinghai Province
has aroused deep concern from the local authorities.
According to China Central Television yesterday [6 Apr 2005], in the past 2
days, more than 10 wild yaks have been found dead in a forest in Golmud,
which lies in the Kunlun Mountains. They are in the 1st class of "key"
species of wildlife protected by Chinese legislation. "It is the 1st time
we have seen so many wild yaks die at the same time within a small area of
20 square km," said Duojie, head of the local forest police. "We will
co-operate with the local department for animal epidemic prevention to find
out the cause behind the deaths," he added.
As the investigation is carried out, researchers and experts on wildlife
living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau pointed out there are several factors
that may have contributed to such a tragedy, but death by old age is not
one of them.
Dawa Tsering, director of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) office in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, told China Daily yesterday [6 Apr 2005] that spring is
always the most difficult time for animals living in the wild. "The yaks
have endured the long and cold winter and expected to get some fresh grass,
but they may not have enough to eat as a result of continuous droughts in
their habitat or over-grazing," he said. The habitat for the grass-eating
wild animals has been shrinking on the plateau, as local animal husbandry
develops and as their own numbers grow. Dawa Tsering added that spring is
also a mating season, and the wild yaks may have come into contact with
domesticated yaks and got infected.
Nyima Wangdu, professor of biology at Tibet University, said the wild yaks
may have suffered from an illness. But, it will be very difficult to
pinpoint the exact diseases, said Wang Hongjia, director of the Wildlife
Protection Station in Southwest China's Sichuan Province.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the "roof of the world," is home to the
wild yaks. The plateau cuts across the Tibet and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous
regions and the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan, with an
average altitude above 3000 meters.

[The newswire does not provide data on pathological findings, the age of
the affected animals and the size and age distribution in the affected
population. Such data could help in assessing the potential etiologies.
Mortality in adult yaks could be ascribed to numerous etiological agents,
both non-infectious (metabolic, toxic) and infectious ones. Among the
possible infectious agents, various bacteria (e.g. anthrax and
pasteurella), viruses, protozoa and helminths might be taken into
considerations.
The investigators are expected first to try to exclude any possible
presence of highly infectious viruses, such as rinderpest and FMD. Both
have the capacity to cause significant mortality in domestic and wild
artiodactyls, while potentially threatening the national herd.
In 1991, rinderpest was diagnosed in yaks in the former Soviet Union, near
the border with Mongolia. At the peak of the epizootic, mortality among
affected yaks was 32-42 percent in adults and 65 percent in animals less
than one year old. However, if rinderpest is involved in the current yak
die-off, it may be assumed that the typical diarrhea would not remain
unnoticed, even if only dead animals were observed. - Mod.AS]
