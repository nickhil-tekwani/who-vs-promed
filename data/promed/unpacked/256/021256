Disease hits SA barley crops
----------------------------
South Australian (SA) grain growers fear a wipeout from a fungal
disease that takes hold of barley crops. The South Australian
Research and Development Institute says the disease, called net
blotch, could cut crops yields by a third.

Farmer Brian Tiller, from the state's mid-north, says the only weapon
against it is monthly spraying, a costly exercise when returns aren't
guaranteed. "I've already sprayed 500 acres (202 ha) and I'm just
looking whether I am going to spray more," he says. "As long as
you're going to get a yield at the end of the day it's all right, but
if you're going to put it on and don't end up getting the rain to get
the costs at the end, I'm not sure where you draw the line."

_Septoria tritici_ has proved extremely challenging this year [2008]
with many crops carrying higher levels of the disease than might have
been expected given the level of [fungicide] input applied. The trend
emerging is that early-drilled crops with a septoria rating of 5 or
less are a lot dirtier [carrying more disease] than the same
varieties drilled later or varieties with a better resistance score
drilled at the same time.

This is perhaps not altogether unexpected, but the differences are
more marked than usual, so one could be forgiven for questioning the
curative activity of some materials applied at T2 [growth stage]. For
2009, disease resistance will more than ever figure as a key
consideration in varietal choice, particularly for the September drillings.

Area farmers brace for lackluster year
--------------------------------------
Farmers are facing more concerns than just wet weather. Iowa State
University Extension Southeast Iowa field specialist Mark Carlton
said 2 crop diseases have been discovered in some area fields --
anthracnose and holcus spot. "These are mainly on corn crops," he said.

Anthracnose is a fungus that survives on crop residue. Add in high
humidity levels and rainfall, the fungus will spread, eventually
knocking the lower three or four leaves off the corn plants. "It
could lead to stock rot later on in the summer or fall ... it can be
a serious problem," Carlton said. "We would have a small to moderate
yield loss if severe."

The other disease -- holcus spot -- is caused by a bacterium that
also thrives in corn residue and splashes up on the leaves.

And there's also worry about pests.

[Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and
affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). The disease
causes necrotic areas on leaves leading to significant losses of up
to 20 percent to barley yield around the world. There are 2 types of
this fungus: the net type caused by _P. t._ f. _teres_, and the spot
type caused by _P. t._ f. _maculata_. The fungus survives between
seasons on barley residue, volunteer barley plants, some grasses, and
seed. Disease management includes cultural practices to remove
pathogen reservoirs, fungicide applications, use of clean seed, and
planting of resistant cultivars.

Cereal diseases of the septoria complex are caused by the fungi
_Mycosphaerella graminicola_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) and
_Phaeosphaeria nodorum_. These pathogens cause blotches on both
leaves and glumes reducing the photosynthetic ability of the host and
causing yield losses.

Anthracnose leaf blight and anthracnose stalk rot of maize are caused
by the fungi _Colletotrichum graminicola_ and _Glomerella
tucumanensis_. _G. tucumanensis_ also causes red rot of sugarcane.

Holcus spot of maize is caused by the bacterium _Pseudomonas
syringae_ pv. _syringae_ . This pathogen also causes diseases of, for
example, tomato, citrus, mango, and apricot. Other pathovars also
exist which can affect different hosts.
