[Dagestan is in the northeast of the Caucasus mountain range, bordering the
Caspian Sea in the east, the Chechen Republic and Stavropol Territory in the
west, the Kalmukya Republic in the north and Azergaijan and Georgia in the
south. Makhachkala is the administrative capital of the Republic -MPP

An outbreak of anthrax has been registered in the Novy Cherkei village in
the southern Russian autonomous republic of Dagestan, Shikhmurza Aliyev,
deputy chief of the Dagestani sanitary inspectorate, said on Friday.
Three residents of the village were taken to hospital after they attended a
wedding and ate meat bought from a private dealer near a Makhachkala market,
Aliyev told Itar-Tass. It turned out that the meat had not been examined by
sanitary inspectors.
All people who had cut the meat and attended the wedding were given urgent
vaccinations, Aliyev added. However the meat dealer is not yet found. Legal
action is under way.
