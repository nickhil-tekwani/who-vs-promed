More than 30 people have died following an outbreak of listeriosis.

Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi announced on [Tue 5 Dec 2017] morning that while listeriosis is a serious disease, it is a disease which can be treated with antibiotics.

The bacteria are found in soil, water and vegetation. Motsoaledi said people who are most vulnerable include the elderly, children, newborns or those who are ill.

Approximately 557 cases have been reported, with the majority coming from Gauteng province. He said they had traced 70 patients, of whom 36 died.

The minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi has urged anyone who is displaying symptoms of listeriosis to seek medical attention immediately following the outbreak of the disease across South Africa. At a media briefing in Pretoria today [Tue 5 Dec 2017], Motsoaledi announced that there is an outbreak of listeriosis - a disease caused by a bacterium found in soil, water and vegetation, which contaminates food sources such as animal products and fresh produce.

The minister said those who contract the disease will have flu-like symptoms including diarrhoea, fever, general body pains and weakness. He said the disease can cause meningitis, which is an infection of the brain and septicemia which is an infection of the blood stream, both can be fatal. However, Motsoaledi stressed that while the disease is serious and dangerous, it is treatable with antibiotics and urged that anyone who is showing symptoms should get medical help immediately. "If you encounter the symptoms I've mentioned please rush to look for medical help, in other words don't just assume and sit at home especially if you get flu like symptoms now in summer."

Motsoaledi said that tracing as far back as [1 Jan 2017] up until [29 Nov 2017], 557 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported. Of the 557 cases, the department of health has found the final outcome of 70 confirmed cases of listeriosis. "Of these 70 cases, 36 persons have perished," said Motsoaledi.

The Head of the Centre for Enteric Diseases at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), Dr Juno Thomas, said the number of deaths will increase as they receive final outcome data on the reported cases.

Motsoaledi added that whilst anyone can get the diseases, which has a mortality rate of between 20 and 30 percent, those at a high risk of developing the disease are newborns, the elderly, pregnant women and people with weak immunity systems such as HIV or cancer sufferers.

The World Health Organisation has advised on food safety measures which includes; that people should keep clean especially when handling food, food should be cooked thoroughly; raw food should not be eaten; use safe water, keep food at safe temperatures and use pasteurized milk products.

The source of the outbreak is currently being investigated, but Motsoaledi said it's believed that this particular outbreak is from a food source that is being consumed by both the rich and the poor, and the contamination points may well be farms and food processing plants. "All the stakeholders are cooperating with the investigation led by the NICD. Environmental health officers are following up diagnosed cases and are visiting their homes to sample food where available," said Motsoaledi.

_Listeria_ typically occurs every year, with between 60 - 80 cases detected and treated annually, however, in July this year [2017], the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg and Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria alerted the NICD to unusually high numbers of babies with listeriosis.

Out of the 557 cases reported, 345 cases were reported in Gauteng, followed by the Western Cape which reported 71 cases, and 37 cases of listeriosis reported in KwaZulu-Natal.

Members of the public can contact the NICD emergency operations centre during working hours (011 386 2000) or the NICD hotline for clinical emergencies after hours (082 883 9920).

[When ProMED-mail last posted on this outbreak, there were 122 cases of listeriosis in the province of Gauteng (mostly in the city of Johannesburg), over 60 percent of which are newborn babies, with 190 cases in South Africa as a whole (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - South Africa: increasing incidence 20171025.5402225). There are now a total of 557 reported cases, with 345 (61.9 percent) coming from Gauteng province in 2017. There were 71 cases reported in the Western Cape and 37 cases of listeriosis reported in KwaZulu-Natal. Only 60 - 80 cases are detected and treated in South Africa annually. 70 of the 557 cases have been traced, of which 36 were fatal. The overall case fatality rate of listeriosis is 20-30 percent and the case fatality rate in infected newborns has been reported to be approximately 50 percent (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/listeriosis.pdf).

Gauteng, one of the 9 provinces of South Africa, is the smallest and most populous, with a population of over 13 million residents, containing the country's largest city, Johannesburg, its administrative capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng). A map of South Africa provinces can be found at https://www.southafrica.to/provinces/provinces.htm.

Genotyping _Listeria_ isolates is important to identify transmission pathways. In the USA, clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ are forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases.

When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis of food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source. The genotype of clinical isolates is then compared to genotypes of food isolates to identify the source.

More information on food exposures and genotyping of clinical and environmental isolates from the South African outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
