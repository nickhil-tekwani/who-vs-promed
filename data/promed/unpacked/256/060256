[In the past week, there were 4 newly confirmed cases, 3 from the Riyadh region and one from Tabuk (maps showing the locations of these cases can be found at the source URLs for each of the reports). It appears as though there is a pattern of continued sporadic cases, primarily classified as primary cases with some still under investigation for high risk exposures in the 14-day period preceding onset of their illnesses. In the absence of many secondary cases with markedly reduced nosocomial transmission, the epidemiologic picture appears to be one of endemicity of the disease in Saudi Arabia. The question remains as to why it is Saudi Arabia and not neighboring countries, which also have camels and camel farming.
