The following is quoted from the California Department of Health Services
Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance Bulletin #2 (Thursday, May 18, 2000)
(some material deleted to save space)
"HORSE DEATH IN VENTURA COUNTY. Yesterday the UC Davis Center for
Vector-Borne Disease Research (CVBDR) confirmed by ...(RT-PCR) tests that a
horse (onset of illness on April 21) died in Ventura County from...(EEE).
EEE has only been reported once west of the Mississippi River as an
isolated incident in Texas many years ago. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST
THAT EEE WAS ACQUIRED VIA MOSQUITO TRANSMISSION.
...A vaccine for EEE, WEE tetanus and influenza was administered seven days
prior to onset of illness. Therefore, the USDA reference lab in Ames.
Iowa...is evaluating the safety of that vaccine lot. Testing results
should be available next week. CVBDR will be testing the vaccine by RT-PCR
and genetic sequencing to possibly determine if the EEE virus in the horse
and the vaccine are identical. VRDL will be inoculating mice with the
vaccine to determine if the vaccine contained live virus."
The report continues to summarize surveillance efforts by the Vector-Borne
Disease Section of the California Department of Health Services and local
vector control agencies, including testing sentinel chicken sera from the
area, testing mosquito pools collected in CO2 traps, larval surveillance
and control, and resting mosquito surveillance. Mosquito counts have been
low, and chicken sera and mosquito pools tested so far have been negative.
The upshot is that so far this appears to be an isolated incident related
to a vaccine problem, and there is no evidence of local transmission of
EEE to date.

[We are grateful to Steve for sending this message. As our subscribers
might have suspected from the noncommittal comment attached to the first
message, posted yesterday, there was more to this story than it first
appeared. There were and are epidemiologic and legal ramifications and it
is inappropriate to comment on these. The proper people are taking the
proper steps and the germane information should become available soon. Keep
in mind that horses infected with EEE virus do not mount high titer
viremias, so even if there was an abundance of competent arthropod vectors
in the area (there apparently are not), the likelihood of secondary
infections would be low. California has what most people accept as the
best vector control program in the U.S. and all necessary and prudent steps
are being taken to track down the origin of this infection. Speculations
about this incident will not be posted on ProMED-mail.
If anyone is wondering why a horse in California would be vaccinated with
EEE virus it is because the horse was vaccinated with the
commercially-available trivalent (EEE virus, western equine encephalitis
virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus) or bivalent (EEE virus and
WEE virus) vaccine; I do not know which.
Allow me to clarify the statement (above): " EEE has only been reported
once west of the Mississippi River as an isolated incident in Texas many
years ago." Strictly speaking this is true. That is, the disease EEE may
have been detected only once west of the Mississippi River. However, EEE
virus has been isolated west of the Mississippi River previous to this. We
isolated EEE virus numerous times in 1971 during surveillance efforts
intended to contain the invading Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus; EEE
virus was found in South Dakota in penned birds that had originated as eggs
brought there from the eastern U.S. There must be other examples. In the
U.S. EEE (the disease) has been limited to the eastern part of the country,
mainly the eastern seaboard. EEE virus-infected southbound migrant birds
may carry this virus from the U.S. into the Caribbean area in autumn. The
South American variety of EEE virus has been isolated from northbound
migrant birds entering the U.S. in Spring but that variety does not become
established here. Birds, however, do not migrate east-west and vice versa.
Finally, it is hoped that this California incident is an isolated one and
that spread will not occur. - Mod.CHC
