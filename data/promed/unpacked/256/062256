The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) reported that an adult female deer in Oregon County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). A landowner found a dead deer on his property and was concerned. MDC was notified, and staff collected a sample and had it tested for CWD.

This is the 1st deer found dead in Missouri that has tested positive for CWD. The nearest confirmed CWD positive is over 70 mi [about 112.6 km] away in Arkansas. This new CWD-positive case brings the total number of CWD cases detected in free-ranging deer in Missouri to 76 since 2012.

"We will be working cooperatively with hunters and landowners in the coming months to test more deer in this area and assess the extent of the disease in Oregon County," MDC wildlife disease coordinator Jasmine Batten said.

CWD is a fatal disease affecting deer and other members of the deer family, called cervids. There have been no cases of CWD infecting humans, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hunters harvesting deer in areas known to have CWD to get their deer tested before consuming meat.

Hunters in or around Oregon County can have their deer tested during normal business hours at the Ozark Regional Office in West Plains. Hunters can bring the entire deer -- preferably field dressed -- or the head with at least 6 in [about 15.2 cm] of the neck in place to the office, and MDC staff will take a sample to have it tested for CWD.

Hunters harvesting deer outside of business hours can remove the head, keep it cool, and bring it to the office during business hours. Additional sampling opportunities can be found online at https://bit.ly/2SgjUqH.

"Sampling deer showing possible signs of CWD is one important piece of our surveillance efforts, and we greatly appreciate the public's assistance," Batten said.

[How sad. The Upper Peninsula of Michigan announced a CWD case yesterday, and today the positive case is in Missouri, quite a distance from where other positive CWD cases have been found. Missouri also points out this is the 1st CWD case found in dead deer. All the animals are deceased when they are sampled and determined to have the disease, but the point is that this deer was not harvested, nor was it a road kill; it was dead when it was found, and they elected to sample the animal. One has to wonder how long it had been dead, as usually the brain deteriorates rapidly, rendering it unable to be tested accurately. Therefore, it must have been luck the animal was found in a timely manner to facilitate testing. - Mod.TG
