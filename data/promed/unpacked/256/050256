Each shipping label bears the establishment number "Est. 18076"
inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The products subject to recall were distributed for further
processing and repackaging and will not bear the recalling firm's
establishment number on the package. As the use-by date for products
subject to this recall may have expired, consumers can contact their
retailers to ask if they received any of these products and if so,
consumers are urged to look in their freezers for these products and
return or discard them if found.

The ground beef products subject to recall were produced on 10 Oct
2007, and were distributed to retail establishments and distributors
in Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and
Virginia. The problem was discovered through an investigation into 2
illnesses that was initiated by the Illinois Department of Public
Health. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a physician.

FSIS recommendations for preparing ground beef for safe consumption
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before
and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes,
and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.
- Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry away from other food that will not
be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and egg
products and cooked foods.
- Consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that
have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160 deg F (71 deg
C).
- Color is NOT a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef
patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful
bacteria such as _E. coli_ O157:H7.
- The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough
temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to
measure the internal temperature.
- Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within 2 hours after purchase or
one hour if temperatures exceed 90 deg F (32.2 deg C). Refrigerate
cooked meat and poultry within 2 hours after cooking.

[This recall involves ground beef that was to be further processed
and/or repackaged making effectiveness of the recall even lower than
its usual effect. So far, it appears that only 2 cases are linked to
the vehicle. It is of interest that the cases were from Illinois, not
among the states where the recalled beef was initially distributed.
It is not clearly stated if the beef was purchased in Wisconsin or
Indiana, states on the list that are adjacent to Illinois or if the
meat did find its way to Illinois.

The list of safe kitchen procedures included in the posting would
decrease any risk of _E. coli_ O157:H7 even if the meat were to be
contaminated. - Mod.LL]
