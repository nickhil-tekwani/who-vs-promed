Abstract
--------
The role of migratory birds in the movement of the highly pathogenic
(HP) avian influenza H5N1 remains a subject of debate. Testing
hypotheses regarding intercontinental movement of low pathogenic
avian influenza (LPAI) viruses will help evaluate the potential that
wild birds could carry Asian-origin strains of HP avian influenza to
North America during migration. Previous North American assessments
of LPAI genetic variation have found few Asian reassortment events.
Here, we present results from whole-genome analyses of LPAI isolates
collected in Alaska from the northern pintail (_Anas acuta_), a
species that migrates between North America and Asia.

Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the genetic divergence between Asian
and North American strains of LPAI, but also suggested
inter-continental virus exchange and at a higher frequency than
previously documented. In 38 isolates from Alaska, nearly half (44.7
percent) had at least one gene segment more closely related to Asian
than to North American strains of LPAI. Additionally, sequences of
several Asian LPAI isolates from GenBank clustered more closely with
North American northern pintail isolates than with other Asian origin
viruses. Our data support the role of wild birds in the
intercontinental transfer of influenza viruses, and reveal a higher
degree of transfer in Alaska than elsewhere in North America.

Migratory ducks carry bird flu from Asia to Alaska
--------------------------------------------------
Wild migratory birds appear to be important carriers of avian
influenza viruses from continent to continent, according to new
research that scientists say has important implications for highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus surveillance in North America.
Migratory bird species, including many waterfowl and shorebirds, that
frequently carry low pathogenic avian influenza and migrate between
continents may carry Asian strains of the virus along their migratory
pathways to North America.

Scientists with the US Geological Survey [USGS], in collaboration
with the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska and the University of
Tokyo, have found genetic evidence that northern pintail ducks
carried Asian forms of avian influenza to Alaska. "Although some
previous research has led to speculation that intercontinental
transfer of avian influenza viruses from Asia to North America via
wild birds is rare, this study challenges that," said Chris Franson,
a research wildlife biologist with the USGS National Wildlife Health
Center and co-author of the study. Most previous studies examined
bird species that are not transcontinental migrants or were from
mid-latitude locales in North America, regions far removed from
sources of Asian strains of avian influenza, Franson said.

For this study, scientists with the USGS, in collaboration with the
US Fish and Wildlife Service, state agencies, and Alaska native
communities, obtained samples from more than 1400 northern pintails
from locations throughout Alaska. Samples containing viruses were
analyzed and compared to virus samples taken from other birds in
North America and Eastern Asia where northern pintails are known to
winter. The scientists observed that nearly half of the low
pathogenic avian influenza viruses found in wild northern pintail
ducks in Alaska contained at least one of 8 gene segments that were
more closely related to Asian than to North American strains of bird
flu. None of the samples were found to contain completely
Asian-origin viruses and none were highly pathogenic.
...

In June [2008], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]
in Atlanta released results of a study suggesting that some North
American avian influenza A H7 virus strains have properties that
might enhance their potential to infect humans and their potential to
spread from human to human. "We know that influenza viruses are
constantly changing and that is why it's so important to watch them
carefully," explained Dr Jessica Belser, CDC lead author on the
project. "In this study, we discovered that some recently identified
avian influenza A H7 viruses have some properties that could enhance
their potential to infect people and possibly spread among people."

The role of migratory birds in moving the highly pathogenic virus to
other geographic areas has been a subject of disagreement among
scientists that focused on how likely it is for H5N1 to disperse
across continents via wild birds. For this study, the researchers
chose northern pintails because they are fairly common in North
America and Asia, they are frequently infected by low pathogenic
avian influenza, and they are known to migrate between North America
and Asia. In addition to the samples from more than 1400 ducks, the
scientists utilized satellite telemetry in their research. In
February 2007, biologists from the Alaska Science Center worked with
Japanese scientists to mark 27 northern pintail ducks with satellite
transmitters at Lakes Izunuma-Uchinuma in the Miyagi Prefecture of
Japan. In February 2008, this international research team marked 52
pintails with satellite transmitters. Pintails were again marked at
Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma as well as at Gosho Reservoir in the Iwate
Prefecture. An additional sample of pintails will be marked in 2009,
the final year of the study.

"This kind of genetic analysis -- using the low pathogenic strains of
avian influenza virus commonly found in wild birds -- can answer
questions not only about the migratory movements of wild birds, but
the degree of virus exchange that takes place between continents,
provided the right species and geographic locations are sampled,"
said John Pearce, a research wildlife biologist with the USGS Alaska
Science Center and co-author of the study.
