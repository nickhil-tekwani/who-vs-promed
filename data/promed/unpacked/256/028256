TUBERCULOSIS TRANSMISSION RISK IN AIDS PATIENTS (5)
===================================================
I am not a specialist in infectious diseases, but my anecdotal experience
may provide some assistance. This information is based on recall that has
been dulled by the passage of several years.
While working with inmates, I treated similar cases on a few (roughly 3)
occasions. Mycobacterial sepsis presented in HIV positive individuals as
gradually progressive, unrelenting sepsis not responsive to broad spectrum
anti-bacterial therapy. It did not occur exclusively in advanced AIDS,
defined on the basis of CD4 count.
The microbiology staff with whom I was fortunate to work were able to apply
fluorescent stains for mycobacteria to blood samples. I believe these were
plain smears, though the blood may have been first hemolyzed using any of a
variety of commonly available techniques. We were always able to identify
mycobacterial organisms using this technique; all the diagnoses were made
while the patients were still alive (as early as three days after
presentation to the ICU). Despite initiating aggressive anti-tuberculous
therapy, focusing on parenteral agents, and maintaining maximal supportive
therapy for sepsis, all the patients died.
I don't believe we ever isolated M. tuberculosis from sputum in any of
these individuals. We considered urine and all gastro-intestinal secretions
to be potentially infectious, though we never attempted to confirm whether
this was the case.
