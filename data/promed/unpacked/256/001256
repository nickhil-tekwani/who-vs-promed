The Norwegian veterinary authorities are investigating a suspected case of bovine TB [tuberculosis] in alpacas imported from southern England in autumn 2013. The alpacas reacted positively to the skin test and are now being kept in isolation while further serological tests are carried to provide a definitive diagnosis. If bovine TB [bTB] is confirmed it will be Norway's 1st case of the disease since 1986. On its website, the Norwegian Government's veterinary body notes there has been an increase in the incidence of bTB in some countries.

"This includes Britain, which for several years has had a serious situation in cattle in parts of the country," it says. "In recent years, the incidence of the disease has been highlighted also in alpacas in the UK. "In wild animals (especially deer, wild boar, and badgers) tuberculosis is occurring in many countries in the EU, including Spain, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. At the same time, there has been an increase in imports of camelids to Norway from countries where bovine tuberculosis is a problem."

It also notes that the situation in camelids is complicated by the fact that tuberculosis is a 'slowly progressive disease that makes testing challenging' and that bTB is a zoonosis that can be transmitted from animals to humans.

The last case of bTB in Norway, where bTB was once 'prevalent, was recorded in 1986, and it achieved bTB free status in 1994. The Department's director of supervision Kristina Landsverk expressed concern at the increased importation of camelids in Norway and warned they can 'carry pathogens including parasites, that do not occur here.' She said it was 'especially unsafe to import animals from risk areas'.

A Defra [UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs] spokesman said the department was aware of the suspected case in a herd of alpacas imported to Norway from England. "We are awaiting further tests to confirm whether the disease is present," he said.

[Cases of bovine tuberculosis in domestic animals other than cattle have shown an increase in the UK in recent years. These involved cats, pigs, South American camelids (llamas and alpacas), and deer, and -- less frequently -- other species, including dogs, goats, sheep, feral mink, ferrets, rats, and mice. _Mycobacterium bovis_ was first diagnosed in camelids in Great Britain in 1999; several human infections attributed to an alpaca source have been registered since.

UK's recent statistics of bovine tuberculosis in cattle are available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/310857/bovinetb-dataset-14may14.xls.

Final results of the tests in Norway and of the epidemiological investigations in the UK and in Norway (possible contacts since their arrival), are anticipated.
