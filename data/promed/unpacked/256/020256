Singapore on Saturday [16 Aug 2008] reported 9 new cases of
mosquito-borne chikungunya fever, bringing to 117 the total number of
such cases this year.

According to Channel NewsAsia reports on Saturday [16 Aug 2008]
night, of these cases, 54 were imported and had a history of travel
to countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka.

The 9 new cases of chikungunya fever were locally-transmitted ones,
as none of them traveled overseas recently.

Singapore's Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan was quoted as saying that
the country has been fighting mosquitoes for several decades now and
that he knew these were very formidable enemies.

"They'll try to survive, and I think there's no other way except just
make sure our environmental hygiene is of very high standards," the
minister said.

[The chikungunya outbreak in Singapore smolders on. Minister Khaw
Boon Wan is correct; clean-up to eliminate _Aedes_ mosquito breeding
sites is the only way to end the outbreak, since no vaccine is
available. Although the outbreak has been confined to just 2 foci, it
would be of interest to know whether there are other areas in the
city with significant populations of this chikungunya virus mosquito vector.
