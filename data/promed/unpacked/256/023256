Outbreak of African horse sickness in Grahamstown area confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A further report [following our previous report of 5 Apr 2002] on African
horse sickness (AHS) in Grahamstown was delayed pending availability of
typing results. The outbreak was confirmed as horse sickness by
antigen-capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and virus isolation.
Due to a strong heterologous cross reaction between AHS types 3 and 7,
serotyping results are still unclear. Polymerase chain reaction tests and
gene sequencing are being done.
Typing results are particularly important, as the outbreak in the Eastern
Cape last year in the rural unvaccinated horses of the Transkei was due to
serotype 2. This season's outbreak in a more affluent vaccinated riding
school/farmhorse population adjoining the Transkei is obviously a newly
"imported" strain of AHS 3 or 7.
Proof of overwintering of the AHS virus after an outbreak in a
traditionally free area has never been shown. Outbreaks are invariably the
result of unregulated infected horse movement from the north to the south
of the country.
