NEW VIRUS ? --- SAKHALIN (RUSSIA)
=================================
>From Isvestia and international media services comes a report that
doctors in Sakalin have discovered a virus not known previously.
Neither a name for the virus nor symptoms of any disease caused by
the virus were in the reports, which said the virus had been
discovered in material collected in the oil and gas pipeline
construction area on the oblast.
Virologists are said to be very concerned for health of the
construction workers, because the pipeline will traverse widely
ranging topography, including land that has never been medically
explored.
It is reported that this exploration was done previously for other
construction projects in the area and was the basis of an atlas on
natural disease in the oblast.
