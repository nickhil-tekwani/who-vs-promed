[The methods of diagnosis of botulism are not stated here. Individual
cases of the paralysis can be confused with other diseases, but a
cluster of such cases is certainly likely to be botulism. Type E
botulism is the type frequently associated with fish products (1).

Classically, botulism is a food-borne disease caused by the ingestion
of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in
which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant
botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although each
type has a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that
type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status
and more autonomic dysfunction (2).
