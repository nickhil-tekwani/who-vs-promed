At least 38 people in Dongguan, an industrial city in south China's
Guangdong Province, have been infected by the mosquito-borne
chikungunya virus, the local health department has confirmed.
Meanwhile, another 166 people were suspected of being infected and
were still waiting for test results, the Guangdong Provincial Health
Department announced in a statement late Wednesday [6 Oct 2010]. Most
of the infected suffered fevers, joint pains and rashes, it said.
"All the patients are in stable condition. There are no severe cases
or deaths," it said.

Local health authorities have set up a task force of medical experts
to oversee the treatment of the disease, it added.

The word "chikungunya" is Swahili for "that which bends up" referring
to the stooped posture of patients afflicted by severe joint pains
caused by the virus. Chikungunya fever, like dengue fever, is a
mosquito-borne disease. The chikungunya virus is carried mostly by
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito [except in outbreaks in Indian Ocean
islands, where _Aedes albopictus_ has been the major vector. -
Mod.TY]. Most infections are reported in tropical Africa and
southeast Asia where the average winter temperature is over 18 deg C
[64 deg F].

[The numbers of chikungunya virus infection cases have increased from
10 on 4 Oct 2010 to the 38 in this report of 7 Oct 2010.

Dongguan is a prefecture-level city in central Guangdong province on
China's south coast. It, and its nearby cities have 25 million
inhabitants. The climate is subtropical and the average yearly
temperature is 22.8 deg C (73 deg F). Given these conditions and the
current outbreak, there is a reasonable probability that abundant
_Aedes_ mosquito vector populations are present and ongoing
chikungunya virus transmission can continue.

[2] Reunion

On 4 Oct 2010, 153 indigenous cases of chikungunya have been
identified, including 112 confirmed and 41 probable, according to a
statement from the Health Agency Indian Ocean. The weekly number of
confirmed cases has increased from late March [2010] and has
stabilized around a dozen cases until mid May then it began to
decrease gradually. From late June [2010], the number of cases was at
a weekly low.

However, although greatly reduced, the transmission was maintained
during the austral winter and 2 new confirmed indigenous cases have
recently been identified in the town of Saint-Denis (1 in la Montagne
and the other in the town).

Surveillance was immediately increased and the doctors located in
areas where cases have been reported, were asked to report daily any
"dengue-like" syndrome(*) they would have to see in consultation
without waiting for results of a laboratory confirmation, in order to
allow intervention by the vector control services as quickly as possible.

The persistence of local virus circulation and the arrival of the
southern summer conditions with temperature and rainfall favor the
development of mosquitoes can leave a fear of an upsurge in the
number of cases of chikungunya on the island during the weeks come.

La Reunion is particularly vulnerable to risks associated with
diseases transmitted by mosquitoes because a constant vector density
is sufficient to allow for local viral transmission, starting an
epidemic. We must remain vigilant vis-a-vis the chikungunya, dengue
fever (which causes very large epidemics in Southeast Asia and
America and is circulating in Mayotte) and the risk of introduction
of other arboviruses. [This is not correct -- chikungunya virus
transmission has not occurred in the Americas. - Mod.TY]

Besides the indigenous chikungunya, 7 cases were imported from
Madagascar, Bali and Indonesia.

(*) Syndrome "dengue-like: Any patient with the following symptoms:
sudden onset of fever (> 38.5 deg C) with a combination of one or
more nonspecific symptoms include: muscle and joint pain, hemorrhagic
manifestations, frontal headache, asthenia, digestive symptoms, pain
retr-orbital, maculopapular rash and in the absence of any other
infectious agents.
