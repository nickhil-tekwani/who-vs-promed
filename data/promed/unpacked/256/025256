While addressing a County Steering Group (CSG) meeting on Friday [8 Nov 2019], the [Laikipia] County Livestock Production Officer (CLPO), Pius Butich, said that "the current meteorological reports have created alerts for Rift Valley fever [RVF], which is the most dangerous zoonotic disease."

He proposed the need to put in place an early warning system on high alert as part of measures to protect both livestock and humans against the disease.

Butich said all field staff, public health administrators and local leaders should be alerted to the likelihood of an outbreak of zoonotic diseases. Livestock in high risk areas should be vaccinated, and all reported cases of livestock abortion, hemorrhage syndromes, and deaths should be investigated and serum and blood sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory Kabete for scrutiny.

The CLPO added that active surveillance would be intensified, with emphasis on areas that experienced the disease in both animals and humans during the previous outbreaks, and a one-health approach should be activated through collaboration with the ministry of health.

He noted that Sh.2 million [USD 19 579] is required to purchase 50 000 doses of RVF vaccine and 60 000 doses of FMD.

[According to official reports to the OIE, since late September 2019, RVF has been circulating in Sudan, primarily in the north-eastern provinces River Nile and Red Sea, affecting both humans as well as animals. Sporadic human cases have also been reported in the provinces Khartoum, White Nile, Gedaref and Kassala. The total, as of 4 Nov 2019, was 279 cases, including 9 deaths (CFR 3.2%).

The assessment of RVF recurrence, in particular RVF vector amplification, in Eastern Africa are based on climatic anomalies, historical RVF occurrences, and above-average rainfall forecasts. - Mod.AS
