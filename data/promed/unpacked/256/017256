Austria confirms 1st MERS virus case
--------------------------------
Austrian health authorities confirmed the 1st case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and said Tuesday [30 Sep 2014] that the female patient from Saudi Arabia was in critical condition.

"The patient is responding to therapy and is on the path to stable condition," a hospital spokeswoman said.
The woman had arrived in Austria a few days earlier and was admitted to an isolation ward in a Vienna hospital, the Health Ministry said Monday [29 Sep 2014].

A dozen [12] cases of MERS have been recorded in the European Union so far, the ministry said.
The strain of the coronavirus that causes MERS was 1st identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

In July [2012], WHO confirmed 291 deaths globally and 837 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection.

MERS has similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke out in Asia in 2003. It is deadlier but has a lower rate of transmission, with symptoms including fever, pneumonia and kidney failure.

First MERS CoV case in Austria
----------------------
The BMG was informed on [29 Sep 2014] of a confirmed case of MERS CoV infection in a female citizen of Saudi Arabia, who has traveled to Austria a few days ago. She is currently being cared for in isolation in a Vienna hospital. All possible contact persons are currently being identified and informed about the disease as well as other measures. Since the beginning of the outbreak more than 800 cases has been reported globally with a total of 12 reported in the EU [European Union], where there have also been secondary cases in individuals who have had close contact [with other MERS-CoV infected] individuals [person-to-person transmission]. Further spread could be prevented in the countries concerned through appropriate protective measures. These measures are being carried out in Austria.

[The remainder of the report provides background on the disease, recommendations for travelers, and recommendations for those planning on attending the Haj. - Mod.MPP]

[The above reports of a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in 2 individuals with exposure in Saudi Arabia, one a female who traveled from Saudi Arabia to Austria, the other a 79 year old Saudi male from Al Henakiyah, Al Madinah serve to highlight the continued transmission of the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.

With the addition of the case reported by Saudi Arabia today, the total number of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 754, including 319 deaths (case fatality rate 42.3 percent). At the global level, the most recent global statistics on the total number of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected cases were available in an ECDC risk assessment on 21 Aug 2014, citing a global tally of 855 cases including 333 deaths. Since that risk assessment was released, as of today, 30 Sep 2014, there have been an additional 31 cases including 19 deaths reported, all with contact in Saudi Arabia (there were 16 cases including 14 deaths retrospectively confirmed on 28 Sep 2014), bringing the global tally of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections to 886 including 352 deaths (case fatality rate 39.7 percent).

We await further information on the newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV reported by Austria, including demographics (age, and geographic location within Saudi Arabia where she was during the incubation period -- 14 days preceding onset of her illness) and possible high risk exposures (history of contact with camels, or raw camel meat, milk, urine, contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals, contact with the health sector in the 14 days preceding onset of illness).

An obvious concern is the documentation of a case of MERS-CoV in Al Madina, the 2nd most visited holy site in Saudi Arabia where pilgrims go while performing the Haj pilgrimage. Pilgrims have been arriving in Saudi Arabia this past week with expectations of the Hajj to be between 2 and 7 October this year (2014). Al Henakiyah is approximately 125 kms to the northeast of Al Madinah town where the holy site is located (see google map showing the trajectory http://tinyurl.com/oucw25h). It should also be noted here, that since 1 Sep 2014, there have been 5 cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection in Taif, Makkah (Mecca) -- approximately 94 kms due east of Mecca (http://tinyurl.com/oeg9zav).
