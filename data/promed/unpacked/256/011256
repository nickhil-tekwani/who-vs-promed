CJD-BSE Connection (17) 970108143703

Although the studies so far done on the BSE-nvCJD connection show
astounding similarity in a number of different facets, I believe the
results are being misinterpreted. The fact that nvCJD and BSE prion
proteins act and even respond in identical ways does NOT mean their is
necessarily a causal connection between the two. It simply means the two
agents are extremely similar chemically. In order to adjudge the extent to
which this indicates a causal connection (either implicatively or by a
common cause), we would have to know the false positive rate of such a
comparison. I.e., how many different types of TSE agents are possible. At
the moment, we simply know nvCJD and BSE are a match among the half-dozen
other types studied.
So at present, we know the two agents are remarkably close in chemical
action and structure. Either there are a limited number of subtypes of
prion diseases, or there is a causal connection between the two.
Personally, I find the coincidence of the scrapie pandemic, the BSE
epidemic, the nvCJD disease and the increasing incidence of CJD in the UK
as jointly indicating a causal link among or behind themselves.
I have pieced together the dates of onset of disease from published and
press reports of the 21 nvCJD victims, and performed a simple hazard
function analysis. The results show that, so far as the first 21 cases are
concerned, there is a statistically constant incidence rate of 6.7
(6.3-6.9, 95% confidence) cases per year, with no evidence the case rate is
increasing. The data fit near perfectly (R2=98%) a simple exponential
distribution. The false appearance of an increasing case rate in the news
has been fostered by the clumped release of delayed patient data. (I would
be happy to supply a copy of the report to anyone who may be interested.)
This indicates that, even if nvCJD is being driven by the BSE epidemic, the
incidence of disease is being limited by either a rare combination of
genetic and environmental factors to a near constant and low frequency. It
is also possible that nvCJD is not directly connected to BSE, but is a
naturally occurring variant with action similar to BSE which was discovered
and separately classified by heightened surveillance. It is also possible
that if BSE is driving the nvCJD epidemic, what we have seen so far is a
self-limiting low incubation period type, and latter and larger pulses with
increasing rates will appear after a longer incubation period.
[Robert raises some interesting points but clearly the new research pushes
the BSE & nvCJD causal football down the field a great deal. Analysis and
modelling of the epidemic curve will certainly be important for monitoring
the epidemic. The work done on the predictive modelling for the BSE
epidemic by John Wilesmith's group has really been valuable in
understanding where things are and what should be done. - Mod. pc

The question offered at the end of this posting is incisive and, far from
being rhetorical, is worthy of attention and serious consideration. Changes
in human behavior and/or changes wrought by humans have frequently resulted
in microbial shifts, sometimes resulting in disease. At least a partial
answer to the question is contained within the question itself: "If the
genesis of this disease . . . was a change in the operational technology of
the animal rendering industry".
The recognition of a change in the way things have been done, or the degree
to which they depart from the way nature has done things should send up a
red flag to us. The use of offal as feed for a strictly herbivorous animal
is both a change in how bovines feed and a change in how humans have done
it in the past 10,000 years.
That technology seems to me to have been a radical change or departure. And
we have gotten a microbial reaction. When a revolution in our thoughts
regarding sexual behavior occurred in the US in the late 60s and through
the 70s, the microbes responded to that change (and I'm not just talking
about HIV). Radical changes occurred in behaviors and the microbes were
there to take advantage of the changes. As human behavior changes, we can
expect microbes to change also.
Evaluation of the changes proposed must come before the changes are
enacted. We might not be able to accurately predict exactly what will
happen. What we can definitely expect is a microbial reaction to our actions.
What else is happening out there in terms of humans changing things around?
Is the incidence of food borne outbreaks in the US due to and increase in
food-borne microbes, increased virulence, or is it due to the fact that
lots more people go out to eat now. Or, is it a two-way street, both
humans and microbes feeling each other out, each trying to figure out what
the other is going to do. (Apologies for the anthropomorphism here.)
There are probably changes going on out there that we are not even
conscious of, but can recognize if we ask the right questions. I hate
buzzwords, but perhaps it's time to be proactive and head off any changes
occurring that spell disaster at some point in the future.
[The tricky bit is to identify which changes are going to cause problems.
If something might cause a problem, will the problem(s) be minor or
something big enough so that we should halt a new innovation? - Mod. pc
