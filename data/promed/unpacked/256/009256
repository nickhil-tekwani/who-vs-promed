Dutch bird flu cases keep rising, no end in sight
----------------------------------------------
The number of bird flu cases in the Netherlands continued to grow on Monday
and authorities remained unsure when the outbreak would stop spreading.
All confirmed cases so far have been confined to the central Gelderland
province, calming fears that the highly-contagious disease would spread
like wildfire through the European Union's biggest poultry exporter and the
world's largest egg exporter.
But several more cases are being reported each day, with confirmed ones
growing to 97 farms on Monday and the number of farms suspected of
infection at 37, agriculture ministry spokesman Benno Bruggink told
Reuters. "We don't know really (when the number of cases will stop
growing). Our epidemiologists are working on it, trying to find the logic
of where it's expanding," he added.
Poultry exports have been banned and agricultural transport severely
restricted in the country, which is also the world's fourth biggest poultry
exporter. The outbreak has cost the poultry sector in the Netherlands,
which has around 100 million birds, more than 40 million euros since the
disease was discovered 3 weeks ago, based on estimates by authorities of
around 2 million euros per day.
Tests are continuing on farms throughout the country and the aim is
eventually to probe all farms. Bruggink said antibodies for a lower-grade
variant of the bird disease had been found on 3 turkey farms outside the
main contaminated area, in the southwest of the country, but no quarantine
was imposed as the actual disease had not been found. The less virulent
variant of bird flu is not harmful in itself, but authorities fear it
mutates into the deadly version.

[The Dutch ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management & Fisheries reports
on Tue, 24 Mar 2003 that 7 outbreaks have been added since yesterday, the
total number of poultry farms affected by fowl plague (highly pathogenic
avian influenza, HPAI) reaching 141, of which 97 are "definitely infected"
while 44 are, at present, regarded "highly suspected".
In another press release, the Ministry announced an alleviation of the
animal transport restrictions, allowing broilers for immediate slaughter to
be imported from German farms directly to Dutch slaughterhouses. The
Ministry explains that the decision is considered not to compromise
biosecurity. It has been taken in view of the animal welfare problems,
created on German farms due to the Dutch import ban. This measure comes
into effect Tue, 24 Mar 2003, at 18.00 pm. - Mod.AS]
