[1] UK: heterologous prime-boost vaccine trial
Date: Tue 8 Dec 2020 00.01 GMT
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/covid-mixed-vaccine-trial-likely-to-begin-in-uk-next-month


A trial is likely to go ahead in January [2021] to find out whether mixing and matching COVID vaccines gives better protection than 2 doses of the same one, the head of the British government's taskforce has said. The trial will begin if the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is approved in the coming weeks, as is hoped. The treatment can only be administered with licensed vaccines.

The news comes as the 1st British patients begin receiving coronavirus vaccinations from Tuesday [8 Dec 2021], a jab made by Pfizer/BioNTech, a week after the UK became the 1st country in the western world to approve a COVID vaccine.

Those who take part in January's [2021] trial will get one shot of AstraZeneca's vaccine and one of the Pfizer injection. A vaccine from US biotech firm Moderna will also be included if it gets approval.

Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines have both been shown to have 95% efficacy at protecting people against the virus. For AstraZeneca's, efficacy was 62% among the largest cohort given 2 doses but rose to 90% among a smaller group given 1/2 a dose initially, followed by a full dose.

Kate Bingham, outgoing chair of the UK's vaccine taskforce, said the "mix and match" trials were not about making limited supplies of the vaccines go further. The UK government has ordered 40m [million] doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 100m [million] of Oxford/AstraZeneca's candidate. "It's not being done because of supplies," said Bingham. "It's to do with trying to trigger the immune response and the durability and nothing to do with what vaccines we've got."

The concept is known as a heterologous prime-boost. "It means mix and matching vaccines," said Bingham. "So you do a prime with one vaccine and then the 2nd -- whether it's 28 days or 2 months or whatever the agreed periods would be -- would be with a different vaccine."

Viral-based vaccines such as the Oxford jab, which is based on a chimp common cold virus, give a much greater cellular response -- prompting the T-cells to kill cells infected with the coronavirus. The mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer's, tend to generate a bigger antibody response. So the idea is to combine them, in whichever order, to help the immune system respond more powerfully to SARS-CoV2.

"No one's ever done it live and since we'll have safe vaccines available we should do that study because then we have the ability to actually produce better immune responses," said Clive Dix, deputy chair of the taskforce. "There is a slight benefit to it, too, in that if prime and boosting either way around work, it may help with the deployment, because it might just be simpler to deploy that way round, but the main reason is to get a stronger immune response."

Bingham and Dix were speaking at the launch of a progress report on the 1st 6 months of the taskforce, which has secured deals for 7 different vaccines for the UK. 3 of them -- Oxford/AstraZeneca, Valneva, and Novavax -- are being manufactured in the UK. The 1st doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been made in the Netherlands and Germany, but 4m [million] doses are already in the country and most of the rest of the supply will be UK-manufactured.

There remain questions over when the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be approved. The UK regulator has been asked by the government to appraise it following a rolling review, assessing all data and information on safety and efficacy and the quality of the product over recent months as it has become available. But the full data from the late-stage clinical trials, involving 24 000 people, have not yet been published and it is not known how the regulators will view the results.

Dix said the taskforce had no regrets over backing other types of vaccine over mRNA vaccines like Pfizer's and Moderna's, adding: "We certainly wouldn't have got enough [of the Pfizer vaccine] to vaccinate everybody."

They looked at Moderna but realised they could not get any doses until April [2021], so did not sign a contract. On the day Moderna reported its results, a deal was agreed to buy 5m [million] doses, which was later increased to 7m [million].

[Another article covering this in the Daily Mail has a nice table comparing the 3 vaccines -- Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9027097/People-mix-match-coronavirus-vaccines-jab-chiefs-say.html)

According to Lu S (1), the 1st major report demonstrating the use of a heterologous prime-boost vaccination approach was Hu et al's study on the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in Macaques (2) below, as part of studies on HIV vaccine development. Lu S (1) summarized the thoughts surrounding the use of heterologous-boost vaccination strategy as, "An effective vaccine usually requires more than one time immunization in the form of prime-boost. Traditionally the same vaccines are given multiple times as homologous boosts. New findings suggested that prime-boost can be done with different types of vaccines containing the same antigens. In many cases, such heterologous prime-boost can be more immunogenic than homologous prime-boost. Heterologous prime-boost represents a new way of immunization and will stimulate better understanding of the immunological basis of vaccines."

Agrawal (3) reviews the concept of heterologous immunity and states that "Heterologous immunity can broaden the protective outcomes of vaccinations and natural resistance to infections."

The concept has been studied in animal models and found to be promising. 2 small studies in humans showed promising results as well as safety with vaccines targeting Influenza A(H5N1) and Ebolavirus (4,5).

The UK proposed trial is focused on optimizing response to vaccines targeting the SARS-CoV-2 and seeing if the concept of heterologous-boost vaccination is ready for prime time, potentially lengthening the duration of immunity against the virus in the vaccine recipients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When COVID-19 struck Europe, Slovakia was quick to respond. It locked down early. Its population readily adopted face masks. At the end of April 2020, Slovakia had the lowest COVID-19 death rate on the continent. But the 2nd wave has proved harder to manage. On [1 Sep 2020], Slovakia had registered just over 4000 cases of COVID-19. By [31 Oct 2020], this figure had risen to nearly 60 000. The country has once again taken strong action. It imposed another lockdown and then, over the course of 2 weekends, became the 1st European nation to roll out mass testing for COVID-19.

On [31 Oct 2020-1 Nov 2020], Slovakia tested 3.6 million of its 5.5 million inhabitants using lateral flow tests, the results of which are available within an hour. The tests reached 95% of the targeted population (children younger than 10 years and adults older than 65 years were excluded from the campaign). About 5000 testing sites were established around the country. 40 000 healthcare workers, armed forces personnel, and volunteers ran the operation.

"Our primary goal was to identify the people who were most infectious, the ones who had a high viral load and were the greatest epidemiological risk," explains Pavol Jarcuska, associate professor in the department of infectology and travel medicine at PJ Safarik University (Kosice, Slovakia) and member of the Government's scientific advisory committee. A pilot scheme in the north of the country had seen a 60% drop in positive results between the 2 rounds of testing. The lateral flow tests used by Slovakia are associated with a false negative rate of around 30%. "We knew this prior to testing," said Jarcuska. "But the test is very effective at detecting those with a high viral load. It misses some people with lower viral loads, but these people are not so infectious."

The 1st weekend yielded 38 359 positive results, which translates to a disease prevalence of 1.06%. Those who tested positive were required to continue adhering to the strictures of the lockdown. Slovaks who received a negative test result were given a certificate that allowed them to travel freely. The following weekend, Slovakia tested 2 million people in the regions where a high prevalence of COVID-19 had been identified.

Anne Wyllie, associate research scientist in epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine (New Haven, Connecticut, USA) welcomed the effort. "Mass testing offers an opportunity to reset where you are in the pandemic", she told The Lancet Microbe. "You can identify cases and hotspots and start the process of contact tracing; it means you have a good shot at breaking chains of transmission." But she stressed the importance of supportive measures. Slovakia offers accommodation for those who cannot easily self-isolate in their homes. It also compensates workers who have to take time off after a positive test result. This is an important incentive, especially given the possibility of false positives. Testing 3.6 million people with a test with a specificity of 99.7%, for example, would result in 10 800 individuals being wrongly advised to self-isolate.

On [6 Nov 2020], Liverpool became the 1st place in the UK to trial mass testing. Anyone who lives or works in the city is eligible for a lateral flow test; those who test positive are offered confirmatory RT-PCR testing. As of [20 Nov 2020], 90 429 residents had been tested using lateral flow, out of a total population of 500 000, 629 of whom had tested positive. "The pilot will help to inform a blueprint for how mass testing can be achieved and how fast and reliable COVID-19 testing can be delivered at scale", noted a press release from the Department of Health and Social Care.

Mike Gill, former regional director of public health in the southeast region of England, has misgivings. "If you are going to start screening people, the aim has to be to reduce transmission. The main means of doing this is self-isolation, and we know this is going very badly in the UK," he explained. "Simply finding more cases will not do anything to reduce the burden of disease; indeed, it may even make things worse, if it is not done systematically."

Gill pointed out that a programme organised on a general invitation basis, rather than by call and recall, could end up screening only those at least risk from COVID-19. "Who is going to take time off work to queue in the rain, and open up the possibility of having to take even more time off if they receive a positive result?" he asked. "The way things stand in the UK, pushing mass testing amounts to apply more pressure to the weakest link in the chain." The government clearly disagrees. As The Lancet Microbe went to press, Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled plans to roll out mass testing in parts of England where COVID-19 is particularly widespread.

[China has been using mass testing combined with isolation as the strategy for dealing with cluster outbreaks in the country, with a success rate leading to interruption of transmission in the affected areas (usually urban). An important variable that had a probable significant impact in Slovakia was the "accommodation for those who cannot easily self-isolate in their homes." And compensation for "workers who have to take time off after a positive test result." Other countries should pay attention to this success.

The UK has started a trial in Liverpool, and one can see the push back on the part of naysayers. These major efforts may supplant the need for prolonged lockdowns and aid significantly in economic recovery.

The death toll of COVID-19 in Afghanistan has increased to 1902 after 27 patients lost their lives within the past 24 hours, the country's Ministry of Public Health reported on Monday [7 Dec 2020]. The ministry also confirmed 232 new cases during the period, bringing the number of infected people across the country to 48 133 including 7737 active cases, the ministry said in a statement. A total of 202 people recovered and were discharged from hospitals since early Sunday [6 Dec 2020], according to the ministry. Laboratories across Afghanistan have completed 160 161 tests since the outbreak of the pandemic in February 2020, according to statistics of the ministry.

[Apparently, the total number of confirmed cases reported from Afghanistan is relatively low as compared to other neighboring countries. However, in about 11 months more than 160 000 tests have been conducted. The prevalence and incidence estimation of COVID-19 with low testing is difficult to determine. In remote settings with limited availability of PCR based testing, the use of rapid antigen-based tests may be considered to enhance the testing capacity for early identification of cases and clusters.

The WHO interim guidance regarding antigen detection in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection using rapid immunoassays is available at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/antigen-detection-in-the-diagnosis-of-sars-cov-2infection-using-rapid-immunoassays. - Mod.MS

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
Global summary
The global incidence of new cases remained very similar to the previous week with just under 4 million new cases reported in the past 7 days, while new deaths, globally, increased slightly to over 73 000 new deaths reported [Figure 1]. New cases and deaths in the Region of the Americas account for nearly 1/2 of all new cases and over 1/3 of all new deaths this week. While new cases remain high in the European Region, new deaths have decreased for the 2nd week. New cases declined in the South East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions this week. Deaths decreased in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and increased in the South East Asia Region. In the African Region, while both new cases and deaths remain low compared to other regions, there was an increase of 9% in new cases. New deaths have remained stable over the past few weeks. In the Western Pacific Region, cases showed a small decline overall while new deaths increased slightly this week.

As of [7 Dec 2020] there have been over 65.8 million cases and over 1.5 million deaths reported since the start of the pandemic.

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (reporting over 1.2 million cases, a 9% increase from the previous week), Brazil (over 295 000 new cases, a 35% increase), India (over 251 000 cases, a 15% decrease), Russian Federation (over 191 000 new cases, a 6% increase), and Italy (over 145 000 new cases, a 21% decrease).

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
In the past 7 days, over 53 000 new cases were reported in the African Region, a 9% increase compared to the previous week, while deaths remained similar to last week's at just under 1000 new reported deaths (Figure 3). South Africa continues to account for the greatest proportion (48%) of new weekly cases in the Region. In the past 7 days, the highest number of new cases was reported from South Africa (25 310 new cases, 427 new cases per 1 million population), Algeria (6290 new cases, 143 new cases per 1 million population), Kenya (5379 new cases, 100 per 1 million population), Ethiopia (3810 new cases, 33 new cases per 1 million population), and Uganda (2244 new cases, 49 per 1 million population).

Over the past month, Kenya has reported its highest weekly cases and deaths. However, in the past week, these numbers have declined by 13% and 8%, respectively, for both new cases and deaths. Case totals in the country have reached nearly 88 000 since the start of the pandemic and, with fatalities only being reported for hospital deaths, it is likely that cumulative deaths are being underreported. A study in July [2020] reported that for a country of 51 million people, there are only 537 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and 256 ventilators. Nearly 75% of Kenya's ICU beds are in Nairobi and Mombasa. Thus far Kenya has conducted nearly 886 000 tests with a testing rate of 1.2 per 1000 population in the last week and a test positivity rate of 10%.

Cases in Nigeria have increased by 46% in the past seven days, the highest weekly case count reported since August [2020]. In the past 7 days, 22 of the 37 states in Nigeria have reported new cases with the highest case numbers being reported in the states of Lagos, Federal Capital Territory, Plateau, Oyo, and Kaduna. In a country of over 206 million persons, Nigeria has conducted over 803 000 tests throughout the pandemic. In the last reporting week, it had a testing rate of 0.17 per 1000 population and a test positivity rate of 4.6%. Additionally, while the volume of inbound international travel in the past week has remained within its normal parameters, the number of travelers with a positive result after seven days has increased by 68% (from 48 to 81).

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [6 Dec 2020].

- Region of the Americas
In the Region of the Americas, the weekly number of new cases reached 1 845 816 this week with 26 624 new deaths, accounting for 12% and 18% increases compared to the previous week, respectively (Figure 4). The United States of America accounted for 68% of all new cases reported in the past week in the Region. The highest new case and deaths counts were reported in the United States of America (1 251 632 new cases, 3781 new cases per 1 million), Brazil (295 618 new cases, 1391 new cases per 1 million), Mexico (66 095 new cases, 513 new cases per 1 million), Colombia (62 097 new cases, 1220 new cases per 1 million), and Argentina (47 354 new cases, 1048 new cases per 1 million).

In Brazil, a 35% increase in cases was observed in the past week, with 295 618 new cases (1391 cases per 1 million population), which was the highest number reported since mid-August. Upwards trends are being observed in all 5 regions, and to date, the Southeast Region, which includes the state of Sao Paulo, has reported the highest number of cumulative cases and deaths, followed by the Northeast Region. The number of new deaths was 3990, a 19% increase compared to the previous week. On [1 Dec 2020], the government of Paraná in southern Brazil, which borders Paraguay and Argentina, introduced a night curfew.

In Mexico, 66 095 new cases (513 cases per 1 million population) were reported in the past week, a 2% increase compared to the previous week and the highest weekly case count since the beginning of the pandemic. There were 3990 new deaths reported, similar levels to the previous week. The government is urging citizens to stay home and is planning to add hospital beds, medical equipment, and increase the number of doctors and nurses ahead of the holiday season.

The number of new cases in Canada continues to increase with 43 505 reported (1153 cases per 1 million population), a 13% increase from the previous week reaching the highest weekly number since the beginning of the pandemic. 602 new deaths were reported in the past week, a 7% increase compared to the previous week. In Manitoba province, which reported the 5th highest number of COVID-19 cases in Canada, outbreaks have been reported in a children's daycare center, at a hospital, and at a care home in recent weeks. The province of Quebec plans to prohibit gatherings over the holidays in the maximum alert "red zones", which covers most of the state, as a result of the recent upward trend in cases.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [6 Dec 2020].

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
For the 2nd consecutive week, both new cases and new deaths have declined. The Eastern Mediterranean Region reported over 240 000 new cases and over 5000 new deaths, reflecting a reduction of 2% and 12% respectively compared to the previous week (Figure 5). Increases in both new weekly cases and new weekly deaths were reported in Afghanistan, Egypt, occupied Palestinian territory, Oman, and Somalia. The highest number of new cases were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (93 187 new cases, 1109 new cases per 1 million), Morocco (27 050 new cases, 733 new cases per 1 million), Jordan (26 804 new cases, 2627 new cases per 1 million), Pakistan (20 835 new cases, 94 new cases per 1 million), and Iraq (13 699 new cases, 341 new cases per 1 million).

In Lebanon, over 10 000 new cases (1500 per 1 million population) were reported in the past week. Since cases peaked in the beginning of November [2020], small weekly decreases in new cases have been reported. 99 new deaths were reported this week compared to the 97 reported in the previous week. National health authorities stated on [3 Dec 2020] that ICUs for COVID-19 patients remain at critical capacity. Before the strengthening of public health and social measures (PHSM) came into effect in mid-November [2020], the occupancy of ICU beds ranged between 80 and 90%. As an effect of these measures being implemented, occupancy has declined to the range of 65 to 70%. Despite the high occupancy in healthcare facilities, Lebanon has seen a decreasing trend in new cases and the country is gradually relaxing PHSM by reopening restaurants, postponing curfews, and returning to face-to-face classes in some schools.

Morocco continued to show a decreasing trend in the past week, reporting a decrease of 6% in weekly new cases and 8% in weekly new deaths compared to the figures in the past week. The country reported over 27 000 new cases (733 cases per 1 million population) and over 400 new deaths (12 deaths per 1 million population). Since its peak of cases in mid-November [2020], Morocco has shown a decreasing trend in cases for 3 consecutive weeks. National health authorities inaugurated a new field hospital in the region of Souss-Massa this week and established new hospital projects for treating COVID-19 patients planned for 2021 in the region of Rabat-Sale-Kenitrar.

Since mid-October [2020], cases in Egypt have increased. In the current week, the country reported over 2800 new cases, a 13% increase compared to the past week (28 cases per 1 million population). As Egypt experiences a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, the country is strengthening public health and social measures by reducing the working hours for shops and limiting the number of employees and workers in government offices.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [6 Dec 2020]

- European Region
The number of new cases in the European Region remains high with over 1.4 million new cases reported in the past week (Figure 6). However, the number of new cases has declined again, in line with the past 4 weeks, down 10% in comparison to the last 7 days. While deaths also decreased in the Region in the past 7 days, there were still almost 35 200 deaths reported. Despite the observed reductions, the European Region continues to account for the 2nd highest number of new cases and deaths globally (37% and 48% respectively). Last week [week of 1 Dec 2020], the countries reporting the highest number of new cases were the Russian Federation (191 454 new cases, 1312 new cases per 1 million population), Italy (145 459 new cases, 2406 new cases per 1 million population), Germany (128 622 new cases, 1535 new cases per 1 million population), and the United Kingdom (100 799 new cases, 1485 per 1 million population).

In Germany, the weekly number of new cases has remained relatively unchanged compared to the previous week (3% increase), while the number of deaths has increased by 26%. An increase in both cases and deaths was seen in early October [2020], which then seemed to have plateaued in the latter half of November. While the incidence in younger ages remains stable, it continues to increase in older age groups with an incidence of cases of 128 per 100 000 population in those aged 60 years and over. The distribution of cases and deaths varies across the country with the state of North-Rhine Westphalia consistently reporting the highest number of cases, while deaths are highest in Bavaria (30.9 per 100 000 population).

The United Kingdom continues to report high numbers of new cases and deaths, although the overall incidence has decreased for the past 3 weeks. The country introduced tighter public health and social measures on [5 Nov 2020]. It has conducted nearly 39 million tests since the start of the pandemic. In the past week, the testing rate has been 29 tests per 1000 population with a test positivity rate of 5.8%. On [2 Dec 2020] the United Kingdom became the 1st country to approve Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, with the 1st doses to be administered on [8 Dec 2020]. Vaccines will be available to about 70 hospital hubs across the country and provided first to those aged over 80 years and healthcare workers.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [6 Dec 2020]

- South East Asia Region
In the South East Asia Region, new cases reported last week declined 10% compared to the previous week (332 396 new cases, 164 new cases per 1 million population), although new weekly deaths showed a slight increase of 2% compared to the previous week (5004 new deaths, 2 new deaths per 1 million population) (Figure 7). The trends in cases and deaths are still largely driven by India, which reported 76% and 70% of new weekly cases and deaths respectively in the Region. A decrease in new weekly cases was reported in India, Nepal, and the Maldives, whereas an increase was reported from Bhutan, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The highest number of new cases were reported from India (251 303 new cases, 182 new cases per 1 million), Indonesia (41 708 new cases, 152 new cases per 1 million), and Bangladesh (15 260 new cases, 93 new cases per 1 million).

In Nepal, over 9000 new cases (314 per 1 million population) were reported in the past week, a significant decrease of 24% compared to the previous week. In addition, the number of new deaths decreased by 17%, to 123 new deaths (4 deaths per 1 million population). As of [2 Dec 2020], 77% of cases were reported from 3 provinces, Province 1, Bagmati province, and Lumbini province. National authorities inaugurated 5 provincial infectious diseases hospitals and 309 basic hospitals at the municipal level across the country. In addition, health authorities are working with Kathmandu Municipality, one of the hardest hit areas, to institutionalize community based active surveillance and testing.

In Bangladesh, new weekly cases and deaths remained at similar levels as the previous week, with over 15 000 new cases (93 new cases per 1 million population) and 227 new deaths (1 death per 1 million population) reported in this week. As of [30 Dec 2020], the bed occupancy rate for general beds and ICUs were 17.4% and 56.2% respectively, according to national health authorities. Moreover, on [5 Dec 2020], the country started a new testing strategy, introducing the antigen rapid detection test (Antigen-RDT) in 10 of the 64 districts (Jashore, Brahmanbaria, Gaibandha, Joyupurhat, Madaripur, Meherpur, Munshiganj, Panchagarh, Patuakhali, and Sylhet). Among the samples tested, the proportion of infection detected by antigen-RDT [rapid diagnostic test] was 26.5%. The country will be gradually expanding antigen-based testing in areas where PCR testing is currently not implemented.

- Western Pacific Region
Last week [week of 1 Dec 2020], in the Western Pacific Region, the weekly incidence of new cases was 40 039, with 461 new deaths, accounting for a 1% decrease in cases and a 4% increase in deaths compared to the previous week (Figure 8). Countries including the Republic of Korea and China reported an upward trend in weekly new cases, while countries including Malaysia, Guam, and Mongolia reported a downward trend compared to the previous week. The highest new case and death counts were reported in Japan (15 445 new cases, 122 new cases per 1 million), Philippines (10 272 new cases, 94 new cases per 1 million), and Malaysia (8183 new cases, 253 new cases per 1 million).

In Malaysia, 8183 new weekly cases were reported, a 14% decrease compared to the previous week, but the levels continue to remain high since the rise of cases in September. The number of new weekly deaths reported was 26, an 18% increase compared to the previous week, but overall the trend continues to decline since death counts peaked in mid- to late October [2020]. Sabah state has reported the highest number of cumulative cases, followed by Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Negeri Sembilan states. Among the new cases reported in the past week, there were cases linked to clusters in prisons and temporary detention centers in Kedah, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Sabah, and Penang states. In addition to correctional facilities, clusters have also been identified in construction sites, factories, and other workplaces, as well as in family settings.

China reported 831 cases (1 per 1 million population) in the past week, a 22% increase compared to the previous week, though cases remain at low levels. New weekly cases last exceeded 800 in the week commencing [27 Jul 2020]. 3 deaths were reported in the past week.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added yet)].

Data by country, area, or territory for 8 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC8_1607462066.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 47.6% of daily case numbers and 29.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 28.5 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Chile, and Peru. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Puerto Rico, Paraguay, and Dominican Republic. Costa Rica did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 36.3% of daily case numbers and 52.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 20.6 million. Countries not reporting cases today (8 Dec 2020) include Israel, Sweden, and Kazakhstan among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Turkey, Russia, UK, Germany, Italy, and Ukraine. There are 19 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours and 7 countries reporting more than 500 but less than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.8% of daily case numbers and 8.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.34 million cases. Iran maintains its dominance, with daily totals now beginning to drop from more than 13 000 to less than 11 000, followed by Jordan, Pakistan, Iraq, Palestinian Authority, Morocco, and the UAE. Lebanon reported more than 500 but less than 1000 new cases, while Sudan and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.7% of daily case numbers and 1.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.56 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Mauritania (almost 1100 newly reported cases), Uganda, Algeria, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Botswana, Kenya, Mali, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Burkina Faso. Ghana, Cameroon, Madagascar, and Cabo Verde, among other countries, did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 0.91% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.92 million cases. Japan is maintaining its dominance followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 7.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.15 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia (with more than 5700 cases confirmed in the past 24 hours), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The Maldives did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

Impression: Basically, unchanged on the regional levels, with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 81% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, it is basically unchanged as well. Japan is the dominant country in the Western Pacific region, while South Korea continues to report more than 600 cases daily; Russia and Italy maintain dominance in the European region. Indonesia has been increasing daily reports in the South East Asian region. South Africa maintains dominance in the African region at a higher level in recent days and Iran maintains its dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean region although transmission may be slowing down. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis and Brazil has been increasing daily reports. All of this is apparent even as the weekend reporting decrease is still occurring with multiple countries not reporting any cases or markedly reduced.

[The weekly observed weekend reporting artifact continues. Countries not reporting any new cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Cameroon, and Uganda among others.

In the past 24 hours the USA (222 663), Brazil (47 850), Turkey (33 198), and India (32 067), and have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 726 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 7 to late 8 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Turkey, India, Russia (26 097), Sweden (18 820), Germany (18 319), Italy (14 837), France (13 713), UK (12 281), Iran (11 023), Mexico (11 006), and Ukraine (10 811). A total of 59 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 31 of the 59 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 6.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 6.0% -- even with reduced reporting. The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (28.5%) and reported deaths (48.1%) which is most likely related to increased transmission over the Thanksgiving weekend [26-29 Nov 2020] with travel and gatherings held despite advice not to. The 7-day average daily new cases reported in the USA is 211 746 and newly reported deaths is 2346. In 7 of the past 8 days, the USA has reported more than 200 000 new cases daily, and today (8 Dec 2020) represented over 35.5% of all newly reported cases.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. The increases in the USA are alarming, to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
