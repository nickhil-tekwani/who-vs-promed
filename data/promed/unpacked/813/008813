[A map is included.

It may be assumed that the virus involved is similar to the one in
neighbouring Ghana, namely H5N1 (see 20070906.2938); however, this
should be verified and confirmed by a reference laboratory.

Detailed information on the test applied in Benin's National
laboratory will be helpful. - Mod.AS]

[3] Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia killed close to 60 000 birds on Tuesday [3 Dec 2007] in
the latest discovery of the deadly disease in the kingdom, bringing
the total number birds culled to around 4 million.

The discovery at another table-egg farm in the Al-Kharj region south
of the capital Riyadh is the 15th in the area, as fears continue to
grow that the disease may spread to other parts of the kingdom.

The ministry last week said that farms surrounding the port city of
Jeddah, the gateway for pilgrims to Mecca and Medina, are still safe
from the bird flu.

Concerns over the spread of the H5N1 strain have grown steadily in
recent weeks as Saudi Arabia prepares for the Hajj, with around 3
million of pilgrims expected to gather in the holy cities of Mecca and Median.

As a precaution, the Agriculture Ministry on Tuesday [3 Dec 2007]
banned the shipment of live birds from the Riyadh area to Mecca for
the next month.

All cases of bird flu in the kingdom so far have come from the Riyadh province.
