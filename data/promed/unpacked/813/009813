Methemoglobinemia has long been a concern of nutritionists involved in
infant feeding. Infants younger than 6 months are particularly susceptible
to methemoglobinemia arising from well water high in nitrites and from the
development of nitrites in vegetables high in nitrates such as beets,
spinach, and carrots. Parents are warned not to feed these foods to infants
younger than 6 months, and never to save pureed spinach, beets, and carrots
or carrot juice in the refrigerator for later use, as bacteria in the food
can cause nitrates to rapidly convert to nitrites. Commercially prepared
spinach, beets, and carrots have been shown to be safe when first opened,
but should not be saved for later use once opened.
Preserved meats such as ham, lunch meats, bacon, and hot dogs are high in
nitrates and nitrites and should never be pureed and added to baby food for
young infants. Further, foods containing these products should not be saved
in the refrigerator for older infants.
Well water, particularly from shallow farm wells, should be checked for
nitrite content before being given to infants for drinking or being used to
prepare infant formula, juice, or food.

If this is truly a case of sodium nitrite poisoning it bears an eerie
resemblance to an incident in New York City in 1944, source of Berton
Roueche's famous article in the New Yorker Magazine (and 1953 collection)
entitled "Eleven Blue Men." In that incident homeless elderly men in NYC
consumed sodium nitrite mistakenly placed by a cook into a vat of oatmeal
and a salt shaker. One man died.

[Many thanks to those who have recalled Berton Roueche's "Eleven Blue Men"
(we are endebted also to David Sencer <djud2@mindspring.com>, Dean Cliver
<docliver@ucdavis.edu>, and Richard Wilsnac <rwilsnac@medicine.nodak.edu>).
Berton Roueche wrote a series of medical detective stories for the "Annals
in Medicine" column of the New Yorker. His story Eleven Blue Men (from the
Annals in Medicine, and also published in a book called "The Medical
Detectives") described an outbreak of methemoglobinemia in alcoholics in
New York City. A copy of the story (with the author's name spelt
differently) can be found at <http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~shier/BlueMen.html>.
