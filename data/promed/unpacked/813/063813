Equine encephalitis reappeared in the center of the city, getting
through the sanitary barrier, stated veterinarians. In 2010, the
deaths of an Embera 2-year-old girl from the virus and more than 65
horses in Darien province and in the eastern area of the city led to
an alert in the whole country and also the prohibition of horse
parades for the fiesta of San Juan. However the virus attacked in the
provinces of Panama and Colon.

Jose Rolando Torres, president of the Association of Veterinarians
and member of the National Medical Negotiation Commission, stated that
a man who worked in construction in Tocumen died in the Arnulfo Arias
Madrid Hospital complex due to equine encephalitis and mentioned
another case of a woman in Colon, who was also positive for the
virus.

The veterinarian thinks that the authorities are not carrying out
preventive or control efforts for the period in which the virus
reappears. Torres lamented that the Ministry of Health [MINSA] does
not provide the tools and the resources to prevent these cyclic
diseases. MINSA denied that there is an outbreak of encephalitis and
the deaths were a result of the disease.

[Unfortunately, this report provides no details about when these
cases occurred or the basis on which the diagnosis of equine
encephalitis of the 2 human cases was made. One cannot determine if
these were due to eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), western equine
encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, or something else
entirely. Because there were confirmed human and equine cases of EEE
virus infection a year ago (in 2010) in Panama (see archives below),
an EEE virus etiology is implied but not stated in the report above.
The denial of the occurrence of these cases by the Ministry of Health
raises serious questions about the validity of this report.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further information about the
cases as it becomes available.
