An Indonesian man who had been suffering from bird flu for days died
early on Thursday, a hospital official said, taking Indonesia's death
toll from the disease to 52. "He died because of breathing problems
which he had suffered since he was admitted to the hospital," said
Hadi Yusuf, who heads the bird flu ward at Hasan Sadikin hospital in
Bandung, West Java's provincial capital. The government had
acknowledged the 20-year-old victim as a bird flu case earlier this week.

Indonesia's 52nd death from bird flu has heightened fears about
feared human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus. The health
authorities today reported the death of a 20-year-old Indonesian man
from Bandung city in West Java, where many other cases have occurred.
The [man] died of respiratory problems but doctors had already
ascertained he was suffering from avian influenza. His 25-year-old
brother died a few days earlier on 24 Sep 2006, with symptoms of the
same disease. His death came about before blood samples could be
taken for testing and he has been included on the list of suspect cases.
Senior Health Ministry official, Nyoman Kandun, said the 2 victims'
15-year-old sister, who was also hospitalized with high fever and
respiratory problems, tested negative for H5N1 virus. Kandun said for
now, with only one confirmed case, human-to-human transmission could
not be considered as a possibility.
Such cluster cases are closely monitored by authorities and
specialists: there are fears that the virus may mutate into a form
that can easily pass between humans. Experts have warned that
human-to-human transmission -- never proven as yet -- could generate
a pandemic with millions of deaths. According to the World Health
Organisation, since bird flu first surfaced in Asia 3 years ago, it
has killed at least 147 people across the world.

[The death of the 20-year old patient brings the human H5N1 death in
Indonesia to 52, while the case number remains 67. The global total
of WHO-confirmed human cases of H5N1 remains 250, with the death toll
increased to 148.
The sister of the deceased 20-year-old patient has tested negative
for H5N1 virus infection and a previous report suggested that she had
contracted an N1 strain of seasonal influenza virus. The elder
brother of these 2 had died previously with symptoms of bird flu, but
no samples were collected for analysis. Therefore the conclusion of
the Indonesia Health Ministry is that for now, with only one
confirmed case, human-to-human transmission between the members of
the 3-member cluster of cases in West Java cannot be considered a
possibility. - Mod.CP]

It would be very instructive at this point in the smoldering epidemic
of H5N1 to see a country by country summary of cases, so far (i.e.,
all years from 2003-2006), by age and sex. Is this info available?
