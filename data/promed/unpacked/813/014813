An outbreak of typhoid in Porirua is being blamed on imported food from
Samoa. Three people have contracted the infectious and potentially fatal
disease since the beginning of 2007. Of these, 2 were from the same family
and all 3 had eaten the same batch of food; 2 [of the patients] were
treated in hospital but both have now been discharged.
Regional public health spokesperson, Annette Nesdale, said that the most
likely source of the illness is a delicacy made from taro leaves and
coconut cream that [was brought back] from Samoa by a returning traveler,
and that the 3 patients ate. "We've followed up with their family members
and their household members and we haven't found any other people who have
been ill," says Nesdale.
Pacific health experts in New Zealand say the problem is a lack of
education. Primary health nurse, Fara Leasuasu, says the answer is to make
Pacific Islanders aware of hygiene and how to prepare the food. "I think
that will solve a lot of those problems," she says.
Health officials say with 20 cases of typhoid reported in Samoa each month
it is important that travelers not bring back perishable foods.

The recent typhoid outbreak in South Auckland has been traced back to
palusami brought over from Samoa. Porirua city councillor, Litea Ah Hoi, is
suggesting that perhaps it's time to stop bringing those foods [to New
Zealand]. Ah Hoi says, "anything we want from the islands, is readily
available in New Zealand."
The Auckland Public Health Services says if the food packs are being
carried and stored properly there shouldn't be a problem. Medical officer
Greg Simmons says people just need to be more mindful of safe food practice.

[Palusami is a popular dish made from dalo or taro leaves. Thick coconut
cream is combined with onions, salt (chillies and canned meat are optional
choices) and poured into a cup made from several leaves, wrapped in foil or
banana leaves and baked.
