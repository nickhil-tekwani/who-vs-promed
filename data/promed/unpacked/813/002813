Botswana works to contain anthrax outbreak
------------------------------------------
Botswana's wildlife authorities have closed Chobe National Park to tourists
after an anthrax outbreak that threatens buffalo and elephants in one of
the country's largest game reserves, a spokesperson said on Monday [20 Sep
2004].
By Friday [17 Sep 2004], game rangers had found the carcasses of 68
buffalo, and one elephant, in the park, which borders Namibia, said
Wildlife and National Parks acting district coordinator Obert Gwapela. "We
have communicated with tour operators that they should stop taking tourists
into the park until we contain the disease," he said. No other animal
species have died so far, but nature officials are worried that predators,
such as lions, vultures, jackals, and hyenas, may feed off the flesh of the
dead animals. "We need time to assess how the disease is spreading and how
it can be contained," Gwapela said.
Chobe National Park is a major tourism draw in Botswana, attracting
tourists interested in game viewing because of its abundant wildlife,
including elephants, buffaloes, and lions. It also boasts most of the
country's safari camps. Wildlife authorities are trying to nail down the
origin of the acute infectious bacterial disease, which mainly affects wild
and domestic animals, but, can also pose a risk to humans exposed to
infected animals or their tissue. Gwapela stressed, however, that there is
no danger to humans. "It is too early to say when the park may be opened,
as our teams are currently on the ground assessing the situation," Gwapela
added.
Annually, tourism brings in about USD 104 million in revenue to the arid
Southern African country. The anthrax outbreak has sparked fears within the
tourism and hospitality industry of major financial losses. Anthrax has
broken out before in the Chobe National Park, the latest outbreak being in
1996. That outbreak was attributed to buffaloes that had strayed from Namibia.
Symptoms [in humans - Mod.AS] include skin infections that can develop into
ulcers or swelling of lymph glands, breathing problems, vomiting, and
fever, officials said.
