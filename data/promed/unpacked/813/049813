ASEPTIC MENINGITIS - USA (SOUTH DAKOTA)

[Brad Walsh, Texas Department of Health, <DonaldBrad.Walsh@tdh.state.tx.us>
asked (see 980808183533 cited below): "Can we ask if other areas are having
a bad year for aseptic meningitis? Without looking up the exact numbers,
it seems that we're seeing maybe 50-100% more reports this summer than the
last 3. Our Texas Department of Health virology lab says the virus
isolations (a tiny fraction of the total cases) have shown largely
echovirus 30." - Mod.CHC]

From: Susan Lance <SusanL@doh.state.sd.us>

>From April 15 through July 31, we've had 121 cases of aseptic meningitis
reported to the South Dakota Department of Health. Of these, echoviruses
have been isolated from 58. The ones we have typed (about half) have been
echovirus 30. From January 1- July 31, 1997, we had only 7 aseptic
meningitis cases reported. Aseptic meningitis is reportable in South
Dakota but not in all states.
The majority of cases (65 aseptic meningitis, of which 36 had an echovirus
isolate) have been reported from Pennington County, which includes Rapid
City. We've started seeing cases in the eastern half of the state in the
last 2 months.

[Thanks. We would appreciate it if someone knowledgeable about U.S.
national patterns of aseptic meningitis would let us know whether this
multi state picture is unusual or not. Of course, numbers of aseptic
meningitis cases peak seasonally and the etiologic agent of many summer
cases never are known (no effort made, no success, arboviruses,
unidentified agents, etc.) but we now have reports of great increases in
cases within the past few months. Is this an inordinate increase? - Mod.CHC
