Trying to reduce dog populations by killing dogs (and cats) by the millions
has been attempted for many centuries, with no examples of even transient
success in a mainland habitat. A dog population can be reduced and even
eliminated through the combination of mass sterilization and eliminating
food sources, and this is what eventually eliminated the street dog
populations in the USA and Europe: open garbage heaps became covered
landfills, sewers were enclosed, and the transition to mechanized vehicles
ended the accessibility of horse faeces full of undigested grain to rats,
who in turn were a major protein source for dogs.

Killing dogs never had a comparable effect. Even when New York City (NYC)
was killing a quarter of a million dogs per year, between 40 and 50 years
ago, the numbers of dogs kept increasing. The numbers began their long
slide to the present level of about 20 000 killed per year only after the
introduction of the 1st high-volume, low-cost sterilization program in NYC
in 1968.

Bangkok has far more dogs at large than NYC ever did, so trying to kill
dogs there would be even more of an exercise in futility, especially while
food sources remain abundant practically everywhere.

The Bali [Indonesia] government has been trying to both kill and vaccinate
their way out of a rabies outbreak for 16 months now, with about 35
acknowledged human deaths so far. The vaccination program suffers because
so many resources have been directed into the killing side of the effort.

With a dog population officially estimated at 500 000, even if Bali managed
to exterminate dogs at the rate of 1000 a day, for an entire year, with no
holidays, the Bali dog population, like any dog population, could still out
breed the extermination effort. Only if it were possible to kill more than
70 per cent of all of the dogs in Bali within one breeding cycle, including
the owned population, would it be possible to eliminate street dogs even
temporarily, so long as their food sources remain. Otherwise, the surviving
dogs (including abandoned or strayed pets) will rapidly breed up to the
carrying capacity of the habitat and form a new unvaccinated population.

Coming to this realization in other locations after centuries of failed
attempts to eradicate rabies by killing dogs is why, over the past 30
years, every major national and international organization concerned with
rabies control has come to recommend against culling dogs en masse in
response to rabies outbreaks. This includes the World Health Organization,
the US Centers for Disease Control, the OIE [ Organisation Mondiale de la
Sante Animale], the Rabies Alliance, the National Animal Control
Association, the National Association of Public Health Veterinarians, and
the International Society for Infectious Diseases, among others.

It is also necessary to vaccinate 70 per cent of a dog population to
totally prevent the spread of rabies, but when dogs are vaccinated, they
stay vaccinated for at least the duration of the potency of the vaccine,
which will be 3 years if good quality vaccines are used. Unlike dead dogs,
vaccinated dogs do not leave a habitat void into which an unvaccinated
population can multiply.
