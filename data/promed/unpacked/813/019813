The UN Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] has dispatched 3 experts to North Korea to help contain a foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] outbreak that Pyongyang says is spreading after emerging in the country more than 2 months ago, according to a US radio report.

The 3 experts plan to assess the situation with their North Korean counterparts and make recommendations on how to contain the highly contagious animal disease, the Voice of America [radio] reported Thursday [13 Mar 2014], citing [FAO's] Chief Veterinary Officer, Juan Lubroth.

The trip comes more than 2 weeks after North Korea made a request for assistance to the UN body.

Last month [February 2014], the North told the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health [OIE; see ProMED-mail post 20140220.2289582] that the animal disease had broken out at a pig farm in a suburb of its capital, Pyongyang, on 8 Jan 2014.

The North's media reported last month [February 2014] that the country had killed 2900 pigs as a preventive measure to stop the spread of the disease and buried about 360 others that had died from the disease.

The highly contagious animal disease is continuing to spread due to a lack of vaccines, diagnostic means and disinfectants, according to the North's media.

FMD is an infectious and sometimes fatal disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as pigs, cattle, deer, and sheep [and goats].

Last month [February 2014], South Korea offered to supply disinfectants and other assistance to North Korea, though Pyongyang failed to respond to the offer.
