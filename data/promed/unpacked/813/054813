Florida officials consider making strangles a reportable disease
------------------------------------------------
Officials from Florida's Department of Agriculture expect to confirm
additional cases of strangles at Palm Meadows Training Center and will
consider placing the highly contagious respiratory disease on the state's
list of reportable diseases.
[If strangles is made] a reportable disease, horsemen would be required to
notify officials of suspected cases.
5 horses trained by Dale Romans have tested positive at Palm Meadows for
strangles. Dr. Mike Short, manager of equine programs for the Florida
Department of Agriculture, said he expects an unknown number of additional
positives from Romans's barn.
"There's generally approximately a 2-week incubation period on it, so this
is not unexpected," Short told the Palm Beach Post. "There's no indication
that it has spread outside the barns that we have under quarantine right now."
Trainer Randy Schulfhofer, who is stabled in the barn next to Romans, said
he would support the change making strangles a reportable disease.
Schulfhofer's barn has been under quarantine after a horse he trains, Sky
Conqueror, showed signs of strangles but passed a 1st round of tests.
"It's a good idea after the trouble it has caused here," Schulhofer said.
"It was just an unfortunate thing, but if it was reportable, it'd make
people have to take precautions."

equine events where horses are commingled from many different areas, the
proposed change may cut down on the transmission of the disease. - Mod.TG]
