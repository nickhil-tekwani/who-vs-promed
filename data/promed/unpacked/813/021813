Cryptosporidiosis after attending petting zoo
---------------------------------------------
2 people contracted cryptosporidiosis and more than a dozen others got sick after attending a local petting zoo 31 March, state health officials said.

The Minnesota Department of Health issued an alert to health care providers Wednesday afternoon after laboratory tests confirmed 2 people picked up the parasite, which causes severe watery diarrhea.

The Humane Society of Goodhue County had a one-day petting zoo and photo shoot at its shelter on Bench Street. 15 visitors and staff members have been identified so far, all with symptoms consistent with "crypto" infection, according to a release from Goodhue County Health & Human Services.

Colleen LaVine, infection prevention coordinator for the Fairview Red Wing Medical Center, said it's fortunate the Humane Society had everyone sign a roster, which officials used to track people down. "In another circumstance they might not have a clear idea of who all was there," she said Thursday.

All on the list have been contacted. If they have or had symptoms -- diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss and low-grade fever -- they were asked to follow up with their health care provider. For more information, see the 21 April edition of the Republican Eagle.

[Children come in intimate contact with various animals at petting zoos and it is almost inevitable that the commensal bacterial flora from the animals may be transmitted. Especially the risk of being infected with Vero toxin-producing _E. coli_, VTEC, which may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is well documented.
