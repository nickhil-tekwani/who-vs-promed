Re: 1st anthrax case of 2009
----------------------------
The information that I received from TAHC [Texas Animal Health
Commission] is that of a herd of 31 head on 1500 acres [607 ha], 6
are dead and 6 are missing. Two dead deer were also found on the
property. There are rumors of more dead deer but no real reports or
sample submissions.

Another veterinarian out of Ozona has submitted samples from cattle,
but TVMDL [Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory] Amarillo
said they were negative (for anthrax).

[Our thanks to Ken. As this ranch's neighbours go out to check their
stock it is probable that other cases may be found as it is not a
part of Texas that routinely vaccinates its stock.
