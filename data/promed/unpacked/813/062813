Outbreak of leishmaniasis in Yemen
---------------------------------------
Do we know that _Le. tropica_ is definitely the cause of this current
leishmaniasis outbreak in Yemen? My understanding from speaking with
Dr. Peter Weina of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
(WRAIR), while he was studying the outbreak in our soldiers in
southern Iraq in 2003, was that _Le. major_ was the likely etiologic
agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in that region.

[Both _Leishmania tropica_ and _Le. major_ have been recorded from
Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen as causing cutaneous leishmaniasis. Past
surveys in Yemen have indicated that _Le. tropica_ is more common, or
at least more commonly reported, than _Le. major_; but I have no
information on the species responsible for the recent cases in Yemen.
_Leishmania tropica_ causes dry cutaneous leishmaniasis and is an
anthroponotic infection, with humans usually the only reservoir host,
although dogs can become infected. It is more common in urban
situations than the closely related parasite, _Le. major_, which is a
more rural infection and is responsible for the wet form of cutaneous
leishmaniasis. This is a zoonotic infection having various rodent
reservoir hosts, although in many situations, these have not been
fully identified.
The vector in Yemen is possibly the peridomestic sandfly _Phlebotomus
sergenti_. But we need more information on the actual parasite
causing leishmaniasis in the 4 cited areas in Yemen as well as its
vectors. - Mod.MS]
