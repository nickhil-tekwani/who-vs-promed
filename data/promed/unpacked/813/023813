The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development identified pigs at the Fowlerville Family Fair testing positive for swine flu.

The Fowlerville Fair Board isolated infected pigs to prevent additional exposure. Officials say the infected pigs began showing signs in the afternoon of Thu 25 Jul 2019, and laboratory results were confirmed late Friday [26 Jul 2019] afternoon.

The fair was scheduled from 22-27 Jul 2019. At this time, all pigs have been removed from the fairgrounds, and there are no reported human illnesses, according to Livingston County Health Department.

Fair-goers were also exposed to the virus last year [2018]: Influenza A was identified in 2 Michigan residents exposed to pigs at Fowlerville Family Fair. The Livingston County Health Department (LCHD), in coordination with the Fowlerville Fair Board and Michigan State University Extension, are reaching out to exhibitors and their families who participated at the Fowlerville Family Fair that may have been in close contact with the infected pigs. The LCHD is also instructing healthcare providers in the area to watch for patients presenting with respiratory symptoms who report exposure to swine or who visited the swine barn. In addition, any individuals who attended the fair and were exposed to the pigs who begin to have influenza like symptoms should contact LCHD.

Right now, there is no vaccine for swine flu, and the seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against swine flu. But antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza are effective in treating swine flu.

Here are several steps you can take to protect yourself and prevent the spread of any illness:
- Avoid close contact with sick people.
- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it and wash your hands.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
- Refrain from eating or drinking in livestock barns or show rings.
- Do not take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers, or similar items into pig areas.
- Anyone who is at high risk of serious flu complications and is planning to attend a fair should avoid pigs and swine barns.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs spread this way.
- If you are sick, stay home from work or school until your illness is over.
- Avoid contact with pigs if you have flu-like symptoms. Wait 7 days after your illness started or until you have been without fever for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications, whichever is longer.
- Get an annual influenza vaccination

[Novel influenza viruses can arise among humans either by direct transmission from mammalian or avian sources or through genetic reassortment. The segmented nature of the influenza viral genome allows reassortment to occur in a host that is simultaneously infected with more than 2 subtypes of influenza A viruses. Although influenza viruses exhibit some host specificity, swine are susceptible to infection with viruses of avian and mammalian lineages, facilitated by the presence of receptors for both lineages in the respiratory tract. Swine can therefore serve as "mixing vessels" for different lineages, providing an opportunity for novel re-assortants to arise. The reassortant viruses may acquire mammalian adaption characteristics, thereby allowing infection of humans to occur [Webster RG, Bean WJ, Gorman OT, et al. Evolution and ecology of influenza A viruses. Microbiol Rev. 1992; 56(1): 152-79; http://mmbr.asm.org/content/56/1/152.full.pdf].

A(H1N2) viruses have been described among avian, swine, and human populations. Like A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses, A(H1N2) viruses have become established in swine herds in many regions. During 2012, in addition to over 300 human cases of swine-origin influenza A(H3N2) variant (v) viruses, a lesser known swine-origin influenza subtype variant, A(H1N2)v, infected 4 persons attending agricultural shows during the final days of the agricultural show season (see PROMED-mail Influenza (85): United States of America (Minnesota) swine H1N2 Influenza, human cases 20120911.1290389). Although there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, there was concern that the presence of the matrix protein derived from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which had been circulating widely in the human population since 2009, could potentially confer the A(H1N2)v virus with increased transmissibility among humans.

The specific strain of virus has not yet been reported. However, last year (2018), there were similar cases to these cases, which were among the 1st influenza A (H1N2)v virus infections identified in 2018 in the United States, and also from this particular Michigan fair. Since reporting of novel influenza A viruses began nationally in 2005, only 17 human infections of influenza A (H1N2)v (including the 2 Michigan cases) have been reported to CDC. We must wait to see which strain of virus this one is.

Studies at the animal-human interface are needed to determine seroprevalence, and active surveillance is needed to uncover infection rates to better determine the risk for zoonotic transmission of swine-origin H1N2 to human health. - Mod.TG with assistance from Mod.UBA
