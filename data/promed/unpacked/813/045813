Mr Anthony Adjavor, chief technical officer of the Ho Leprosarium, on
Friday [4 Mar 2011], reported an increase in leprosy cases, in the
Volta Region, from 73 in 2009 to 120 in 2010. He said the situation
had presented a challenge to the disease control officers to institute
extensive outreaches, to educate the public on the disease.

Mr Adjavor was speaking at a ceremony in Ho, when staff of the Armed
Forces Pay Office in Accra, presented assorted items to cured lepers,
living in clusters around the Ho Polyclinic, which was in the past
essentially a leper clinic. He said it was important that individuals
reported strange patches and abrasions on their skin to health
institutions for examination. Mr Adjavor said there could be people
with the disease, who were unknowingly infecting others.

The items presented include bags of maize, rice, cooking oil,
detergents, beverages, canned fish, disinfectants, toilet rolls and
loaves of bread, estimated at GHC [Ghana Cedi] 5000 [about USD 3300]
a[nd] cash of GHC 500 [about USD 330]. Lt Col Anthony Dzisi,
commanding officer, said the overture formed part of the Pay Office's
corporate social responsibility policy of contributing to the needs of
the disadvantaged in the society. He said the unit's activities, which
had been concentrated in Accra, were now being decentralized to affect
those in the regions as well. The officers and men joined the civilian
employees of the unit on the trip, and together with cured lepers,
danced and made merry after the presentation.

Donors, including some international non-governmental organizations,
have over the years, supported the cured lepers with health care
facilities and accommodation. Shunned by society, dejected cured
lepers from across the country, after their discharge, settled on the
fringes of the leprosarium (now Polyclinic) and christened the
flagship settlement "Freetown", which had since expanded into other
clusters.

[The news release makes it apparent that, despite being cured of
leprosy, people who once had this disease cannot return to a normal
way of life, but continue to live separate from the rest of their
society, and entirely dependent on the beneficence of others
(<http://allafrica.com/stories/201003180681.html>).

The following is extracted from the WHO Leprosy fact sheet no. 101
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/>):

Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by a bacillus, _Mycobacterium
leprae_, an acid-fast, rod-shaped bacillus. _M. leprae_ multiplies
very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years,
but symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. Leprosy is not
highly infectious. It is transmitted via droplets, from the nose and
mouth, during close and frequent contacts with untreated cases.
Untreated, leprosy can cause progressive and permanent damage to the
skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes. Leprosy is curable with multidrug
therapy (MDT) and treatment provided in the early stages averts
disability. MDT (dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine), which has been
available free of charge to all patients worldwide since 1995, remains
the key in eliminating the disease as a public health concern.

In 1991, WHO resolved to eliminate leprosy as a public health problem
by the year 2000. Elimination of leprosy as a public health problem is
defined as a prevalence rate of less than one case per 10 000 persons.
Ghana reported in 2005 that it achieved the leprosy elimination target
in most parts of the country with a prevalence rate of 0.36 per 10 000
population; at the time, leprosy was considered endemic in only 6
districts, where the prevalence rate was more than one per 10 000
(<http://www.modernghana.com/news/82523/1/ghana-achieves-target-in-reducing-leprosy.html>).
Ghana reported a total of 734 cases at the end of October 2006
(<http://www.modernghana.com/news/121589/1/ghana-achieves-global-leprosy-target.html>).
In 2010 it was reported that Ghana had a prevalence rate of 0.29 per
10 000
(<http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/artikel.php?ID=178169>),
which calculates to be 703 cases for its population of 24 233 431
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana>).

Currently, even with 120 cases of leprosy and a population of 1 635
421, the Volta region, one of 10 administrative regions in Ghana, has
a prevalence rate of 0.73 per 10 000, less than the leprosy
elimination target. Whether the increase in cases reported in the
Volta Region is the result of enhanced case-finding or ongoing
transmission of leprosy is not known. Leprosy among children would be
an indication of ongoing transmission in the community.

The Volta Region is located along the southern half of the eastern
border of Ghana, which it shares with the Republic of Togo
(<http://www.modernghana.com/GhanaHome/regions/volta.asp?menu_id=6â_menu_id=133&gender=>).
The city of Ho in southeast Ghana is the capital of the Volta Region
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho,_Ghana>). Ho has one of the only 3
ultra modern hospitals in the country
(<http://www.modernghana.com/GhanaHome/regions/volta.asp?menu_id=6â_menu_id=133&gender=>).
