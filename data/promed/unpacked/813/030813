After having been struck in October 2000 by an outbreak originating from
Sardinia, Corsican farmers are facing another outbreak of bluetongue
disease, [which affects one out of every 4 Corsican flocks.
The disease has spread quickly to every part of the island, and it has been
difficult to count the initial cost of the crisis. Health risks are present
from the burning of sheep carcasses, not helped at all by the summer heat.
Farmers are angry at the "confusion" generated by the State services
designed to help them and accuse [authorities of not doing everything in
their power to prevent the outbreak.

[The health risk must be from burning carcasses, because Bluetongue is not
a zoonotic disease. However, there may well be risk to people prone to
allergies and asthma. Undoubtedly the smell is unpleasant. ­ Mod.TG
