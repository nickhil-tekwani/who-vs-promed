A senior health ministry official in the Democratic Republic of Congo [Congo DR] on Monday [3 Jun 2013] ruled out an Ebola virus disease outbreak in the northeast of the country, after possible cases were reported by United Nations staff.

"There were 6 cases, including 4 children under 5 and 2 adults, who suffered from fever and haemorrhagic symptoms. We have carried out analyses at the INRB (National Institute of Biomedical Research) and the results are negative... It's not Ebola virus disease," Benoit Kabela Ilunga, who runs the contagious diseases department at the Ministry, told Agence France-Presse. Kabela added that further tests were in hand to determine what disease had killed 3 of the children among the 6 cases reported last Wednesday [29 May 2013] by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). "Other diseases can be associated with bleeding, like typhoid fever, meningitis, yellow fever, (and) severe malaria," the doctor said.

OCHA had announced suspect cases recorded between 1 May and 12 May [2013] at Mongo in the Bas-Uele district of the northeastern Orientale province, about 240 km (150 mi) from Isiro, where the last Ebola virus outbreak killed 34 people out of 62 confirmed cases between May and November 2012.

To date, no treatment or vaccine is available for Ebola virus disease, which kills between 25 and 90 percent of those who fall sick, depending on the strain of the virus, according to the World Health Organisation. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with blood, faeces, or sweat, and by sexual contact or unprotected handling of contaminated corpses.

Ebola virus disease, one of the world's most virulent diseases, was first discovered in the DRC in 1976 and the country has had 8 subsequent outbreaks.

[Orientale is one of the 10 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Orientale Province lies in the north east of the country. It borders Equateur to the west, Kasai-Oriental province to the south west, Maniema to the south, and Nord-Kivu to the south east. The province is divided into the Bas-Uele, Haut-Uele, and Tshopo districts and the Ituri Interim Administration. The current suspected outbreak, now unconfirmed, is located some 240 km [150 mi] distant from the previously confined outbreak in Orientale province in late 2012.

Further information is awaited on the outcome of the current investigation.
