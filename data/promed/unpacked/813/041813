Red tide outbreak expanding; state closes larger area to shellfishermen
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The massive red tide festering off the coast of New England has
spread to federal waters, closing thousands of square miles to
shellfishing by Massachusetts boats, as levels of the algal bloom's
toxin hit all-time highs in the region's clams and mussels.
"Cumulatively, it is the worst outbreak ever," said J. Michael
Hickey, the chief shellfish biologist for the state Division of
Marine Fisheries. The agency ordered the federal waters closed to
state shellfishermen late Friday [10 Jun 2005] and asked federal
officials to extend the ban to out-of-state boats. The last red tide
outbreak of a similar scope occurred in 1972.
Shellfish bed closures have already idled close to 2000 clammers,
oyster farmers, and mussel harvesters in state waters that stretch 3
miles from shore. The new ban extends that closure to more than 100
miles from shore. Officials expect fewer fishermen will be affected
by the federal ban, although the new closure may hurt a robust
fishery for ocean quahogs and surf clams. Niche fisheries in federal
waters could also be affected.
The news arrives as New England officials scramble to cope with the
devastating algal bloom that stretches from central Maine to
Nantucket Sound. The Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce launched a public
outreach campaign this weekend to educate tourists about the bloom.
One of the world's authorities on red tide, Don Anderson of Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution, flew home early from a scientific
conference in Barcelona yesterday to prepare for a red tide briefing
on Tuesday [14 Jun 2005] with the New England congressional
delegation in Washington, D.C.
The New England shellfishing industry is losing an estimated USD 3
million per week because of the red tide, and state officials say
that if the outbreak lasts for the predicted 8 to 10 weeks, the total
impact could be close to USD 28 million.
The only good news in recent days, officials say, is that the
outbreak has not progressed further south in coastal waters toward
Rhode Island.
Massachusetts officials have authority to close federal waters only
to fishermen with Massachusetts fishing licenses, Hickey said. He has
put in a request with the US Food and Drug Administration to ask the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to shut the area down
to all fishermen. A spokeswoman for NOAA fisheries yesterday [11 Jun
2005] said she was unable to confirm the request.
Yesterday [11 Jun 2005], shellfishermen in Massachusetts and Maine
were awaiting word on whether they would be eligible to get
low-interest loans and other disaster aid that governors Mitt Romney
and John Baldacci applied for last week after declaring states of
emergency because of the bloom.
The red tide, which has yet to take on its signature red-brown color,
is made up of vast numbers of single-celled organisms that began an
exponential growth explosion offshore last month [May 2005]. While
swimming is safe, the algae's toxins, which concentrate over time in
shellfish meat, can cause illness or even death if consumed in enough
quantity. It does not affect lobsters, crabs, shrimp, or finned fish.
The part of the scallop people eat in New England -- the adductor
muscle -- does not retain the toxin and is safe to eat.
No one has become ill from the red tide, state officials said
yesterday [11 Jun 2005]. However, Anderson said there have been
reports of several dead terns at Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge and
ducks in Audubon's Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, although
analysis is needed to see whether they died from eating contaminated
shellfish.
All shellfish being served in restaurants and stores is safe to eat
after having undergone rigorous testing, officials stressed yesterday
[11 Jun 2005]. Many restaurants are buying clams from out of state,
and customers can expect higher prices as a result. Still, despite
the repeated reports about the red tide outbreak, tourists seemed to
be getting only some of the message.
"We are getting calls, not so much about eating but about swimming .
. . which is safe," said Wendy Northcross, CEO of the Cape Cod
Chamber of Commerce. "It would be such a shame to change plans
because of bad information."
Red tide is naturally found in New England waters; it appears so
regularly off the coast that the Georges Bank area is permanently
closed to shellfishing. However, this year's [2005] stubborn storms,
winter snow runoff, and recent hot sun has created perfect conditions
for the algae to bloom furiously and be blown close to shore.
Hickey -- and researchers from the Woods Hole Center for Oceans and
Human Health -- said cell counts in the water remain high, but it was
the counts in the shellfish meat that were the most worrisome.
Normally, shellfish beds are closed if there are more than 80
micrograms of toxin per 100 grams of shellfish meat. On the North
Shore, isolated counts were over 2000 micrograms per 1000 grams of
meat, while in Chatham they were around 1800.
The high counts and the bloom's persistence troubles longtime red
tide researchers like Anderson, because there is some research that
shows the more severe and long a red tide outbreak is, the longer it
can take for some shellfish to purge the toxins from their bodies.
Another worry is that the algae -- which rest on the sea floor much
of the time as dormant cysts -- may begin reproducing in
Massachusetts Bay in greater numbers, triggering outbreaks year after
year.
"As much as we are all exhausted, it is very, very important to map
this out and learn about its footprint," said Anderson.
New England elected officials, meanwhile, said yesterday [11 Jun
2005] that aid would be coming for the beleaguered shellfish
industry. US Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine said, "I am confident
we can find a way to bring relief to the workers and businesses that
have been devastated by this outbreak."
US Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts said the outbreak response was
a clear example of how federal government can help an entire industry. "For
those people who say we don't need the government, that it is a nuisance, we
need disaster relief, we need the government to sort this out," he said.
