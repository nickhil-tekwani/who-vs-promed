The Health Department of Valinhos is warning people to take care to
prevent spotted fever, a disease that has killed 5 people in the city
in 2011. The dry climate facilitates the proliferation of the tick
that transmits the disease.

Of the 7 confirmed cases in 2011 in Valinhos among the 27 reported, 5
ended fatally. In 2010, of the 38 cases of spotted fever reported, 2
were confirmed and resulted in one death.

Health officials of the Department of Public Health, city of Valinhos,
are advising the public about the risks of spotted fever disease
transmitted by ticks infected with the bacteria _Rickettsia
rickettsii_. Health teams have visited the neighborhoods of Bom
Retiro, Frutal, Parque das Colinas and Capuava, where there are rivers
and lakes, natural habitat of capybaras, host of the tick. The city is
also placing warning signs along the Ribeirao Pinheiro and Bom Jardim
creek, a region where capybaras usually appear.

[Brazilian spotted fever is known in Portuguese as "febre maculosa
brasileira". The disease is quite similar to Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, with only subtle differences. The etiological agent,
_Rickettsia rickettsii_, is considered almost identical to its North
American counterpart.

The disease was first described in 1929 but underwent a
still-unexplained disappearance in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1985, it
has been found with increasing frequency in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais
states, but cases have also been seen in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito
Santo states. Cases have also been identified in the state of Santa
Catarina in the south. The main vector tick is _Amblyomma cajennense_,
but _A. cooperi_ has been also implicated. - Mod.LL

rodents, and are aquatic -- see photo:
