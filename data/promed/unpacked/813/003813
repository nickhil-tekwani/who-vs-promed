A case of cutaneous form of anthrax in a shepherd was found in Shumen district. This is the 1st and only [human] case of the year [2021] in the country [Bulgaria]. According to a report on the epidemic situation of the Ministry of Health from mid-September [2021], the man fell ill after treatment of the skin of a dead animal. After examination by an infectious disease specialist, he was left for home treatment. The diagnosis was laboratory confirmed. The case was notified to the Regional Directorate for Food Safety (RHI) in Shumen for taking measures of competence.

RHI-Shumen continues the epidemiological study (of the event) with the application of anti-epidemic measures.

This is the 1st case of anthrax in the country this year [2021], according to the National Center for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases. At the same time last year [2020] in our country, there was not a single patient with this disease.

Anthrax mainly affects herbivores. In humans, the skin form is the most common (affected organ). It is spread through contact with infected animals, contaminated soil, meat, and objects that have come into contact with the carcass. The incubation period is 1-20 days. The skin form begins with the appearance of a dense red spot, which increases for 1-2 days. Along with the local changes, there are also signs of intoxication of the body (such as) malaise, loss of appetite, headache, fever. If left untreated, the disease can have fatal consequences.

[Anthrax in Bulgaria is truly sporadic with many years without reported cases. In such a sporadic situation, it is challenging to maintain a proper level of surveillance and persuade farmers to report unexpected deaths, which can then be checked out, and to get farmers to vaccinate their stock when they are some 5-10 km [3.1-6.2 mi] from any recent case. Optimistically, this outbreak will show that the threat is still there. And if I were investigating this recent case, I would try to find out if there had been any previous livestock outbreaks around this rural community, including unexplained sudden deaths.

There were previous livestock anthrax outbreaks in Shumen in 2014, 2013, and 2012; see ProMED reports below.

While there are systemic symptoms from cutaneous anthrax, a key thing to note is that the lesion itself is painless, but it itches. Don't scratch it! If you do, you can spread the infection to other places. Such infections are common whenever anyone skins a contaminated carcass. When the hide is contaminated, the pathogen can be transferred to other sites after handling and processing such hides and the bloody wool.
