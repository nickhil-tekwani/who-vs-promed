Deadly apple disease resurfaces in Himachal Pradesh
---------------------------------------------------
The danger of severe crop damage looms large over apple orchards
across Himachal Pradesh state, as scab, the most deadly disease of
apples, has again resurfaced after 13 years. Apple scab [AS], caused
by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_, attacks apple trees during
spring and early summer. AS manifests as brown or black lesions on
leaves and fruits, resulting in reduced fruit yield and quality,
without killing the fruit. However, in severe infections it
defoliates and weakens the trees, making it prone to other pest
attacks.
The sudden outbreak after so many years is attributed to heavy and
incessant rains in the region, as wet and cool weather helps the
spread of the disease. One of the major concerns is the
unavailability of fungicides and other chemicals required to curb the
menace.
According to Tara Chand Thakur, an apple grower, people are unhappy,
growers are dependent on the apple crop, and neither big nor small
farmers have access to pesticides to control AS. Even uninfected
apples do not fetch good prices. "If the growers won't get the
pesticides, the situation would worsen," said Tara Chand Thakur.
The fungicides, if available, are very costly, as all the subsidies
have been removed by the state government, thus making them
accessible only to affluent farmers.
Apple growers say that the state horticulture department has not done
anything to check the outbreak of AS, which, in 1982, caused an
epidemic resulting in a loss of millions of rupees. Horticulture
department officials, on the other hand, say that they have done
everything to inform farmers about the AS outbreak and its control.
"We ourselves have surveyed the orchards and asked them to use
curable fungicides to eradicate the disease," said Kishor Khosla,
senior scientist of the Himachal Pradesh Horticulture Department.
There are about 300 000 apple growers in the state depending entirely
on the crop. With an apple economy of almost 1000 crore rupees (USD
2.3 million), Himachal Pradesh is one of the major producers of the
crop in the country.

[India produces all deciduous fruits, including pome fruits (apple
and pear) and stone fruits (peach, plum, apricot and cherry), in
considerable quantity. These are mainly grown in the northwestern
Indian States of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and in the Uttar
Pradesh hills. The North-Eastern Hills region, comprising the States
of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur and Sikkim, also
grows some of the deciduous fruits on a limited scale. Due to
introduction and adaptation of low-chilling cultivars of crops like
peach, plum and pear, they are also now being grown commercially in
certain areas of the north Indian plains. Out of all the deciduous
fruits, apple is the most important in terms of production and extent.
Apple scab caused by _Venturia inaequalis_ is a serious disease
causing maximum economic loss. A sound forecasting and early warning
system has been developed for prediction of AS. Also, a judicious
fungicide spray schedule has been devised. Under high disease
pressure, systemic fungicides performed better, while under low
disease pressure, ergosterol biosynthesis inhibiting (EBI) fungicides
were as good as protectants. Ascosporic inoculum produced by
over-wintered apple leaves could be substantially reduced by giving
post-harvest applications of Bavistin (0.1 percent) and EBI chemicals
Penconazole (0.5 percent) and Flusilazole (0.01 percent), as
pre-harvest fungicidal sprays control scab during storage. AS
survives on infected plant parts, including fruits. Disease
management depends upon spraying with proper fungicides, at the
proper time of application, at the optimum dose.
