[This is the first outbreak of ASF reported in the Americas (Central and South America) in 40 years. No cases have ever been found in the United States.

The 2nd meeting of the Standing Group of Experts (SGE) on ASF of the GF-TADs of the Americas was held (virtually) on 15 June 2020. The general objective of the meeting was to develop recommendations that would make it possible to evaluate the risk factors present in the Americas' region for the introduction of the ASF virus. According to the report of this meeting, "Dr. Abelardo De Gracias, from OIRSA, presented the qualitative and semiquantitative Risk Analysis developed for its 9 member countries [Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Dominican Republic.], focused on identifying the risk represented by the health situation in the countries which have commercial exchange with the region. The risk assessment carried out suggests that the American Continent may occur due to the legal or illegal introduction of goods of porcine origin, as well as undetected tourist import from Asia countries (moderate risk) or from affected European countries (high risk)". The full report is available at https://rr-americas.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/esp_eng-report-2nd-sge-asf-15-jun-2020.pdf

The presentation of "Results of the Risk Analysis of introduction of the ASFv virus to the OIRSA region" is available in Spanish and English at https://rr-americas.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/esp-oirsa_ri-ppa-2.pdf

The following information is a USDA Statement on Confirmation of African Swine Fever in the Dominican Republic. The statement, published on 28 Jul 2021 and available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/news/sa_by_date/sa-2021/asf-confirm, mentioned that:

"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory has confirmed African swine fever (ASF) in samples collected from pigs in the Dominican Republic through an existing cooperative surveillance program.

"USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has numerous interlocking safeguards in place to prevent ASF from entering the United States. Pork and pork products from the Dominican Republic are currently prohibited entry as a result of existing classical swine fever restrictions. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is increasing inspections of flights from the Dominican Republic to ensure travelers do not bring prohibited products to the United States. CBP will also be ensuring that garbage from these airplanes is properly disposed of to prevent the transmission of ASF.

"USDA is committed to assisting the Dominican Republic in dealing with ASF, is offering continued testing support, and will consult with them on additional steps or actions to support response and mitigation measures. We will also offer similar help to Haiti, which borders the Dominican Republic and is at high risk for ASF detections.

"The USDA continues to work diligently with partners including CBP and the U.S. swine industry to prevent ASF from entering the United States. ASF is not a threat to human health, cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans and it is not a food safety issue".
