Increase in Coccidioimycosis (Valley Fever), Central Valley, California
------------------------------
Doctors with Children's Hospital Central California say they have seen a significant increase in cases of Valley Fever.

Doctors say they normally treat one or 2 cases of the disease at any one time.
Children's Hospital, along with other areas of the Central Valley, has seen a significant increase in Valley Fever. In March [2012] the number of Valley Fever inpatients at Children's peaked at 16.

Normally Children's [Hospital] has only about one or 2 inpatient cases at any one time. Currently there are 11 in patients being treated with Valley Fever, 8 admitted in the month of May [2012].

Valley fever can be difficult to detect, but early treatment is critical to preventing dangerous progression of the illness. The disease is primarily caused by a fungus called _Coccidioides immitis_, spreading through spores in the air when contaminated soil is disturbed such as by construction, dust storms and earthquakes.

Late summer and early fall are peak periods for Valley Fever infection but this year's late rains meant longer periods of dry conditions. People become infected by inhaling airborne spores of the dirt-dwelling fungus and dry conditions allow the fungus to become airborne.

The disease may not manifest until months after a person is infected. There's no vaccine to prevent Valley Fever but efforts are ongoing to develop one. "The best thing people can do is avoid inhaling excessive amounts of dust - especially in the South Valley," advised Dr. James McCarty, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's Hospital Central California.

Dr. McCarty recommends families and doctors suspect Valley Fever particularly if: "The child has pneumonia. The child has symptoms that can't be explained or persist without improvement".

When Valley Fever is suspected, a doctor can order an antibody blood test or culture. Treatment usually includes oral or injected antifungal medicine and treatment time can range from 3 to 6 months or years for more serious cases.

"There is no reason for the public to panic, but awareness is key to getting quick treatment for this disease," said Dr. McCarty.

Since last summer Children's Hospital has admitted about 20 children for Valley Fever. While most of these cases come from the South Valley, including 6 from Avenal alone, Children's also has affected patients from Fresno, Clovis and Los Banos.

Valley Fever is an illness that usually affects the lungs. Sometimes other parts of the body are impacted, such as the brain, bone, skin and other organs. This is called disseminated Valley Fever. Without proper treatment, the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, meningitis and even death.

People at risk for severe Valley Fever include:
*Those with weakened immune systems
*Women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy

About 60 percent of those infected never show symptoms. The others develop the following ailments that can last a month:
*Cough
*Fever
*Chest pain
*Headache
*Muscle aches
*Fatigue
*Rash

[Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by the fungi _Coccidioides immitis_ and _C. posadasii_. The infection is airborne through inhaled spores, which cause a usually mild acute pneumonia (Valley Fever). Disseminated disease may be seen in immunosuppressed patients. The infection is common in the southwestern part of the United States and is also found in parts of Mexico, Central and South America.

A substantial increase in the incidence of coccidioidomycosis has been observed in both California and Arizona in recent years. In Arizona, reported cases of coccidioidomycosis increased from 21 cases per 100 000 in 1997 to 155 cases per 100 000 in 2009 (Hector RF et al. The public health impact of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona and California. Int J Environ Res Public Health 2011;8:1150). In California, the incidence of coccidioidomycosis increased from 2.4 cases per 100 000 in 2000 to 8 per 100 000 in 2006 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
