[1] Mali: new death reported

Mali reported the death of a girl suspected of having Ebola, as the nation races to contain the virus that has ravaged 3 of its West African neighbors. Results from tests to confirm whether the girl had the virus will be known today, Alassane Souleymane, a spokesman for Mali's communication ministry, said by email today [14 Nov 2014].

5 people have been confirmed as having Ebola and a 6th case is suspected, Hubert Balique, a French public health expert consulting with the French embassy in Mali, told reporters yesterday [13 Nov 2014]. It's unclear whether the girl whose death was reported today was one of those cases. Officials have identified more than 200 people who had contact with those individuals, and new cases will probably be confirmed in coming days, he said.... -- more

Liberia won't extend Ebola state of emergency, says president
-------------------------------------------------------------
Liberia's president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said on Thursday [13 Nov 2014] she would not seek an extension to a state of emergency imposed in August [2014] over Ebola, which has hit the country harder than any other this year. Her announcement is a sign of progress in the fight against the disease, which has killed more than 2800 people in Liberia since breaking out in West Africa in March [2014]. The decision effectively ends the state of emergency that officially expired earlier this month [actually at midnight 31 Oct 2014], though Sirleaf said a night curfew remains in force. The emergency had allowed authorities to restrict movement in areas hard hit by the virus. Ebola has hit Liberia harder than Guinea or Sierra Leone, the 2 other countries at the center of the worst outbreak of the disease on record.... -- more

[3] WHO Ebola response roadmap situation report update
Date: Fri 14 Nov 2014

A total of 14 413 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in six affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the United States of America) and two previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal) up to the end of 11 November 2014. There have been 5177 reported deaths.

Following the WHO Ebola Response Roadmap structure, country reports fall into two categories: 1) those with widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); and 2) those with or that have had an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the United States of America).

In Mali, there have been 4 reported cases, including 3 reported deaths. The Situation Report of 12 November reported 4 cases (2 confirmed and 2 probable) and 4 deaths in Mali. One probable case and death has been reclassified and is now excluded from the Mali case count.

1) countries with widespread and intense transmission
A total of 14 383 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 5165 deaths have been reported up to the end of the 11 November by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and 10 November by the Ministry of Health of Liberia (table 1 in URL above).

A total of 570 health care workers (HCWs) are known to have been infected with EVD: 93 in Guinea; 332 in Liberia; 2 in Mali; 11 in Nigeria; 128 in Sierra Leone; 1 in Spain; and 3 in the United States of America (2 were infected in the USA and 1 in Guinea). A total of 324 HCWs have died.

WHO is undertaking extensive investigations to determine how each HCW became infected. Early indications are that a substantial proportion of infections have occurred outside the context of Ebola treatment and care. Infection prevention and control quality assurance checks are underway at Ebola treatment centres in the three intense-transmission countries. At the same time, exhaustive efforts are ongoing to ensure an ample supply of optimal personal protective equipment (PPE) to all Ebola treatment facilities, along with the provision of training and relevant guidelines to ensure that all HCWs are exposed to the minimum possible level of risk.

2) countries with or that have had an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission
Five countries (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the United States of America) have reported a case or cases imported from a country with widespread and intense transmission (table 2 in URL above).

In Mali, there have been 4 reported cases, including 3 reported deaths, as of 13 November. The most recently reported cases in Bamako are not related to the first case in Kayes, who died on 24 October. A total of 251 contacts are being followed-up in Bamako, and 5 in Kourémalé. Twelve contacts related to the first case are still under follow-up in Kayes.

There have been 4 cases and 1 death in the United States of America. All patients have been discharged from hospital, and all contacts in the country have completed the 21-day follow-up period.

In Spain, 24 days have passed since the HCW infected while caring for an Ebola patient in Madrid tested negative twice and was discharged from hospital. Spain will therefore be declared free of EVD 42 days after the date of the second negative test if no new cases are reported. All 83 contacts of the HCW have completed 21-day follow-up.

In Nigeria, there were 20 cases and 8 deaths. In Senegal, there was 1 case and no deaths. However, following a successful response in both countries, the outbreaks of EVD in Senegal and Nigeria were declared over on 17 October and 19 October 2014, respectively.

[But all emergency regulations have not been entirely lifted; for example, there is still a curfew, but now extended to midnight.
