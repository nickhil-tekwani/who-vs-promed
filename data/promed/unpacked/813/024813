Multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Mbandaka infections linked to Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Mbandaka infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of 14 Jun 2018, 73 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Mbandaka have been reported from 31 states.

Illnesses started on dates from 3 Mar 2018 to 28 May 2018. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 87, with a median age of 58. 65 percent are female. Out of 55 people with information available, 24 (44 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 22 May 2018, might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Investigation of the outbreak
-------------------------------
Epidemiologic evidence indicates that Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal is a likely source of this multistate outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. 30 (77 percent) of 39 people interviewed reported eating cold cereal. In interviews, 14 people specifically reported eating Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal. Ill people in this outbreak reported this cereal more often than any other cereals or food items.

On 14 Jun 2018, the Kellogg Company recalled 15.3 oz. and 23 oz. packages of Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal. Recalled Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal have a "best if used by" date from 14 Jun 2018 through 14 Jun 2019. The "best if used by" date is on the box top. The recalled 15.3 oz. Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal has a UPC code of 38000 39103. The recalled 23.0 oz. Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal has a UPC code of 38000 14810. The UPC code is on the bottom of the box.

CDC will provide updates when more information is available.
