[According to the last 6-monthly report (January-June 2013) sent to the OIE by Mauritania, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) has been reported as a present disease limited to one or more zones http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation (Note: To see the information from Mauritania, you need to choose the region and scroll down to the country name and time period.).

Quantitative information provided by OIE's WAHID database shows that from January to June 2013, Mauritania reported 5 outbreaks of CBPP in 2 departments. Three outbreaks were reported in Maghama department and 2 in M Bout department. Detailed information on these outbreaks is available in the WAHID's section "Detailed country(ies) disease incidence," at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: To see the information from Mauritania on CBPP, you need to choose the region, scroll down to the country, scroll to the disease, and choose the time period).

Mauritania is divided into 12 wilayat (regions) and one district. These are further subdivided into 53 moughataas (departments) http://www.statoids.com/ymr.html.

Kaedi, a city in southern Mauritania, lies along the right bank of the Senegal River where it is joined by the Gorgol River. The banks of these streams and other tributaries are seasonally inundated and cultivated and support the densest settled population in the nation. The remainder of the area, which receives more rainfall than regions farther north, is grazed by zebu cattle, sheep, and goats, the hides and skins of which are exported http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/309505/Kaedi.
