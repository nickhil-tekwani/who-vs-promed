Fish disease breaks out in Moulvibazar
--------------------------------------
Fish disease has broken out in 6 upazilas [blocks or neighborhoods] of the
Moulvibazar district in an epidemic form killing a large number of fish.
Fish with the disease develop ulcers on their bodies and die within a week
after being attacked. The species of fish being attacked with the disease
include Koi, Taki, Shoal, Puti, and Tengra.
A source in the district Fisheries Department said the fish disease has
been caused by a kind of virus which is found in water bodies such as
ponds, canals, and ditches. Fishermen and the fish cultivators are
incurring heavy loss due to the outbreak of the disease because people have
stopped [buying] these fish. Some fish cultivators said that the Fisheries
Department has not yet instituted any preventive measure to check the disease.

[Although the clinical signs given here are not entirely consistent with
Pfisteria and Pfisteria is not a virus, at this point, I wonder if the
authorities have considered it or ruled it out. ­ Mod.TG]
