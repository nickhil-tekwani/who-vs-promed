Avian influenza H5N1 confirmed in Dorset
-----------------------------------------------------
Defra has today [10 Jan 2008] confirmed Avian influenza in 3 dead
wild mute swans in the Chesil Beach area in Dorset, following
positive test results from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for the
highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. These birds were found and tested
following our routine surveillance programme.
A Wild Bird Control Area and a Monitoring Area are being established
around the premises, encompassing Chesil Beach and Portland Bill, and
the shape of these is based on expert ornithological advice.
Inside these areas bird keepers are required to house their birds or
otherwise isolate them from contact with wild birds, bird movements
will be restricted, and bird gatherings are banned. Defra is also
working closely with ornithological and other experts to consider
what wider measures may be needed. Further details can be found on
the Defra website at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/avianflu>.
No disease has been found in domestic birds, and a programme of
surveillance is being carried out in the local wild bird population.
There will be no culling of wild birds because such action may
disperse birds further and would not aid control.
Acting Chief Veterinary Officer, Fred Landeg said: "While this is
obviously unwelcome news, we have always said that Britain is at a
constant low level of risk of introduction of Avian influenza. Our
message to all bird keepers, particularly those in the area, is that
they must be vigilant, report any signs of disease immediately, and
practice the highest levels of biosecurity."
A full epidemiological investigation is underway. All poultry keepers
on the GB Poultry Register are being notified, and the EU Commission
has been informed

Bird flu discovered in mute swan
--------------------------------
A total of 3 mute swans in Dorset have been found dead with the
virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu. Efforts have begun to test other
birds at Abbotsbury Swannery, a sanctuary located nine miles from
Weymouth.
Acting Chief Veterinary Officer Fred Landeg said: "Our message to all
bird keepers, particularly those in the area, is that they must be
vigilant."
BBC environment correspondent Sarah Mukherjee said officials would
now try to establish how the virus spread. The swans' carcasses were
found following routine surveillance, a statement from Defra said.
Defra spokeswoman Linda Scott said: "Government vets have been
testing them for avian flu for the last 2 days." The statement added
that a Wild Bird Control Area and Monitoring Area has been set up
around the Swannery, covering Chesil Beach and Portland Bill. Culling
of wild birds has been ruled out because experts fear this may
disperse birds further.
John Houston from Abbotsbury Swannery, which holds 600 swans, said:
"It's all a big shock. No-one expected it to come round here."
Shadow Environment Secretary, Peter Ainsworth said: "Clearly this is
very disturbing news especially because of the connection with the
wild bird population."

[The source of this outbreak is to be sought in wild birds;
ornithological assessment is anticipated. It will be also of great
interest to obtain information on the strain involved, particularly
its sequencing results highlighting its genetic profile and its
relationship with other recent isolates in the UK, in other European
countries, and elsewhere. - Mod.AS]
