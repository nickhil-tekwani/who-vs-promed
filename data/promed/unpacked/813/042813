It may look an irony that a `mysterious' fever, assuming the proportion of
an epidemic, has claimed over 100 lives, besides infecting many others, in
a `health-conscious' and highly literate State like Kerala during the past
one week. The Additional Director of Health Services, P.K. Sivaraman,
himself has confided that 616 persons have contracted leptospirosis (rat
fever) in the State until 22 Jun 2003. Though the official figures of death
toll in the past one week are 53, unofficial records show that not less
than 115 persons have succumbed to the illness. The crucial question is
whether the existing system is enough to take up the task, especially when
towns and villages have been turned into waste-dumping yards, posing
serious health hazards. Many hospitals do not have any proper biomedical
waste disposal facility as prescribed by the Bio-Medical Waste Management
and Handling Rules, 1998 despite reports of liquid waste from hospitals
reaching water bodies.

[ProMED reported an outbreak of leptospirosis in Karala in 2002. It is
questionable whether the infection can be traced particularly to hospital
waste as suggested in the report. Leptospira is a natural infection of
rodents, and plain unsanitary conditions concerning waste and water
management is sufficient to explain an outbreak. *Mod. EP]
