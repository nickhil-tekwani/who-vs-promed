Healthy deer can spread prion disease through faeces
----------------------------------------------------
Brain-destroying prion disease can spread among deer through faeces
shed by animals, which have been infected by the deadly pathogen but
are not sick, a study published on Wednesday [9 Sep 2009] suggests.

The paper implies that the mysterious disorders known as chronic
wasting disease (CWD) and scrapie -- cousins of mad-cow disease --
could be transmitted in a hitherto-overlooked way, posing a headache
for farmers.

The scientists are led by University of California neurologist Stanley
Prusiner, who won the 1997 Nobel Medicine Prize for research into
prions, the rogue proteins blamed for turning brains spongey.

Prion diseases are well-researched disorders in deer (CWD), cattle
(bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE), sheep and goats (scrapie),
cats (feline spongiform encephalopathy, FSE) and in humans
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD).

Many aspects about them are unclear, though. In deer, CWD is known to
be handed on from mother to offspring, but other paths of infection
are deemed possible.

Publishing in the British journal Nature, Prusiner's team probe a
theory that deer may pass on the prion in their faeces, thus creating
a risk that other deer will pick up the pathogen in the soil when they
graze.

Over the course of months, the investigators collected the faeces of 5
mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) and then orally infected them with
CWD prions.

They continued taking samples until the animals died or developed
signs of the disease and were euthanised.

Faecal samples -- irradiated to kill germs and viruses but leave the
prions untouched -- were injected into the brains of genetically
modified mice. Samples that had been collected before the deer were
infected and 3 to 4 months after infection had no effect. But 14 out
of 15 samples that were collected after the 4-month mark caused the
mice to fall sick with CWD-like signs.

The results, say the authors, point to a "horizontal" way by which CWD
could spread among deer in the wild -- and, possibly, by which scrapie
could spread among sheep and goats.

The "faecal-oral route" was given credence by a 1994 Icelandic study
in which sheep with scrapie were held in a field, removed, and then
replaced with scrapie-free sheep, which then went on to develop the
disease.

But an unresolved question is whether prions can survive long enough
in the soil to infect other animals. Past studies have sent back
conflicting data on this; some say harsh weather and microbial enzymes
in the soil degrade the pathogen.

The new paper did not touch on BSE. That disease, which erupted in
Britain in the 1980s, unleashed a scare in 1996 when BSE-infected beef
was linked to a rare form of fatal neurodegenerative disorder in
humans, variant CJD.

The causes of BSE have been fiercely debated. One idea is that herds
became infected by eating the ground-up carcasses of scrapie-infected
sheep. [Another proposed theory has been feeding unhealthy ground up
cattle back to cattle. - Mod.TG]

BSE has been fought through a culling of animals and a change of
feeding practices. Several studies into cattle suggest there is no
"faecal-oral route" for BSE.

Although science is good at using genetically modified mice as models
for ruminants, it is critical to remember it is a model and there may
be difference between the model and reality of the target species.
Mice are monogastrics and no matter what the genetic manipulation,
that mouse will never have the same action as that of a ruminant. So
while the genetically modified mouse is a tool to assist an
understanding, it is only a tool. It is not the actual target.

It has however been well established that in the presence of renal
disease, the prion could pass in the urine. Why not examine if the
prion may pass in the urine at lower levels than previously identified?

There are ongoing and as yet unpublished studies regarding passage of
the prion through gut piles of killed animals.

So while this study is interesting, it is a long way from being
inclusive. - Mod.TG]
