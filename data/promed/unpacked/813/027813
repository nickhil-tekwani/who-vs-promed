"Virus" [see comment below] -affected paddy is common in different areas of Noakhali [district in Chattogram division]. Farmers of coastal island areas are worried as disease has been destroying the fields. They said the agriculture officials could not extend any help and solution to their problems.

Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) sources said this [2018] season [rice] was planted on 153 670 hectares -- both local variety and high yielding variety (HYV). The farmers in many areas have already started harvesting. Diseases have spread to ripe paddies, the sheafs are being damaged by black moss created by a "viral" disease. The rice is turning into yellow powder.

Farmers saw their produce being destroyed [and] demanded government assistance. The DAE did not say anything about the cause and spread of the disease.

[Symptoms of 'black moss' and rice grains 'turning into yellow powder', as described above, do not correspond to any viral symptoms known for rice. Such symptoms would rather seem to point towards a fungal pathogen. It appears likely that the term "viral" is used above as a general indication of a disease or disorder, not to indicate a particular pathogen.

A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes, have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. Reliable, preferably molecular, diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved will be needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the reported problems.
