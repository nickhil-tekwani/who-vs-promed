The Benue State Government Ministry of Health has quarantined an entire family in Adoka, Otukpo local government area [LGA], Benue state, over the outbreak of Lassa fever and the death of a family member.

The State Commissioner for Health, Mrs Cecilia Ojabo, who confirmed that 2 pregnant women and a man died in Makurdi of Lassa fever, said the ministry is putting the family under close monitoring so as to ensure that the fever does not spread to others.

She said one of the pregnant women was confirmed positive when her blood sample was sent to a specialist hospital in Irua in Edo state. She said the other patient commenced treatment for Lassa fever at the designated centre located at the Benue State University Teaching Hospital, Makurdi but died in the process.

"There was another instance of a young man, an indigene of Benue state who had Lassa fever and died in Lagos state. We were duly informed about his death and the corpse was thereafter transmitted back to Benue state for burial," she said.

Ojabo also disclosed that a patient from the Guma LGA of the state manifested late symptoms of Lassa fever when he started bleeding from the nose, ears, and mouth. According to her, the victim was admitted to the Benue State University Teaching Hospital but before doctors could obtain his blood sample for the test at Irua, he died.

She confirmed that a 2nd pregnant woman died "this afternoon [18 Feb 2018] after showing symptoms of the disease. Last week l got a report from the Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi that another suspected case of Lassa fever was recorded and they were advised to take the patient to the infection unit in the teaching hospital but on their way to the hospital, the patient died with her pregnancy."

She said some persons close to the victims had also been placed under close monitoring.

The Delta State Commissioner for Health, Dr Mordi Ononye, has disclosed that 3 persons have died from Lassa fever since the latest outbreak of the disease was first reported in the state on [26 Jan 2018].

Ononye however said 2 out of the 3 fatal cases of the disease were brought to the hospital in Asaba from the neighboring Anambra state.

The health commissioner further revealed that Delta state has recorded 7 confirmed cases while 24 persons have been placed under medical surveillance.

Some of the cases were referred from Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba to Institute of Lassa Fever in Irrua, Edo State, he said, adding that the 1st patient had been treated and discharged.

While noting that active case search and contact tracing was ongoing, the commissioner advised members of the public not to panic but to report any suspected cases to the appropriate health authorities.

"As an immediate response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Health, through its rapid response team, has been coordinating the state response to contain the spread of the disease, just as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Abuja, has been contacted and presently collaborating with the state in this regard," he said.

Ononye stated that the ministry, in collaboration with the state Primary Health Development Agency, was "creating awareness through the various mass media so that the public can refresh their memories on how the disease is transmitted and therefore take preventive measures to forestall its spread."

He revealed that "some personal protective equipment (PPEs) were earlier procured and distributed to health facilities across the state, including the FMC, Asaba, in addition to the sensitisation of health workers in the state to have a high index of suspicion and take preventive measures when managing infectious cases."

He noted that the state Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, "has provided all the support to the ministry to enable them curtail the spread of disease in the state," saying members of the public could report any suspected case to the nearest health facility or through telephone number 07037120510 or 08168741415.

No fewer than 11 persons have died of Lassa fever in Edo state in the latest outbreak of the hemorrhagic disease.

The State Commissioner for Health, Dr David Osifo, who disclosed this at a press briefing to announce a successful stem cell transplant carried out by a private hospital, Celltek Healthcare Medical Centre, in Benin, added that 45 confirmed cases were recorded in the state.

Osifo said that the recorded cases were receiving treatment at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital [ISTH].

"In terms of the state, there are about 45 confirmed cases from Edo state. At the initial stage during the outbreak, a lot of people were not aware and so, awareness was a problem. "And so, many people who had Lassa fever took it for malaria fever. So, the thing (disease) was spreading rapidly.

"When we heard the call from ISTH that there was an epidemic, I paid an on-the-spot visit to assess the situation. I discovered that within a period of one month, 11 patients died of Lassa fever and that was very disturbing to us," Osifo said.

The Commissioner blamed the casualty figure on inadequate facilities to manage of the high number of patients undergoing treatment in the Hospital.

[Cases of Lassa fever continue to occur in a wide geographic area in Nigeria. Recently, WHO teams and personnel from the Ministry of Health began engaging with communities at risk of infection. The villages and towns are scattered over a large geographic area in 17 states. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

As noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.
