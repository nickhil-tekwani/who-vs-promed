[CIDRAP News, edited] http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/05/ebola-cases-drop-more-specimens-test-negative [Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) officials said some suspected cases of Ebola have tested negative for the disease, dropping the total number of cases to 51 from 54.

Of the cases, 35 are confirmed, 13 are probable, and 3 are suspected, the DRC health ministry said yesterday. Two of the suspected cases are new, 1 in Iboko and 1 in Wangata, the urban zone located within Mbandaka, a city of more than 1 million people.

The DRC said teams of health workers are going "house to house" in Mbandaka to trace any patient contacts and conduct extensive surveillance in the city. Authorities also said that three patients who left the Wangata Ebola treatment center last week were found in the Bongonzo neighborhood of Mbandaka.

The DRC Minister of Health, Oly Kalenga, MD, said response coordination teams will be monitoring the Bongonzo neighborhood in the coming days.

28 May 2018. Three people infected with Ebola virus were 'discharged' on Sunday in Bokoro
[Media Congo] [Machine trans., edited] https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite -38710_trois_personnes_atteintes_de_la_maladie_a_virus_ebola_dechargees_dimanche_a_bikoro.html

A total of 3 people infected with Ebola virus, including Father Lucien Ma Bungala, were "discharged", the best leaving [Sun 27 May 2018], from Ebola treatment center (CTE) cured of Ebola virus disease (EVD), in Bikoro, Equateur Province, where the epidemic is currently taking place.

According to the communication unit of the Ministry of Health, the departure of this Catholic prelate and his companions from the center testifies to the determination of the Minister responsible, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, to eradicate this disease in the affected areas and their surroundings.

Moreover, the same source reports, in the context of the revitalization of activities to fight Ebola virus disease in Equateur, that the health authority, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, visited various ports, both public and private, in the city of Mbandaka, to inquire about the arrangements put in place for the prevention [of spread] by travelers and other communities there.

[3] Congo's river of worry
[30 May 2018] Ebola: Fear, suspicion, and anger along Congo's river of worry
[Irin News, edited] [https://www.irinnews.org/news-feature/2018/05/30/ebola-fear-suspicion-and-anger-along-congo-s-river-worry [Byline: Issa Sikiti da Silva]

As fish-seller prepares to board a barge from Mbandaka to Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, she is painfully aware of the heightened risk of catching Ebola, which has already reached the outskirts of this city of one million people.

"My family in Kin (Kinshasa) told me to be very, very careful on this trip. I really wished we could be screened so that we know we are 100 percent sure that we are Ebola-free. I'm going to look at everyone who got here with suspicion," she says.

Properly screening the entire Congo River and all its tributaries is a practical impossibility - thousands of ports and informal embarkation points dot the 600 kilometres [372.82 mi approx.] south to Kinshasa, the 500 kilometres [310.68 mi. approx.] north to Bangui (the capital of the Central African Republic), and the various routes westward into neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. But people here are afraid and some accuse the government and the international medical authorities of putting out mixed messages.

The 1st news of the outbreak, in rural Bikoro, reached the World Health Organisation, which is now leading the response with the Congolese government, on [Tue 8 May 2018]. Its spread to Mbandaka, confirmed on [Thu 17 May 2018], greatly increased fears of a wider epidemic, and was described by the WHO as a "major game-changer".

Because of Mbandaka's location on the river and its road and air links, the confirmation of Ebola cases there "increases the risk both of local propagation and further spread within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries," according to the government's strategic response plan.

For now, authorities seem to believe the outbreak is contained in Equateur Province, but fears remain that it could hitch a ride up or down the largely unmonitored Congo River and become a major epidemic.

"All it takes is one sick person to travel down the Congo River and we can have outbreaks seeded in many different locations... that can happen at any moment, it's very hard to predict," Peter Salama, the WHO's head of emergency response, told Reuters news agency last week.

Bonne Annee Etombi Sanga, the principal of Le Chandelier School, located next to one of Mbandaka's ports, said the proximity to the river had spurred him to take preventative action to protect the children.

"We thought we should organise ourselves to create awareness about the disease," Sanga said. "We are deeply worried. As a result, we handed out Ebola pamphlets to the kids and teachers, and we have set up hand-washing buckets so that anyone entering or going out of the school could wash his hands properly. We are being very vigilant."

Double standards?
The Ebola virus is passed from person to person via direct contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of infected people who are in the late stages of infection. It takes between 2 and 20 days from infection for the first symptoms, such as a fever, to show.

Mbandaka is now teeming with experts, health ministry personnel, and aid workers trying to contain the outbreak by administering vaccinations, detecting new infections, tracing people who have come into contact with infected people, and raising awareness among healthcare workers and the general population.

But whereas passengers at Mbandaka's airport all have their temperature checked on arrival and departure, no such screening is taking place at the several ports around the city IRIN visited.

According to the International Organization for Migration, another UN agency involved in the response, ports on the Congo River "do not meet international standards for boarding and disembarking, and the lack of effective surveillance could lead to Ebola cases being found in Kinshasa."

Another passenger waiting to board a barge in Mbandaka, complained of double standards: "If they are screening people at airports, why don't they screen us at ports? Oh, okay, plane passengers are rich and VIPs, and we, poor people on the boats and barges, count for nothing."

In Geneva, Michael Ryan, the WHO's assistant director general for emergency preparedness and response, told journalists that steps had already been taken to stop Ebola reaching Kinshasa.

"Now, a joint IOM/WHO team is going up and down the river looking at where the best and most strategic points are to do such screening," he said, noting there are "literally hundreds of ports along the river."

He said it was important not to unnecessarily restrict the movement of people and goods when tackling an outbreak, especially because "the vast majority of people who are travelling in Congo and may have a fever will not have Ebola. They'll have malaria or something else."

But a boat owner in Mbandaka preparing to sail to Lukolela, a town about 175 kilometres [108.74 mi approx.] downstream, said he too was worried by the lack of controls on the river. "Time is flying and the virus is getting near our homes and families," he said. "Anyone among these people going in and out of these ports could be infected. What are they waiting for? This disease scares me to death."

Others, however, didn't want any talk of the virus and appeared more concerned about its economic impact. IRIN witnessed one group of local residents and passengers vandalising a hand-washing bucket placed near a boat. "There is no Ebola here, so we don't want to see this damned bucket standing here and giving a bad name to our area. That's why people got rid of it," explained a motorcycle taxi driver.

Words, but no action
Last week [week of Sun 20 May 2018], Congolese Minister of Transport Jose Makila announced a night-time curfew on the river and the deployment of patrol boats. "There will be no more sailing at night," he said. "Come 6 pm, all transporters must spend the night exactly where they find themselves, and bring all the boats to the shores to be controlled by the health ministry."

But the government decree does not appear to have translated into action.

"I only heard it on the radio," said the supervisor of 1 port, through which about 100 vessels pass daily. "We have yet to see those motorised boats patrol the river day and night to ensure that the passengers and boat crews abide by the law and pull to the shores to be screened," the supervisor, who gave his name only as Bosco, said.

"I really wonder how these operations will be carried out since there is a distance of 600 kilometres [372.82 mi approx.] between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, and the river is huge and dangerous," he added.

[A man], who crews on a barge carrying charcoal, timber, and people to Kinshasa, joked that he also served as the vessel's health inspector.

"I'm on the lookout for sick-looking passengers who board at Mbandaka," he said. "I don't want them to take Ebola to the capital where our families live. Just imagine the disaster that it will bring to us if even one single Ebola-infected passenger were to board the boat to Kinshasa. He will not only die on the way but infect everyone in the ship, including me."

On the bustling river, small pirogues used by fishermen, hunters, and farmers compete for space with strings of tug-pulled barges laden with cars, livestock, charcoal, and people.

The pirogues ply nearby riverside settlements, while the barges travel to cities as far away as Kinshasa, Kisangani, and Bangui.

For most passengers and crew, there is little choice but to continue as normal.

"We are carrying on with our lives regardless of what's happening around us because we have families to feed and kids to send to school," said a fisherman.

[A maize] seller, about to board a boat for Zongo on the CAR border, agreed: "We cannot lock ourselves in our houses to hide... May those who died of Ebola rest in peace, but life must go on."

[4] WHO international traveler advice for DRC
31 May 2018. WHO issues advice for int'l travelers about DRC Ebola outbreak.
[Xinhua] http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-05/31/c_137218557.htm

The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued travel advice for international travelers in relation to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), following the latest disease development as of Wednesday [30 May 2018].

Generally, risk of contracting Ebola disease to travelers to the DRC is low, the WHO said, as people are only infectious after they have developed symptoms, including fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat.

The UN health agency advises that travelers to the DRC consult a travel medicine clinic or medical practitioner at least 4 to 8 weeks before the journey. The consultation should include information about the most important health risks, determine the need for any vaccinations and antimalarial medication, and identify any other medical items that the traveler may require.

To minimize the risk of infection, travelers in the affected areas should practice regular hygiene, especially hand hygiene with soap and water, and if not available, with an alcohol-based hand rub solution (hand sanitizer). They also need to practice hand hygiene especially before touching eyes, nose or mouth, and after using the toilet or touching objects at high risk of being contaminated. Safe sex is required too.

If symptoms consistent with Ebola disease develop, travelers should seek immediate medical attention. According to the WHO, 1st symptoms are the sudden onset of fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

The latest WHO statistics show that from [Wed 4 Apr 2018] through [Sun 27 May 2018], a cumulative total of 54 Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases including 25 deaths have been reported from 3 health zones in Equateur Province of the DRC. The total includes 35 confirmed, 13 probable and 6 suspected cases. Since the launch of the vaccination intervention on [Mon 21 May 2018], a total of 462 people have been vaccinated.

Despite the current situation, the WHO has decided that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern have not currently been met in the DRC. It continues to advise against the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

The WHO has assessed the public health risk to be very high in the DRC, and high at the regional level. At the global level the risk currently remains low.

[New Vision, Uganda] https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1478857/dr-congo-pilgrims-screened-ebola [Byline: Vicky Wandawa]

All pilgrims arriving from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are undergoing screening for Ebola, according to a statement from the [Uganda] ministry of health.

The screening is taking place at both the border districts and in Namugongo before entrance into the shrines.

This comes after the Health Ministry in the DRC the declared the 9th outbreak of Ebola virus in the country, in early May [2018].

The ministry of health in Uganda has set up an isolation unit at the China-Uganda Friendship hospital, Naguru.

"An expert team of 10 medical personnel will conduct screening of Ebola Viral Hemorrhagic fevers at Namugongo," reads the statement.

Additionally, the ministry has designated 150 workers, led by Tororo diocese at the Catholic shrine while 60 health workers led by Kigezi diocese will be deployed at the Anglican shrine alongside 40 emergency care officers.

Some of the personnel shall be positioned among the pilgrims, wearing reflector jackets with tags for easy identification and timely provision of 1st aid in case need arises.

A total of 7 fully equipped ambulances, 2 stationed inside the premises and 5 along the road have been availed until [Mon 4 Jun 2018].

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The official DRC update for today [Thu 31 May 2018] [part 1] is relatively brief, but should be supplemented by the most recent WHO EVD External Situation Report (now up to number 6). Although not up-to-the-minute in terms of case counts, these reports provide an overview of all facets of the epidemiological response, accompanied by multicolor graphics: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272695/SITREP-EVD-DRC-20180529-eng.pdf

Every day in the field during an epidemic brings new challenges, but also small victories. Although our updates generally do not attempt to provide granular coverage of individual patient cases, we have excerpted 2 recent reports here in part [2] as a reminder that case numbers do drop: fewer suspect cases may arise, many suspect cases turn out not to have Ebola infection, and many Ebola patients do survive and are effectively cured [albeit sometimes with residual sequelae or reservoir live virus, as we learned from West African Ebola survivors].

Travel advisories, restrictions, and screening procedures are also being put in place both within and outside of the DRC. As previously reported, Congolese health authorities have mounted screening stations along the Congo River, the busiest highway in the country. Even as they do so, however, they encounter and must overcome the kind of individual and group fear and suspicion that are vividly described by the IRIN News report in part [3].

At a global level, WHO has now issued guidance for international travelers to the DRC [part 4]. Importantly, WHO advises that the risk of Ebola to travelers to the DRC is low, that the Ebola outbreak in the DRC does not (yet) merit designation as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and that therefore there should not be any travel or trade restrictions for the DRC. The original WHO recommendations may be found at http://www.who.int/ith/evd-travel-advice-final-29-05-2018-final.pdf?ua=1

But what about DRC citizens and residents traveling to other countries? Although the WHO advises against any travel restrictions, the question naturally arises as to if and when travelers from the DRC should be screened for Ebola infection. This question came up for me personally 2 weeks ago when I cared for a febrile patient who had flown to Boston only 3 days before from Kinshasa. Although this patient had a clear-cut case of malaria and had not recently been in Equateur Province, these would be likely be irrelevant considerations if we had the kind of Ebola screening, isolation, and referral policies that were in place during the 2014-2015 West African Ebola epidemic.

We should certainly expect to see efforts by other countries to screen travelers from the DRC, even if these are only tentative ad hoc procedures generated by an abundance of caution and not panic. That is why the relatively isolated, even obscure, Ugandan plan to screen DRC pilgrims [part 5] is so noteworthy. By way of background, Namugongo, Uganda, is the site of an important Christian shrine commemorating the deaths of 32 Catholics and Anglicans who were killed there in 1886 for their beliefs, and were later canonized as martyrs by the Roman Catholic Church. An annual pilgrimage to Namugongo takes place every year on June 3, attracting an estimated 2 million people in 2015. The New Vision article describes the screening and public health procedures, personnel, and facilities - extending even to an isolation unit - that the Ugandan Ministry of Health has put in place for the many imminent Christian pilgrims from the DRC. Uganda is no stranger to Ebola, having experienced the largest previous Ebola outbreak prior to the 2014-2015 West African epidemic, and this current effort is completely consistent with the kind of rapid but large-scale public health screening procedures put in place for the Hajj and other annual or periodic religious mass gatherings.
