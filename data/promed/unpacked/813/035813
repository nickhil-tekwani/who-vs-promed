The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in early 2000 was most likely
caused by a virus carried to Korea in imported dry grass and on the shoes
of returning travelers, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said.
According to research conducted by the Foot-and-Mouth Disease
Epidemiological Investigation Committee, FMD [was probably spread by dry
feed and tourists.
The committee indicated the possibility of the epidemic being ignited by
yellow sand blown over from China is low but cannot be ruled out.
The committee based its conclusions [in part on the fact that a lot of the
dry grass imported from northeast Asian countries where the epidemic
occurred in early 2000 was used in the regions where the [Korean epidemic
occurred.
Outbound tourists [were also thought to be a likely cause of the outbreak;
the number of tourists who traveled to countries where the 2000 outbreak
occurred [was much higher than the number for 1999, the committee said.
