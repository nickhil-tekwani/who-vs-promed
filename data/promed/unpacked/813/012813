Anthrax death probe hears Scots lab plea
----------------------------------------
A Scottish anthrax research centre would be "overly expensive" and a
"pointless dilution" of UK expertise, a fatal accident inquiry was
told yesterday [2 Dec 2008]. The idea for the centre was suggested
after the death from anthrax of a Borders craftsman, Pascal Norris,
in July 2006.

It was claimed [that] "unnecessary delays" in identifying the
bacteria could have been avoided if a Scottish centre existed.
Samples had to be sent to the south of England for analysis.

Mr Norris, 50, is believed to have caught the bug from West African
drums made of infected hide at a drum class 6 days before he died.
The cause was only established a month later.

A fatal accident inquiry ended at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday
[2 Dec 2008], and Sheriff Principal Edward Bowen, QC, will deliver
his written determination later.

Mr Norris became the 1st person in the UK in more than 30 years to
die from anthrax, and there are no other recorded cases worldwide of
people getting anthrax by simply playing drums [see ProMED-mail
listings below. - Mod.MHJ] No [Scottish] doctor who saw Mr Norris was
able to diagnose anthrax.

Dr Colin Ramsay, who chaired the inquiry for Health Protection
Scotland, said a Scottish facility was "not practical." The fiscal
depute, Martin Macari, said it "would be an overly expensive and
pointless dilution of the pool of UK expertise".

[The 1st human anthrax death in the UK in 30 years maybe but there
were 3 cases in the 1990s, 2 cases in 2001 (diagnosed by
retrospective serology), and 2 in 2005 before this fatal case in
2006. Infrequent, yes; unknown, no. But one must agree that
establishing an anthrax research centre in the north would be an
unnecessary duplication of effort when there is internationally
recognised institutional experience at Porton, outside Salisbury,
over many years. The last anthrax livestock case in Scotland was in
1997; after sporadic bovine cases up to 1996 in England and Wales the
last English outbreak was in 2002 and one in Wales in 2006. It is in
the process of disappearing.

This inquiry has added little to what was revealed in an earlier
Borders report. However, without trying to preempt the Sheriff's
written determination it is clear that the inquirey has provided an
official justification for the Sabre decontamination expenses and
recognised the protracted-diagnosis problem.

We all have problems recognising disease conditions we don't see
every month. But we on the other side of the pond should be very
thankful that Dr Larry Bush of the JFK Memorial Hospital, Fort Worth,
Florida had _just_ returned from a CDC (US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention) training course that included pneumonic
anthrax when he was presented with a patient with the relevant
symptoms. His initial diagnosis and the subsequent laboratory
confirmations (plural) alerted this country before the other cases
occurred in the northeast. One can ask if Larry had not been on that
course, would the other 21 cases have been recognised and properly
diagnosed? Would they have received appropriate treatment? The
probability would certainly have been much less and in the absence of
a diagnosis this might have prompted the perpetrator to repeat his or
her letter-filling act, resulting in more deaths. One must remember
that for any bioterrorist act to succeed it must be recognised and
diagnosed. Without diagnosis it hasn't occurred because the political
and social "BANG!" has not been set off. We owe much to the training
that Larry Bush and others were given then and subsequently.

In the meanwhile I think we can safely assume that there will
continue to be human anthrax cases associated with West African goat
skins and drum making, albeit few. - Mod.MHJ]
