AEROSOL TRANSMISSION (6)
========================
Today, with the recent outbreak in Gabon, there are clinical experiences
and data from 13 separate, virus-isolation-confirmed, filovirus-associated
outbreaks. We also have the first results from a series of studies designed
to verify if Ebola virus can be effectively transmitted by oral or
conjunctival exposure in nonhuman primates.
I believe that the result shows:
1) that it is predictable that Ebola would be a much more likely candidate
for aerosol transmission than HIV
2) that more studies are needed
AEROSOL TRANSMISSION OF EBOLA
*** Scientists at CDC have by looking at stained samples from Ebola
patients found that the virus is sometimes present in the air sacs of the
lungs. (Preliminary CDC study, from New York Times, Sept. 19, 1995, p. C3)
["Air sacs" = alveoli presumeably; only birds have air sacs. MH-J]
*** "Laboratory evidence for the extensive presence of virus in pulmonary
secretions and the relentless spread within involved rooms (even in the
absence of needle or syringe use) clearly established the ability of this
filovirus strain (Reston, H.A.) to spread from monkey to monkey and even
from monkey to man by droplets and/or small particle aerosols."
(C.J.Peters, E.D. Johnson, P.B. Jahrling a.o. - "Emerging Viruses", edited
by Stephen Morse, 1993)
*** USAMRIID has done formal aerosol experiments in which as little as 400
plaque-forming units of Ebola Zaire caused a rapidly fatal disease in 4-5
days. (Int. J. Exp. Path., Vol. 76, 1995, p. 227-236; E. Johnson, N. Jaax,
J. White and P. Jahrling - "Lethal experimental infections of rhesus
monkeys by aerosolized Ebola virus")
*** "All Ebola virus aerosol exposed monkeys had a mild to moderate,
patchy, interstitial pneumonia, clearly oriented around terminal
bronchioles (bronchocentric pattern). Additional pulmonary lesions included
diffuse leucocytosis, vasculitis, multifocal septal necrosis, thrombosis,
haemorrhage, odema, and increased numbers of alveolar macrophages. Large,
amorphous, pleomorphic, acidophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions... were
present in circulating and alveolar macrophages of the lungs... When
examined by immunocytochemistry, the strongest viral antigen reactivity in
the lungs of aerosol exposed monkeys also occured in a bronchocentric
pattern, with the heaviest antigen concentration occuring adjacent to
terminal bronchioles. Bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, alveolar
pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages showed positive Ebola virus antigen
staining. Copious extracellular Ebola virus antigen was also present in
secretions on the mucosal surfaces of the nose, oropharynx and airways...
The presence of virions in the tissues of aerosol infected monkeys was
confirmed by electron microscopy. Extracellular filamentous virions were
abundant, and were present in lung alveoli... Type 1 alveolar pneumocytes
contained nucleocapsid inclusions with characteristic viral particles
budding through plasma membranes into the air space." (Int. J. Exp. Path.,
Vol. 76, 1995, p. 227-236)
*** "In 1 Reston virus-infected monkey, virus particles were embedded in
the basement membrane of lung alveoli, indicating, as previously suggested,
that this filovirus may replicate in the lung." (The Journal of Infectious
Diseases, 1992;166: 753-63. Susan P. Fisher-Hoch et al. "Pathogenic
Potential of Filoviruses: Role of Geographic Origin of Primate Host and
Virus Strain")
*** Field observations indicate that "a minority of Ebola secondary
infections did not have close contact with patients' blood or body
fluids".(C.J.Peters, E.D. Johnson, P.B. Jahrling a.o. - "Emerging Viruses",
edited by Stephen Morse, 1993)
*** The prominent pneumonic component of the disease in infected monkeys
supports the conclusion that aerosol transmission may occur, as does a
serosurvey of human contacts. (Int. J. Exp. Path., Vol. 76, 1995, p.
227-236 and J. Comp. Path., Vol. 106, 1992; Geisbert T.W. - "Association
of Ebola related Reston virus particles and antigen with tissue lesions of
monkeys imported to the United States")
*** Nancy Jaax, Pathologist from USAMRIID, showing Richard Preston, a slice
of lung tissue in a microscope. The piece is from a monkey exposed to
aerosolized Ebola Zaire in a BL4-lab. study:
"You see those bricks budding directly into the air spaces of the lung?
When you cough, this stuff comes up your throat in your sputum. That's why
you don't want someone who has Ebola coughing in your face." (The Hot Zone,
p. 384)
*** This is an excerpt from a just published USAMRIID study. Four adult
rhesus monkeys were exposed to Ebola Zaire (Mayinga) by the conjunctival
route, three exposed by the oral route, and one intramuscularly inoculated
positive control monkey. All animals were succesfully infected with Ebola.
Seven died of Ebola fever between days 7 and 8 postexposure. One monkey was
given aggressive supportive therapy and a platelet transfusion, and lived
until day 12 postexposure.
"Viral titers of lungs were high in all monkeys, and viral antigen was
abundant by immunocytochemistry. Immunoreactivity in the lungs of six of
eight infected monkeys was not apparent in alveoli or airways and occured
primarily within vascular structures. These findings were confirmed by
ultrastructural examination. The distribution pattern of virus in these six
animals may explain the clinical observation that Ebola is apparently not
transmitted via aerosol in natural outbreaks.
In the other two monkeys, however, severe pulmonary edema was present.
Alveoli were filled with proteinaceous fluid, fibrin, and large numbers of
immunopositive macrophages. Immunopositive exudate was also present in
bronchioles. Based on these findings, these two monkeys would be a more
likely source of infectious aerosol or droplets than the other six monkeys.
This suggests there may be a percentage of clinical cases that have
presence of infectious viral particles in the upper airway, making them a
potential aerosol or droplet hazard. This finding has been documented in
the primate epizootics of Ebola-Reston in 1989-1990." (Arch Pathol Lab Med
- Vol 120, February 1996. Nancy Jaax, DVM et al.;"Lethal Experimental
Infection of Rhesus Monkeys With Ebola-Zaire (Mayinga) Virus by the Oral
and Conjunctival Route of Exposure")
*** "EBOLA - TRANSMISSION (5)", ProMED 15 Feb. 1996 - Excerpts from another
USAMRIID study that showed a secondary transmission of Ebola Zaire in two
of three control rhesus monkeys that did not have direct contact with
experimentally inoculated monkeys held in the same room:
"The exact mode of transmission to the control monkeys cannot be absolutely
determined, although the pattern of pulmonary antigen staining in one of
the control monkeys was virtually identical to that reported in
experimental Ebola virus aerosol infection in rhesus monkeys, suggesting
airborne transmission of the disease via infectious droplets."

DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER THIS ONE
"Unfortunately, an extremely virulent virus that appears de novo can spread
through and virtually destroy a large population before it either adapts or
exhausts its supply of nonimmune hosts. It is just such epidemic spread of
the common childhood diseases of Europe, such as measles and smallpox, that
devastated indigenous populations in Central and South America after
contact between European and Native American populations. Such agents are
deadly in virgin populations, ie, populations without previous exposure to
the agent."

Emerging Viral Threats", by Robert M. Herndon, MD.
