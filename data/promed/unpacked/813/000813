[1] Indonesia, vaccination

A shortage of vaccines has hampered the
government's plan to carry out a nationwide
poultry vaccination drive against bird flu next
month, a senior government official said Monday
[10 Apr 2006].
"We planned to hold 2 rounds of a massive
vaccination campaign in May and June, but because
we are short of vaccines, we have to reconsider
the plan," Agriculture Ministry head of bird flu
emergency response Delima Hasri Azahari told The
Jakarta Post.
The vaccination effort would target mostly
backyard and small-farm poultry, she said.
She explained that to carry out the drive, the
government needed about 600 million doses of the
vaccine for some 300 million birds across the
country. Each would receive 2 shots.
"However, the 2006 state budget could only afford
enough money to purchase 120 million doses. So we
are facing a gap of 480 million doses," Delima
said. She could not specify how much money was
needed to cover the shortage.
Delima said she believed if the shortage was not
addressed immediately, the vaccination drive
would not be effective. "We could still carry out
the vaccination drive according to schedule, but
we could only focus on high-priority regions
where bird flu is pandemic.
Such measures wouldn't be effective, however,
because to contain the spread of the virus we
should vaccinate all poultry at the same time,"
she said.
High numbers of bird flu fatalities among humans
and poultry have been recorded in 9 provinces
across Indonesia -- Jambi, Lampung, Jakarta,
Banten, Central Java, West Java, East Java,
Yogyakarta and South Sulawesi.
The H5N1 virus has killed 24 of 32 confirmed
human bird flu patients. It has also killed
millions of birds.
Delima said she and other senior government
officials, led by Coordinating Minister for the
People's Welfare Aburizal Bakrie, would discuss
the disease Tuesday [11 Apr 2006] with World Bank
chief Paul Wolfowitz in Tangerang, West Java.
"Recently, a team of World Bank experts did a
preliminary assessment of bird flu in the
country. So we expect they will understand our
needs," she said. "However, we also encourage the
private sector to support the campaign," Delima
said.
An advisor to Aburizal on bird flu issues, Emil
Agustiono, told the Post recently that the
private sector should do more to help the
government battle bird flu.
He said that to date, of the Rp 9 trillion [USD 1
billion] needed to fight bird flu from 2006 to
2008, the private sector had donated only Rp 200
million [USD 22 300].
Secretary-General of the Indonesian Employers
Association Djimanto said businesses were
actually eager to help fight bird flu, since a
pandemic could cost companies billions of rupiah
in losses.

[So far, mass vaccination of poultry against HPAI
H5N1 has been included in the formal prevention
and control policies of 3 countries: China,
Indonesia and Vietnam. France and the Netherlands
have decided to vaccinate (limited) sections of
their avian populations which cannot be kept
indoors, separated from wild birds. - Mod.AS]

So far in 2006, 5334 wild birds have been handed
over to the Bavarian Agency for Health and Food
Safety; 4655 of them have already [by 7 Apr 2006]
been tested for influenza A, and the 71 samples
that were influenza A positive have been sent to
the Friedrich Loffler Institute (FLI) for further
testing. The FLI has confirmed 54 samples as H5N1
positive, 7 as H5N1 negative, and 10 have yet to
be determined.
During the week of 31 Mar 2006 (12 noon) until 7
Apr 2006 (12 noon), the following 16 new cases

[3] Denmark, wild birds, update

2006 [edited]
<http://www.uk.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/AnimalHealth/Avian_influenza/Latest_news/Results_in_2006/forside.htm>

The following selected data are derived from the
10 Apr 2006 update from the above source.
During the period 15 Feb 2006 to 14 Mar 2006, 225
wild birds have been tested for avian influenza
with negative results.
Since 14 Mar 2006, when the first H5N1-positive
case was detected in Denmark, a total of 39
positive cases have been confirmed. They included
the following species:
Tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_): 23
Common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_): 6
Whooper swan (_Cygnus cygnus_): 2
Peregrine falcon (_Falco peregrinus_) 1
Greylag goose (_Anser anser_): 1
Mute swans (_Cygnus olor_): 3
Rough-legged buzzard (_Buteo lagopus_): 1
Swan (unspecified)(_Cygnus sp._): 2
Their respective dates of laboratory confirmations were the following:
14/03/2006 1 common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_)
17/03/2006 9 tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_)
19/03/2006 6 tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_)

30/03/2006 1 tufted duck (_Aythya fuligula_)
31/03/2006 1 mute swan (_Cygnus olor_)
31/03/2006 1 tufted duck (_Aythya fuligula_)
01/04/2006 1 tufted duck (_Aythya fuligula_)

06/04/2006 1 whooper swan (_Cygnus cygnus_)
07/04/2006 1 common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_)
07/04/2006 1 common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_)
10/04/2006 1 swan (_Cygnus sp._)
10/04/2006 1 swan (_Cygnus sp._)
The above web-site includes detailed reports and
maps. It will be interesting to note if the peak
of infection in wildlife is indeed over.
The Danish authorities seem to have been so far
successful in their endeavors to prevent contacts
between domestic and wild fowl.
An interdisciplinary analysis of the above data
and similar surveillance results from other
European countries might be anticipated. It might
provide better insight on the role of the various
species. - Mod.AS]

[4] Requests for information: Lebanon, Japan, Iraq, Laos
Date: Tue, 11 Apr 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
Requests for information
-------------------------
The following issues, included in previous
ProMED-mail postings, have remained unanswered.
Information, if available, will be very much
appreciated.
1. Avian influenza, H7, poultry - Lebanon: RFI - 20060402.0988
The above posting of 30 Mar 2006 included the
following information: "The laboratory of the
American University of Beirut has detected the
virus H7 on several samples of domestic poultry
from the South of Lebanon. The Ministry of
Agriculture has agreed for sending samples from
the affected poultry to the Weybridge Laboratory
in UK or IZS-Venezie laboratory in Italy for
further testing."
Our request for information -- confirming the
above data or otherwise, and providing testing
results, if performed -- is hereby repeated.
2. Avian influenza - Eurasia (23): Japan (Ibaraki), H5N2 20060117.0158
The above posting addressed the possibility that
an illegal bird flu vaccine was behind a
lingering H5N2 outbreak in Ibaraki. An
alternative hypothesis, raised by a subscriber,
was the introduction into Japan of H5N2 by
illegally trafficked exotic birds.
ProMED-mail's request for data on the official
investigation into the matter which, reportedly,
had been carried out, is hereby repeated.
3. H5 in avians
ProMED-mail posting Avian influenza - worldwide
(53): Europe, 20060315.0803 included the names of
5 countries which had reported the detection of
H5 cases, without data on the neuraminidase
serotype. In the meantime, 3 of the said
countries have completed their tests and
officially reported that the causative agent was
indeed H5N1. The remaining 2 counties are still
listed by OIE as infected by H5. Those countries
are:
Iraq (see <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_32.HTM#Sec0>);
Laos (see <ftp://ftp.oie.int/infos_san_archives/eng/2004/en_040130v17n05.pdf>).
Complementary information on the full identity of
the avian influenza virus detected in those
countries will be appreciated.
