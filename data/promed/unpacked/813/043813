First Report of Ascochyta Blight of Chickpea Caused by _Ascochyta
rabiei_ in Chile.
R. Galdames and M. Mera, INIA-Carillanca, Temuco, Chile. Plant Dis.
87:603, 2003; published on-line as D-2003-0324-01N, 2003. Accepted
for publication 6 Mar 2003.
Chickpea (_Cicer arietinum_ L.) plants with foliar and stem lesions
fitting the description of Ascochyta blight [Ab] were observed in
October 2002 in 4 chickpea crops located in the La Araucania Region
(38 deg S, 72 deg 24 min W) of southern Chile. Large, circular foliar
and stem lesions containing pycnidia arranged in concentric circles
were observed (1). Stem breakage also was observed.
Isolates were obtained from mature pycnidia developed on stems by
culturing a spore suspension on PDA and chickpea seed meal agar. A
pathogenicity test was performed by inoculating 25 plants with a
suspension of 1.2 million conidia/ml and incubating at 22 deg C and
75 percent relative humidity. Foliar and stem lesions were observed 5
and 7 days after inoculation, respectively. 4 check plants sprayed
with sterile distilled water showed no symptoms.
Fungal colonies obtained from inoculated plants showed the same
cultural characteristics as the original isolates. Cultural
morphology was consistent with the description of _Ascochyta rabiei_
(Pass.) Labrousse (teleomorph _Didymella rabiei_ (Kovacheski) v. Arx
(= _Mycosphaerella rabiei_ Kovacheski)) (3). Conidia produced on PDA
were predominantly aseptate, 3.90 to 5.85 micrometers wide, and 9.75
to 11.7 micrometers long.
Affected plants (cv. Kaniva) originated from seed introduced at
commercial volumes (69 tons) from Victoria, Australia in August 2002.
_A. rabiei_ can be disseminated via infected seed (1). Ab symptoms
have been observed in small patches in several crops near Temuco, the
capital of La Araucania Region.
Chickpea production is currently relatively small in southern Chile,
but plans to promote its cultivation may be hindered by this
outbreak. The only other country to report Ab of chickpea in South
America was Bolivia (2).

[Of the diseases affecting chickpea, Ab is regarded as the most
damaging worldwide. Only chickpea is susceptible to Ab, and all parts
of the plant can be infected. Yield reductions of up to 50 percent
are not unusual. Management of Ab includes crop rotation using
non-host crops, not planting chickpea for at least 3 years on the
same site, and avoiding cropping close to previously blighted fields.
Information obtained from Fred Muehlbauer and Walter Kaiser of USDA
at Pullman, WA, indicated that cv. Sierra was tested in Bolivia and
demonstrated some resistance to Ab. Unfortunately, resistance to Ab
is short-term, and does not cover the entire crop season. Application
of chemical fungicides can be beneficial.
