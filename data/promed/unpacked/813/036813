France to ban slaughter method in move against BSE
----------------------------------------------------
France's food safety agency approved on Tuesday a proposed ban on
"pithing", a method widely used in slaughterhouses which experts fear may
increase the risk of "mad cow disease" (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,
BSE) spreading to humans through infected meat.
It involves firing a metal bolt into the brain to stun the animal before
killing it. Experts say the bolt could release prions, the proteins which
cause BSE from the brain while the animal was not yet dead, allowing them
to spread into the meat.
The bolt, which is reused, might also carry the prions from one animal to
another, the AFSSA food safety agency said in an opinion made public last
week. Meat from cattle infected with BSE is blamed for human cases of new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD), a deadly, brain-wasting disorder
for which there is no known cure.
Slaughterhouses use pithing so animals do not flail their limbs while being
butchered, injuring workers. The AFSSA agency said it approved the wording
which the government proposes to use in banning it.

[Work published in the Lancet in September, 1996, detailed how this process
could allow for the meat to be seeded with microscopic prion agents. It is
great the research is finally having an impact. The article detailed
finding as much as 14.5 cm of neurological tissue in the lungs. If pieces
that large can be found, what about the smaller, microscopic particles? -
