[We have received the following dengue update from Tonga -- Many thanks to
Dr Ian Welch and Tonga Ministry of Health -- TK
Ministry of Health in Tonga has advised latest figures on dengue in Tonga
as of 29 May 1998.

Since February 1998 there has been a total of 438 clinically suspected
cases of dengue presented at Vaiola Hospital on Tongatapu.

Of the 438 clinical cases, a total of 220 cases have had serology tests and
70 of these have confirmed evidence of dengue. Dengue type 2 has been
identified.
There has been one death of a child of 6 years with confirmed dengue. The
child had been admitted to hospital 'in extremis'.
At this time, there is little evidence of dengue in outer islands.

There is now a significant reduction in the number of clinical cases of
dengue type illness presenting at Vaiola Hospital on Tongatapu.
