[India has experienced HPAI outbreaks due to H5N1 virus infection in domestic poultry almost every year since the 1st report in 2006. So far, around 150 outbreaks in poultry have been reported, and 4 genetic clades of the virus have been identified. In 2016 and 2017, several cases of HPAI H5N1 were reported in poultry farms, crows and Guinea fowl. Since November 2016, also subtype H5N8 outbreaks were reported in India. - Mod.PMB
