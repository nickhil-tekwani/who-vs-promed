KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 11 (AFP) - Malaysia has stopped all its state health
departments from making statements about the fatal Japanese
encephalitis [JE virus which has claimed 14 lives in four months, a
report said Thursday.
The Sun newspaper cited officials as saying the order by Health
Minister Chua Jui Meng was issued earlier this month.
"The minister does not want the public to be unnecessarily alarmed. If
everyone makes statements, there will be confusion. This way,
information will be centralised," one official reportedly said.
Chua reportedly told local editors not to overplay the issue as their
reports could adversely affect the economy if picked up by foreign
media.
The Malaysian media faced similar problems in obtaining information in
1997 when an outbreak of the Coxsackie B virus killed 30 children in
the eastern state of Sarawak state on Borneo island.
Malaysian Medical Association president Lee Yan Sang reportedly agreed
information should be centralised. "If too many people speak up, there
would be contrasting statements and this would cause the public to
panic," he was quoted as saying, urging the health ministry to set up
a homepage to educate the public on the virus.

[There are 3 important points to be made here:
1. There is an urgent need for an official statement that there is
nothing unusual about seeing cases of JE at this time of year, and no
need for panic  a web page giving daily updates, such as Sarawak had
during the Coxsackie B virus outbreak quoted would be a good idea.
2. Bitter experience has taught many countries that reporting some
diseases, such as cholera, has a bad effect on trade & tourism. This
is all the more reason why there should be frequent official updates
of the situation, to curb rumors, put the outbreak in context, &
explain what the country is doing to control the disease & prevent
further cases.
3. As our Regional Moderator for Asia, Dr Chan Yow Cheong, pointed out
in his comments on the posting referenced above, the epidemiology of
this outbreak is different from the usual, since the cases reported
are mainly in adults, and serological confirmation that most of them
are due to JE virus is lacking. Either JE virus has changed its
characteristics this year, or there is a second virus involved.
Malaysia has highly competent virologists who should be able to give
an answer to this question soon  Mod.JW
