Miass city district in the Chelyabinsk region was placed under quarantine
on 1 Jul 2008 due to potato nematodes.

The dangerous potato pest _Globodera_ was reported by villagers in Syrostan
and Naily. Potato nematodes were detected in soil samples from the affected
areas.

This is not the 1st time for this region -- a similar situation occurred in
Miass in the 1980s and 1990s.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_) and pale (_G. pallida_) cyst
nematodes cause serious crop losses in potato. They can also infect other
solanaceous crops and weeds. Symptoms on potato are stunting, yellowing,
and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root system, which is abnormally
branched and brownish in colour. Damage to the crop varies from small
patches of poor growing plants to complete crop failure. Diseased plants
first occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop
if potatoes are continually grown on the infested site. In light
infestations, potato plants may show no above ground symptoms, but yield
can be reduced. Light infestations can reduce tuber size, whereas heavy
infestations reduce both number and size of tubers.

The nematodes are not greatly influenced by soil type and temperature and
thrive wherever potatoes are grown. The pathogens survive in soil in the
absence of a host as cysts containing viable eggs. These can survive in
soil, which has not been planted to potatoes, for up to 20 years. Spread
occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material. It takes about
6-7 years from introduction into a potato paddock before numbers of the
nematodes reach a detectable level. Disease management includes exclusion,
quarantine, and crop rotation with non-host species. Both nematodes have
been included on the alert list of the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO).

The report above does not state which of the _Globodera_ species has been
detected. However, _G. rostochiensis_ is widely distributed in the Eurasian
area, while _G. pallida_ has not been reported from Russia before.
Furthermore, potato cyst nematodes were detected in the Chelyabinsk region
in 1982 and the report above is a result of an annual monitoring programme
following the 1st detection, during which an increase in the affected area
has been observed (information provided by Mod.NP). It is therefore more
likely that the reported species is _G. rostochiensis_.
