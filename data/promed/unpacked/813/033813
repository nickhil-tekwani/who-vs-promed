Root-knot nematode new to the US
----------------------------------
_Meloidogyne mayaguensis_ [Mm], a root-knot nematode, is now
present within the continental USA ... Specimens were found in 3
Florida locations, ... (a commercial tomato field, an ornamental
nursery, and a tropical fruit nursery). Specific host information for the
latter 2 sites can be found in the Florida Pest Alert (see link below).
Mm, ... considered a tropical/subtropical nematode, is reported in the
field from Puerto Rico, several Caribbean basin countries (Cuba,
Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Tobago, and Trinidad),
Brazil, and 4 African countries (Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Senegal,
and South Africa).
Its potential host range is wide, but several [crop] plants are reported as
primary hosts, including coffee, guava, tomato, tobacco, eggplant, and
bell pepper.
The potential economic damage inflicted by Mm ... on these crops in
the USA is unclear, though this nematode is known to be more capable
of breaking cultivar resistance, particularly in tomatoes, soybeans, and
sweet potatoes, than other co-occurring tropical species.

[Can this nematode be contained, or is it a foregone conclusion that
spread has already occurred to other sites? Do any of our readers have
information on this topic? - Mod.DH]
