Herpes outbreak kills 2 horses
---------------------------------
Horse boarding facilities on the [US west] coast are instituting a
voluntary quarantine of horses after the 1st confirmed cases of a
deadly form of the equine herpesvirus in San Mateo County were
recently identified.
Three stables in the Moss Beach and Montara area are under voluntary
quarantine to help stop the spread of the neurotropic form of equine
herpesvirus. The San Mateo County Farm Bureau reported the outbreak
Friday [16 Mar 2007] afternoon.
Three cases were identified at a boarding facility in Montara, north
of Half Moon Bay, on 12 Mar 2007. A 4-year-old horse became feverish
on 6 Mar 2007. She began showing slight signs of ataxia on the
evening of 11 Mar 2007 and was unable to stand the next morning. At
that time, one other horse in the paddock was also ataxic, according
to the statement of the farm bureau's web site.
A diagnosis of equine herpesvirus was made based on history, clinical
signs and the number of horses affected. The horse was referred to
the University of California at Davis Large Animal Clinic. The
diagnosis was confirmed the afternoon of 12 Mar 2007 based on a
positive nasal swab, blood and spinal tap. Two other horses at the
boarding facility have also tested positive, with one other pending,
according to the statement.
Two of the affected horses were subsequently euthanized at UC-Davis
after failing to respond to treatment.
Equine herpes is a fairly common virus among horses. Humans cannot
get the disease but can inadvertently spread it among animals by
touching them or using contaminated equipment. The virus is usually
transmitted between horses through the air and through nasal secretions.

[One appreciates the stables taking this illness seriously. The
neurological disease often results in fatalities. Biosecurity at the
facilities and between facilities is critical to breaking the
transmission of this disease. - Mod.TG]
[The previous outbreaks reported from California in 2007 -- see
ProMED refs. below -- were from different stables. - Mod.JW]
