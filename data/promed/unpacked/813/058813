Source: WER Notifications of diseases received from 3 to 9 Jan 2003
3 cases of yellow fever were notified from Senegal with a date of 13 Dec 2002.
[ProMED would be interested to receive further details. Senegal shares a
border with Guinea, where suspect cases of YF are also reported with onset
in December 2002 -- see ref. below. Sandwiched between these countries
are Gambia & Guinea-Bissau, which should also be on the lookout for
cases. It would be prudent for travelers to all 4 countries to be
up-to-date with their YF vaccinations (valid for 10 years). - Mod.JW]
