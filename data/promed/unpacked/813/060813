[1] ECDC report

Main developments
-----------------
The 30 contributing countries (29 EU/EEA countries and Croatia) reported 8127 cases of measles during the last 12 month period (April 2012 to March 2013). (Luxembourg did not report for 3 [months] of the 12 month reporting period. The Netherlands did not report data for February and March 2013, and Iceland did not report data for March 2013).

France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom accounted for 95 per cent of the cases in the last 12 month period. 14 countries met the elimination target of less than one case of measles per million population during the last 12 months.

[In comparison Poland and Romania accounted for 99 per cent of all reported rubella cases in the same 12 month period. Romania has reported an average of 7 cases per month since August 2012, indicating that the nationwide epidemic that affected more than 20 000 people is now over. Poland is experiencing a nationwide rubella epidemic. Since August 2012, Poland has reported over 95 per cent of all rubella cases in the EU/EEA. The highest notifications have been among adolescents aged 15-19 years. Women represented 39.6 per cent of the case-based reports in the 15-44 year age group.]

66 per cent of the cases had a positive result in a measles laboratory test (serology, virus detection, or isolation). Of the 7757 cases for which information on vaccination status was available, 82 per cent were unvaccinated. In the target group for routine childhood MMR vaccination (1-4 year olds), 78 per cent of the cases were unvaccinated.

No measles-related deaths were reported during the period April 2012-March 2013 but 6 cases were complicated by acute measles encephalitis.

Epidemic intelligence reports
-----------------------------
- In the United Kingdom, measles transmission continues in England and Wales.
- Public Health England has launched a catch-up measles vaccination campaign that aims to immunise an estimated 330 000 unvaccinated people in the 10-16 year old age group. The plan is to halt the outbreak before the school start in autumn.

Surveillance data
-----------------
The enhanced measles surveillance data were retrieved from The European Surveillance System (TESSY) on 30 Apr 2013. The analysis covered the 12 month period from April 2012 to March 2013. All the 30 contributing countries (29 EU/EEA countries and Croatia) reported case-based data for the period. Data were missing for 3 months (November, December, and January) of the 12 month reporting period for Luxemburg, while the Netherlands did not report data for February and March 2013; Iceland did not report data for March 2013.

During the period April 2012 to March 2013, 8127 cases of measles were reported. The highest notification rate was among infants under one year of age (224.6 cases per million population), followed by children aged between 1 and 4 years (101.1 cases per million population) (Figure 2 -- available at the source URL above). The number of reported cases in March 2013 was about half of that reported for the same month in 2012, and the expected increase in cases normally associated with the peak transmission season of measles in the spring has so far not been observed in the 2013 data. 66 per cent of the cases had a positive result in a measles laboratory test (serology, virus detection, or isolation) but variations were observed between countries.

Vaccination status was known for 7757 (95 per cent) of the 8127 reported cases. Of these, 82 per cent (6389 cases) were unvaccinated, 12.5 per cent (973) had received one dose of measles vaccine, 3.5 per cent (273) had received 2 or more doses, and 1.6 per cent (122) had received an unknown number of doses. The proportion of unvaccinated cases was high across all age groups. Among the 1-4 year olds, which is the age group targeted by routine childhood vaccination programmes, 78 per cent of the cases were unvaccinated.

Over the last 12 months, 6 cases were complicated by acute measles encephalitis. No measles-related deaths were reported. [These data are presented as tables, graphs, and maps. Interested readers should access the original document via the source URL above. - Mod.CP]

Over 14 000 children are suffering from the disease in Punjab and the Lahore High Court [LHC] has summoned a report over the rising number of measles cases.

According to the Punjab Health Department, during the last 48 hours 5 children in the Children's Hospital, 4 in Mayo Hospital, and one child in Jinnah Hospital lost the battle to measles in Lahore.

The death toll at the Children's Hospital over the last month has risen to 57, 54 in Mayo Hospital, and 7 in Jinnah Hospital. Caretaker prime minister Najam Sethi has directed concerned departments to take all necessary steps to control the outbreak of measles. Meanwhile, during the hearing of the measles death case, justice Khalid Mahmood remarked that the spread of the disease despite the vaccination drive was a great cause of concern.

With 210 new cases reported during the last 24 hours, the number of measles cases reported in Punjab during last 6 months has reached 14 600. According to health department officials, the death toll has so far risen to 117 with most of the deaths occurring in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, and Sialkot. During the last 24 hours, around 210 cases of measles were reported from Punjab, including 59 from city hospitals.

Meanwhile, director general Health Services Punjab Dr Tanveer Ahmed talking to media said that on investigation it was found that the majority of deaths in Lahore were caused by severe pneumonia and delay in reaching hospitals. However, measles vaccination is available in all hospitals of the city, in ample quantity, and patients were being treated at free of cost. He appealed to parents to get their children up to 5 years of age vaccinated against measles without any delay and to cooperate with vaccinating teams.

Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court on Wednesday [29 May 2013] sought a report from the Health Department [by] 11 Jun 2013, about the steps taken to control measles during the past 3 years.

[Director general [DG], Punjab Health Department, Dr Tanvir Ahmad said] that the measles vaccine was of international standard and it was being provided to 12 million children. However, the court asked that if the vaccine was of international standard then why were children dying? The DG replied that vaccine was effective for only 85 per cent.

The court observed that there were 30 million children, if 4.5 million die then did it not make any difference? The petitioner's counsel Azhar Siddique pointed out that no measles campaign [had been] launched for the last 4 years. However, the DG said that the campaign was launched in 19 districts of Punjab and vitamin A was also provided along with the vaccine, if required.

The court observed that if dengue could be rooted out in one year then measles could also be controlled. To a court query, the DG said that INR 243 million [about USD 4.3 million] was spent on measles campaign in Lahore. He said that measles fatality rate was 5 per cent in the world, 2.5 per cent in Asia, but it was only 0.8 per cent in Pakistan. The court observed that the measles fatality rate should be zero and that if there was any problem of funding, the court should be apprised as it was necessary to save children lives. The court adjourning the matter until 11 Jun 2013, requested a report from the health department and ordered that steps be taken for keeping the vaccine as per international standards.
