A total of 48 cases of wild polio virus (WPV) has been recorded in 10 states since the beginning of the year 2012 with Kano, Jigawa, Bauchi, Borno, Yobe, Sokoto, Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina and Niger as the affected states.

Niger State governor, Babangida Aliyu Muazu, who made this known at the flag-off ceremony of the 4th Round of the Immunisation Plus Days (IPDS) at Chanchaga town, Bosso LGA, Niger State, stated that the ugly experience of polio cases in Nigeria has made the country the leading country with polio infection in the world.

In an address delivered by the deputy governor, Hon. Ahmed Musa Ibeto, the governor warned that with the outbreak of polio in neighbouring northern states, the time has come for everybody to work together in fighting the scourge.

"48 cases of WPV have been reported in 10 states of the country including Niger. Although Niger state has not recorded any case of polio in 3 years until the recent case discovered in a migrant nomad child from one of the neighbouring states, this discovery is a signal for the need to intensify surveillance for making sure we do not have a wide spread of the virus in the state. In this bid, the Niger state government has put in place measures to stop polio transmission and strive to make sure the state is declared polio free once more. Therefore, this is not the time to celebrate but to collectively work together in fighting the scourge of polio in the state. Let me also use this medium to call on all parents and caregivers to make sure that they complement the effort of government at eradicating polio in the state by bringing out their children under the age of 5 for immunisation against polio," he said.

[The strategy for the fight against polio in Nigeria should be reviewed in depth. Other means of communication should be considered to change the population's behavior to accept vaccinations. Vaccinators should also be aware of their role in the polio eradication effort and how their role is to ensure that all children targeted to be vaccinated are vaccinated during the vaccination campaigns.

Too few children have received sufficient doses of vaccine to wipe out polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan, 2 of only 3 countries in the world where endemic polio has yet to be eliminated, according to new research published Online First in The Lancet. The findings suggest that the newly introduced bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has the potential to eliminate polio in these countries if sufficient numbers of children could be reached by vaccination programmes.

"In 2011, in the worst affected regions of Pakistan and southern Afghanistan, an estimated 40 per cent of children under age 3 were unprotected against type 1, the predominant circulating wild poliovirus," explained Kathleen O'Reilly from Imperial College London, UK, who led the research. "One of the reasons for the low vaccination coverage is access to all populations due to insecurity, in particular in some parts of Southern Region in Afghanistan, and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in Pakistan. These regions are a potential reservoir for the virus into polio-free countries, jeopardising worldwide polio eradication."

Despite mass immunisation campaigns and the introduction of the more effective bivalent OPV in Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2009, incidence of virus type 1 has increased. In 2011, polio cases in Pakistan reached a decade high.

Using vaccination history data from almost 47 000 children with acute flaccid paralysis between [1 Jan 2001 and 31 Dec 2011], O'Reilly and colleagues estimated vaccination coverage, the protection offered by OPVs, and examined their association with incidence of poliomyelitis over the study period in 7 regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Their findings indicate that with each dose of the bivalent OPV received, there was a greater than 23 per cent chance of being protected against type 1 poliomyelitis, compared with about a 35 per cent chance with the monovalent OPV, and around a 13 per cent chance with the trivalent OPV.

But despite the bivalent and monovalent OPV proving very effective, limited access to children during recent vaccination campaigns has severely limited the effect of these vaccines, they say, "Substantial drops in vaccination coverage during 2006-11 in FATA, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan, and in southern Afghanistan, have resulted in lower vaccine-induced population immunity and resulted in an increase in the incidence of poliomyelitis during 2010-11."

In contrast, in regions outside of southern Afghanistan that are free from conflict, where both routine immunisation services and supplementary immunisation activities have been able to reach the majority of children, there has been a consistently high percentage of children receiving more than 3 doses of the OPV. These areas have experienced significant increases in population immunity during the study period.

The researchers conclude: "If vaccination coverage during the 2 trivalent and 4 bivalent OPV campaigns planned in Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2012 could be increased to at least 80 per cent, and if persistently missed children could be reached by the programme, the proportion of unprotected children would decrease to less than 10 per cent, and eradication would become feasible."

Philip Minor from the Health Protection Agency in the UK says: "These results provide an example of the need to tailor immunisation programmes to epidemiological circumstances, particularly where the goal is eradication."

[As can be seen from the Polio Eradication Initiative update statistics, this year (2012) has seen wild poliovirus (WPV) activity almost exclusively in the 3 remaining countries endemic for WPV -- Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The only other documented WPV activity was seen in Chad, where there were 4 WPV type 1 cases reported, with the most recent date of onset being 11 May 2012.

The obvious concerns raised in the 2 newswire updates covering the 3 known WPV endemic countries relate to the difficulties in achieving optimal coverages with the oral polio vaccine (OPV) in selected designated high risk areas within each of these countries. In Pakistan and Nigeria, there is documented refusal to vaccinate by the population due to rumors circulating in these areas that the vaccine is intentionally tainted by the West. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, civil unrest in selected areas has also contributed to the reduced vaccination coverages. As has been seen in the past, with continued circulation of the WPV in endemic countries, reintroduction of the WPV to countries that have previously interrupted its transmission but have not been able to sustain high vaccination coverages on a more "routine" basis is a real threat.
