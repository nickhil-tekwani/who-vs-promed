1. Japan's MAFF reports the 5th classical swine fever (CSF) farm outbreak for August 2019, bringing the country's total to 39 farms since the virus re-emerged -- after an absence of 26 years -- just shy of a year ago. While Gifu Prefecture remains the epicenter of this outbreak, we've seen not only a geographic expansion, but an acceleration of outbreaks over the past few months.

2. It took Japan more than 5 months (164 days) to report their 1st 10 farm outbreaks, but we've seen that number nearly quadruple since mid-February [2019], with 29 new outbreaks over the past 191 days.

3. Summary of the wild boar surveillance (as of 14 Aug 2019):

-Gifu prefecture (since 13 Sep 2018). Tested (RT-PCR): 1914 wild boars (368 dead and 1546 captured), Positive: 841 (275 dead and 566 captured)
-Aichi prefecture (since 14 Sep 2018). Tested (RT-PCR): 797 wild boars (36 dead and 761 captured), Positive: 65 wild boars (16 dead and 49 captured)
-Nagano prefecture (since 14 Sep 2018). Tested (RT-PCR): 212 wild boars (89 dead and 123 captured), Positive: 59 (29 dead and 30 captured)
-Mie prefecture (since 14 Sep 2018). Tested (RT-PCR): 131 wild boars (15 dead and 116 captured), Positive: 4 (0 dead and 4 captured)
-Fukui prefecture (since 14 Sep 2018). Tested (RT-PCR): 39 wild boars (5 dead and 34 captured), Positive: 7 (0 dead and 7 captured)
-Toyama prefecture (since 14 Sep 2018). Tested (RT-PCR): 29 wild boars (9 dead and 20 captured), Positive: 4 (3 dead and 1 captured)
-Other 37 prefectures (since 14 Sep 2018). Tested (RT-PCR): 352 wild boars (265 dead and 87 captured), Positive: 0

Japan's most recent (No. 34) follow-up report of the CSF event was submitted to the OIE on 18 Aug 2019, covering 71 new outbreaks, most of which were in wild boar (see, with interactive map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=31405).

OIE's summary of the event, as of 18 Aug 2019, follows.
Total outbreaks = 961 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 127 335 / 217 / 38 / 113 466 / 0
Wild boar / 967 / 321 / 646 / 0

The outbreak reportedly started on 3 Sep 2018 when fattening pigs were found dead in Gifu and reported to the local authorities by a veterinarian. On 9 Sep 2018, sequencing analysis of the virus RNA was completed, and the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) confirmed CSF, excluding the feared possibility of African swine fever (ASF). Based upon genotyping, the source of infection was found likely to be China; the route of introduction has not been established. From the onset of the event, wild boars were found infected in the same region and were suspected to play a significant, though not exclusive, role in the further spread of the virus.

The CSF event in Japan may be viewed as a drill for an unfortunate future introduction of ASF virus, most likely by contaminated pork products, and indicative of the possible role of wild boar in its epidemiology. Swill feeding is not widely used in Japan, while its use is liable to heat treatment. Japan has applied severe measures in air and seaports to prevent the ASF virus -- currently circulating throughout China, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos -- from being introduced by passengers. A recent incident demonstrating this situation was reported in 20190807.6611268.

Since March 2019, oral vaccination of wild boars, which have become the CSF virus reservoir in Japan, is being applied in affected areas. Unfortunately, no vaccine is yet available against ASF. - Mod.AS
