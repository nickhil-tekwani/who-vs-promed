[One new state and 35 new cases were added since the previous Epidemiological Report. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.

Once again, Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi is thanked for sending in the above Epidemiological Report.
