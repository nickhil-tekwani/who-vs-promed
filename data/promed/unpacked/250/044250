Experts seek cause of death for local ducks
-----------------------------------------------
The N.C. Department of Agriculture still doesn't
know exactly what killed several ducks and left
others sick earlier this week in downtown
Swansboro. But it's definitely not bird flu,
state officials said Thursday [27 Jul 2006].
Representatives from the Department of
Agriculture were in Swansboro Wednesday
collecting samples from sick Muscovy ducks. A
necropsy -- an animal autopsy -- was also done on
one of the dead birds, but the cause of death
isn't known yet, said Brian Long, spokesman for
the Department of Agriculture. "We are still
working on it," Long said. "We haven't turned up
any cause yet. ï¿½ It could take several days."
State officials are running a variety of tests --
everything from toxicology to bacterial tests --
in an attempt to rule things out. "As our state
veterinarian says, when you are doing these types
of diagnostic tests, sometimes you can get a
really clear-cut answer, and sometimes you end up
amassing a lot of information that leads you to
make certain conclusions," Long said.
The ducks that hang around the Swansboro
waterfront and seemed to be healthy until
recently could have come into contact with any
number of things that caused the deaths, Long said.
One of the 2 sick ducks that was rescued from
downtown Swansboro Tuesday [25 Jul 2006] is going
downhill, said Toni O'Neil, a wildlife
rehabilitator at Possumwood Acres Wildlife
Sanctuary in Hubert who is caring for them. "She
probably won't make it through the night," O'Neil
said. "The other one has gotten stronger and is
now standing. I'm hoping that this one will make
it." If the 2 female Moscovies [Muscovy ducks]
survive, O'Neil said, they won't be going back to
downtown Swansboro, at least not until the state
determines what's causing the deaths.
O'Neil received several phone calls Thursday [27
Jul 2006] from folks who live in the area and are
concerned about the ducks. "Some of these people
take their ducks very seriously and don't want to see them go," O'Neil said.
Swansboro police checked the area behind Through
the Looking Glass, a gift shop on the corner of
Front and Church streets in the historic
district, Thursday [27 Jul 2006] morning to see
whether more ducks turned up sick or dead. At
least 10 dead and 10 sick ducks were found in
that area Tuesday [25 Jul 2006]. "We found no
additional deceased or apparently ill ducks,"
said Swansboro Police Chief Ed Parrish. "We will
continue to do that at least until we receive
results back from the state lab telling us the
cause. ... We understand the public is concerned as we are also concerned."
It's rare to have a day without a lot of ducks,
but Virgo, who lives several blocks away from the
area where the dead ducks were found, couldn't
find many Thursday [27 Jul 2006] afternoon.
Until the Department of Agriculture finishes its
testing, O'Neil is doing her best to keep the 2
ducks she has isolated from the rest of the
wildlife in her care. She is also careful to wash
her hands and not let others near them. "We need
to know what it is," O'Neil said. "At what level
do we need to worry about this?"
It's a situation that has piqued the interest of
Louis Wise who lives near Angola Crossroads in
Onslow County. Wise used to feed cracked corn to
several ducks on his property until about 3 years
ago. At the time, his yard was infiltrated with
ants and he put granular ant poison down on the
ant hills. "A little while later, I saw that the
ducks were acting weird and realized they were
actually eating the poison like it was the
chicken feed I normally put down," he said. The
ducks started shaking. Several couldn't walk.
Three died immediately and another after several
hours. He was able to save a goose, which is
still living, and a duck. "They will eat that
poison as we tragically found out," Wise said."
... It could be totally off base as to what
happened to those ducks in Swansboro, but it's
something people need to watch out for."

[The article does not mention whether the local
people feed the ducks. Moldy corn or bread could
have caused illness in the birds.
_Haemoproteus_ has been known to infect other
birds without producing clinical illness in the
host, but killing Muscovy ducks.
There are both low pathogenic and high pathogenic
strains of avian influenza. It is unlikely to be
avian influenza, but it cannot be ruled out at this point.
We look forward to an authoritative answer with
regard to the cause of the deaths of the ducks. - Mod.TG]
