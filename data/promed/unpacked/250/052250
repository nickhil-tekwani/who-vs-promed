On [4 Nov 2018] in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of EMERGENCY's Maternity Hospital in Panjshir, Anabah, an outbreak of an unknown and as yet not determined origin, was registered.

A total of 12 newborns, who were already in a critical condition and on antibiotic therapy, passed away due to what presented itself as sepsis.

EMERGENCY immediately informed the health authorities regarding the ongoing outbreak and involved an external private laboratory in Kabul to carry out microbiological tests. EMERGENCY will communicate the results as soon as they are available. Until the causes are fully clarified, the criteria for admission in the Maternity Centre have been reduced solely to life saving treatments.

EMERGENCY's staff have immediately applied measures to contain the outbreak and treat the affected patients, and we can exclude any medical negligence in what has happened. These are the measures that have immediately been adopted in the hospital to prevent the spread of the outbreak:
- All staff movements were restricted to avoid any possible spread of contamination;
- No new admissions were allowed in the NICU;
- Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and sepsis treatment protocol began for all neonates;
- As further deliveries were ongoing in the Maternity Centre, a new ward was set up for treatment of neonates, with reinforced hygienic measures;
- All cleaning and hygienic protocols were reinforced across the entire hospital;

Emergency can testify that every medical professional, both local and international, did all they could do to the best of their capabilities to save each and every life in the hospital.

The medical coordinator of the Maternity Centre is in constant contact with Panjshir Provincial Health Directory, Anabah District Office and Anabah NDS office, and willing to collaborate with all authorities, as we have done since 2003 when the centre was opened. Over these years, the Maternity Centre - that offers gynaecological, obstetric and neonatal assistance to the population of the Panjshir Valley, and the provinces of Parwan, Kapisa and Kabul - has provided treatment and healthcare to over 300 000 mothers and newborns.

In the first 9 months of 2018, 6535 babies were treated in the centre, 6368 born in the centre and 145 outborn babies, with half the mortality rate of the rate registered across the country. This proves the high quality of the treatment provided and the full dedication of all staff working in the centre.

EMERGENCY is close to the families and their communities in this moment for their painful losses and confirms its commitment to clarify as soon as possible the causes of these deaths.

[Sepsis is a life-threatening complication of an infection, which results from release into the bloodstream of a cascade of inflammatory mediators in response to the pathogen. This inflammatory cascade can overwhelm the function of multiple organ systems, causing them to fail. Initial symptoms of sepsis include fever, and rapid respiratory and heart rates. If sepsis progresses to septic shock, blood pressure drops dramatically and does not adequately respond to fluid replacement, which may lead to death. However, in neonates, unlike in older individuals, early signs of sepsis are frequently nonspecific and subtle. Early treatment of sepsis, usually with antibiotics and large amounts of intravenous fluids, improves chances for survival.

Neonatal sepsis may be categorized as early-onset (within the 1st 72h after delivery) or late-onset (within 4-90 days after delivery). Early-onset sepsis is associated with acquisition of microorganisms from the mother, such as Group B _Streptococcus_ (GBS). Late-onset sepsis is usually due to microorganisms acquired from the hospital environment and the pathogens include Gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., _E coli_ and _Klebsiella_), _Pseudomonas_, or _Acinetobacter_, Gram-positive bacteria such as coagulase-negative staphylococci or _Staphylococcus aureus_, and fungi such as _Candida_.

Sources for the infection have included contaminated hospital equipment such as indwelling vascular, urinary or endotracheal catheters, or contaminated intravenous or enteral solutions. Premature and ill infants are more susceptible to sepsis.

EMERGENCY opened a Maternity Centre in Anabah, Afghanistan, in 2003 to provide free-of-charge antenatal, gynecological, obstetric, and neonatal care to the population of the Panjshir Valley and the surrounding provinces; as many as 17 babies are born every day at the Maternity Centre and 170 on average are admitted to its neonatal ICU each month (https://www.Emergencybe.org/where-we-work/afghanistan/anabah-maternity-centre/). Anaba District is in Panjshir Province, which is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the northeastern part of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panjshir_Province).

More information on the outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
