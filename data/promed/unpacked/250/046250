[1] Africa (Congo DR): declaration of end of measles epidemic

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Tuesday [25 Aug 2020] declared the end of a 25-month outbreak of measles that claimed the lives of more than 7000 children aged under 5. The outbreak was countered by vaccination on a massive scale, in which millions of children and infants were immunised.

"For the past month, we are able to say that this epidemic has been eliminated from across our territory," health minister Eteni Longondo told a press conference. "We can say that measles (in the DRC) no longer exists."

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that attacks mainly children. The most serious complications include blindness, brain swelling, diarrhoea, and severe respiratory infections. Once common, the disease has been rolled back around the world thanks to a cheap and effective vaccine, but low rates of immunisation among a community can cause infection to spread quickly.

"The measles epidemic was unfolding at a low level but was the deadliest. It carried off more than 7000 of our children," Longondo said. Routine vaccinations will continue in order to prevent the virus from bouncing back, he added.

The 1st cases of measles in the latest outbreak were recorded in June 2018. As of January this year [2020], the World Health Organization had recorded more than 335 000 suspected cases of the disease, of which 6362 were fatal. By way of comparison, the DRC -- a vast country the size of continental western Europe -- has recorded 9891 cases of coronavirus, of which 251 were fatal. An outbreak of Ebola in the east of the country, which was declared over on 25 Jun [2020] after nearly 2 years, killed 2287 people.

[2] Niger: climatic factors

Rainfall and temperature drive agricultural activity, which, in turn, influences patterns of measles outbreaks in the West African nation of Niger, according to an international team of researchers. The findings may be useful for improving vaccine coverage for seasonally mobile populations within Niger and other countries.

"Measles is a major cause of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about 62 000 deaths in the region in 2017," said Alexandre Blake, graduate student in biology, Penn State [University]. "Yet current immunization strategies achieve low coverage, in part because they were designed for higher-income countries where children are vaccinated prior to attending school, instead of for highly mobile populations where the median infection age is below school age."

The researchers analyzed weekly reported measles cases at the district level in Niger from 1995-2004, as well as weekly cumulative rainfall and average temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Next, they used wavelet analysis, a mathematical tool for uncovering temporal patterns hidden in large amounts of data, and regression, a statistical tool, to investigate the associations between the measles cases and the environmental data. Their findings appear in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

The team discovered a strong and consistent annual pattern of measles outbreaks that was associated with rainfall. Specifically, they found that the rainy season was associated with a lower risk of measles case reporting, whereas measles cases were [more numerous] during the dry season.

"The timing of the beginning of the measles season is consistent with a phase of annual agricultural labor migrations, when people move from rural areas to urban areas," said Blake. "Vaccination strategies that target migrating populations at this point in the season could be very powerful to break the annual pattern of outbreaks."

The researchers also observed a 2nd, weaker and more inconsistent pattern of outbreaks occurring every 2-3 years. "This 2nd outbreak pattern tells us that other mechanisms are at play," said Nita Bharti, assistant professor of biology. "So even if we could vaccinate everybody before the annual agricultural migration event, there would still be measles cases that are related to other factors."

Blake noted that some of those factors could be inequalities in access to care and movement between adjacent countries, such as Nigeria, where vaccine coverage is also low. "Niger and Northern Nigeria share languages, culture, and economic activities, and as a result, there is a lot of human movement across the border," he said. "But they do not have synchronous measles vaccination efforts, which likely permits the reintroduction of the virus on both sides."

The team concluded that targeting seasonally mobile populations for immunizations could reduce the strong seasonal pattern of outbreaks in Niger and across similar settings. "Human health and the environment are often stitched together with human behavior," said Bharti. "Understanding the nature of those relationships in sub-Saharan Africa will provide valuable insights on how to tailor interventions in this setting."

[Another contributing factor in the decrease in measles reported during the rainy season may be the impact of humidity on airborne virus, where the virus cannot linger in the airstream as long as when the air is dry, but rather is brought down to ground level where it wouldn't infect as many naive individuals. - Mod.LK]

[3] Immune suppression

Many of the deaths attributable to measles virus are caused by secondary infections because the virus infects and functionally impairs immune cells. Whether measles infection causes long-term damage to immune memory has been unclear. This question has become increasingly important given the resurgence in measles epidemics worldwide. Using a blood test called VirScan, Mina et al. comprehensively analyzed the antibody repertoire in children before and after natural infection with measles virus as well as in children before and after measles vaccination. They found that measles infection can greatly diminish previously acquired immune memory, potentially leaving individuals at risk for infection by other pathogens. These adverse effects on the immune system were not seen in vaccinated children.

[The study notes that "epidemiological evidence has associated MV [measles virus] infections with increases in morbidity and mortality for as long as 5 years (15, 23) and suggests that in the pre-vaccine era, MV may have been associated with up to 50% of all childhood deaths from infectious diseases, mostly from non-MV infections (15)." [See publication for references]

Michael Mina and colleagues at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, further determined that it takes 2-3 years post-measles infection for protective immune memory to be restored. The average duration of measles-induced immune amnesia was 27 months in US, UK, and Denmark. Corresponding evidence indicates that it may take up to 5 years for children to develop healthy immune systems even in the absence of the immune-suppressing effects of MV infection. If MV infection essentially resets a child's developing immunity to that of a newborn, re-vaccination or exposure to all previously encountered microbes will be required in order to rebuild proper immune function (https://asm.org/Articles/2019/May/Measles-and-Immune-Amnesia).

Measles immune suppression is a serious sequela of natural infection with measles virus, not observed in vaccinated individuals. But the increase in severity of COVID-19 in older individuals who probably never were vaccinated against measles and instead were infected naturally (the vaccine was first administered in 1968, then combined with mumps and rubella in 1971) is unlikely to be related to the immune suppression of measles virus (MV) causes because MV infection would have occurred many more than 5 years prior to COVID-19 infection. - Mod.LK
