[Because of ongoing cases of sylvan (jungle)
yellow fever in South America, the following
report may be of interest to ProMED-mail
subscribers. - Mod.TY]

1. Current status of yellow fever (YF) in the region
----------------------------------------------------
Argentina and Brazil
--------------------
Since October 2008, monkey deaths (epizootics)
have been observed in southern Brazil; and
starting in November of the same year, in
northeastern Argentina. The affected area
includes municipalities in the state of Rio
Grande do Sul in Brazil, and localities in the
provinces of Misiones and Corrientes in
Argentina, adjacent to Rio Grande do Sul.

In Brazil, up to 17 Mar 2009, the state of Rio
Grande do Sul has reported 299 monkey deaths in
103 municipalities. Of these, 30 had
laboratory-confirmed yellow fever epizootics; and
19, a yellow fever epizootic confirmed by
epidemiological link. Some of these epizootics
were reported in municipalities located outside
of the area previously considered at risk.

In Argentina, no new monkey deaths have been
reported since our last update of 10 Feb 2009.
The number of monkey deaths reported since
October 2008 continues to stand at 25, with 19 in
the province of Misiones and 6 in the province of
Corrientes, with yellow fever confirmed in 12
such deaths in Misiones and 1 in Corrientes.

Regarding human yellow fever cases, Brazil has
reported cases in the states of Rio Grande do Sul
and Sao Paulo. In Rio Grande do Sul, up to 17 Mar
2009, 14 suspected cases of jungle yellow fever
(JYF) have been reported, of which 8 have been
confirmed and 5 have been fatal. Among the
confirmed cases, 6 involved males and 2 females.
Age varied from 14 to 41 years. None of them had
any previous history of vaccination. The date of
onset of symptoms of the last reported case was
26 Jan 2009.

In the state of Sao Paulo, up to 25 Mar 2009, 11
suspected cases of JYF were reported, of which 9
were confirmed and 3 resulted in fatalities.
Among the confirmed cases, 6 involved males and
3 females. Age varied from 14 to 59 years. None
of them had any previous history of vaccination
and the probable site was in a rural or jungle
setting. The date of onset of symptoms of the
last reported case was 20 Mar 2009.

In Argentina, the figure stands at 2 reported
cases, 1 laboratory confirmed and the other with
a compatible clinical profile and epidemiological
link -- both with the probable site of infection
in the vicinity of Fachinal, province of
Misiones. The latest outbreaks of jungle yellow
fever reported both in Rio Grande do Sul
and in Corrientes were in 1966 [43 years ago].

Trinidad and Tobago
--------------------
Since our last update of 30 Jan [2009], no new
yellow fever epizootics have been reported, nor
have any human cases. The places where the last
reported and confirmed yellow fever epizootic
occurred were in the districts of Mayaro and
Nariva, respectively located in southern and
southeastern Trinidad.

Venezuela
---------
During epidemiological weeks (EWs) 1 through 6,
2009, monkey deaths were reported in the
municipality of Zamora in the state of Aragua;
and during EWs 1 and 2, in the municipalities of
Roscio and Ortiz in the state of Guarico.
Regarding human yellow fever cases, up to EW 6 a
total of 86 samples were analyzed as a result of
the surveillance of febrile icteric/hemorrhagic
syndrome, all of which turned out to be negative
for yellow fever. The last human case reported in
the country was in 2005.

Colombia
--------
One new case was reported in EW 2, for a new
total of 5 yellow fever cases reported in 2009
(with 2 deaths). Of the confirmed cases, 4 showed
a probable infection site in the municipality of
La Macarena, and 1 in the municipality of Puerto
Concordia, both located in the department of
Meta; 3 of these had no previous history of
yellow fever vaccination, and in one case the
history of yellow fever vaccination is unknown.
The date of initial onset of symptoms of the last
reported case was 17 Jan 2009. The cases were
reported in an area recognized as endemic, and it
is considered that the number of cases observed
falls within the expected pattern of cases in the
country.

Peru
----
Up to EW 3, 2 suspected cases of JYF were
reported: 1 in the department of Loreto and the
other in the department of San Martin. The latter
case has been laboratory confirmed. The 2 cases
were reported in an area where cases have been
known to occur.

Paraguay
--------
In epidemiological week 5, one rumor of monkey
death was reported in the Limoy Biological
Reserve, department of Alto Parana, which is
located in the eastern part of the country (on
the Brazilian border), which was unverifiable.

2. Response
-----------
The countries are continuing to take action to
prevent the occurrence of more human cases by
strengthening epidemiological surveillance, which
includes active case-finding of febrile,
jaundiced, and ictero-hemorrhagic febrile fever
cases. In addition, investigation of any rumors
of monkey deaths has been intensified. At the
same time, vaccination coverage of the population
living in affected areas has been increased. The
indication to vaccinate travelers to these areas
has also been reinforced. Moreover, in order to
prevent urban transmission by _Aedes aegypti_,
vector control activities have been strengthened in towns.

3. Recommendations: previous recommendations are being reiterated
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccination against yellow fever
--------------------------------
One of the most important preventive mechanisms
for yellow fever is vaccination. However, when
applying it, it is important to take into
consideration the priority of its use as well as
its indications and counter-indications. PAHO
recommends the rational use of vaccines, with
priority given to the population living in the
area at risk and travelers who are going there.
Special attention should be paid to vaccinating
persons living in at-risk areas (where epizootics
or cases have been identified), as well as
persons who -- though residing in low-risk areas
(where vaccination coverage is generally low) --
are involved in occupational or recreational
activities in risk areas. In addition, it is
worth reiterating that vaccination against yellow
fever should not be administered to people with
acute febrile illness, those with
hypersensitivity to eggs and their derivatives,
or people who have a disease adversely affecting
their immune system or who are undergoing
treatment for it.

Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
The early detection of outbreaks allows for the
effective implementation of control measures. In
order to achieve this, it is important to
emphasize the utilization of all surveillance
mechanisms for yellow fever in both humans and
primates: surveillance of compatible clinical
cases, surveillance of febrile icteric syndromes,
surveillance of epizootics, intensifying
surveillance of _A. aegypti_ infestation indexes
in urban areas near the focus, monitoring
vaccination coverage, and surveillance of
post-vaccination events supposedly attributable
to vaccination against yellow fever in affected
or adjacent areas.

Vector control
--------------
Yellow fever transmission in the Americas
continues to originate in the jungle. However, in
order to avoid the reurbanization of this disease
-- of which a confirmed outbreak already occurred
in early 2008 and was successfully controlled --
the importance of _A. aegypti_ control measures
must be emphasized, mainly in cities and
localities adjacent to affected areas. These
measures also help prevent dengue outbreaks.

Risk communication
------------------
Given the intense spread of the yellow fever
virus that has been observed in the Region, the
countries should include in their activities
clear, educational communication guidelines on
rational vaccine usage, the population to be
vaccinated, personal protective measures, the
avoidance of activities in jungle areas, and
vector control measures.

[It is noteworthy that 7 South American countries have reported YF so
far this year (2009). The risk is growing that rural cases will be
hospitalized in nearby towns and infect the urban vector mosquito,
starting an epidemic. - Mod.JW]
