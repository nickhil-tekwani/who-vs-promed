Control rust to protect foliage
-------------------------------
Sugar beet growers who aim to lift their crops after the 1st week of
November [2009] can help to reduce the risk of frost damage by
ensuring their crop is free from rust. But action may be needed sooner
than usual. Signs of the disease are already starting to show due to
the warm and damp weather over the past couple of weeks, says Mark
Stevens of Broom's Barn. "Rust usually appears in late August or early
September, but recent weather has brought many foliar diseases
forward," he says.

Trials conducted last year [2008] at Broom's Barn found that of all
the foliar diseases, rust had the greatest effect on the
susceptibility of beet to subsequent frost damage, while presence or
absence of powdery mildew was shown to have little or no impact.

"The run of frosts we had between October and December in 2008 caused
plants infected by rust to sustain high levels of defoliation; the
higher the level of infection, the greater the damage became," says Dr
Stevens. Once significant defoliation had occurred, the crown was
exposed and the root was vulnerable to frost damage. Lessening the
effects of frosts is therefore essential for any grower storing crops
in the ground later in the season. "If beet is going to be lifted
late, good rust control must be achieved," says Dr Stevens.

"Growers should also be looking out for powdery mildew, cercospora,
and ramularia and adjusting their fungicide strategy to suit. It is
important to keep a close eye on the crop and take appropriate action
as diseases start to develop."

[Sugar beet rust is caused by the fungus _Uromyces beticola_
(previously _Uromyces betae_). It affects _Beta vulgaris_ and
subspecies including sugar beet, beetroot, spinach beet, mangolds,
wild beet as well as some other species in the genus (_Beta_ species
taxonomy remains to be clarified, see link below).

Symptoms include small brown pustules on leaves, petioles, and seed
stalks which in susceptible varieties spread quickly. Older leaves
wilt and die prematurely, younger leaves become crumpled, drooping,
and yellow. The disease can quickly decimate green leaf area and thus
photosynthetic potential, and badly rusted plants finally collapse.
There is little information on direct crop losses, but the secondary
effect due to defoliation reported above is an important aspect.

The fungus overwinters on seed crops and beet plants left behind in
the field. Spores are spread by wind, water, plant debris and
mechanical means and may adhere to seed clusters. A spore viability of
2 years in store houses has been reported. Wide variation in rust
resistance exists in sugar beet varieties, but some varieties widely
used in Europe are amongst the more susceptible ones. Disease
management relies usually on preventative fungicide applications.

The other sugar beet fungi referred to above are leaf spot diseases
caused by _Ramularia beticola_ and _Cercospora beticola_, and powdery
mildew caused by _Erysiphe betae_. For more information see previous
