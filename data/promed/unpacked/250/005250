Canadian bird flu case NOT highly pathogenic H5N1
OTTAWA, (Reuters) - A case of bird flu in the eastern Canadian province of
Prince Edward Island was not the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, a Canadian
source said on Tuesday.
"The news is good. The dead bird was not carrying the highly pathogenic
strain of H5N1," the source told Reuters, declining to say exactly what the
dead bird had been suffering from.

[There are many illness that can kill a bird, including Low pathogenic
avian influenza, as well as a host of others. I think this case illustrates
the ultrasensitivity of awareness that we all have with regard to ill birds.
We look forward to when CFIA will provide us with the exact cause of the
birds demise. Mod.TG]
