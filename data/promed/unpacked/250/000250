SARDI issues net blotch alert
-----------------------------
Farmers are being urged to manage their barley wisely this season
[2010], with variation in the net form of net blotch on the rise.
Hugh Wallwork, South Australian Research & Development Institute
[SARDI], says the variation is making resistance ratings for
varieties more complicated.

"In 2009, we saw a dramatic change in Maritime (variety)," he said. A
Maritime-virulent strain hit Eyre Peninsula causing significant
damage to crops, and was also a problem on lower Yorke Peninsula.
There was increased virulence on Keel, and this virulence was now
common through the Mid North and Lower North. A new pathotype was
collected at Ungarra, which showed increased virulence on Fleet,
Keel, and Commander. There was a further pathotype picked up at
Bordertown, with increased virulence on Keel and Schooner.

Considering the high level of stubble-borne inoculum that would be
present this year [2010], Dr Wallwork said seed treatments for the
blotch were probably not worthwhile. Growers could take steps to
minimise disease issues. "Avoid sowing barley on barley, and sowing
susceptible varieties close to infected stubbles, because it will
move quickly. Reduce the area sown to susceptible varieties, and use
high rates of fungicide earlier."

[Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and
affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). The disease
causes necrotic areas on leaves leading to significant losses of up
to 20 percent to barley yield around the world. There are 2 types of
this fungus: the net type caused by _P. t._ f. _teres_, and the spot
type caused by _P. t._ f. _maculata_. The fungus survives between
seasons on barley residue, volunteer barley plants, some grasses, and
seed. Disease management includes cultural practices to remove
pathogen reservoirs, fungicide applications, use of clean seed, and
planting of resistant cultivars.

In 2008, a major outbreak of net blotch was reported from South
Australia's mid-north (ProMED-mail post 20080707.2057), and the
disease was considered an emerging threat to barley producers in
southern Australia. The emergence of multiple new pathogen strains
reported above demonstrates a high genetic variability of the net
type pathogen in this environment and poses a serious risk to the
industry.
