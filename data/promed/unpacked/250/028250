The source of infection of the national outbreak with _Yersinia enterocolitica_ is probably a pre-cut lettuce product, according to the investigation of the outbreak.

The outbreak is considered over. Lettuce has a short shelf life, and the relevant lettuce products are probably no longer on the market, says senior researcher Umaer Naseer at the National Institute of Public Health.

The outbreak of _Yersinia enterocolitica_ O3 started in mid-November 2020. In total, as of 21 Dec 2020, there are 10 confirmed cases. Everyone became ill in the period from mid to late November 2020. The last person became ill on 26 Nov 2020. The persons live in Oslo (2), Viken (3), Innlandet (2), Vestland (2) and Telemark and Vestfold (1). They are all women aged 11-59 years.

The National Institute of Public Health's analysis of patient interviews shows that everyone stated that they had eaten a pre-cut salad product the week before illness.

In collaboration with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, we conducted interviews to map what the people had eaten before they became ill and have found that ready-cut lettuce stands out, says Umaer Naseer.

Salad products have also on previous occasions caused outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease in this country. In the spring of 2018 and 2020, outbreaks with _Yersinia enterocolitica_ were investigated, where ready-washed lettuce was the probable source of the outbreak.

_Yersinia enterocolitica_ O3 usually causes symptoms such as diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, nausea and possibly fever, which go away on their own. In rare cases, diarrhea can be long-lasting and severe.
