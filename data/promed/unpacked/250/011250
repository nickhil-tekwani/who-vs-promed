Dengue Fever Cases in Hawaii Now Total 59
-----------------------------------------
HONOLULU: Ten more people have received confirmation that they have dengue
fever virus, according to the state Department of Health. That brings the
total number of confirmed cases in Hawaii to 59. All confirmed cases have
been confined to Maui, Oahu and Kauai. The numbers of dengue fever Cases by
island are: Maui 49 (4 new cases), Oahu 6 (5 new cases) and Kauai 4 (2 new
cases). Health Director Bruce Anderson said that there are 2 suspected cases
based on preliminary tests. In addition, officials said that another 262
illnesses remain under investigation.
The Health Department is continuing an aggressive campaign of treating areas
with insecticide that are possibly infected by the mosquitoes believed to
carry the virus. Inspectors with the department's vector control division
have sprayed more than 900 areas.
Gov. Ben Cayetano, Anderson and chief epidemiologist Dr. Paul Effler are
scheduled to fly Thursday to Hana in East Maui, the area hardest hit by the
virus. More than 30 people near Hana are confirmed cases of the disease, and
other cases are believed to have originated in East Maui.
Among those taking part in the visit will be Sen. Kalani English,
D-Wailuku-Kahului-Upcountry Maui, who was one of the first people to be
stricken by dengue fever in August. He said that having the virus was 50
times worse than any flu or cold he ever had. English said that he will
propose legislation for an environmental SWAT team that would respond to
everything from dengue fever to alien species such as coqui frogs.
