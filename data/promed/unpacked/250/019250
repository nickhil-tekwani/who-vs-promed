Uganda has reported an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, FMD. The
outbreak of the cattle disease has been reported in Nakisunga and
Nyenga sub-counties of Mukono district, central Uganda.

According to Dr. Fred Mukulu, the director of production, it is the
1st time in 20 years that Mukono has registered an FMD outbreak. The
outbreak has led authorities to impose a ban on cattle movement. "To
avoid further spread of FMD, authorities in Mukono have suspended the
slaughter of livestock at the main abattoir in Kyetume", said Mukulu.

The directorate of production is partnering with the police and
sub-county chiefs to implement the ban. Mobile animal checkpoints
have also been erected across the district.

"We have also banned transportation of meat by public transport," Mukulu says.

Livingstone Zziwa, the Mukono vice-chairman, says veterinary doctors
are supposed to recommend and witness slaughter of cattle, but
sometimes they do not.

"All vehicles transporting cattle are supposed to have livestock
movement permits, but some transporters don't have them," he says.
"Such transporters will now be arrested."

Mukono's imposition of quarantine followed a recommendation by the
agriculture ministry. Movement of livestock, its products and
by-products from, to and within Nakisunga and Nyenga sub-counties and
Njeru town board is prohibited with immediate effect, says a ministry official.

"No slaughters are allowed in Njeru town board, Nyenga and Nakisunga
sub-counties in Mukono," says Dr. Rutebarika from the livestock
health and entomology department.

The quarantine has no time frame, and residents of the affected areas
will, in the meantime, do without beef and pork. They will rely on
other sources of proteins like beans and fish.

Mukono has also imposed restrictions on the movement of pigs. "They
(pigs) are more susceptible (to the FMD) than cattle," says Mukulu.
While no case of the disease has so far been reported in pigs, the
district has closed all pork joints in Nakisunga, Nyenga and Njeru
until the quarantine is lifted.

The 1st case of the disease was reported in June 2008; about 10
cattle have died of FMD in Mukono.

FMD does not affect humans when meat of an infected animal is eaten.

[The current newswire indicates the continued spread of the outbreak,
reported by ProMED-mail since the end of January 2008.

According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory (WRL) for FMD
at Pirbright, the disease is endemic in Uganda, with the following
serotypes identified (in brackets, year of last occurrence): O
(2007), A (2002), C (1971), SAT1 (1999), SAT2 (2002), SAT3 (1997;
only in African buffalo).

The WRL further states that "all 3 SAT types are probably endemic in
the African buffalo population."

Uganda submitted to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)
its 2 semi-annual reports for the year 2007; FMD was reportedly
present in the administrative units Arua, Kaberamaido and Kasese, but
no quantitative data were included.

Mukono is east of Kampala on the northern shore of Lake Victoria; see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/uganda_pol_2005.pdf>.

The last submission of a field-collected sample to the WRL-FMD took
place on 3 Jul 2008 (sampled from cattle on 24 Apr 2007). The results
of the sequencing of this strain, found to be topotype EA-2, are
included in the Molecular Epidemiology Report of 9 Aug 2007, available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2007/WRLFMD-2007-00021-Uganda-O.pdf>.

A response to our request for information on the serotype involved in
the current outbreak is pending. - Mod.AS]
