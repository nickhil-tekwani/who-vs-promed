Kevin Johnson was too quick to apologize. Ionizing radiation most
certainly affects proteins. The free radicals produced by ionizing
radiation will react with many sites in proteins. Nonetheless, ionizing
radiation may not be a useful way to "kill" prions because the dose
required may be high enough to cause extensive damage to other proteins in
the food, perhaps making it unpalatable or nutritionally deficient.
Research would be required to determine if ionizing radiation would be a
feasible control method for prion contamination.
