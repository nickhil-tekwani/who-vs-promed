[Further information on the circumstances of this case and the extent
of the patient's illness would be welcomed.

Avian influenza A/H9N2 virus has caused repeated human infections in
Asia since 1st recorded in 1998 (see ProMED-mail archived reports
below). Human infections have generally been mild. An infection of a
5-year-old child in Hong Kong in 2003 is described in detail by Butt
et al in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, November 2005, p.
5760-5767, Vol. 43, No. 11.

Furthermore, Matrosovichb, Kraussa and Webstera established that H9N2
influenza A viruses from poultry in Asia have human-virus-like
receptor specificity. Features of the surface glycoproteins of H9N2
viruses from Hong Kong suggested an enhanced propensity for
introduction into humans and emphasized the importance of poultry in
the zoonotic transmission of influenza viruses. (See: Virology, Volume
281, Issue 2, 15 Mar 2001, Pages 156-1620).
