E. COLI, OPEN FARM - UK (ENGLAND) (02)
**************************************

Interestingly, I happen to know personally the owner of the farm. He is
rather disturbed about the outbreak. Doubtless I could ask for further
details if anyone has good reason. Do not take my report as as totally
accurate in detail as I did not ask him to look up exact dates etc.
The farm has been open for a considerable number of years (circa 10) and
has a lot of facilities, children's zoo, cafeteria, lecture room etc. It
takes in many school visits annually. The owner is a thoughtful, honest,
well organised and intelligent (MA Cantab) person.
The first case of E. coli 157 was in the child of one of the staff, origin
unknown in March or April. This was followed by another case in a visitor
in Mid June and the final case (who is not at all well) in Late June/early
July. His guess (which sounds on the low side) of 10,000
children having visited during that period is interesting. If the farm was
the source of the cases, it is odd (given the high infectivity) there are
so few cases.
Samples of cow dung proved negative (there is a large milking herd on the
site), but goats (in the children's zoo) tested positive. He confirms that
the goats were regularly fed leftovers (of the children's food) by the
children.
In the case of sporadic outbreaks I really do have problems believing the
causes have properly been identified. Any contact with a farm is not proof
that 'farms' have caused the contamination, even though pathogens can be
isolated there. Pathogens can probably be isolated from the door handle of
the toilet, a neighbour's dog or hamster and a whole host of
other sources. In particular it would be helpful to know what bacterial
load is required to infect suitable animals rather than saying that 'we
found one E. coli 157 in some sausages that hadn't been eaten, so we have
found the source', I find this unconvincing.
