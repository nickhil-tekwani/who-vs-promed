I am forwarding the following note to you at the
request of Dr. Becky Brewer, Oklahoma State Veterinarian:
On Fri 27 Apr 2007 Oklahoma received confirmation
that we have one TB infected herd in Cimarron
County OK. The herd is a 1100 head beef herd that
was discovered following a slaughter surveillance
TB positive trace. One additional infected animal
was found on the whole herd test. That animal had
a Colorado ID tag. The rancher thinks he may have
owned that cow for 7 to 10 years. The Oklahoma
Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry
working with the office of the Oklahoma AVIC
[Area Veterinarian in Charge], will be testing
adjacent herds throughout the month of May [2007].

[Oklahoma has been classified as TB free.
Certainly the USDA will be watching to see if the
state has other cases which could cost the state its coveted free status.
The state will begin testing the herd and doing
the epidemiology of animals that have moved into
and out of the herd for the last several years. � Mod.TG]
