Citrus black spot was detected in some shipments of citrus fruit imported by the European Union from Tunisia. "[This] confirms all our worries about the spread of this devastating disease in the Mediterranean and we require the immediate block of imports from Africa. Over the past few years, we have asked the authorities to implement stricter checks," explains Giovanni Selvaggi, Consorzio Arancia Rossa di Sicilia IGP [Sicilian blood orange growers' association].

"We require the activation of the strict phytosanitary barriers envisaged within EU treaties and never implemented, to prevent the arrival of oranges not suitably checked." The 2018-2019 citrus campaign was affected by imports with no green passport. If the disease were to spread, it would cause irreparable damage to citrus production, the leading agricultural segment in southern Italy. [Farmers] therefore asked for imports from Tunisia to be blocked, alongside an increase in checks and a quick revision of Community regulations.

[Citrus black spot (CBS) caused by the fungus _Phyllosticta citricarpa_ (previously _Guignardia citricarpa_) is one of the most serious diseases of the crops in Asia and regions of the southern hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape, and colour, depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses since fruit may not show visible symptoms while on the tree. However, characteristic lesions may develop in storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause symptoms also exist. CBS causes significant losses due to premature fruit and leaf drop, as well as disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit. Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material (including nursery plants or scions with latent infections), and by mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the season and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties. All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents, except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitation, and pathogen exclusion.

The threat of CBS introduction has been an issue in Europe for several years. The disease has been included in the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). CBS has also been introduced into the USA by unknown means (2010; ProMED-mail post 20100412.1183), and this further illustrates the risk to northern hemisphere citrus industries. Once established in a region, eradication of a sporulating fungus such as _P. citricarpa_ is considered impossible.

The EU was alarmed by a large number of quarantine detections in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20131204.2090761) which implied that certification of disease freedom at point of origin was not working effectively. An import ban was considered to protect European citrus industries but, instead, stricter EU regulations were approved (see ProMED-mail post 20150714.3509850). The report above suggests that these measures are still not effective and that incursions in citrus producing areas of southern Europe remain a threat to the region.

A study published in 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simyco.2017.05.003) suggested that the CBS pathogen is already present in Europe. The findings were reviewed and considered unconvincing by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Preliminary surveys by National Plant Protection Organisations (NPPOs) have so far not confirmed CBS, but monitoring is still ongoing (for more information see links below).
