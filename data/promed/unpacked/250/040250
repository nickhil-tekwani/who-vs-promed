I know it is unlikely but, lest your readers read too much into your
account of The East African article and its references to an article in The
Lancet (Sall et al "Origin of 1997-98 Rift Valley fever outbreak in East
Africa", The Lancet, vol 352, pp1596-7, November 14 1998), I would like to
post some comments - perhaps for discussion.
It is gratifying to note that molecular epidemiology for RVF is
progressing. The Lancet paper provides useful information but it does not
provide sufficient information to draw conclusions about origins of, and
connections between, epidemics as implied. The paper states that the
authors have demonstrated three distinct lineages which represent
geographically separate populations over 50 years. However, the dendrogram
provided does not demonstrate such a clear picture. The Egyptian cluster
contains viruses which appear to be from [Egypt ... MHJ, Senegal and
Madagascar; the East and Central African cluster contains viruses from
Mauritania and Senegal [as well as the Central African Republic, Kenya, and
Madascar ... MHJ; and, the West African cluster contains viruses from
[Burkino Faso ... MHJ, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal (all from the period
1984-93). Thus, it seems to me that there is only one cluster demonstrated
- an African cluster. As RVF is limited to Africa this does [not? MHJ
appear to represent a major advance in epidemiology!
The paper makes other statements which I find difficult to accept e.g.
"Although environmental changes may cause the virus to emerge, its
biological features appear to be different with each outbreak and the
reasons for this are unknown." I am not aware that the biological features
have been demonstrated to differ significantly between outbreaks. In
contrast in Kenya and southern Africa the biological features appear to
have been remarkably constant over many years. I would suggest that any
differences which have been observed in severity of disease in humans
(incidence rate of haemorrhagic disease) and livestock (mortality rates
primarily) probably reflect farming systems/social organisation (e.g.
sedentary farming compared to extensive pastoral systems) and intercurrent
disease incidence rather than differences in viral characteristics.
The paper also puts forward the concept of spread of RVF as does your
edited quote from The East African newspaper. The comment that "Kenya's
outbreak ... later spread to Somalia and Tanzania" gives an impression of
RVF epidemiology which is by no means sure. Certainly RVF appeared to
spread to Egypt from the south in the 1970s but within eastern Africa I am
not sure that "spread", indicating translocation of vectors and/or virus at
the time of an epidemic, is the correct concept. It might be correct but I
am not aware of any evidence that this occurred in the most recent epidemic
in Eastern Africa. And can the present epidemic in Mauritania be said to be
spreading or is it emerging progressively over a broadening area?
The current evidence suggests that RVF virus in sub-Saharan Africa is
maintained in inter-epidemic periods primarily by transovarial transmission
in aedine mosquitoes. Aedine mosquitoes are thought to maintain a low level
of seasonal viral transmission to livestock, with epidemics triggered by
above-average rainfall that leads to a rapid increase in vector numbers.
Once infection has been amplified in livestock, secondary epidemic vectors
such as culicine and anopheline mosquitoes that breed in semi-permanent
pools of water can become involved in transmission.
>From late October 1997 to January 1998, torrential rains occurred in most
of eastern Africa resulting in the worst flooding in the region since 1961
to 1963. This included the northern part of Tanzania, northeastern Kenya,
southern Somalia and southeastern Ethiopia - areas in which RVF disease
and/or infection were detected in 1997/98. These are areas peripheral to
the disease's usual range in central Kenya where RVF infection and disease
have been encountered most frequently. The contiguous areas of NE Kenya
with Somalia have been found to be involved in Kenya epidemics in the past
depending on the extent of the rains; the last time was in 1961. Although
clinical RVF disease has not been recorded before in Somalia, antibodies
have been detected, perhaps, but not certainly given extensive livestock
movement, indicative of past infection in that country. Disease
surveillance is inadequate in these more remote, generally arid areas and
the determinants of RVF occurrence in them have been inadequately studied.
Thus, in my opinion, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether
the virus is able to persist through aedine mosquito/cattle cycling in
these areas, such as northeast Kenya, or whether it is periodically
introduced and takes off in epidemic form at times of particularly
favourable climatic conditions for vector multiplication. There is a
tendency for outbreaks to occur simultaneously across an extensive area in
adjacent countries. This is because climatic conditions that favour the
breeding of the mosquito vectors of RVF tend to occur over large areas and
it might indicate that the virus does in fact persist in certain
favourable, if very restricted, habitats.
If we are to predict and prevent the generation and evolution of the
epidemics of RVF which regularly devastate communities in Africa we need to
bear in mind the limits of our understanding at present and they are
considerable. To answer the questions requires a devoted programme of
surveillance for RVF infection and disease.
