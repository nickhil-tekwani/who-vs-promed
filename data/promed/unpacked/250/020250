The number of instances of [viral - Mod. LL] hepatitis in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) is growing, and there are fears there may be more cases going undiagnosed due to the stigma surrounding the infections. There was a 25 percent increase in the number of people diagnosed with hepatitis C in the ACT in 2013 and a 5 percent increase in hepatitis B cases. The blood-borne viruses cause inflammation of the liver, and can be spread through the sharing of drug-taking equipment, like unsterilized syringes or needles. Left untreated, serious damage to the liver can result, which can be fatal.

Hepatitis B / 106 / 111
Hepatitis C / 147 / 184

John Didlick from Hepatitis ACT said there are an estimated 8000 people in the ACT living with viral hepatitis, including 4000 with hepatitis C.

"We estimate that half are already in what we call the 'liver danger zone'," he said. "That's an age point of 40 years of age, at which there's a an increase of liver cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer and early death."

Mr Didlick said there should be greater awareness of the vaccines for hepatitis A and B, and testing for hepatitis needed to be ramped up. "A diagnosis of hepatitis C, or any other blood-borne virus, can lead to better management, and also the prevention of onward transmission."But Mr Didlick said those at risk of hepatitis often do not seek treatment, due to the stigma surrounding the viruses in the community.

"People living with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are often silenced both by themselves, and by external factors," he said. "We need governments and key public health officials to choose to address the invisibility of viral hepatitis. Not only will that shine a light on a neglected epidemic but it will also encourage affected communities to speak out and seek help."

He said the most marginalised parts of the community were at the greatest risk of contracting the virus. "The most at risk for hepatitis C are people who inject drugs, have a history of injecting drugs, also people in our prison system."

Mr Didlick also called on the Federal Government to give patients better access to the latest treatments for the virus. "There are advanced new hepatitis C medicines in use in other parts of the world right now that are not available here," he said. "We live in a first world country, with a first world health system, so this is an unacceptable situation."

[The increase in the absolute numbers of newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis B and C in the Capital Territory does not necessarily reflect an increase in newly infected individuals. Both of these hepatitis viruses can cause chronic infection and the newly diagnosed cases may represent cases that have been infected for years but not diagnosed before. This is particularly the case for viral hepatitis type C which is uncommonly diagnosed in the early stage since it is rarely associated with acute jaundice.

The posting also reflects the current issues relating to the new treatment regimens for hepatitis C which are quite expensive but very effective. The prevention of progressive liver inflammation with the development of liver cirrhosis and its complications including liver cancer, however, can make even a very expensive therapy cost effective. - Mod.

[Another important advantage of effective therapies for hepatitis C, is "treatment as prevention" in that elimination of hepatitis C in one individual prevents its onward transmission. - Mod.LM
