Two cases of endemic typhus [caused by _Rickettsia typhi_] have been reported
in Los Angeles County, public health officials said Friday. The ailment was
found in two otherwise healthy young males from the Pasadena area. Both
recovered. These are the first cases this year.
Typhus is characterized by a fever, headache, muscle aches and rash, and it
is treatable with antibiotics. There have been 70 cases reported county-wide
since 1993, with most occurring in the summer and transmitted to humans by
fleas from rats or opossums.
Residents can help prevent disease transmission by trimming ivy, ground cover
and other vegetation, which harbors rodents; and pet owners should keep
domestic animals free of fleas and avoid leaving uneaten pet food where it
can attract wild animals.
For information regarding medical symptoms or treatment contact the county
Disease Control Unit at (213) 240-7941.
[Though there are several new flea control products available for pets, my
experience as a private practitioner suggests that many people do not do an
adequate job at controlling fleas on their pets! Also ivy is a common plant
used extensively all over the various cities within Los Angeles and other
coastal areas.-- pc]

Epidemic typhus is transmitted by body lice and involves a different agent
(_Rickettsia prowazeki_).
Health officials said two men in their 20s, living in Pasadena and South
Pasadena, came down last month with the illness, whose symptoms include
severe headaches, high fever, muscle aches and rash. Both men were treated
with antibiotics and recovered.
There were 23 cases of endemic typhus reported in Los Angeles County last
year and 70 since 1993, an increase over previous years. It is unknown
whether the rise was a result of more instances of the illness or better
reporting.
