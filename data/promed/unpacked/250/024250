From 2007 to 2012, surveys have been conducted in 16 states in India to confirm the distribution of huanglongbing (associated with _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus - EPPO A1 List) with molecular methods.

All commercially important citrus species (_Citrus aurantifolia_, _C. grandis_, _C. jambhiri_, _C. limon_, _C. limonia_, _C. macroptera_, _C. nobilis_ x _C. deliciosa_, _C. reticulata_, _C. sinensis_) were found to be infected by _Ca._ L. asiaticus.

Results also showed that huanglongbing is widespread in India. The presence of _Ca._ L. asiaticus_ was confirmed by real-time PCR in all studied states, except Arunachal Pradesh: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram*, Nagaland*, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura*, West Bengal.

[* Previously no data about the occurrence of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' in these states.]

[Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, caused by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus, occurs throughout much of Asia. It is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its vector; 2 other related pathogens, _Ca._ L. africanus (including a subsp. capensis) and _Ca._ L. americanus and their specific vectors exist in the respective areas. HLB has not been reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia.

The disease affects both leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel, and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

_Ca._ L. asiaticus is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission, and with infected plant material to areas where the vector is already present. Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Biological control by interplanting of guava is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).

A general decline of citrus health in India and the region has been observed over time, and it is thought that combinations of a number of pathogens and other factors may be contributing to the situation. Extensive harvest failures have led to citrus replanting programmes (ProMED-mail post 20080130.0375), but these can only be of long-term benefit if linked to an ongoing crop sanitation and monitoring programme to prevent re-introduction of pathogens, especially into orchards used as sources for propagating material.

National surveys like the one above are important tools to establish a base line for crop improvement programmes. However, from the report it is not clear if Arunachal Pradesh is now considered the only tested state free of HLB, or if it was only a case of HLB not being confirmed successfully by the PCR assay. To reliably identify and preserve potential HLB-free areas as sources of planting material would be important for improving national citrus health.
