As of 14 Feb 2010, worldwide more than 212 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of
pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 15 921 deaths. The
situation is largely unchanged since the previous update [see:
Influenza pandemic (H1N1) (17): WHO Update 20100216.0546].

Situation update
---------------
Temperate zone of the northern hemisphere:
- active but declining pandemic influenza transmission persists in
limited areas of eastern and southern Europe, South Asia, and in East
Asia. Several countries in West Africa reported increases in the
number of cases, but there is as yet insufficient evidence to conclude
that widespread community transmission is occurring. An increasing
trend in respiratory diseases activity was reported in Thailand and
Jamaica, however the cause of the respiratory disease is uncertain at
this point.

Southeast Asia:
- several countries reported an increasing trend of respiratory
diseases activity, but overall intensity remained low. After several
months of sporadic influenza activity, Thailand reported increasing
respiratory diseases activity marked by increased ILI [influenza-like
illnesses] in 24 provinces; however, the overall intensity of activity
nationally remains low. In Myanmar and Indonesia, localized geographic
spread of influenza activity, an increasing trend of respiratory
diseases, and low overall intensity was reported. In South Asia,
influenza activity persists in the northern and western states of
India, however, overall influenza activity continued to decline or
remained low in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. In East Asia,
transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists but has been
steadily declining in most countries of the region (China, Japan, and
the Republic of Korea), with the exception of DPR Korea, where an
increasing trend of respirat!
ory diseases activity was reported. In West Asia, pandemic influenza
virus continues to circulate in many countries, however the overall
intensity of current activity remains low in the region.

North Africa:
- pandemic influenza transmission persists, but substantial declines
in activity continue to be reported over the past month. In
Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus
transmission may be sporadic in most areas of the continent. Several
countries in West Africa continue to report increases in the numbers
of confirmed cases of pandemic influenza, however, currently, no
countries in the region are reporting an increasing trend in
respiratory diseases activity.

Europe:
- pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate across central and
southeastern Europe, but the overall intensity of activity remained
low in most places; only Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Slovakia, the
Republic of Moldova, and the Russian Federation reported a moderate
intensity of respiratory diseases activity. Several weeks of increases
in ARI/ILI [acute respiratory infections/influenza-like illnesses]
were reported in Slovakia and in the Russian Federation, but increased
activity in these countries may be associated with other circulating
respiratory viruses. Among 12 countries testing at least 20 sentinel
respiratory specimens, only Hungary reported that greater than 20
percent specimens had tested positive for influenza.

Americas:
- both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, pandemic
influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels, but overall
pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remained low in
most places. In Central America and the Caribbean, pandemic influenza
virus transmission persists, but overall activity remains low or
unchanged in most places. Jamaica reported an increasing trend of
respiratory diseases activity, but the overall intensity remains low.

Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant
influenza virus circulating worldwide. In addition to the increasing
proportion of seasonal influenza type B viruses recently detected in
China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating
in parts of Africa, and Asia.

The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring
the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic,
seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting or with the potential
to infect humans, including seasonal influenza.

Region / Deaths*
----------------------
WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) / 167
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) / At least 7433
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) / 1018
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) / At least 4056
WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO) / 1562
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) / 1685

Total* / At least 15 921

* The reported number of fatal cases is an under-representation of the
actual numbers, as many deaths are never tested or recognized as
influenza-related.

tabulated data accompanying this report.

A new feature of the weekly updates is a map of influenza activity and
virus subtypes accessible at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/Global_influenzapositive_FluTransmissionZones_week05.png>.

The displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to Flunet
(<http://www.who.int/FluNet>), WHO regional offices or on Ministry of
health websites in the preceding 2 weeks.

The percent of specimens tested positive for influenza includes all
specimens tested positive for seasonal or pandemic influenza.

The pie charts show the distribution of virus subtypes among all
specimens that were tested positive for influenza.

The available country data were joined in larger geographical areas
with similar influenza transmission patterns to give an overview
