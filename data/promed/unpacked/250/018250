[There is no explanation for this outbreak except from the data provided it seems it might have been new cases on a recent outbreak site, for which there is no direct information as the previous OIE report on 1 Oct 2021 was in a different province. Or it could have resulted from an animal recently bought from that farm. Hopefully, we will see a clarification of these outbreaks.
