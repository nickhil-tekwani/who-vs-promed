EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS - USA (LOUISIANA): CORRECTION

In the latest posting, it seems we were misinformed. There were not three
horses confirmed with EEE, only one -- in Tangipahoa Parish and which on
the second bleeding had an EEE IgG titre of 1024, IgM was 256; the
surviving horses, and others since, are "suspects" at this time and are
being rebled as the initial results were not internally consistent. One of
the recent unconfirmed cases was euthanised with severe neurological signs
before it could demonstrate unequivocal diagnostic EEE titers. Sera have
been sent to CDC for retesting.
I apologize for the premature reporting.
