Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Gabon - WHO Update 3
------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 13 Dec 2001, the Gabon Ministry of Health has reported 14
suspected cases (2 laboratory confirmed) including 10 deaths (see previous
report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2001/december/12december2001.html>).
A team from MSF Belgium and EPICENTRE (both partners in the
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network) arrived in Libreville
this morning to join international experts already in the country.
The International Response Team met with the Ministry of Health in
Libreville on Tue 11 Dec 2001 and assisted the Ministry of Health in
completing the organizational and coordination arrangements for the
response. This includes a Comite Politique Interministeriel, Comite de
Coordination Generale, Comite Provincial, and Comite de
Coordination Technique et Scientifique de Lutte with technical sub-
committees for epidemiology and surveillance, case management,
community sanitation and hygiene, health education, logistics, and
research. Technical meetings with the Gabonese health and military
personnel were held on Wed 12 Dec 2001 to organize the teams, their
programme of work and the tools (e.g., epidemiologic forms and
databases) and materials needed in the field.
The joint Gabonese-International team is leaving for the field after
making the necessary logistic preparations to travel to the outbreak site
to establish an isolation unit and implement a surveillance system.
