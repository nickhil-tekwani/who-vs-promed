Thailand confirms more bird flu outbreaks
-----------------------------------------
Thailand confirmed more outbreaks of the deadly bird flu, among chickens,
on Thu 15 Jul 2004, and, now, has recurrences of the deadly virus that
swept through much of Asia earlier this year [2004] in 9 of its 76 provinces.
"Bird flu is confirmed among chickens in Kamphaeng Phet province," said a
statement posted on the Livestock Department's web-site
<http://www.dld.go.th> [Web-site in Thai; English version not functional],
referring to an area north of Bangkok.
Almost 40 000 fowl have been culled in the latest outbreaks, officials said.
Suspected cases of bird flu in chickens and ducks have been reported in 5
districts of Bangkok, and samples have been sent for testing, they said.
The results will be known in a few days.

New bird flu outbreak: containment strategy working, Thaksin says
-----------------------------------------------
The outbreak of bird flu in 7 provinces is not another epidemic, rather, it
demonstrates quick detection of the killer virus as part of a successful
rapid-containment strategy, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said
yesterday [Wed 14 Jul 2004]. "The fresh outbreaks are the resurgence of
avian influenza that's been dormant since early this year [2004]," Thaksin
said.
The flare up had not grounded exports of cooked chicken meat, and, would
not spiral out of control, he said.
Government veterinarians were under strict orders to destroy suspiciously
sick chickens immediately rather than wait for lab test results.
Agriculture Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said his ministry was taking
measures to prevent wild migratory birds from infecting farm chickens.
[Earlier published intentions to kill storks have been cancelled, which
means, the prevention measures should encompass segregation of domestic
poultry. - Mod.AS].
Yukol Limlamthong, director general of the ministry's Livestock Development
Department, instructed his officials to intensify checks of poultry farms.
"Every preventive measure must be strictly enforced, and, no chicken, dying
unexplainably, should be sent to a slaughterhouse and processed, or sold,
for human consumption," he said.
Vets are expected to investigate suspected cases at farms, he said.
The ban on vaccinating fowl nationwide stays in place to avoid speeding up
mutations of the virus that could cause it to jump to people. "The poultry
industry would be ruined if bird flu were able to spread from human to
human," he said.
A decision on allowing limited vaccinations of chickens for domestic
consumption would wait until next week [3rd week July 2004]. "I have to
weigh the pros and cons of the proposal, and, will submit my report to
Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisang," he said. [Readers are referred
to FAO's relevant reference in item 4: "Targeted and strictly monitored
vaccination using a quality-assured vaccine remains a complementary
option." - Mod.AS].
Hasty immunizations by poultry breeders would result in the mandatory
culling of their chickens, he warned.
A Siriraj Hospital virologist had earlier feared that the bird flu might
have already jumped to pigs, but, the latest checks by leading virologists,
at home and abroad, found no mutation of the H5N1 strain here, he said.
About 60 non-farm chickens in Chiang Rai, and 30 in Bangkok, were quickly
disposed of yesterday [Wed 14 Jul 2004] after some were suspected to have
come down with bird flu.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, South East Asia: WHO
response
-----------------------------------------------
2 press releases, from the World Health Organization (WHO), last week [2nd
week July 2004] have refocused international attention on highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) [1,2]. During the past 3 weeks [1st week of
June, 1st and 2nd weeks of July 2004], an outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) has been
confirmed in Anhui province (China), and, outbreaks caused by a virus, so
far identified only as H5, have been confirmed in provinces north of
Bangkok (Thailand) and the Mekong Delta (Viet Nam). These outbreaks may be
new, or, continuations of the outbreaks reported earlier in 2004. Details
of the recent outbreaks can be seen on the web-site of the World
Organisation for Animal Health, OIE, <http://www.oie.int>
[3]). No human infections have been confirmed in these countries, and
control efforts are underway, including the culling of poultry in the
immediate vicinity of the outbreaks, vaccination of poultry within a wider
area, and limiting the movement of people living in the affected areas.
The WHO also calls attention to 2 research reports, published this month
[July 2004], which add to the understanding of the virus. The 1st indicates
that the virus may be widespread in domestic ducks in southern China, and,
that it has also caused increasingly severe disease in experimental mice
over the period 1999-2002 [4]. The 2nd reports that the virus may be
spreading via both domestic and wild birds, suggesting that it may be more
difficult to control than previously thought [5].
WHO is actively offering assistance -- and strongly encouraging counties to
take advantage of this offer of assistance -- with risk assessment
activities in affected countries, including enhanced surveillance of
animals and humans, and, strain analysis. The WHO is also urging these
countries' authorities to allow WHO's international reference laboratories
full access to all viral isolates and clinical specimens, so that more can
be learned about H5N1 viruses, which may differ from one another.
Although no human infections are so far confirmed, the WHO is keenly aware
that the H5N1 virus could adapt the ability to spread easily from human to
human. The WHO is working closely [with] agriculture authorities, and other
international organizations, including the OIE and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO). <http://www.fao.org/>
Pandemic preparedness activities, and pandemic vaccine development, continue.

as of 14 Jul 2004 [edited]

Current Status, 14 Jul 2004
---------------------------
New outbreaks of the AI virus H5N1 in China, Thailand, and Viet Nam confirm
that viral activity is still present in the region. In the aftermath of the
major outbreaks between January and March 2004, affected countries
succeeded greatly in bringing the disease under control, but, more may be
required. The recent surge of new outbreaks (or improved surveillance)
clearly demonstrate that the virus continues to circulate in parts of the
region, which is likely to continue in future, posing a continuing threat
to animal and human health, and, thwarting restocking and rehabilitation
initiatives for the poultry sector. It is very encouraging, however, that
governments have reacted immediately to recent outbreaks, and, have
officially informed international organizations in a timely manner.
Key elements of a successful control strategy are: continued surveillance
operations throughout all poultry production systems, strengthened
biosecurity of commercial, or local, enterprises, and, a rapid response to
outbreaks, including stamping-out in affected areas, with proper
disinfection, restriction of movement of animals and goods, and continuous
public awareness campaigns. Targeted, and strictly monitored, vaccination
using a quality-assured vaccine remains a complementary option. Restocking
should only be resumed if adequate preventive measures are put in place to
preclude re-infection.
Through several national and regional projects, FAO is closely monitoring
the situation and is assisting countries in further improving surveillance
and disease reporting.
