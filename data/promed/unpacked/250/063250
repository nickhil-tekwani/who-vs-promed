An outbreak of dengue fever on Madeira Island is waning after infecting 2000 people in Europe's 1st sustained transmission since the 1920s, Portugal's health secretary Fernando Leal da Costa said on Monday [10 Dec 2012].

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Madeira to assess the outbreak, Leal da Costa lauded the island's dengue detection and treatment system, saying dengue-carrying mosquitoes had apparently been brought inadvertently from a tropical country earlier this year [2012].

"With this imported _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito we've had the cases of the illness in humans, but it is diminishing and is being treated in exemplary fashion," he said in televised comments. He warned, however, that the complete eradication of the mosquito on the island, which is popular with tourists, "will be very difficult since it has found a habitat here."

Dengue fever is a mostly tropical viral infection producing symptoms that can range from mild flu-like illness to potentially deadly forms, which develop in around 5 per cent of patients. It is sometimes known as "breakbone fever" because of the severe pain it can cause.

On 5 Dec [2012], the health ministry said in its latest weekly report that 1993 cases of dengue had been reported since the start of the outbreak, with a 54 per cent drop in the number of cases registered in the week of 26 Nov-2 Dec [2012] from the preceding week and that all those infected were recovering.

A total of 118 people have received hospital treatment in Madeira since October, but there have been no deaths.

The ministry said 42 cases of the disease had been found in Britain, Germany, Sweden, and France among travellers returning from Madeira.

[Although the number of dengue cases has increased from 1819 on 25 Nov 2012 to 1933 cases as of 2 Dec 2012, it is good to learn that the incidence has declined.

The number of dengue cases acquired on Madeira Island but diagnosed and treated in other countries in Europe has not increased since the previous report.

Eradication of _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito vector of dengue virus on the island, may be difficult. With Europe entering the winter season, there has been no risk of onward transmission of dengue virus when tourists infected in Madeira returned viremic to their home countries. It would be of interest to know if this dengue outbreak has had an adverse impact on tourism to the island, which is a popular tourist destination.
