A surge in potato blight across the UK has led experts to tell growers to give careful consideration as to how crops are protected. AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board] reported a sharp rise in late blight samples submitted. '36_A2', a new strain of late blight that spread rapidly across continental Europe before arriving in the UK in 2017, was the most frequently detected [strain], with '6_A1' -- sometimes referred to as 'Pink 6' -- also confirmed.

Dr David Cooke, James Hutton Institute, said: "The 1st samples from cull piles in South East England were 36_A2. More recent samples from Essex and Suffolk have been confirmed as 36_A2 with further ones from Kent being a mix of genotypes 36_A2 and 6_A1." The rise in blight cases follows a period of warm, wet weather. "It's too early to draw conclusions about the national picture, but this gives growers advanced warning of the strains in their area." Late blight remains the single most important potato disease.

[Late blight of potato (PLB) and tomato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers, tomato transplants, plant debris, volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind, and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, as well as fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks. Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. Presence of both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen increases the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses to develop.

In Europe, regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist, and increasingly virulent strains have been reported to emerge mainly on potato (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), but recently also on tomato (ProMED-mail post 20180611.5850443). Strain 36_A2 was first detected in Germany in 2014 and spread rapidly in Europe, before arriving in the UK in 2017. So far, not much is known about its phenotypic characteristics and there are still not enough data to explain the current distribution of this lineage or to predict its ability to persist in the current environment of other strains in the same region. It has not yet arrived in Ireland, but an alert has been issued for that country (see link below). Strain 6_A1 'Pink' emerged in the UK around 2009 and is, together with 13_A2 'Blue', currently one of the dominating strains in Europe.
