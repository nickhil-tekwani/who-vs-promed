RCL Foods has reported an outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in one its 18 sheds on its Viva farm near Mulderdrift, Gauteng - a relatively small breeder facility with approximately 67 000 birds in total.

Breeding facilities are not used for meat production and these birds were in any event at the end of their life cycle, so market supply will not be affected. All the birds on this farm are in the process of being euthanised to prevent the spread of the infection beyond the farm and the farm remains under quarantine. RCL Foods' closest facility to Viva is nearly 30 km [approx. 18.6 mi] away.

Scott Pitman, managing director of RCL Foods' Consumer Division, commented: "This outbreak occurred despite the obsessive and stringent biosecurity measures that we have in place to contain the spread of the AI virus. We are working closely, and fully cooperating, with government and other authorities to gather industry research on how best to contain the virus. It should be noted that the virus is not known to affect humans."

The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) has confirmed 11 outbreaks in the industry.

All stakeholders will be kept informed as the process evolves.

[RCL Foods is one of South Africa's largest processors and marketers of chicken (Raibbow's Chicken). It is a fully integrated broiler producer that breeds and rears its own livestock which it feeds from its own feed mills, processes, distributes and markets fresh, frozen and further-processed chicken.

South Africa has reported 2 new HPAI H5N8 outbreaks on poultry farms in Gauteng in its follow-up report No 5, submitted to the OIE on [Mon 7 Aug 2017]. The summarised epidemiological data on these outbreaks, both reportedly starting [Fri 4 Aug 2017], are the following:

Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 107 000 / 2010 / 2010 / 4800 / 0

The report, which indicates that stamping out is to be applied, is available - with a map showing the 2 locations in Gauteng - at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=24509 (the coordinates of the outbreaks were modified "to protect confidentiality as required by South African Legislation").

South Africa's immediate notification on the recent H5N8 epizootic in poultry was submitted on [Thu 22 Jun 2017] (covered in item 1 of posting 20170623.5125151). Since then, 8 additional H5N8 outbreaks have been reported, their locations seen as a cluster on the map in OIE's summary report, available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=24127.

It will be interesting to note if the RCL Foods outbreak on its Viva farm in Gauteng is one of the 2 outbreaks covered in follow-up report No 5, or rather a later outbreak.

Continued spread of the virus into poultry facilities "despite the obsessive and stringent biosecurity measures" is cause for concern. - Mod.AS
