A multistate _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium outbreak, which has sickened 41 people in 13 states since last November 2013, has been linked to clinical and college and university teaching microbiology laboratories, according to a CDC investigation. The cases have been reported from Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

The CDC investigation reveals via laboratory testing that the outbreak strains are indistinguishable by PFGE pattern from commercially available _S._ Typhimurium strains used in laboratory settings for teaching or quality control purposes. These commercially available strains are known to be present in several teaching laboratories associated with ill persons.

Information gathered from interviews from those infected shows 18 (86 percent) of 21 ill persons interviewed reported being enrolled in either a human biology course or microbiology course. 15 (83 percent) of these 18 ill persons were students, and 3 (22 percent) were employees. Many ill persons reported several behaviors while they were working in the laboratory that would increase the risk of acquiring salmonellosis, including not wearing gloves or lab coats, lack of hand washing, and using the same writing utensils and notebooks outside of the laboratory. Additionally, many ill persons did not recall receiving laboratory safety training.

This is not the 1st reported outbreak linked to college laboratory classes. In 2011, a total of 109 illnesses with one of these same strains of _S._ Typhimurium were linked to exposure to clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. Findings of that investigation indicated that teaching and clinical microbiology laboratory instructors should enhance training of students and staff on biosafety measures necessary in the laboratory.

[The following information is extracted from the CDC report of the 2010-2011 outbreak in microbiology labs regarding safety(http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/typhimurium-laboratory/011712/index.html#advice-students):

Advice to students and employees in clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Be aware that bacteria used in microbiology laboratories can make you or others who live in your household sick, especially young children, even if they have never visited the laboratory.
-- If you work in a laboratory, it is possible for you to bring bacteria home through contaminated lab coats, pens, notebooks, and other items that you use in the microbiology laboratory.
-- Avoid taking laboratory supplies outside of the laboratory to limit contamination.

- Persons working with any infectious agents, including _Salmonella_ bacteria, must be aware of potential hazards, and must be trained and proficient in biosafety practices and techniques required for handling such agents safely, in particular, to:
-- Wash hands frequently while working in and immediately before leaving the microbiology laboratory and follow proper hand washing practices. This is especially important to do before preparing food or baby bottles, before eating, and before contact with young children.
-- Leave food, drinks, or personal items like car keys, cell phones, and mp3 players outside of the laboratory. These items may become contaminated if you bring them into the laboratory or touch them while working in the laboratory.

- Wear a lab coat or other protective garment over personal clothing when working in a microbiology laboratory. Remove protective garment before leaving for non-laboratory areas (such as cafeteria, library, or administrative offices). Dispose of protective garment appropriately or deposit it for laundering. Lab coats should be removed from the laboratory only when they are to be laundered by the institution.

- If you work with _Salmonella_ bacteria in a microbiology laboratory, be aware that these bacteria can make you sick. Watch for symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection, such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Call your health care provider if you or a family member has any of these symptoms.


Advice to laboratory directors, managers, and faculty involved with clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A comprehensive set of biosafety guidelines for work with _Salmonella_ and other similar human pathogens can be found in the Biosafety Level 2 section of the CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories manual (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm), the Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories MMWR Supplement (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6101a1.htm?s_cid=su6101a1_w), and the Guidelines for Biosafety Laboratory Competency MMWR Supplement (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6002a1.htm?s_cid=su6002a1_w).

- Either non-pathogenic or attenuated bacterial strains should be used when possible, especially in teaching laboratories. This practice will help reduce the risk of students and/or their family members becoming ill.

- Persons working with infectious agents, including _Salmonella_ bacteria, must be aware of potential hazards and trained and proficient in the practices and techniques required for handling such agents safely.

- Advise all persons working in the laboratory to watch for symptoms of Salmonella infection, such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, and to call their health care provider if they or a family member have any of these symptoms.

- All students and employees using the laboratory should be trained in biosafety practices.

- Ensure that handwashing sinks have soap and paper towels. Require students and employees to wash their hands before leaving the laboratory.

- Do not allow lab coats to leave the microbiology laboratory, except to be cleaned by the institution.

- Do not allow food, drinks, or personal items like car keys, cell phones, and mp3 players to be used while working in the laboratory or placed on laboratory work surfaces.
- Provide students with dedicated writing utensils, paper, and other supplies at each laboratory station. These items should not be allowed to leave the laboratory.
