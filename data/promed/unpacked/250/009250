COPENHAGEN -- Danish health authorities on Friday confirmed the
Scandinavian country's fourth case of mad cow disease. The latest case was
detected last week when a farmer contacted a veterinarian because of the
unusual behavior of a cow on a farm near the city of Soenderborg, 240 km
(150 mi) southwest of Copenhagen. Initial tests were positive and final
confirmation came Friday. The whole herd, which has been in quarantine the
past week, will be destroyed on Sunday, authorities said.
The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has said it expects the
figure of confirmed cases of mad cow disease to reach 10 by year's end.
Health authorities also said they suspect another cow that was found dead
on a different farm has bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, as mad
cow disease is known. But the cadaver was so decomposed that confirmation
tests will take 2 to 4 weeks to complete.
Danish farmers' unions have criticized officials for announcing suspected
mad cow cases before they are confirmed, because some prove to be false
alarms but cause panic anyway. In line with a European Union directive,
Denmark checks all cattle over the age of 30 months that are slaughtered,
or about 250 000 cattle.

HELSINKI -- A farm in northeastern Finland was quarantined after a cow
showed signs of a nervous system disorder that could be the country's first
case of mad cow disease, although officials presumed tests would be
negative. "The assumption at this stage is that this is a false alarm,"
Matti Aho, deputy director-general at the Agriculture Ministry, told
Reuters on Tuesday, emphasizing that the farm had been quarantined since
Friday as a precaution.
"The veterinarian at the farm has decided that BSE-like symptoms cannot be
ruled out," Aho said. Aho said results of tests from the animal at the farm
in Suomussalmi, around 550 km (330 mi) north of Helsinki, would be ready on
Wednesday, not Tuesday as had been reported. First reported by the regional
paper Karjalainen on Tuesday and confirmed by officials later, the incident
is the first suspected case of mad cow disease in Finland, which had been
one of few countries in Europe without a reported case of mad cow disease.
A suspected BSE case was found in Sweden, like Finland a country considered
at low risk for the disease, during the weekend, but tests showed it seemed
to be a false alarm. The Finnish Agriculture ministry said in a statement
that the cow killed on Friday had been more than 3 years old. Aho said that
meant it was theoretically possible that the animal could have the disease.
But the ministry said no other animal on the farm had shown symptoms, the
farm had purchased no cattle in the past 15 years, and it last slaughtered
cattle in October 2000. Agriculture Minister Kalevi Hemila said on Tuesday
that while the spread of the disease to Finland could not be ruled out, the
risk was very low. "There are numerous cases like this each year because 20
000 animals a year are tested for BSE in Finland," Hemila said, according
to Finnish news agency STT.
"This is a normal disease case that is showing symptoms, and about 100
similar check-up tests are made each year," Hemila said, according to STT.

STOCKHOLM -- The Swedish Agriculture Ministry was cited as saying on Friday
it had found a suspected case of mad cow disease in Sweden, until now
thought to have been free of the brain-wasting illness. It said in a
statement that a routine preliminary test for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in a young milk cow came up positive, but believed the
probability it was a real case of BSE was small.
Dutch authorities on Friday confirmed they had found a new case of mad cow
disease, bringing to 13 the number of affected animals discovered in the
Netherlands since 1997. The 5-year-old animal was taken for slaughter last
week and confirmed to be carrying the brain-wasting disease after a series
of tests.
Friday 3 new cases of mad cow disease were confirmed in Germany, bringing
to 39 the number of infected German-born cattle found since the end of
November [2000, regional authorities announced.

Sweden Detects First Mad Cow Case
------------------------------------
STOCKHOLM -- Sweden detected its first possible case of mad cow disease
late Friday in a heifer from the southwestern part of the country, but
officials said they were confident that further testing would show the
animal was free of the disease. The Agriculture Ministry said in a
statement that a routine test done on a slaughtered 28-month-old milk cow
that had suffered damage to its spine determined that it was possibly
infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, as mad cow disease
formally is known. Brain tissue samples from the cow will be sent to a
British laboratory for further testing, with results expected in about 2
weeks, the ministry said. Sweden also was repeating its own tests to
double-check them.
Government officials expressed confidence that the final results would show
the animal was not infected with BSE but said they would treat it as a real
case in the meantime. "It will be a couple of weeks before we will know
with certainty," Agriculture Minister Margareta Winberg said in a
statement. "Until then, we will handle things as if the test was positive."
Winberg also said she had asked the National Food Administration to remove
all meat from the originating farm from the stores. The National Veterinary
Institute also started an epidemiological examination to determine where
the animal had been, what it ate and if other animals had eaten the same
fodder, among other things. The farm also was barred from dispatching any
animals, agriculture officials said.
