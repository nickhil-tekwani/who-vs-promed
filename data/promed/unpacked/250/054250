The provincial governor spokesman said 12 children suffering from whooping cough died in a snow-bound district in the northeastern province of Badakhshan.

Spokesman Abdulmaroof Rasekh said the children were between the ages of 1 and 5 years old, and the deaths took place in Shoorian village bordering Tajikistan, located in Nasi Darwaz district of the province. He said local officials learned of the deaths last week. About 350 other children in the area are suffering from the whooping cough epidemic.

The village remains inaccessible from Afghanistan, so a health team was sent from Tajikistan 27 Dec 2012. The team is now treating the children and providing them nutritious food, Rasekh added.

Heavy snow has blocked access to 12 districts in Badakhshan, and teams are unable to reach other areas with potential health emergencies. Officials have said they will call in the Afghan National Army for help if needed.

[The scope of this outbreak is not clear. Most pertussis-associated deaths are in quite young, unimmunized children who are in contact with older children or young adults with milder illness. Pertussis mortality can be minimized not only by immunization with trivalent vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, but also by early antimicrobial intervention. Large populations of susceptible people in the developing world are the cause of large outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. - Mod.LL
