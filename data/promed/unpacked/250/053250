The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the [Hong Kong] Department of Health (DH) is today (4 Sep 2013) investigating an imported case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus infection] affecting a 20-year-old man, and hence urged the public to take precautions against mosquito-transmitted diseases.

The patient, with good past health, developed fever and vomiting on 24 Aug [2013] in Thailand and subsequently consulted a local doctor on 26 Aug [2013]. Upon arrival in Hong Kong on 31 Aug [2013], he sought medical attention from Princess Margaret Hospital, where he is currently admitted for management in stable condition.

Both his serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples tested positive for antibodies against JE [virus], a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infective mosquitoes, upon preliminary laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP.

Initial enquiries by the CHP revealed that the patient had travelled to Thailand from 28 Jul to 31 Aug [2013]. The CHP's investigation is proceeding.

To date, 3 JE cases (2 local and one imported) have been reported to the CHP this year.

In 2012, 3 cases (2 imported and one local) were reported while one (a local case) was reported in 2011. Locally, no cases were reported from 2008 to 2010.

A CHP spokesman explained that JE is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ (Culicine mosquito) is the principal vector of JE and is nocturnal.

It mainly breeds in waterlogged fields, marshes, ditches and small stagnant collections of water around cultivated fields. The mosquitoes become infected by feeding on pigs [amplifying host] and wild birds [reservoir host] infected with the JE virus, and then transmit the virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. JE [virus] is endemic in the Mainland and Southeast Asia.

Most JE virus infections are mild without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache.

More severe infections are clinically characterised by quick onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, impaired mental state, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially in infants) and paralysis.

To prevent contracting JE, members of the public, particularly those living in rural areas, are reminded to take heed of the following preventive measures, especially after dark:

- Wear long-sleeved clothes and trousers;
- Use effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body when outdoors; and
- Use mosquito screens or nets in rooms which are not air-conditioned.

Travellers to endemic areas of JE should take the following precautions:

- Avoid outdoor exposure to mosquito bites at dusk and dawn, especially in rural areas, when mosquitoes spreading this virus are most active;
- Apply effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothes; and
- Consider vaccination that should be completed at least 10 days before departure to endemic areas in Asia or the Western Pacific for staying over one month, particularly in high-risk rural areas.

[Although ProMED-mail has not posted reports of JE virus cases in Thailand previously, it is endemic in Thailand, so the occurrence of this case is not surprising. The specific locations that the patient visited while in Thailand are not mentioned. Visitors to rural areas in Thailand are well advised to take the precautions mentioned above.
