As emphasized by the ARS (Regional Health Agency), the circulation of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) continues in Mayotte.

"An animal disease of viral origin, Rift Valley fever, mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), causing abortions and high mortality in young animals, and can be transmitted from the infected animal to other animals, and to man."

A total of 123 animal outbreaks and 137 human cases have been reported since the 1st cases occurred in late November [2018].

[In the last report on 28 May 2019, the CHM laboratory reported 134 human cases of RVF at the monitoring and health emergencies platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS) of Mayotte and 121 outbreaks of sick animals (including 97 cattle and 24 small ruminants). Now, a week later, there are 123 infected animals and 137 human cases. The above report makes no predictions as to when this outbreak may be brought to an end. Recommendations and requirements have been issued that should help to reduce the number of human and animal cases. As Mod.AS noted in an earlier post, a French delegation included the following comment in its presentation of 21 Mar 2019: "What about vaccination? To date, no vaccine has been authorized in the EU." Such authorization deserves early consideration. It would be of interest to know what role, if any, mosquito vectors are playing in transmission of RVF virus during the current outbreak. If _aedes_ mosquitoes are involved, there is a risk of transovarial transmission of the virus that can persist for months in mosquito eggs with resumption of transmission when those eggs hatch and infected adult female mosquitoes emerge. - Mod.TY
