----------------------------------
An outbreak of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) has been confirmed on a sea
farm in Fuglafjordur, in the Faroe Islands. In a fax to the International
Office of Epizootics (OIE), chief veterinary officer Dr Bjorn Harlou,
reported that a total of 940 000 salmon and rainbow trout were affected. In
all, 125 000 salmon showed clinical signs of the disease, with a mortality
rate of 5.47%. A further 728 000 salmon showed no clinical signs of
infection but had a mortality rate of between 0.64% and 4.19%. No other
fish farms are suspected of harbouring ISA.
