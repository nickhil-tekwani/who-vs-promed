A Saskatchewan man has become ill with [a] hantavirus [infection] -- the
1st case in 2 years, provincial health officials say. The man, who lives in
the west central area of Saskatchewan, has been infected with the virus,
the province said Monday [9 Aug 2010].

People are typically exposed to hantavirus[es] from the saliva or droppings
of deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. It begins with flu-like symptoms
but can be a serious and even potentially fatal illness.

Health officials say people should protect themselves. They encourage
farmers, grain handlers, and cottage owners to wear a mask and gloves when
dealing with rodent droppings or cleaning dirty buildings.

The last case was in 2008. Not including the recent case, there have been
19 cases of the illness reported in Saskatchewan since 1994.

[Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in humans have occurred in
Canada's Prairie Provinces and British Columbia for several years. This
report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in this case but it
likely is Sin Nombre virus. Both Sin Nombre and New York hantaviruses have
deer mice as reservoir hosts. A USA CDC site, with extensive information
about hantaviruses, including those in North America, with clinical signs,
treatment, epidemiology, and an image of the deer mouse, _Peromyscus
maniculatus_, can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/>.

The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in
North America. A map showing its distribution can be accessed at
