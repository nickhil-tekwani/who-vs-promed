A potential outbreak of legionnaires' disease is being investigated in several adjacent towns in Bergen and Passaic Counties, the health department reports.

A total of 7 cases have been confirmed, with one "suspected" case still being investigated, the New Jersey Department of Health said in a Thursday [29 Dec 2022] release.

The cases -- which are treatable with antibiotics but have an incubation period of up to 2 weeks -- were reported between 9 Nov and 21 Dec 2022.

Legionnaire's disease can occur when a person inhales aerosolized water -- typically from cooling towers, hot tubs, plumbing systems, decorative fountains, or cooling misters -- contaminated with the bacteria _Legionella_.

Officials did not disclose which towns are included in the outbreak; however, the towns in the area are Clifton, East Rutherford, Elmwood Park, Fair Lawn, Franklin Lakes, Garfield, Glen Rock, Hawthorne, Lyndhurst, Mahwah, North Haledon, Oakland, Passaic, Paterson, Pompton Lakes, Ridgewood, Ringwood, Rutherford, Wanaque, Wallington, Wayne, and Wyckoff.

Passaic County officials tell NorthJersey.com [https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/health/2022/12/29/passaic-bergen-possible-legionnaires-disease-cluster/69764154007/] that the investigation was centered in Wayne.

"The risk of legionnaires' disease among any resident of, or recent visitor to, either Passaic or Bergen County is low," said New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli.

"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department recommends that individuals who live or work in these counties who become ill with pneumonia-like/respiratory symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle aches, and headache visit their healthcare provider immediately to be evaluated."

[Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can be generated by showerheads, spa pools and hot tubs, misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments, fountains, cooling towers, and car washes.

Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors, wafted in air currents downwind from their source. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passersby on Broad Street who were near, but never entered, the Philadelphia hotel where the 1976 legionnaires' disease outbreak occurred during a Pennsylvania legionnaires' convention (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

The news article above reports 7 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease in several unnamed, adjacent towns in Bergen and Passaic counties in the US state of New Jersey. Genotyping of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates from the 7 confirmed cases in Bergen and Passaic Counties match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

On 19 Dec 2022, ProMED reported a cluster of 4 legionnaires' disease cases in Pennsauken Township (Camden County), a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in southwestern New Jersey (Legionellosis - USA (17): (NJ) RFI 20221219.8707353). On 6 Sep 2022, ProMED reported a cluster of 2 legionnaires' disease cases in Hamilton Township (Mercer County), a residential community located mid-state, immediately east of the city of Trenton, New Jersey's state capital (Legionellosis - USA (11): (NJ) fatal, RFI 20220906.8705426).

Bergen County (pop., almost 1 million residents), located in northeastern New Jersey and part of the New York City metropolitan area, is the most populous county in the state. Passaic County (pop., over 1/2 million residents) is also part of the New York City metropolitan area, located immediately west of Bergen County. A map showing New Jersey counties can be found at https://www.njpt.uscourts.gov/new-jersey-county-map.

We are given no information about the timeline over which the 7 cases in Bergen and Passaic Counties occurred, and no information about any epidemiologic links among the cases or genetic links among the clinical isolates of _Legionella_. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources on the several clusters of cases of legionnaires' disease in New Jersey last year (2021). - Mod.ML
