A whooping cough (pertussis) outbreak is continuing to sweep across
the Gladstone region [Queensland]. There are ongoing reports of the
highly contagious respiratory infection, which can be life
threatening, running rampant in the Miriam Vale and Agnes Water
communities and further afield.

There have been 65 notifications of whooping cough recorded in
Gladstone in 2010. This is an alarming increase on the 11
notifications recorded for the same period in 2009. This dramatic
rise in reported cases has prompted a plea by local medical officials
for residents to get [re-]immunized against this infection, which is
capable of causing serious health complications in babies under 6
months of age.

Speaking with The Observer yesterday [19 Oct 2010], a local medical
practitioner said his practice alone had recorded 14 cases in the
past 4 months and a total of 18 for 2010. The medical practitioner
said it was an alarming number, particularly considering a number of
babies had become ill.

"It's a bit of an epidemic which has been going on for some time
now," the medical practitioner said.

Caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, whooping cough can
affect babies, infants, adolescents, and adults. For adolescents and
adults the infection may cause an irritating, persistent cough, which
can last up to 8 weeks. However, for babies and young children the
infection can be life threatening, particularly for those not fully
protected by vaccination.

[Cases of pertussis in previously vaccinated older children and
adults are generally attributed to waning immunity without
considering potential differences in _Bordetella pertussis_ strains.
As pointed out in 2009 by Dr Frits Mooi (ProMED-mail Pertussis -
Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876): There are now many studies which
show that outbreaks of pertussis are often associated with changes in
the _B. pertussis_ population. Most recently, we have shown that more
virulent (P3) strains have appeared which we believe to be (partly)
responsible for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The P3 strains have
emerged worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of sudden upsurges in
infectious diseases should include changes in the pathogen
population. This is even true for pertussis.
