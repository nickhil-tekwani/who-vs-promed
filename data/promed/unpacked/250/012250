Within a matter of weeks, 3 cases of gonorrhea that are resistant to the recommended 1st-line antibiotic treatment have been detected in Europe [see prior ProMED-mail post Gonococcal disease - UK: antibiotic resistance, ceftriaxone/azithromycin 20180330.5719556] and Australia. At a time with limited alternatives to the current dual therapy, lack of a vaccine and insufficient surveillance capacity in some regions, these cases highlight the growing threat of drug-resistance, which could lead to untreatable gonorrhea.

With more than 75 000 reported cases in 2016, gonorrhoea is the 2nd most commonly notified sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Europe. Successful gonorrhoea treatment with antibiotics not only reduces the risk of complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or increased HIV transmission in some settings, but -- combined with regular testing -- also serves as one of the main public health strategies for reducing further transmission. However, over the past decades, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ [the bacteria that cause gonococcal disease] has been developing resistance to several antimicrobial classes.

Between February and March 2018, the United Kingdom (1) and Australia (2) notified the 1st 3 cases globally of extensively drug-resistant _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ with high-level resistance to azithromycin and ceftriaxone resistance that are thus not susceptible to the currently recommended 1st line dual therapy for gonorrhoea (ceftriaxone intramuscularly and azithromycin orally). These cases were not epidemiologically linked.

The control of gonorrhoea depends on primary prevention, including promoting safer sex practices (in particular the use of condoms), regular testing of individuals at risk as well as treatment with effective antibiotics to reduce the chance of further transmission.

Even a small change in drug resistance may have a broader impact as those infected can continue to transmit the infection without knowing. Spread of extensively drug-resistant strains like the ones identified in the UK and Australia can have an even more serious impact on the control of gonorrhoea.

In its Rapid Risk Assessment, ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] outlines the necessary steps to respond to the threat of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea: across disciplines, clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and public health authorities at national and international levels need to work closely together to preserve ceftriaxone and azithromycin as viable treatment options for this bacterial infection [1,2].

The most important actions needed are: primary prevention interventions, such as sexual education and promotion of barrier methods (condom use), aiming to reduce the overall prevalence of gonorrhoea; effective identification and management of infected patients by ensuring that all those infected are promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated and receive a follow-up test of cure as recommended in current patient management guidelines; reminding those diagnosed with gonorrhoea of the importance of partner notification and of attending for their test of cure.

The reported cases of extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea also highlight the need for developing novel antimicrobials for this disease as well as prioritisation and funding of an effective vaccine.

Executive Summary
-----------------------
"The 1st 3 cases of infection with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ displaying resistance to ceftriaxone (MIC = 0.5 mg/L) and high-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC over 256 mg/L) at a global level were reported by the United Kingdom (one case) and Australia (2 cases) in February and March 2018, respectively. The case from the UK and one case from Australia were travel-associated, and both acquired gonorrhoea in Southeast Asia. These strains are the 1st global reports of high-level azithromycin resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_, which is also resistant to ceftriaxone as well as most other alternative antimicrobials. Consequently, they are resistant to the 1st line dual therapy for gonorrhoea (ceftriaxone intramuscularly and azithromycin orally) recommended by European, Australian, World Health Organization, and other guidelines [also U.S. CDC recommendations]. They highlight the increasing threat of multidrug- (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) gonorrhoea in the context of limited therapeutic alternatives, lack of vaccine, and limited surveillance capacity in many regions globally.

"Effective response to this threat will require strengthened collaboration between clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and public health authorities at national and international levels through the adoption of measures to preserve ceftriaxone and azithromycin as viable treatment options for gonorrhoea. The recently reported cases indicate a need to continue to increase awareness of the issue among the public, clinicians, laboratory staff, epidemiologists and other healthcare and public health professionals.

"Prevention efforts need to be focused on measures to reduce the overall number of gonorrhoea cases by emphasising the importance of safer sex practices, in particular the use of condoms, and following any national guidelines on STI testing after unprotected sexual activity with new or casual partners. Considering that 2 of the 3 XDR gonorrhoea cases reported here were travel-related, provision of information on safer sex practices should be considered as routine advice for travellers. All patients diagnosed with gonorrhoea need to be reminded of the importance of partner notification and attending for test of cure.

"Clinicians need to ensure that all gonorrhoea cases are managed according to national and/or international guidelines, be aware of the possibility of further cases which are resistant to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, ensure that tests of cure are performed for all diagnosed cases, and submit samples for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing from all suspected or proven positive sites of infection. In case of XDR gonorrhoea, clinicians should consider taking pharyngeal samples irrespective of reported sexual practices. Sexual health services also need to ensure that partner notification is undertaken for all cases. Particular attention should be paid to effective detection and treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhoea, which is frequently more difficult to eradicate compared to urogenital infections.

"Antimicrobial resistance surveillance for _N. gonorrhoeae_ in EU/EEA countries and globally needs to continue to be prioritised and strengthened. Reporting of treatment failures should be implemented and/or strengthened at the national and European level to enable rapid implementation of interventions to prevent the spread of MDR- and XDR _N. gonorrhoeae_. Timely sharing of data between national authorities on treatment failures will also facilitate a more effective global response."

A discussion of antimicrobial resistance in gonococci can be found in my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Gonococcal disease - UK: antibiotic resistance, ceftriaxone/azithromycin 20180330.5719556.

One of the 2 cases of multi-drug resistant gonorrhea recently detected in Australia was diagnosed in Western Australia, and the other case was diagnosed in Queensland (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr18-dept-dept004.htm). One of the 2 Australian cases and the UK case were believed to have contracted their infection in Southeast Asia. Genotyping the strains would help identify transmission pathways. - Mod.ML
