A medical report from the National Institute of Virology in Pune has confirmed that the recent death of monkeys in the Bandipur National Park limits was due to 'Kyasanur Forest disease' (KFD).

The blood samples were sent to the centre soon after 12 monkeys died of the suspected fever at Alegowdanakatte camp in Maddur division, said Pushkar, the tiger reserve project director.

The daily wage workers of the Forest department too were affected by the epidemic.

Following the report confirming the prevalence of the KFD virus, a meeting of the veterinarians and the officials of the Forest department has been convened to discuss preventive measures.

Soon, the residents in the surrounding villages will be administered a vaccine to check the spread of the infectious disease, he added.

[This report provides laboratory confirmation of the 28 Nov 2012 post indicating that 12 monkeys and forest workers were suspected to have been infected by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121129.1431079). That post reported the deaths of 8 bonnet macaques [_Macaca radiata_] and 2 common langurs [_Semnopithecus entellus_], and infection of 5 workers of the forest department. The current report, above, indicated that 12 monkeys were involved, but did not specify which species. The 28 Feb 2009 post on KFD in India (ProMED-mail archive number 20090302.0860), provides an excellent review of KFD virus and its associated disease.
