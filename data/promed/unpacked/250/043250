Dear Sir,
In your report about yellow fever in Brazil number 20000406110602 there is
a mistake. The number of confirmed cases of sylvan YF as released by the
National Epidemiology Center of the National Health Foundation for the
period 1980 to 1998 comprise a total of 376 cases with 216 deaths, an
average of about 20 cases only yearly, not as reported. From December 1999
a clear increase in the number of cases has been observed, reflecting most
probably an epizootic of YF in the endemic areas and this tendency [has
spread over to this year. From December 1999 to now, 65 cases have been
reported with 27 deaths. Almost all cases report traveling in endemic areas
without previous vaccination. The vaccination coverage in the endemic areas
is high although clusters of unvaccinated populations may be detected in
remote areas.

[We thank Dr Schatzmayr for this information. We quoted a news report that
said: "According to the National Health Foundation, from 100-200 cases of
sylvan YF occur annually." It´s amazing how the media can get figures
wrong! However, I believe Dr Schatzmayr would agree with us that probably
many more undiagnosed cases occur annually than are actually reported - Mod.JW
