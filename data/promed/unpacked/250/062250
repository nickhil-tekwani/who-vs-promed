Brain fever kills 21 in Delhi
-----------------------------
At least 21 people are dead, while 370 others are believed to be
affected by meningococcemia, the highly infectious brain fever that
has gripped Delhi.
While the government is trying to combat its spread through
antibiotics, medicines are not reaching affected areas quickly enough.
The meningococcus spreads through contact. The 1st step in containing
the disease is chemoprophylaxis with antimicrobials, which should be
given to the patient's family. This is followed by immunization of
the population in affected areas.
"Chemoprophylaxis is being done, and we are doing house to house
surveys. Health workers are vaccinated," said Dr. KK Tiwari, Director
of Health Services, MCD.
Though the government is banking on this strategy, the situation on
the ground is very different. In a densely populated and congested
area in Karol Bagh, 70 people have been diagnosed with brain fever,
and the deaths have begun. Infection breeds easily in these areas,
with several people, most of them migrant laborers, sharing a small
living space. Workers on the ground say that, in most cases, they
cannot track down a patient's family. Clearly, the scale of infection
seems much higher than reported.

[2] Burkina Faso, Niger

Hundreds of people have been reported dead from meningitis in West Africa in
the last few weeks.
Worst hit has been Burkina Faso, where 246 people have died,
according to the medical aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres, and over
2000 more have fallen ill from the meningitis bacterium (_Neisseria
meningitidis_), which attacks the brain and spinal chord.
Across Burkina Faso's northern border, 44 people died, and 614 people were
reported ill between 1 Jan & 27 Feb 2006 in Niger, according to the National
Health Information System, SNIS. And to the south, in war-divided Cote
d'Ivoire, the UN children's agency UNICEF has reported 94 cases and 33 deaths
from meningitis.
Meningitis is endemic in much of the arid Sahel region of West
Africa, with outbreaks most common during the dry season, from
January to March.
The Burkina Faso government plans a major vaccination campaign in the
10 epidemic-hit districts that lie in the west, southwest and north
of the country, according to Souleyman Sanou, who is heading the
government's campaign against the illness.
"The government has bought 1 million doses of [vaccine], which will
be given to the population free of charge," said Sanou, who added
that 2 million more doses were being sought.
However, the director of communications in the ministry of health,
Rene Sebgo, said further tests would have to be carried out to
determine the strain of meningitis.
In 2002, an outbreak of the W135 strain of meningitis afflicted 13 000 people
and killed 1500, according to the WHO. Many of the cheaper vaccines long used
against meningitis are less effective against the W135 strain, according to
WHO.
Government officials are worried that a week long cultural festival
due to begin in the country's 2nd city, Bobo-Dioulasso, which lies in
the heart of the meningitis outbreak area, could assist in the spread
of the disease. The thousands of artists and attendees due to flock
to the biannual event that begins on 26 Mar 2006 have been advised to
get shots 8 to 10 days before travel.
In Niger, the most badly hit area is Maradi, some 650 km east of
Niamey, where 31 have died and 514 have been registered with
meningitis, SNIS said.
The government has dispatched 30 000 doses of vaccine as well as
medicine for more than 900 patients, while Medecins Sans Frontieres
has promised 710 000 vaccinations, half of them being already in hand.
But the Health Ministry says Niger needs 3 million doses of vaccine
as well as enough drugs and syringes to deal with an expected 25 000
cases.

[In neither situation was the serotype of meningococcus mentioned. In
recent WHO reports from 2006 outbreaks in Africa, however, except for
W135 found in Kenya, all outbreaks (Sudan, Uganda, Niger) have had
type A isolates found, as well the 2005 outbreak in Delhi. - Mod.LL]
