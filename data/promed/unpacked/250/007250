Officials said that 5 cases of West Nile fever have been confirmed in Russia's Astrakhan region. [Of these,] one woman was in intensive care, the condition of 2 other patients was evaluated as moderate, and 2 others were recovering.

Officials said that cases of West Nile fever were reported in Astrakhan, Volga, and Kamyzyaksky regions. It is assumed that the infection could occur through a mosquito bite.

A natural source of infection of West Nile virus are birds of aquatic and riparian habitats, as well as those that feed on the ground, including pigeons and crows. The infection is distributed [transmitted] through _Culex_ mosquitos.

[These cases appear to have occurred unusually early in the West Nile virus (WNV) transmission season, raising questions about the dates of infection and the reliability of diagnosis. Most of the previously reported cases occurred in late summer to autumn, and in the Volgograd region.

Since the report above indicates that the cases were confirmed, presumably they were laboratory tested and found positive for WNV infection. Because clinically serious cases of WNV infection represent a very small percentage of total human cases, if these are indeed WNV infections, then a much larger number of WNV infections must have occurred. The implication in the report above is that the WNV infections were acquired through mosquito bites, and not from blood transfusions or organ transplants. Additional details of these cases would be appreciated.

The Astrakhan region is located in south western Russia and borders the Black Sea. Maps of Russia can be accessed at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/russiaaddivisions.jpg and http://healthmap.org/r/74KX. - Mod.TY]
