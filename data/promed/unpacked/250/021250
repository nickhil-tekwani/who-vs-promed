ZIKA VIRUS - MICRONESIA: GUAM ex YAP, SUSPECTED

There have now been 2 probable cases of the Zika virus reported in
Guam. The probable cases are not laboratory confirmed, but do meet
the current case definition. According to the Guam Department of
Public Health, the 2 probable cases are from adults who had recently
traveled to Yap. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the
World Health Organization (WHO), and Yap Health Department scientists
continue to investigate the Zika outbreak in Yap State. A total of 86
confirmed and probable cases have been recorded as of Tuesday [26 Jun
2007].
Because this is a relatively unknown disease, they are now collecting
data to better define the course of illness and how it is
transmitted. Since there is no vaccination or specific medical
treatment for Zika virus infection, Guam Public Health advises the
public to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes that transmit the disease.
Guam residents are especially urged to remove old tires, cans,
bottles, coconut shells, and other items in which mosquitoes may
breed from around their homes.
The symptoms of the Zika virus are mild and generally last for 2-4
days, consisting of a rash that starts on the face that may spread to
the rest of the body, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and joint pain
mostly affecting the smaller joints of the hands and feet.

[ProMED-mail thanks Alice Hadley for sending in this report. The
travel of 2 individuals possibly infected with Zika virus is another
illustration of the ease with which pathogens can be disseminated. If
these individuals were viremic on arrival in Guam, and competent
vector mosquitoes were present and abundant, the risk of spread of
Zika virus could be relatively high. Transport of infected mosquitoes
in commercial aircraft is another potential mechanism for
dissemination of Zika and other arboviruses (see references below).
