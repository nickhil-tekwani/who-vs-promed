A rise in the number of children developing scarlet fever has been recorded in Cumbria [England].

36 confirmed cases have been reported so far in 2014, but public health officials are concerned there may be more in the community as people may not recognise the symptoms.

Public Health England, working in partnership with Cumbria County Council, is advising parents to be aware of the signs of scarlet fever, after a rise in cases in children. Kate Brierley, of Public Health England's Cumbria & Lancashire Health Protection Team, said: "We tend to see more cases in winter, but this year [2014] seems to have seen an increase in cases in a relatively short space of time. As it's a very contagious disease, we'd urge parents with children that are showing symptoms to see their GP and obtain treatment. Most mild cases of scarlet fever will clear up on their own, but having treatment for the illness speeds recovery and reduces the risk of complications."

Scarlet Fever is a highly infectious disease caused by the bacteria [_Streptococcus pyogenes_ or Group A streptococci], often found in the throat and on the skin. It is spread by coughing and sneezing and is characterised by a rash, which usually accompanies a sore throat. The bacteria which cause the infection produce toxins which cause a rash, a red and swollen tongue and flushed cheeks. Other symptoms include a high fever, swollen glands in the neck and feeling tired and unwell.

Dr Rebecca Wagstaff, acting Director of Public Health at Cumbria County Council, said: "Between 2000 and 4000 cases of scarlet fever are diagnosed each year in England. Children with scarlet fever should be kept off school for 24 hours after the start of treatment and, during that time, be kept away from other children as much as possible. To help prevent the spread of infection, all tissues and cloths that someone with scarlet fever has coughed or sneezed into should be washed or disposed of immediately. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water if you have touched any of these."

If you think you, or your child, has scarlet fever: See your family doctor as soon as possible. Make sure that you/your child takes the full course of any antibiotics prescribed by the doctor. Current guidance advises that children should not return to nursery or school and adults to work until a minimum of 24 hours after starting treatment to avoid spreading infection. You can help stop the spread of infection through frequent hand washing and by not sharing eating utensils, clothes, bedding and towels, and all contaminated tissues or handkerchiefs should be washed or disposed of immediately.

[Scarlet fever is caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing group A streptococci (GAS) (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), and usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis [sore throat], but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds and burns, or the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever). Scarlet fever usually occurs in children. By the age of 10 years, most people will have developed immunity.

Scarlet fever is highly contagious. Transmission occurs via airborne respiratory particles dispersed from infected patients by coughing or sneezing, usually in the colder winter months, or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. Those who carry the bacteria in the nasopharynx [nose and throat] or on the skin but have no symptoms are less contagious (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm).

Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than one percent. Community-wide outbreaks still occur, as happened in Hong Kong in 2011; (see prior ProMED-mail posts in 2011 on scarlet fever in Hong Kong).

Treatment of scarlet fever is no different than that of GAS pharyngitis, that is, oral penicillin, erythromycin, or clindamycin for 10 days, or one intramuscular dose of penicillin G benzathine. With proper antibiotic treatment, complications are uncommon: penicillin therapy for treatment of GAS pharyngitis within 9 days of onset of symptoms has been shown to decrease the incidence of ARF [acute rheumatic fever]; unlike ARF, antimicrobial therapy does not prevent acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [kidney disease].

Cumbria, one of 5 counties in the North West Region of England, is predominantly rural and contains the Lake District. It is one of the most sparsely populated counties in the UK (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria).
