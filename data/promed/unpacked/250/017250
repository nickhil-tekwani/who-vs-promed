re: ProMED-mail. Ralstonia pickettii, sepsis - Australia: contaminated propofol, alert 20140522.2489978
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that some patients have had _Ralstonia mannitolilytica_ infection, not _Ralstonia pickettii_.

It would appear that contamination may be polyclonal, which has been reported previously, and would not be incompatible with an environmental source of contamination.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Koehler for the additional information that not all 8 patients who developed ralstonia bacteremia/sepsis that was linked to receipt of propofol were infected with _Ralstonia pickettii_; some were infected with _Ralstonia mannitolilytica_, although the exact number is not given. Having more than one organism involved in the outbreak could suggest that the microbial contamination was extrinsic, that is, was introduced at the time of usage because of faulty technique, such as using single-patient vials of propofol for more than one patient.

_R. mannitolilytica_ shows similar biochemical properties to _R. pickettii_, but nitrate reduction (negative in _R. mannitolilytica_) and acidification of D-arabitol and mannitol (both negative in _R. pickettii_) have been reported to enable differentiation, as has PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene (http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/54/1/55.full.pdf).

Although _R. pickettii_ is the most frequently isolated species from clinical specimens of the 13 species in the genus _Ralstonia_, _R. mannitolilytica_ is a clinically significant organism.

The following information on _R. mannitolilytica_ is extracted from Zong ZY, Peng CH: _Ralstonia mannitolilytica_ and COPD: a case report. Eur Respir J 2011; 38(6): 1482-3; available at http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/38/6/1482.full:
_Ralstonia mannitolilytica_ is a recently established species previously known as _Pseudomonas thomasii_ or _Ralstonia pickettii_ biovar 3/thomasii. It has been recovered from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and has also been associated with catheter-associated bacteremia, recurrent meningitis, infection of a hemoperitoneum, urinary tract infection, and post-renal transplant infection. Hospital outbreaks of _R. mannitolilytica_ due to contamination of water, saline solutions or oxygen-delivery devices have also been reported. - Mod.ML
