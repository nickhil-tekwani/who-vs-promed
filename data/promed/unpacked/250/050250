75 cases suspected to be lumpy skin disease have been suspected in cattle in South Ossetia. Almost all of the animals recovered, but a few died. To confirm or refute the presence of the disease, Ossetian veterinarians sent samples to the Vladimir Institute [Federal Governmental Institute, Centre for Animal Health (FGI-ARRIAH), 600900 Yur'evets, Vladimir, Russia]. Results are awaited.

Veterinarians say that due to the decreased temperatures, the incidence of LSD began to decline. At present, they say, there are only 2 sick animals, but the symptoms can still occur in those still in the incubation period.

A new batch of vaccine against sheep pox and goat pox, proven effective, is currently awaited from the neighboring republic.

[South Ossetia, formerly the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the former Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, is a disputed region, which declared independence from Georgia in 1990, calling themselves the "Republic of South Ossetia." Following several political and military events, the Ossetian separatists and Russian troops gained de-facto control of the territory since 2008. The South Ossetia Republic borders Russia (North Ossetia) in the north and Georgia on all other sides; see map at http://tinyurl.com/n9cubqq.

In case confirmed, Georgia and Armenia remain the only countries in the region from which LSD has not been reported. The LSD-infected countries are Turkey, Azerbaijan, Chechnya Russia, the Republic of Dagestan, and Iran.

Since the South Ossetia self-proclaimed Republic is recognized only by few countries in addition to Russia, and it is not a member of the OIE, information on the animal health situation there deserves, probably, to be submitted by a related international reference laboratory, or obtained by other international authorities (FAO?). - Mod.AS]
