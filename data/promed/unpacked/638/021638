Re: African swine fever - Europe (09): Latvia (KS), Poland (PD), update 20140708.2596193
-----------------------------------------
[The following urgent clarification is communicated] on behalf of the Chief Veterinary Officer of Poland in relation to the [above] ProMED-mail post, dated 8 Jul 2014, on African swine fever in Poland (and Latvia).

In Poland, cases of ASF were only confirmed in wild boar (there were no outbreaks in pigs; the term to be used when ASF is confirmed in wild boar is "case," while when it is confirmed in pigs, the term "outbreaks" should be used). Therefore, I would like to kindly ask that you correct the beginning of your report, which should read: "Disease cases [not outbreaks] have been registered in wild boar" [see commentary].

As of 8 Jul 2014, a total of 7 (not 6) cases of ASF in wild boar have been confirmed. No outbreaks of ASF have ever been reported in [domestic] pigs in Poland.

Official communications from the Polish Veterinary Services on those cases can be accessed on the website http://www.wetgiw.gov.pl/ under the following links:

- cases 5 and 6 at http://www.wetgiw.gov.pl/files/aktualnosci/7-07-14-komunikat-glw.pdf (with a correction concerning an improperly indicated municipality: http://www.wetgiw.gov.pl/files/aktualnosci/8-07-14-sprostowanie.pdf);

- case 7 at <http://www.wetgiw.gov.pl/files/aktualnosci/8-07-14-komunikat-glw.pdf [see text in the commentary below].

All the above mentioned communications were available on the website since, respectively, 7 and 8 Jul 2014.

Furthermore, I would like to underline that Poland has notified to the OIE in total 4 cases of ASF in wild boar (not 2 as indicated in your report):

- 2 cases of ASF in wild boar (the 1st ever recorded in Poland) were notified in 2 subsequent notifications (17 and 24 Feb 2014; one can find additional information under those links: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14793 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14819);

- 2 further cases in wild boar were notified on 30 May 2014 (one can find additional information under this link: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=15340).

As regards the cases that were confirmed this week (cases 5, 6 and 7 in wild boar), proper information shall be notified to the OIE in the next follow-up report later this week in accordance with OIE rules. Please note that in accordance with those rules, only an "outbreak" may be indicated in the notification (there is no differentiation between "outbreak" and "case" yet); however, in fact, information concerning cases of ASF in wild boar will be submitted (not on outbreaks, as indicated in the ProMED-mail post).

[ProMED-mail's posting 20140708.2596193, citing information from Russia's official Rosselkhoznadzor web-site, was concluded as follows: "Official confirmation and report on the additional 4 outbreaks is anticipated." We are very grateful to the Polish Veterinary Services for their relevant, firsthand information. There is, thus, no confirmation of 4 additional outbreaks on top of the 2 outbreaks in wild boars which had already been reported to the OIE.

Regarding the terminology applied in relation to ASF in wild boars, subscribers have been referred (URL included) in ProMED-mail's above posting, to OIE's page: "Event summary: African swine fever, Poland," updated 4 Jul 2014, which included the following information: "Number of outbreaks - 2." The information on the number of animals affected is also available, under the title: "Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 2 (Submitted)" at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015529_20140704_170755.pdf. It says: cases: 4; deaths: 4; destroyed: 0; slaughtered: 0.

The information on the new, recently added 7th ASF event is appreciated. The full text in the notification, conveniently available on the official web-site of the Polish Veterinary services (machine translated), is:

"The Chief Veterinary Officer announces the discovery of a 7th case of African swine fever (ASF) in feral pigs on Polish territory.

"The 7th event of ASF is related to a group of 6 wild boars found dead on 4 July 2014 by the Border Guards within a forest in the municipality of Grodek (Bialystok district, Podlaskie province), approximately 1 km from the village Luzany and approximately 4 km from the Polish-Belarusian border. Samples have been obtained from all the dead wild boars for ASF tests. A study carried out in the national reference laboratory for ASF (scores of 7 Jul 2014) confirmed the presence of ASF virus genetic material in all tested samples. Similar to the events 5 and 6, the 7th ASF event is located in the border area, which is covered by the restrictions in accordance with the current legal injunctions, prohibitions and restrictions."

Poland has duly submitted weekly follow-up reports on ASF in wild boar since the start of the event, reportedly on 22 May 2014; we are looking forward to follow-up report No. 6. - Mod.AS
