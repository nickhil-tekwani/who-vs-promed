Cases of a debilitating disease that results in lesions on sea turtles off north Queensland are rising, with a researcher suspecting a link between the disease and the health of the Great Barrier Reef.

The disease, called fibropapillomatosis (FP), is caused by the herpes virus and results in lesions on the turtle's body.

The disease has been found across the world and more recently in places like Townsville [Queensland].

James Cook University [Queensland] researcher Karina Jones has been studying the disease in turtles found near Magnetic Island off Townsville.

She said the disease could contribute to the death of turtles. "It grows on their eyes, they can't see predators, they can't catch food, so sometimes they slowly starve to death -- it's not a nice thing for the turtles to experience," she said.

Ms Jones said scientists did not know why the turtles developed the lesions, but she suspected there may be a link between the disease and the health of the Great Barrier Reef.

She hoped a "hotspot" in Cockle Bay at Magnetic Island would provide clues as to what causes the disease, with turtles only 100 metres away unaffected by tumours.

"If you have happy, healthy turtles, it's thought they have a happy, healthy environment," she said.

"We're a little bit worried because we're starting to see a little more of this disease but we're also wondering what it's saying about the reef.

"If the turtles are sick, there might be something in the reef that's causing them to trigger that disease -- that's why it's really important not only for the turtles, but for the health of the reef that we find out what's going on.

"There's so much we don't know, but we do know the virus is seen a lot more in areas used more by humans."

Mark Read from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said the disease could be confronting. "It ranges like most other diseases in animals -- you can go from a mild form where it's very hard to detect, through to animals that are literally covered with the fibropapillomas," he said.

"Some of the papillomas can get to be the size of a softball or almost like a small rockmelon."

Mr Read said research into the disease would be one their priorities.

"One of the things we're interested in as the Marine Park Authority is obviously what are things out there affecting the values of the marine park," he said.

"When we have some of our iconic species like green turtles that are coming up with a disease, we're trying to understand what is contributing to these animals to be diseased.

"When we look at the animals, particularly when you've local area hotspot like Cockle Bay, just trying to address questions of why it's localised in that particular area, is obviously an imperative to understand that.

"Then trying to put it into the broader context of how the population is functioning, it's one of the things in the list of priorities."

[Fibropapillomatosis is a neoplastic disease putatively caused by a chelonid fibropapilloma-associated herpesvirus (CFPHV). This virus has been documented to infect all sea turtle species.

Around the world, the prevalences of infected green turtles vary considerably, but most populations contain at least a few CFPHV infected individuals.

The infection has also been documented in healthy turtles, so there may be environmental factors that contribute to the development of the tumors. Anthropogenic stressors such as pollutants may be implicated. - Mod.PMB
