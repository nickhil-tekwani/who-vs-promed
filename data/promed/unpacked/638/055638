Health department staff are warning students and teachers who are off this week amid a pertussis outbreak at Grand Traverse Academy to stay home as the number of those ill continues to grow. As of Wed 12 Nov 2014, there are 12 confirmed cases and 161 probable cases of the illness, also known as whooping cough. That is up from 10 confirmed and 83 probable cases 2 days ago.

Grand Traverse Academy administrators chose to close for the week as the number of students and staff with the illness continued to grow. The academy, a K-12 charter school, is closed for all classes, extra-curricular activities and athletic events through Sun 16 Nov 2014 according to a notice posted on the school's website.

Area physician offices, urgent care locations and clinics are bogged down handling the outbreak as Grand Traverse Health Department staff continue to urge any students and teachers to begin a course of preventative antimicrobials. A pertussis hotline designed to coordinate prescriptions has been staffed daily, and the health department staff has responded to more than 900 calls.

Students, staff members and their families are strongly urged to get the vaccine against pertussis. The CDC recommends vaccinating children in a 5-shot series beginning at 2 months. All children should receive an additional single dose at age 11 that provides additional protection. Adolescents and adults who have not received the vaccination in the past are urged to get a single dose to reduce their risk of contracting or spreading the sickness to others.

Earlier this week, county health officer Wendy Trute shared her hope that those infected would not grow to include other community members. But because the academy's more than 1000 students come from beyond an area that would normally be restricted by district lines, it is very possible that would happen, she said.

While today's [6 Nov 2014] headlines in the media highlight the threat of Ebola, and our local health care community has appropriately been planning and preparing for months should this risk materialize, we have a real infectious disease danger already here in Santa Barbara County. 13 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have been identified just in the last few weeks. That makes almost 90 cases in our county so far in 2014, the most cases in one year since we have been collecting electronic reporting data, which goes back over 10 years.

We hope that the children affected fully recover, as whooping cough can cause serious illness. Of the almost 9000 cases statewide in 2014, over 300 resulted in hospitalizations, and there have been a handful of deaths. This is one of the largest epidemics of pertussis statewide in 60 years. What makes this particularly concerning is that whooping cough is largely a vaccine preventable disease.

Pertussis is often cyclical in nature, and there have been years of large outbreaks in the past. The vaccine isn't perfect as even those that had the vaccine can sometimes come down with mild symptoms. But a closer look at our current cases and contact tracing finds that almost all of the recent cases were linked to Waldorf School. That could be an unfortunate coincidence, as we always have some naturally occurring cases every year, but would it surprise anyone that this outbreak is occurring at a school where only 28 percent of the children are up-to-date on all of their vaccines?

While Waldorf schoolchildren are particularly low in their vaccination rates, it would not be appropriate to assume this problem of unvaccinated children is isolated to that one school. In fact, many local schools fall below our target of having 90 per cent of children fully vaccinated. This is the level at which we generally have "herd immunity", meaning that the number of vaccinated individuals in a group is sufficiently high enough to prevent an outbreak when someone comes down with the illness. (To find your school or child care center's immunization rates, go to http://www.sbcphd.org).

Why are there an increasing number of parents filing personal belief exemptions (PBEs) so their children do not need to comply with school vaccination requirements? There are many reasons. A small percentage have legitimate medical conditions or a documented history of adverse reactions that preclude them from safely receiving all of the vaccines. A few may have religious beliefs that do not approve of immunizations. Other parents are simply not adequately informed and still falsely believe there is a link between vaccines and autism: countless research studies have failed to find a causal association. Some believe that their children don't need to be vaccinated because almost everyone else is vaccinated. As mentioned previously, "herd immunity" only holds when vaccination rates are typically above 90 per cent, and many of the schools where PBEs are common are well below this threshold. Some just don't like seeing their little ones getting all those shots (and I can relate as a parent of 3 young children myself; I still turn away when they get pricked).

And yet others are part of a growing group of parents who are highly educated but still choose to file PBEs so their children do not need to get their vaccines upon school entry. For some of them, the miniscule risk, legitimate in their minds or not, is still not worth receiving immunizations because they would rather take the chance that their children catch the diseases naturally, hopefully have only mild symptoms, and develop their own immunity. There are even parties and play dates where parents intentionally expose their children to these vaccine preventable diseases in order for them to get infected and develop immunity.

The problem with these attitudes is that the diseases can be serious; these parents are rolling the dice that their children will not be one of the unfortunate cases that ends up in the hospital or worse. In addition, there is risk to the larger community. Even if one of these unvaccinated children contracts the illness and recovers fully, others around them -- pregnant women, infants too young to receive vaccines, children and adults with immunologic deficits or cancer -- may contract the disease and not be so fortunate.

What can be done about this alarming trend? Several prominent area pediatricians are taking their own measures and have decided they will no longer accept unvaccinated children with PBEs into their medical practices. For them, the risk of vaccine preventable diseases coming in and sitting in their waiting rooms and possibly infecting other children is simply too great.

Public health professionals, the medical community, and schools also need to do a better job at education and outreach about the safety and efficacy of immunizations. After all, vaccines are one of the greatest public health successes in history. In the early 1900s, here in the USA, there were typically 500 000 cases of measles annually, with 8000 deaths. There were 20 000 cases and 1000 deaths from serious _Haemophilus influenzae_ b (Hib) illnesses, which cause meningitis and pneumonia in children under 5 years of age. There were 100 000 cases of pertussis and 5000 deaths. All of these diseases had been almost driven to zero at the start of the 21st century, and maybe that's why many current parents don't feel the immediate threat. But those very diseases are reemerging, and we need to increase awareness of this fact. We can work with the schools to help us with this effort. Local pediatricians need to be ready for these discussions with facts and may need some guidance on how to persuade reluctant parents. There is action at the state level to tighten up the PBE process to make it more difficult to exempt out of vaccines.

Ebola and other new infectious diseases like enterovirus D-68 are scary, and we need to prepare and find effective ways to control them, but there is no current vaccine to protect us against those threats. There is an immunization to prevent pertussis and many other communicable diseases. So, to the parents who choose not to vaccinate their children, I urge you to reconsider. This is not just for the health and well-being of your own children, but for the health of everyone around you, your friends, neighbors, and the community. It is the responsible thing to do.

The Cincinnati Health Department is reporting outbreaks of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, across the city including Elder High School and Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy. The outbreak at Elder began a month ago with one student and quickly spread to 20 students, but before things got out of hand, Principal Tom Otten says the Cincinnati Health Department was called in.

"One of the students came to the school nurse," Otten said. "She realized what she was dealing with at the time, so she alerted the Cincinnati Health Department." Otten, says the health department advised them to follow a strict protocol when a student or faculty member shows symptoms of pertussis. "He goes to his physician and either gets a positive or negative. If it comes out negative, then he's allowed back in class. If it comes up positive that he's got whooping cough, then there's a mandatory 5 day antimicrobial treatment," said Otten.

During those 5 days, the student must stay home. Elder school nurse, Linda Giessler says pertussis is highly contagious. "Pertussis spreads. It can start off like the common cold, you know, cough, sneezing, and because it's respiratory in nature, it's very contagious," Giessler said.

Custodian Jeff Hillgrove says he uses special wipes to sanitize the entire building because the disease stubbornly clings to surfaces. "It actually will live on a surface for up to 7 days, so we've been doing this daily, trying to knock it out, get it out of the school building," Hillgrove said.

Similar steps are being taken at Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, which has reported 5 cases of whooping cough. They hope that at Elder the disease has run its course.

All 20 Elder students are healthy and back in class, but school officials are staying vigilant to make sure the outbreak doesn't spread.

Several cases of pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, have been reported in Chatham County, county health officials said on Thu 14 Nov 2014. In the last month, the Chatham County Public Health Department said it has been dealing with several cases of the respiratory disease.

County health officials said a majority of those diagnosed with whooping cough have been adolescents; however, some of the cases are in children under 5 years old.

The health department is working with Chatham County Schools to identify the students who may have been exposed. The best protection against pertussis is vaccination.

[The morbidity and mortality of pertussis in older children and adults is quite small compared with that in infants under 12 months of age, especially those under 6 months of age. In the wake of the increase in cases in older children and adolescents attributed to unimmunized children and in those with waning immunity attributed to the acellular vaccine (as compared with the classic whole cell killed vaccine), immunization programs have targeted the concept of cocooning the newborn infant by immunization of those around the infant and immunizing the pregnant woman in the 2nd or 3rd trimester.

The following recent publication seems to confirm the relative safety of prepartum pertussis immunization:

Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al. Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes. JAMA. 2014;312: 1897-904.

Abstract:
"Importance: In 2010, due to a pertussis outbreak and neonatal deaths, the California Department of Health recommended that the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) be administered during pregnancy. Tdap is now recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for all pregnant women, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation. Limited data exist on Tdap safety during pregnancy.

"Objective: To evaluate whether maternal Tdap vaccination during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of adverse obstetric events or adverse birth outcomes.

"Design and setting: Retrospective, observational cohort study using administrative health care databases from 2 California Vaccine Safety Datalink sites.

"Participants and exposures: Of 123 494 women with singleton pregnancies ending in a live birth between 1 Jan 2010 and 15 Nov 2012, 26 229 (21 per cent) received Tdap during pregnancy and 97 265 did not.

"Main outcomes and measures: Risks of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births (less than 10th percentile), chorioamnionitis, preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were evaluated. Relative risk (RR) estimates were adjusted for site, receipt of another vaccine during pregnancy, and propensity to receive Tdap during pregnancy. Cox regression was used for preterm delivery, and Poisson regression for other outcomes.

"Results: Vaccination was not associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes: crude estimates for preterm delivery were 6.3 per cent of vaccinated and 7.8 per cent of unvaccinated women (adjusted RR, 1.03; 95 per cent CI, 0.97-1.09); 8.4 per cent of vaccinated and 8.3 per cent of unvaccinated had an SGA birth (adjusted RR, 1.00; 95 per cent CI, 0.96-1.06). Receipt of Tdap before 20 weeks was not associated with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (adjusted RR, 1.09; 95 per cent CI, 0.99-1.20); chorioamnionitis was diagnosed in 6.1 per cent of vaccinated and 5.5 per cent of unvaccinated women (adjusted RR, 1.19; 95 per cent CI, 1.13-1.26).

"Conclusion and relevance: In this cohort of women with singleton pregnancies that ended in live birth, receipt of Tdap during pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy or preterm or SGA birth, although a small but statistically significant increased risk of chorioamnionitis diagnosis was observed." - Mod.LL]
