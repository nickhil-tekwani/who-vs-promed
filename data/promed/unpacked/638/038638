Flaccid trunk paralysis, which leaves the animals unable to feed
themselves, is believed to be spreading across southern Africa. British
experts believe the elephants could have been afflicted by high levels of
pollutants, such as heavy metals, or by plant toxins. The disease seems to
affect male elephants more than females. Park rangers in Zimbabwe have
recently had to shoot bull elephants affected by the condition, mostly in
the prime of life.
Nancy Kock, the British vet who is leading the research from a laboratory
at the University of Zimbabwe, said it was among the most distressing and
mysterious diseases she had seen in animals. "We still don't know what is
causing trunk paralysis but the number of cases is growing. We believe
pollutants or the ingestion of toxic plants, such as thistles, could be
responsible. We can only hope that continued research will provide us with
the answers," she said.
Elephants rely on their trunks for eating by pulling vegetation into their
mouths. In Zimbabwe, however, increasing numbers have been observed trying
to cope with the restrictions imposed by the disease. One technique
involves flicking their heads to throw their trunks across tree branches to
bring vegetation within reach of their mouths. The affected animals also
have problems with drinking. Normally water is sucked up through the trunk,
but the paralysis means they have to wade deep into rivers and lakes to put
their mouths directly into the water. Some animals, already weakened by the
disease, have been swept away by rivers or drowned after sinking into the
muddy beds of lakes.
So far a cure has proved elusive. The disease appears to work by destroying
the nerves controlling trunk movement. Such nerves do not regenerate, so
any animal contracting the disease is doomed. Death, however, can take
months, and as the disease progresses the elephants slowly lose the ability
to feed.
The disorder was first found in two bull elephants nine years ago in
Zimbabwe's Matusadona national park. Since then the number of cases has
steadily increased: 40 corpses have been found and rangers say hundreds
more must therefore have gone undetected in the huge reserves. The number
of live animals with the disease is estimated at several hundred to 2,000.
When the disease was first noticed it was thought to be caused by a
parasitic infection or by injury, but post-mortem examinations showed no
sign of either. Kock and her team believe it is caused by toxins, probably
released by man. Other experts working on the problem agree that pollution
is likely to be involved. Research commissioned by Care for the Wild, an
international animal welfare charity, suggests that flaccid trunk paralysis
is caused by a deficiency of selenium, a trace mineral found in the
vegetation on which elephants commonly feed.
[footnote rescued from original article:
More recently, a number of British zoos reported outbreaks of salmonella in
their
elephant population. At Dudley zoo a 10-year-old African female elephant
died from
salmonella infection, renewing calls for more stringent health regulations
in zoos.
