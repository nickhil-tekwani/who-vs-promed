Abstract
--------
Real-world estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) are important for early detection of vaccine failure. We developed a method for evaluating real-time in-season vaccine effectiveness (IVE) and overall seasonal VE. In a retrospective, register-based, cohort study including all 2 million individuals in Stockholm County, Sweden, during the influenza seasons from 2011/12 to 2014/15, vaccination status was obtained from Stockholm's vaccine register. Main outcomes were hospitalisation or primary care visits for influenza (International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 codes J09-J11). VE was assessed using Cox multivariate stratified and non-stratified analyses adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidities and previous influenza vaccinations. Stratified analyses showed moderate VE in prevention of influenza hospitalisations among chronically ill adults 65 years and older in 2 of 4 seasons, and lower but still significant VE in one season; 53 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 33-67) in 2012/13, 55 percent (95 percent CI: 25-73) in 2013/14 and 18 percent (95 percent CI: 3-31) in 2014/15.

In conclusion, seasonal influenza vaccination was associated with substantial reductions in influenza-specific hospitalisation, particularly in adults 65 years and older with underlying chronic conditions. With the use of population-based patient register data on influenza-specific outcomes, it will be possible to obtain real-time estimates of seasonal influenza VE.

[Annual vaccination against circulating influenza viruses remains the best strategy for preventing illness from influenza. A clear challenge, however, is that vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies from year to year [1]. These variations may be related to differences in antigenic match between the vaccine and the circulating strains, the immune status of those who are being vaccinated, or the time interval between vaccination and influenza outbreaks.

The authors of the above study concluded that overall VE for inpatient and outpatient care was 19 percent, while it was 40 percent during the 2012/13 season, particularly in inpatients over 65 years of age. A similar trend was reflected in the 2013/14 season, but VE was much lower than in the last 2 seasons, at 18 percent. The study also concludes that for the 2 seasons with moderately high VEs, percentages in inpatients with comorbidities were similar to those of the whole population. Stratified analyses on previous season influenza vaccination among those 65 years of age or older showed no clear effects, either protective or negative, against the risk of being hospitalised with a diagnosis of influenza in the current season.

Based on evaluation of multiple vaccine seasons, the authors claim to show substantial protective VE against being hospitalised with a "clinical" diagnosis of influenza among elderly and chronically ill persons in all age groups during 2 of 4 seasons. However, the conclusions have not been based on data supporting reduction of disease burden or disease transmission or any analysis of influenza-associated mortality in vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations stratified by age groups.

For relevant information on different methodologies that can be used to estimate influenza vaccine coverage at national levels among high-risk groups targeted for vaccination based on estimated numerator and denominator data, a comprehensive document published by the World Health Organization is also available [2].

The study recommendation for focusing public health resources towards higher coverage rates in people with underlying diseases is also supported by work of other groups [3].
