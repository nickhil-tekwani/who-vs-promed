--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is believed to be predominantly through respiratory droplets from infected persons in close proximity to uninfected persons, (1) although airborne transmission may also play a role. (2,3) Face shields have been proposed to prevent transmission in the community, (4) but data are lacking. We describe transmission in a community setting before and after the use of face shields.

Methods
Beginning [3 May 2020], community health workers [CHWs] from a research network in Chennai, India, were assigned to counsel asymptomatic family contacts of patients who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at their residence. The workers were housed in separate rooms of hostels and provided food; they did not visit their homes or public places outside work. Prework training was done with no more than 3 persons attending any session. Workers communicated with each other by phone. All workers' nasopharyngeal swabs taken on [1 May 2020], tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Each worker traveled in a small van with a steel partition to prevent air exchange between the driver and the back cabin where the worker sat. Workers maintained constant masking and social distancing when interacting with the driver. Personal protective equipment included alcohol hand rub, 3-layered surgical masks, gloves, and shoe covers. Family members assembled in the front room of each house, and the worker, standing 6 feet [2 m] away, explained the principles of quarantine, mask use, social distancing, hand washing, and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 illness. Family members were asked to wear face masks during the conversation, although workers reported that some did not.

On [16 May 2020], 2 workers developed symptoms. The remaining 60 workers were monitored, and all workers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR between [16 and 19 May 2020], and home visits suspended. Contact tracing was conducted. On [20 May 2020] face shields made of polyethylene terephthalate (250-micron thickness) were added to the equipment provided. After each visit, the shield was decontaminated using an alcohol-based solution, and at the end of the day, soaked in detergent mixed with water. After the introduction of face shields, workers were screened for symptoms and had RT-PCR tests performed weekly.

Family members in the visited homes were followed up for symptoms by daily phone contact with the worker. For symptomatic members, the need for testing was conveyed to local public health officials who subsequently shared the test results with workers. We obtained the number of positive test results in visited households to assess worker exposure.

We compared the number of positive test results before (3-15 May 2020) and after (20 May-30 Jun 2020) the introduction of face shields. The ethics committee of the community research network exempted the study from review and waived the need for informed consent.

Results
Before face shields, 62 workers (40 women) visited 5880 homes with 31 164 persons. From the 5880 homes visited, 222 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, between [4 and 13 May 2020]. 12 workers (19%) were infected during this period. 8 developed symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and anosmia) and 4 were asymptomatic. The 12 infected workers were moved to care centers. 4 developed desaturation and mild breathing difficulty and were treated with oral hydroxychloroquine and oxygen therapy; all 4 recovered. Contact tracing of the workers who tested positive identified 14 van drivers, who were monitored. All were asymptomatic and tested negative between days 7 and 10 after contact with the workers.

After face shields, 50 workers (previously uninfected) continued to provide counseling, visiting 18 228 homes. Among the counseled, 118 428 persons, 2682 subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No worker developed an asymptomatic or symptomatic infection.

Discussion
This study found no SARS-CoV-2 infections among community health workers after the addition of face shields to their personal protective equipment. Because the 1st worker became symptomatic 13 days after beginning home visits and workers had no contact with family, coworkers, or the public, there is no known alternative source of infection for the workers except the asymptomatic contacts of SARS-CoV-2 patients. The face shields may have reduced ocular exposure or contamination of masks or hands or may have diverted movement of air around the face.

Limitations include the before-after design; however, the unique living circumstances of the workers minimized other sources of transmission. Further investigation of face shields in community settings is warranted.

[A PubMed search using the terms COVID and face shields gave 72 results of which 0 (zero/none) actually looked at data on comparative face shielded vs non-face shielded individuals, or community health care workers doing home visits and impact of face shields as PPE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In South Korea, the coronavirus disease outbreak peaked at the end of February [2020] and subsided in mid-March. We analyzed the likely roles of social distancing in reducing transmission. Our analysis indicated that although transmission might persist in some regions, epidemics can be suppressed with less extreme measures than those taken by China.

Article
-------
The 1st coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case in South Korea was confirmed on [20 Jan 2020] (1). In the city of Daegu, the disease spread rapidly within a church community after the city's first case was reported on [18 Feb 2020] (1). Chains of transmission that began from this cluster distinguish the epidemic in South Korea from that in any other country. As of [16 Mar 2020], a total of 8236 cases were confirmed, of which 61% were related to the church (1).

The Daegu Metropolitan Government implemented several measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. On [20 Feb 2020], the Daegu Metropolitan Government recommended wearing masks in everyday life and staying indoors (2). On [23 Feb 2020], South Korea raised its national alert level to the highest level (1) and delayed the start of school semesters (3). Intensive testing and contact tracing enabled rapid identification and isolation of case-patients and reduction of onward transmission (4). We describe the potential roles of social distancing in mitigating COVID-19 spread in South Korea by comparing metropolitan traffic data with transmission in 2 major cities.

The South Korea experience with COVID-19 provides evidence that epidemics can be suppressed with less extreme measures than those taken by China (9) and demonstrates the necessity of prompt identification and isolation of case-patients in preventing spread (4). Our analysis reveals the potential role of social distancing in assisting such efforts. Even though social distancing alone might not prevent spread, it can flatten the epidemic curve (compare Figure 2, panels B, D) and reduce the burden on the healthcare system (10).

Our study is not without limitations. Because of insufficient data, we could not account for differences in delay distributions or changes in testing capacity among cities; line list data were mostly derived from outside Daegu. Nonetheless, the sensitivity analyses support the robustness of our findings (Appendix Figures 5-8). We were unable to distinguish local and imported cases and thus might have overestimated Rt (11). Conducting a separate analysis for Seoul that accounts for imported cases did not affect our qualitative conclusions (Appendix Figure 9). Finally, although the method of resampling infection time can capture qualitative changes in Rt, estimates of Rt can be oversmoothed and should be interpreted with care (K Gostic, unpub. data, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134858). Nonetheless, our estimates of Rt are broadly consistent with previous estimates (12).

We used metropolitan traffic to quantify the degree of social distancing. The 80% decrease in traffic volume suggests that distancing measures in Daegu might be comparable to those in Wuhan, China (13). We were unable to directly estimate the effect of social distancing on population contacts or epidemiologic dynamics. Other measures, such as intensive testing and tracing of core transmission groups, are also likely to have affected transmission dynamics.

Our study highlights the importance of considering geographic heterogeneity in estimating epidemic potential. The sharp decrease in Daegu drove the number of reported cases in South Korea. Our analysis revealed that the epidemic remained close to the epidemic threshold in other regions, including Seoul and Gyeonggi-do. Relatively weak distancing might have assisted the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Seoul (E Shim, G Chowell, unpub. data, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158923).

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, as of today, 20 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug20_1597966319.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 49.0% of daily case numbers and 63.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours. maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 11.8 million cases. Brazil and the USA continue to dominate followed by Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 11.3% of daily case numbers and 7.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and total cumulative cases reported greater than 3.8 million. Spain has replaced Russia as the dominant country and is followed by Russia, France, Ukraine, Germany, Romania, and Turkey -- 3 western European countries who had flattened the curve are now experiencing increased transmission and returns to dominant countries in the region. Israel and Kazakhstan did not report any newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.3% of daily case numbers and 5.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.7 million cases. Iraq continues to dominate, followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Lebanon.

- The African region reported 3.5% of daily case numbers and 4.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.97 million cases. South Africa continues to dominate followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.4% of daily case numbers and 2.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.4 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate followed by Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Viet Nam and New Zealand continue to report newly confirmed cases (5 each) following the new outbreaks identified in the past few weeks.

- The South East Asia region reported 28.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 16.7% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.3 million cases. India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region followed by Bangladesh and Indonesia.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 20 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (68 507), followed by the USA (45 341), and Brazil (44 684) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.2%). There were 6221 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (19-20 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Peru, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, and France. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 4771 to 68 507. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Philippines, Iraq, South Africa, Bangladesh, Iran, Indonesia, Ukraine, Chile, Ethiopia, and Israel; their range of reported new cases is 1630 to 4248. A total of 28 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is very little change in average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 2.6%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 22%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (We haven't changed our minds! -- We feel like a broken record here...). The 22% increase in reported deaths is noteworthy.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 3 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mods.UBA/MPP]
