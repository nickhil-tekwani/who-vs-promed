At least 25 people, including 12 children in Dhunvav village, the site for city's [Jamnagar, Gujarat State] garbage dumping, have fallen ill in the last fortnight. While private doctors said they are suffering from typhoid, government health officials are yet to confirm the nature of the disease. It was only after TOI brought to the notice of Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) notice that medical teams were rushed to the village, which is around 7 km [4.3 mi] from the city.

JMC dumps nearly 200 ton of garbage from Jamnagar in Dhunvav, which is barely 0.5 km [0.3 mi] from the famous Khijadia Bird Sanctuary.

"The garbage has left the drinking water contaminated. It's impossible to sit outside our homes due to the flies," Dhunvav a village sarpanch [an elected head of a village level statutory institution of local self-government called the Panchayat - Mod.LL] said. In fact, she and her husband were among the first to fall ill. "People were falling ill from last 2 months, but it has become severe in last 15 days."

So far 5 patients have been admitted in a private hospital in the city and many are taking local treatment.

Central Province acting medical officer Abel Kabalo said, "As of today [1 May 2013], the cumulative number of people with suspected typhoid at Chindwin Barracks is 144. We are doing our best to contain the disease and people should not panic." Contaminated water at the Barracks is suspected; however, results from water samples are still pending.

"Our appeal to Kabwe residents is that they should not panic. The situation is under control and typhoid is only concentrated at Chindwin Barracks," he said.

Dr Kabalo urged Chindwin Barracks residents to observe high levels of hygiene by boiling their drinking water or adding liquid chlorine to it.

Among children in Canada, most cases of typhoid fever occur after patients travel to endemic areas to visit friends and relatives, according to the findings of a retrospective study. The authors note that recent studies have revealed that typhoid fever can affect children of all ages. "Early studies showed that children and young adults between the ages of 5 and 25 years were the most likely group to be admitted to hospital for typhoid fever; thus, it was thought to be a disease predominantly affecting school-aged and adolescent children," the authors write. "More recently, an Indian study profiling children in hospital in Chennai, India, showed that almost 50 percent of patients in hospital with typhoid fever were 5 years old or younger."

In the current study, the researchers reviewed the records of all patients younger than 18 years who presented to Montreal Children's hospital with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of typhoid fever between 1991 and 2011. They identified 39 patients, with a mean patient age of 7.5 years (range, 10 months-17.7 years). Among the cases, 30 occurred in children who had visited an endemic country, most commonly Bangladesh (10 patients), India (8 patients), and Pakistan (5 patients).

Conversely, 4 patients were newly arrived immigrants or refugees from endemic areas. Among the 30 children who contracted typhoid fever while traveling, none had a record of immunization against _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi before departure.

A total of 34 patients required hospital admission for a mean of 8.8 +/- 3.3 days. 36 patients were treated with 3rd-generation cephalosporins, and the mean duration of treatment was 11.8 +/- 4.0 days. In addition, 23 patients received antibiotics before presentation to the hospital. 36 patients had blood samples that were positive for _S._ Typhi, whereas 26 patients had positive stool samples. Among the 39 isolates, 8 were resistant to both ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 7 were resistant to ciprofloxacin. The most common signs of typhoid fever were anorexia (27 patients), abdominal pain (22 patients), and vomiting (19 patients). In addition, 15 patients had complications after contracting the disease, including hepatitis (4 patients), coagulopathy (3 patients), and meningitis (2 patients).

"The availability of 2 approved vaccines makes this disease potentially preventable for travelers," the authors write. "Family physicians and pediatricians should emphasize the risk of typhoid fever and other travel-related infections (such as malaria) to their patients, especially children whose parents are from endemic areas. This counselling, which should include discussion about safe foods and water, as well as sanitation and hygiene, may be part of regularly scheduled appointments, because parents may not seek medical advice before travelling to their home country."

Health experts are concerned that large numbers of Australians are not getting vaccinations before they travel, with exotic diseases such as typhoid on the rise among returning tourists. With the cost of vaccinations ranging from AUD 25 [USD 25.5] for a flu shot to AUD 250 [USD 255] for a Japanese encephalitis shot, a survey has found up to 2.8 million travellers have failed to have the necessary vaccinations when they have travelled overseas in the past 5 years.

There were 134 cases of typhoid among Australians in 2011, up from an average of about 50 in previous years, the Department of Health's national notifiable diseases surveillance system shows. A Queensland university student died from typhoid in January 2013 after visiting the Middle East and southern Asia.

The president of the Australian Medical Association, Steve Hambleton, said travellers should show some responsibility. "They have to think about their personal risks but also the risks to their country of origin," Dr Hambleton said. "It would be fair to say that if you cannot afford the vaccines you should not be travelling in the 1st place."

A survey released this week conducted by multinational vaccine supplier Sanofi Pasteur of 1042 Australians who have travelled overseas in the past 5 years found more than half did not receive appropriate vaccinations, indicating that 2.8 million travellers had not been appropriately vaccinated. "Typhoid is nasty and it can kill you," said Dr Tony Gherardin, the national medical adviser for the Travel Doctor TMVC [Traveller's Medical and Vaccination Centre'] network of clinics, which released the survey. "It is a bacterial disease from contaminated food or water. The germ invades the gut and multiplies in your body. It is usually characterized by very high fever."

Primarily endemic in the developing world where individuals acquire it from contaminated food and, especially, water, individuals visiting are at risk for typhoid fever. This is particularly true for VFRs, that is 'visitors to friends and relatives', where they are likely to partake of meals that may be contaminated with unclean water. 2 vaccines are available to prevent the infection, an injectable Vi antigen and an oral replication-limited Ty21a mutant. - Mod.LL]
