Food poisoning has hit a military unit of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (Far East, Kurile
Islands). In total, 110 persons have been diagnosed with symptoms of
intestinal infection. It is suspected that canned fish (humpback salmon)
manufactured by a local enterprise ("Senchery") is the source of the illness.
The fish was canned in 2003 (expiration date: August 2005).
Patients received medical aid at the Central District hospital of Yuzhno-
Kurilsk and in a medical battalion of a military unit. 35 persons are
hospitalized. Food products are being sent for bacteriological studies and
clinical and laboratory examinations of victims are being carried out.
