--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether domesticated cats and dogs could be a vector for monkeypox virus is unknown. Here we describe the 1st case of a dog with confirmed monkeypox virus infection that might have been acquired through human transmission.

Two men who have sex with men attended Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, on 10 June, 2022. The men are non-exclusive partners living in the same household. They each signed a consent form for the use of their clinical and biological data, and for the publication of anonymised photographs. The men had presented with anal ulceration 6 days after sex with other partners. In patient 1, anal ulceration was followed by a vesiculopustular rash on the face, ears, and legs; in patient 2, on the legs and back. In both cases, rash was associated with asthenia, headaches, and fever 4 days later (figure A, B).

Monkeypox virus was assayed by real-time PCR. In patient 1, virus was detected in skin and oropharynx samples; whereas in patient 2, virus was detected in anal and oropharynx samples.

12 days after symptom onset, their male Italian greyhound, aged 4 years and with no previous medical disorders, presented with mucocutaneous lesions, including abdomen pustules and a thin anal ulceration (figure C, D; appendix). The dog tested positive for monkeypox virus by use of a PCR [an adapted] protocol that involved scraping skin lesions and swabbing the anus and oral cavity. Monkeypox virus DNA sequences from the dog and patient 1 were compared by next-generation sequencing. Both samples contained virus of the hMPXV-1 clade, lineage B.1, which has been spreading in non-endemic countries since April 2022, and, as of 4 Aug 2022, has infected more than 1700 people in France, mostly concentrated in Paris, where the dog first developed symptoms. Moreover, the virus that infected patient 1 and the virus that infected the dog showed 100% sequence homology on the 19·5 kilobase pairs sequenced.

The men reported co-sleeping with their dog. They had been careful to prevent their dog from contact with other pets or humans from the onset of their own symptoms (ie, 13 days before the dog started to present cutaneous manifestations).

In endemic countries, only wild animals (rodents and primates) have been found to carry monkeypox virus. However, transmission of monkeypox virus in prairie dogs has been described in the USA and in captive primates in Europe that were in contact with imported infected animals. Infection among domesticated animals, such as dogs and cats, has never been reported.

To the best of our knowledge, the kinetics of symptom onset in both patients and, subsequently, in their dog suggest human-to-dog transmission of monkeypox virus. Given the dog's skin and mucosal lesions as well as the positive monkeypox virus PCR results from anal and oral swabs, we hypothesise a real canine disease, not a simple carriage of the virus by close contact with humans or airborne transmission (or both). Our findings should prompt debate on the need to isolate pets from monkeypox virus-positive individuals. We call for further investigation on secondary transmissions via pets.

[Monkeypox virus (MPXV) belongs to the genus _Orthopoxvirus_, family Poxviridae. All pox viruses can, at least experimentally, infect other species besides their natural hosts, but the vaccinia virus (VACV) alone is known to have a wide and almost indiscriminate host range. Due to the high homology between the genomes of VACV and MPXV, the latter may share the same features in the virus entry-fusion step. This feature of pox viruses, especially in view of the reported man-to-dog MPXV transmission, warrants further research involving the susceptibility to MPXV of a wide range of animal species.

Some of the above is available in the review paper:
Gong Q, Wang C, Chuai X, Chiu S. Monkeypox virus: a re-emergent threat to humans. Virol Sin. 2022: S1995-820X(22)00120-1. doi: 10.1016/j.virs.2022.07.006; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virs.2022.07.006

Q & A addressing monkeypox in animals (updated 12 Aug 2022), are available on the WOAH website at https://www.woah.org/en/disease/monkeypox/. 2 of the 9 questions/answers are copied as follows:
1.
Q. Can animals be affected?
A. Various wild mammals have been identified as susceptible to monkeypox virus. This includes rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates, among others. Although it may depend on the route of transmission and infectious dose, some species are asymptomatic, especially species suspected of being reservoirs (rodents). Other mammals, such as monkeys and great apes, show skin rashes similar to those experienced by humans.

Monkeypox infection has also been reported in pet prairie dogs (rodents of the genus Cynomys), which were initially infected by imported rodents, and most recently in a pet domestic dog (genus Canis) as a result of human to animal transmission.

2.
Q.
What messages should be conveyed to at-risk communities to reduce risk of spillover events?
A.
- As a general principle, wash hands after handling wild animals
- Take precautions to avoid being bitten or scratched by animals
- Avoid contact with susceptible animals
- Do not touch wild animals that are sick or have died of unknown causes
- Do not eat raw wild animal meat, uncooked or undercooked food, and food made with wild animal blood
- Immediately inform the Veterinary or Wildlife Services if you find a sick or dead wild animal
- Visit a health centre as soon as possible in case of a scratch or bite from a wild animal
- People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with monkeypox virus should seek medical attention and avoid close direct contact with animals, including domestic pets, livestock, and other captive animals, as well as wildlife.
