[The following two reports illustrate that monitoring for _E. coli_ requires
comprehensive efforts both in terms of product type and geography. In the
case of apple cider, intensified monitoring efforts will involve small
scale producers and associated retail outlets of products not usually
thought to be prime candidates for _E. coli_ food borne disease. It will
also involve international cooperation with specific agencies, which may
vary from country to country, responsible for inspection of products
traditionally associated with food borne disease.- Mod. pc]

MICHIGAN-MADE CIDER RECALLED FOR E. COLI [CONTAMINATION]
LANSING, Michigan.
Michigan State agriculture and health officials were cited as saying that a
routine inspection has detected _E. coli_ contamination in a 100-gallon
batch of cider produced by Schlubatis Orchards of Coldwater, Michigan,
prompting a recall in southern Michigan.
The story says that the orchard, which sells all its cider at a single
farm-stand, is cooperating with authorities by recalling today 300 gallons
sold in gallon and half-gallon plastic containers after Sept. 29. The
story adds that Michigan is one of several states that stepped up
cider-mill testing this year to prevent contamination from reaching consumers.

SOUTH KOREA FINDS NO E.COLI IN 262 MORE BEEF SAMPLES
SEOUL.
South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare was cited as saying today that
it had not detected _E. coli_ O157:H7 in another 262 samples of imported
beef now on sale on the domestic market, adding that "We have not detected
the _E.coli_ bacteria in additional samples of imported beef distributed on
the domestic market."
