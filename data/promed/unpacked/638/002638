Summary: A non-human primate (red howler monkey; _Alouatta seniculus_) was found positive for yellow fever virus (YFV) in Trinidad in February 2021. This represented the 1st detection of YFV in the country since 2009. Rapid sequencing of the virus genome at the University of the West Indies demonstrated that this outbreak was caused by a different lineage compared to the 2009 outbreak.

[Background]
On 8 Feb 2021 an adult, female red howler monkey (_Alouatta seniculus_) carcass was identified and collected by the Veterinary Public Health Unit (VPHU) of the Ministry of Health, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, during their routine YFV surveillance of forested areas. The carcass was one of 2 red howler monkeys found dead in the Brigand Hill area of Plum Mitan, near the east-coast of the island of Trinidad (co-ordinates: 10.488351, 61.085938). During their visit to the area, the VPHU noted the presence of mosquitoes, as well as 2 red howler monkey troops with no obvious signs of illness in those live monkeys visually observed. The carcass, which was intact and had no signs of open wounds, was brought to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Fisheries, where a post-mortem was conducted on 10 Feb 2021.

[Discussion]
Given that continuous YFV surveillance in Trinidad has not yielded positive detections since 2009, we speculate that the lineage may have been introduced relatively recently within that time period. The virus may have been introduced from Venezuela, although the long branch (12 years) and lack of virus genomic sequences from other outbreaks that have occurred in mainland South America more recently than the 2010 Venezuelan outbreak (e.g., including Colombia, French Guiana, Venezuela, amongst others) make it difficult to be fully confident about the country from which the virus was imported.

The current re-emergence of YFV in Trinidad and Tobago is not unexpected. YFV has been introduced to Trinidad at least twice previously over the past 40 years (Auguste, et al., 2010), and epizootics in Trinidad and Tobago occur on average every 10 years (1979, 1988-1989, 1995, 2008-2009, and now 2021) (Auguste, et al., 2010). That YFV has been able to repeatedly disperse across the ocean to Trinidad has implications for our broader understanding of YFV spatial dispersal. Specifically, the involvement of 'bridge vectors' is not necessarily required to explain land-based dispersal of sylvatic [forest] outbreaks across areas that lack suitability for yellow fever virus mosquitos or non-human primates. YFV movement between unconnected patches with high suitability may therefore occur regularly in sylvatic outbreaks. Wind dispersal of mosquitos, human migration, and illegal importation of animals into Trinidad from the mainland all remain possible entry routes for the virus.

[The finding of YFV-infected monkey after a decade-long absence illustrates the value of continuous surveillance. Early detection provides an opportunity for timely response for increased surveillance and assessment of YFV vaccination coverage of the people in the area where the monkeys were found. Although the mechanism for reintroduction of YFV into Trinidad this year (2021) is unknown, the authors propose 3 possibilities: wind-blown mosquitoes, a traveling viremic human, or imported infected animal coming from a YFV-endemic area, probably in South America. Venezuela is the closest country geographically, although there are no recent reports of human or monkey YF cases there. The finding of monkeys dead of yellow fever indicates that the sylvatic (forest) yellow fever virus transmission cycle is active currently, so anyone not vaccinated should become so.
