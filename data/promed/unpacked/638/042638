Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 2 Jul 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [22 Jun 2014], the National IHR Focal Point for the Islamic Republic of Iran reported to WHO an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. On [25 and 27 Jun 2014], the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported the diagnosis of an additional 3 cases of MERS-CoV infection.

Details for the case in Iran are as follows:
The patient is a 44-year-old male, national, healthcare worker (HCW) resident of Kerman province located in southeast Iran. He developed mild symptoms of an influenza-like illness on [6 Jun 2014]. His condition deteriorated as he developed dyspnea and was admitted to hospital on [17 Jun 2014]. Specimens were collected on [17 Jun 2014] and initially tested negative for MERS-CoV on [18 Jun 2014]. His condition continued to deteriorate and he was transferred to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on [19 Jun 2014]. Additional specimens were collected that day and tested positive for MERS-CoV on [20 Jun 2014].

The patient is currently in isolation in a negative pressure respiratory ICU. He does not have a history of travel or contact with animals or consumption of raw camel products in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He is reported to have a comorbidity. In addition, he is reported not to have had contact with a laboratory-confirmed case of MERS; however, he is reported to have had close contact on 26 May 2014 with a patient diagnosed with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at the same hospital where he was working. He is currently in a stable condition.

The SARI patient had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah [pilgrimage to Mecca] between 5 and 15 May 2014. He was diagnosed with SARI on 17 May 2014 and was admitted on the same day. Specimens were collected from him on 22 May 2014 and tested negative for influenza and for MERS-CoV on 24 May 2014. He was transferred to ICU on 26 May 2014 and was intubated. On 30 May 2014, the SARI patient died. Investigation of contacts among health-care workers and family members is ongoing by the provincial health authorities and more information will be provided as it becomes available.

Details for 2 of 3 cases in Saudi Arabia reported on [25 Jun 2014] are as follows:
- A 46 year old male, non-national, and resident of Riyadh city, Riyadh Region who works in construction developed cough and fever on [21 Jun 2014]. He presented to hospital on [24 Jun 2014] and had evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. He was admitted to the hospital on the same day. On [24 Jun 2014], a specimen was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV on the same day. He is reported to have a comorbidity. He reports not to have had contact with laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS or contact with animals. He also reports that he did not perform Umrah or seek health care or consume camel products in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. He is currently in a stable condition in the hospital.

- A 57 year old retired male, national, and resident of Jeddah city, Mecca Region developed respiratory symptoms and fever on [13 Jun 2014]. He presented to hospital on [21 Jun 2014] and had evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. He was admitted to the hospital on the same day. On [23 Jun 2014], a specimen was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV on the same day. He is reported to have comorbidities. He reports not to have had contact with laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS or contact with animals. He also reports that he did not perform Umrah or seek health care or consume camel products in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. He is currently in a stable condition in the hospital.

Details for 3rd case in Saudi Arabia reported on [27 Jun 2014] are as follows:
The case is a 58 year old male, non-national, farmer who works and lives in a farm south of Bisha city, Bisha Region. He had onset of illness with cough and fever on [15 Jun 2014]. He presented to hospital in Bisha city on [22 Jun 2014] and was admitted on the same day with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. On [24 Jun 2014], a specimen was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV on the same day. The case is reported not to have any co-morbid conditions. He reports not to have had contact with laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS or contact with animals. In the farm where he works, he reports that there are no animals, including camels. He also reports not to have performed Umrah or sought health care or consumed camel products in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He is in a critical condition and was transferred to the ICU on [27 Jun 2014]. On the same day, he was transferred to a center in Jeddah to have extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Contact investigation and follow-up of all these cases are ongoing and additional information will be communicated as it becomes available.

Globally, 824 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 286 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO.

[On 11 Jun 2014, WHO announced the confirmation of 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection in 2 sisters in Kerman province, one of whom who had history of contact with a woman with an ILI (influenza-like-illness) who had recently returned from performing Umrah in Saudi Arabia. (see prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (80): S Arabia, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia 20140612.2534478). On 13 Jun 2014, WHO announced the confirmation of another MERS-CoV infection in a 35 year old nurse assistant who had had contact with one of the sisters (see MERS-CoV (01): Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, United Arab Emirates, Iran, WHO, RFI 20140616.2541707). The case mentioned in the 2 Jul 2014 WHO update (see [2] above) is a 44 year old healthcare worker in Kerman province, the same province of the 3 prior cases. Of note is the history of contact with a patient who had a SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) 11 days prior to onset of his illness. Further information on this other patient is not available at present. One suspects that the other patient may well have had a MERS-CoV infection. A key question would be the likely route of transmission of the MERS-CoV to the SARI patient -- is this another individual returning from the Arabian Peninsula, or is there a chain of transmission relating back to the 2 sisters confirmed earlier? We await more information on the epidemiologic investigations surrounding these cases.

Additional disconcerting information is the absence of definable risk factor exposures for the 3 cases reported from Saudi Arabia in the WHO report. Presumable these cases are considered to be "sporadic". A case control study addressing possible risk factors in cases such as these would be very helpful in trying to define risk factors for infection.

According to the WHO update statistics, as of 2 Jul 2014 there had been 824 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 286 deaths. This tally includes cases from Saudi Arabia as of 27 Jun 2014 (see reports presented above in section [1]). If the additional 4 cases and one death reported since 28 Jun 2014 are included, it will raise the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 828 including at least 287 deaths.
