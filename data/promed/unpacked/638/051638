Police officials in northern India were searching on [Tue 6 Feb 2018] for a fake doctor suspected of infecting dozens of his patients with HIV by reusing a dirty syringe.

The patients were treated by what is known as a "jhola chhaap doctor," a wandering medical practitioner whose only verifiable qualification (a chhaap is a trademark or official seal) is a jhola, the cotton shoulder bag from which treatments are dispensed.

Most are untrained, and some of the cures they offer can be dangerous, but in India, where the health care system is tremendously challenged, many poor people often feel they have no choice but to pay a few rupees for their services and hope for the best.

In this case, health officials in Unnao, a primarily rural district 2 hours' drive southwest of Lucknow, became concerned last July [2017] when an unusual number of patients visiting a government hospital began testing positive in routine HIV screening.

Medical officials in Unnao said that they had then tested hundreds of people who lived in the same areas as these HIV-positive patients, including those who seemed perfectly healthy.

At least 33, they found, tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. All of those who tested positive said they had been treated by the same unqualified medical practitioner.

Police officers in the Unnao area are now looking for a jhola chhaap doctor in his mid-40s who rides a bicycle, often sits on a platform in the middle of villages and offers dubious cures. If arrested, police officials said, he is likely to face charges including spreading dangerous disease, impersonating a doctor and practicing medicine without a license.

According to medical officials, he told many of his patients that an injection would make them feel better, and the patients said he kept reusing the same syringe without cleaning it.

Government health officials are offering free HIV treatment to all the people who were infected.

Mohan Rao, the head of the Center of Social Medicine and Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said the prevalence of jhola chhaap doctors was a result of India's overburdened medical system.

"Desperate people find desperate ways to get health care,'' he said. "It's a failure of Indian society, a failure of Indian politics. We spend the lowest on public health care in the world.''

India's government spent 1.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product on health care in 2014, according to the World Bank. China, by contrast, spent 3.1 percent of its GDP on health care that year, and the United States 8.3 percent.

The government said this month [February 2018] that it would offer free health care to half a billion poor Indians, but many details of the plan have yet to be finalized.

A lengthy page on an Indian consumer complaints website describes dozens of encounters with jhola chhaap doctors across India, with bilked patients denouncing "bogus" practitioners who "play with innocent people's lives."

The Delhi Medical Council, a government oversight body, estimates that fake doctors in Delhi outnumber the qualified and registered ones.

[Whether these infections with HIV happened through ignorance of how the virus is spread or greed, laws need to be strengthened to prevent this from happening again. Further, the country needs to make accessible to a greater proportion of the public, education in infectious diseases, chronic disease, medical care, and nursing.

According to the BBC, the Healthcare Federation of India says the country has a shortfall of nearly 2 million doctors and 4 million nurses. It is most prominent in rural swathes where it is estimated that more than 60 percent of primary care visits made by villagers are to fee-charging unqualified practitioners.

The free primary health centres, (which may be several kilometres away in remote areas), are understaffed and open for just a few hours a week.

One controversial approach to correct this situation is to train unqualified practitioners in primary medical care. A non-governmental organization (NGO) that is doing this is Liver Foundation, a Kolkata-based charity. Across India, there are an estimated 1 million "fake" doctors, thus there are more fake doctors than real ones. Training them in basic principles of medicine may be a good approach to prevent situations like the one reported here.
