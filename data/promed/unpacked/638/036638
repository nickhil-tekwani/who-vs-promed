Poultry keepers are being warned that they must take action to protect their birds following an outbreak of avian flu across Europe. Hartlepool Council public protection officials say owners must adopt control measures following the government's decision to create an "Avian Influenza Prevention Zone" across the UK. This means that all chickens, hens, ducks, geese and turkeys should, where practicable, be housed indoors or at least kept separate from wild birds. For farmed geese, gamebirds and other captive birds where housing is less practicable, keepers must take steps to keep them separate from wild birds.

Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] (H5N8) have been confirmed in poultry and wild birds in several European countries. Whilst no cases of the virus -- which is said to pose a very low threat to human health -- have been reported in the UK, the prevention zone has been introduced as a precaution and will remain in place until 6 Jan 2017.

Jane Kett, environmental health manager at Hartlepool Council, said: "Poultry keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns. Clinical signs that poultry keepers should look for in their birds include a swollen head, discolouration of neck and throat, loss of appetite, respiratory distress, diarrhoea and fewer eggs laid -- although these vary between species of bird."

[2] UK (Scotland), preventive measures

The Scottish government has ordered that all poultry and captive birds must be kept indoors, after an alert over avian influenza. In a "precautionary step", it has declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone.

It said it was reacting to multiple reports of the disease causing deaths among wild birds in mainland Europe. The restrictions cover the whole of Scotland and will be in place for 30 days.

Similar measures have been put in place in England.

Bird keepers -- including "hobby farmers" with a small number of hens -- are legally obliged to "take all practicable steps to ensure that poultry and other captive birds kept separate from wild birds".

The government said in most cases this will be by keeping birds housed.

Rural affairs secretary Fergus Ewing said: "We have declared a 30-day prevention zone as a precautionary measure to protect Scotland's valuable poultry industry, particularly in the weeks before Christmas. It is important to stress that there has been no cases of this strain detected in the UK. The Scottish government and its partners continue to monitor the situation in Europe closely and stand ready to respond to any suspicion of disease in Scotland."

Chief veterinary officer Sheila Voas added: "The risk of an HPAI incursion into poultry in the UK remains at 'low, but heightened', although for wild birds the risk has been raised to 'medium'. It is normal to see these viruses circulating among wild bird populations at this time of year, however the strain seen in Europe appears to be particularly virulent which is a cause for some concern. Keeping birds indoors helps to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus, provided that poultry keepers maintain good biosecurity on their premises and remain vigilant for any signs of disease. Consumers should not be concerned about eating eggs or poultry given the expert advice about food safety and human health."

NFU [National Farmers' Union] Scotland said the country's poultry keepers were "up to speed" on the current position and well-prepared to deal with any potential threat. Spokeswoman Penny Johnston said: "It is clear that there is a high risk of infection in wild migratory fowl, posing a risk of cross-infection into our commercial birds. The decision taken by the Scottish government is sensible, given the risk, and producers will play their part. NFU Scotland will continue to monitor the situation and update producers of any changes to the risk status and advice but in the meantime, we urge all poultry keepers to comply with the restriction notice, tighten biosecurity and be aware of the potentially-increased risks from wild birds."

A broiler breeder farm in Masuot Itzhak, south-central Israel, was found H5 positive. 26 000 birds in 6 buildings will be culled. The flock is 60 weeks old. The farm is located 1.5 km [about 1 mile] north-west to the turkey farm in Ein Tzurim [see ProMED-mail post 20161206.4678915].

[The same site (PoultryMed) informed on 8 Dec 2016 about a new outbreak of H5N8 in Israel, namely in a turkey farm in Hatzor, similarly in Hadarom (South), counting 7000 birds, 19 weeks old.]

[PoultryMed also informed on 8 Dec 2016 that Hungary reported 24 new outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 in poultry in the southern part of the country, thousands of ducks and geese to be culled. All outbreaks occurred in either backyard or commercial farms. The largest outbreak involved 26 000 ducks on a farm near the town of Csolyospalos.

The HPAI H5N8 continues its intercontinental march, now circulating in Asia, Europe, the Middle East (reported from Iran, Israel, Egypt; reporting from other countries anticipated) and probably also in the Maghreb (suspected in Tunisia, final serotyping pending). Additional cases in wild birds have been recently reported from Sweden (in Skane Lan and Gotlands Lan counties), Denmark (17 new findings of wild birds in East and West regions), in Switzerland (Bern and Nidwalden cantons) and in the Netherlands (Texel and Friesland).

France reported to the OIE 4 new HPAI H5N8 outbreaks on 8 Dec 2016, all in the department Tarn (South France). This follow-up No. 3 report, including a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=21846.

The accumulated summarised information from France, since the start of the event (25 Nov 2016), as of 8 Dec 2016, is as follows:
Total outbreaks = 12 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 74 553 / 3370 / 3013 / 13 700 / 0
