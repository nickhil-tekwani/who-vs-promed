I felt that I should provide some clarifications on your comment regarding the foraging habits of elephants in this area.

African savanna elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) in southern Africa are mixed grazers and browsers in their foraging habits, but they are most definitely preferential grazers that feed both intensively and exclusively on grasses when these are available in their most palpable stages of growth within their habitats.

My own research on foraging ecology of savanna elephants in the upper Zambezi valley region of western Zimbabwe and northern Botswana showed that they feed almost exclusively on grasses during the peak rainy season periods when grasses are in their most palatable growth stages, only switching over to eating woody plant browse in the form of branches/leaves/bark/roots during dry season periods, or extended intervals during the rainy season period without significant rainfall, when palatable grass forage is either in limited supply or not available.

The rainy season in Botswana/Zimbabwe tends to begin during October/November, at which time the savanna elephants in this region switch from their late season dietary staples of the trunk bark of large trees and the young leaves of newly flushing deciduous trees (especially acacias) to move into open grassland and savanna/scrub areas to feed on new grass growth that emerges immediately after the onset of the first good rains.

Savanna elephants in this region of Africa tend to eat almost nothing except grasses during the rainy season months in years with good rains, with the only exception being fruits from those trees, shrubs, and wild melons that only become available during the rainy season period.

Elephants in this region of southern Africa ingest soils in significant quantities incidentally/accidentally when feeding on newly emerging grass shoots and grass roots which they will scuff up using the toenails on their front feet, and also deliberately ingest large amounts of calcium/sodium rich calcrete clays from mineral licks located in edaphic grassland areas which are referred to locally as dambos or vleis.

[The posting, 23 Oct 2019 Anthrax - Botswana (02): (CH) elephant, susp 20191023.6742740, has the comments: "Preliminary investigations suggest the elephants are dying from anthrax whilst some died from drought effects," and "Due to the severe drought, elephants end up ingesting soil while grazing and get exposed to the anthrax bacteria spore"; which is not to deny the value of Joe's informative comment, and certainly fills an ignorant gap that I had on African elephant feeding. Not unlikely they share a grazing habit of European cattle grazing during a hot dry summer when they are drawn to areas still with some soil moisture and the grass is greener. These saucer areas tend to attract _B. anthracis_ spores as they facilitate spore germination and cell multiplication in the forage root mass. Many thanks to Joe for his valuable comment. - Mod.MHJ
