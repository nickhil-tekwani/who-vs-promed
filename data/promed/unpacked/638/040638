The Department of Health today [15 May 2020] reported that an adult has been diagnosed with meningococcal serogroup B disease and is recovering at home.

Meningococcal disease is an uncommon, life-threatening illness caused by a bacterial infection of the blood and/or the membranes that line the spinal cord and brain, and occasionally of other sites, such as the throat, lungs or large joints.

To date in 2020, 4 meningococcal cases have been reported in WA [Western Australia]. Of these cases 2 were serogroup W, 1 was serogroup Y and 1 was serogroup B. In 2019, 24 cases of meningococcal disease were reported in WA residents, including 3 deaths. Of these, 2 had serogroup W disease and 1 had serogroup B disease. There were no deaths in 2018.

A vaccine to protect against 4 serogroups of the meningococcal disease (serogroups A, C, W and Y) is offered free to all children in WA at 12 months of age, with a catch-up program for children who have not yet received the vaccine and who are aged 1-4 years. Due to a higher rate of meningococcal disease in Aboriginal people in WA, Aboriginal children are offered vaccination from age 6 weeks to 4 years of age. In addition, the vaccine is offered to all teenagers in year 10, with a free catch-up program for 15- to 19-year-olds.

Meningococcal bacteria are not easily spread from person to person. The bacterium is present in droplets discharged from the nose and throat when coughing or sneezing but is not spread by saliva and does not survive more than a few seconds in the environment. Meningococcal bacteria are carried harmlessly in the back of the nose and throat by about 10-20% of the population at any one time. Very rarely, the bacteria invade the bloodstream or tissues and cause serious infections. Sometimes -- but not always -- symptoms may be accompanied by the appearance of a spotty red-purple rash that looks like small bleeding points beneath the skin or bruises. Symptoms of invasive meningococcal disease may include high fever, chills, headache, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, and severe muscle and joint pains. Young children may not complain of symptoms, so fever, pale or blotchy complexion, vomiting, lethargy (inactivity), poor feeding and rash are important signs.

Although treatable with antibiotics, meningococcal infection can progress very rapidly, so it is important that anyone experiencing these symptoms seeks medical attention promptly. With appropriate treatment, most people with the disease recover, although around 5-10% will die and around 15% may experience complications such as hearing loss or gangrene requiring skin grafts or amputations.

[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal disease, infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10% of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.

Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is most common.

Immunity following use of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.

Following the mass introduction into the population of a meningococcal vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.

In Australia, following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34% of cases in 2003 to 5.7% in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60% in 2003 to 83% in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf). ProMED-mail reported in 2016 that serogroup W, rather than B, had become predominant in Western Australia (Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (03): (WA) sg W 20160925.4513543).

As of July 2018, a single funded dose of MenACWY vaccine (Nimenrix) is scheduled at 12 months of age. As of 1 Apr 2019, a single dose of MenACWY vaccine (Nimenrix) is also provided for adolescents through a school-based program (14- to 16-year-olds); those aged 15-19 years who did not receive the vaccine at school can receive it from their GP. MenACWY vaccine is also strongly recommended (but not funded) for infants younger than 12 months of age, adolescents and young adults aged 20-24 years who live in close quarters or who are current smokers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 2 months to 19 years, infants and children 2 months of age or older with medical conditions associated with an increased risk of meningococcal disease (additional doses and boosters required), and travelers to areas where meningococcal disease is more common (http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2019-05/Childhood-schedule-table_May_2019_Final.pdf).

MenB vaccine is recommended for all people 6 months of age and older (but not funded) for infants and young children under 2 years of age, adolescents aged 15-19 years, adolescents and young adults aged 15-24 years who live in close quarters or who are current smokers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 2 months to 19 years, and infants and children aged 2 months and older with medical conditions associated with an increased risk of meningococcal disease (http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2019-05/Childhood-schedule-table_May_2019_Final.pdf).

Invasive meningococcal disease is more common in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/meningococcal-vaccines-in-australia-a-2019-update). In 2019, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had a 10-fold increased incidence of meningococcal disease than the non-indigenous across some age-groups. The most common strains causing infection were types B and W (https://mvec.mcri.edu.au/immunisation-references/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-immunisation-recommendations/). We are not told in the news report above if the patients with meningococcal infection were Aboriginal, their ages, or their immunization status. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Western Australia, covering the entire western third of Australia, is mostly arid, its population being concentrated in the fertile southwest corner and its capital, Perth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia). - Mod.ML
