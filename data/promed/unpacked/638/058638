Salmonella cases rise to 100
---------------------------
A salmonella outbreak in County Down is now believed to have affected up to
100 people. Health officials in Downpatrick say that, although the figure
is expected to increase, the problem is now under control.
A hot food outlet in the town is being investigated as a source of the
infection, and it remains closed.
Doctor Philip Donaghy, who is investigating the source of the infection,
says that it is a particularly severe outbreak. "This is what we would term
an outbreak situation, where we have a significantly larger number of cases
of salmonella than we would expect," he said. "It is almost inevitable
that we will get a few secondary cases."

out to be a "hot food" then it was either under-cooked, or, contaminated
after it was cooked. - Mod.LL]
