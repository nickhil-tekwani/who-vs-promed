Altogether 840 people have succumbed to gastroenteritis in 45 of the 75
districts in Nepal and 51,550 others have been affected by the disease, the
Health Ministry said in a press release Monday. Authorities said that most
of the patients were children aged between three and five. The disease
used to be under control before mid-September in the past years, but this
year it is still raging in the country after that time and the number of
deaths from the disease has increased over the previous years, the ministry
said. During the last three years, a total of 477,419 people suffered from
gastroenteritis.
