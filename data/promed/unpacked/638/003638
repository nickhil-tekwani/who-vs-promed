After allegations that winter-feeding caused a
dramatic jump in Buffalo Valley brucellosis rates
last February [2006], state wildlife researchers
said only 5 percent of elk tested positive during
a similar survey in mid-January [2007].
In late December [2006], Wyoming Game and Fish
Department officials announced an almost 17
percent jump in brucellosis rates in the Buffalo
Valley area after elk were fed on an emergency
basis last February [2006]. Some conservation
groups blamed the jump on the supplemental
feeding, which biologists say congregates
animals, increasing the spread of the disease.
In this year's [2007] study, wildlife officials
tested 39 samples for the _Brucella_ bacteria,
finding it in 2 animals. Researchers also
attached Global Positioning System and VHF radio
collars, and vaginal implant transmitters to 41
female elk. The transmitters are designed to
detect when and where a pregnant female elk
aborts her fetus. Blood from 2 of the 41 elk
froze in the syringe, making it unusable for
brucellosis testing.
Studies of brucellosis rates in Buffalo Valley
from 1987 to 2005 showed disease in 2.7 percent
of the animals. After emergency feeding last
year, brucellosis rates jumped to about 20
percent.
Officials say the jump likely is not caused by
the emergency feeding but rather resulted from
differences in testing methods. The 1987 to 2005
data is derived from hunter samples submitted
during the fall, while the Wyoming Game and Fish
Department used helicopters to capture elk in the
winter during the past 2 years [2005, 2006].
In a statement, Game and Fish wildlife
veterinarian Dr. Terry Kreeger said it was
"highly unlikely"ï¿½ last year's [2006] 20 percent
disease rate was caused by any management action.
"Successive years of data must be collected and
studies repeated before accurate conclusions can
be made," he said.
Hank Edwards, a wildlife disease specialist with
Game and Fish, said biologists aren't sure why
the rate was 20 percent last year [2006] only to
fall again this year [2007].
"I wish we had a good explanation for it, but we
don't have a good handle on that herd unit," he
said. "Are we sampling the same elk? What
difference does snow play?"
"This disease is one of those things, just when
you think you've got a good handle on it, it
throws it back in your face. This is not a closed
system. There's elk moving in and out ... unlike
a research project where we can bleed everybody."
Edwards said he wasn't sure if the data from the
most recent survey are statistically significant.

[Brucellosis is caused by the bacteria _Brucella
abortus_ in elk. The disease is best known for it
ability to induce abortions, although stillborn
and weak calves are other possible effects. It
is difficult to find in these wild animals
because the herds are so dynamic that disease
statistics are not static. The differences in the
percentages of disease suggests hunting vs.
capture plays a large role in the statistical
variation of the numbers. Group feeding or
emergency feeding congregates the animals, which
provides conditions suitable for easy
dissemination, but that may not necessarily be
the whole story to brucellosis in elk. These
theories, management issues, and debates about
brucellosis -- especially in the Greater
Yellowstone Area -- are likely to continue for
some years or until we have advanced
technologically to detect and eradicate this
elusive disease in wildlife.
Etter and Drew published "Brucellosis in Elk of
Eastern Idaho" in the Journal of Wildlife
Diseases, 42(2), 2006, pp. 271-278. This article
suggests there are factors other than emergency
feeding and the method of sampling that may
influence the disease in these elk herds. -
