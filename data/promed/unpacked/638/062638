To the knowledge of Veterinary Services (VS), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), USDA, the measures taken to conserve supplies of _M. bovis_ PPD tuberculin have not caused delays in any testing or movement of animals.

The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL, VS, APHIS, USDA) have been able to consistently supply tuberculin in 5 ml and 1 ml vials, and anticipates supplying 1, 5, and 10 ml vials in the near future. A large shipment (9270 10-ml vials) was delivered this week, alleviating the short-term inventory problems. However, conservation measures to assure an adequate ongoing supply are still needed.

Background:
In 2012, there were 2 companies licensed to produce _M. bovis_ PPD tuberculin for the U.S. market. Due to a large Veterinary Services (VS) inventory of PPD tuberculin at the end of 2012, no contract was put in place for a 2013 purchase. Predictions of use based on the previous 2 years indicated an adequate supply would be available until a 2014 contract would be put in place, and any shortfalls could be made up through production by the NVSL or small open-market purchases from either licensed company.

However, in 2013, as a result of biologics industry restructuring, both of the 2 commercially produced PPD tuberculin products became unavailable. At the same time, usage of PPD tuberculin surged well in excess of 2011 or 2012 levels, thus creating a shortage.

In August 2013, NVSL implemented conservation measures when distributing the product to ensure that the most critical need areas had an ongoing tuberculin supply. These included: restricting volumes of single deliveries; requesting laboratories order more frequent, smaller volumes; and requesting additional information with orders. NVSL ramped up its production levels, and an expired batch of product was tested and approved for extension of its dating. Recently, one of the commercial products became available again. A 2014 contract for purchase is in place. Other methods to alleviate the shortage have been and continue to be evaluated.

We hope this additional information is useful to your readers, and we would be happy to assist further if needed.
