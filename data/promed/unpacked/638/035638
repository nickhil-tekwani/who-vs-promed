[At the time of submission, the Palestinian Authorities regarded the serotyping of the samples from the commercial dairy enterprise in the Gaza strip as "pending".

We have since noted from a reliable source, that this outbreak on both farms was serotyped as FMDV serotype O, likely to be closely related or identical to previous FMDV isolates from the territories controlled by Israel (similar to previous isolates during 2017 from the Gaza strip, Israel and Hebron area and from a Kibbutz near the Gaza strip. - Mod.AS
