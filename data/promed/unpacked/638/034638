Concerning Larry McDougal's comment that "an antibiotic of this class has a
well known potential for resistance development", I must strongly challenge
that statement. It has been used for over 40 yrs and not until the late
80's did resistant strains emerge and were recognised. They had developed
their resistance by the aquisition of 5 essential genes, not a trivial
task. In fact this is the most sophisticated resistance mechanism
presently known. It should also be noted that the resistant strains first
occurred in France and the UK, soon to be followed by the US. None of
these countries have ever used a glycopeptide antibiotic of any description
in animal feeds. The countries where it has been extensively used have to
my knowledge low vancomycin resistant _Enterococcus_ (VRE) incidence. It
appears to me that there could be more than one explanation and everyone
appears to be jumping on the obvious without thinking this through.

In a recent article on the sequence homology of ligases (Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. 94: 6480-6483, 1997) it was observed that there was a 70% homology of
the ligase in the VRE resistance genes to one found in the
vancomycin-producing organism _Amycolatopsis orientalis_, which is a soil
organism. So gene transfer could have been occurring all along between co
mingling organisms. Only when oral use of vancomycin for CDAD (definition
?) [became widespread did the presence of vancomycin in the gut select out
those [bacteria containing the resistance genes. [Resistant bacteria
could have already been there for quite [some time,
generally not making a nuisance of themselves. Their presence therefore
[appears not [to be a result of the use of a glycopeptides in animals but
due to the presence of many glycopeptides in normal soil organisms. A point
that could be in favour of this argument is a case reported last year of a
_Streptococcus bovis_ (another gut organism) infection in a pediatric
patient from Zaire [Democratic Republic of Congo
(Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 41:24-29, 1997). [The organism
infecting this patient had the vanB
related genes without ever coming near to any glycopeptide antibiotic
either from an animal feed or from therapy. Thus, it would be interesting
to investigate totally naive populations to check for the presence of the
vancomycin resistance genes in any of their gut flora. Is this pediatric
AIDS patient from Zaire a solitary case or is the vancomycin resistance
gene [complex more widely spread than we thought?

[The complex of genes that code for vancomycin resistance must come from
somewhere, so Robin Cooper's suggestion that they are derived from soil
microorganisms that must survive in the same environment as
vancomycin-producing bacteria seems like a good bet. Wherever they come
from, the genes become a special threat in human medicine when they
circulate on plasmids, some of which include transposon sequences that
facilitate movement among plamids and bacterial chromosomes. The
introduction of vancomycin into such an environment could easily induce
selection for a predominance of resistant bacteria. I don't know why
widespread vancomycin resistance has not emerged more quickly. Perhaps
development of resistance carries a significant cost for the bacterium due
to energy requirements or decreased efficiency of peptidoglycan
cross-linking. - Mod.ES

Regarding the point by Dr. McDougald about avoparcin not being used in
commercial poultry feed, I recall about 5 years ago walking through a farm
supply store in Minnesota and seeing several long aisles devoted to feed
additives. One of the items available was avoparcin - in impressive
quantities (tens of pounds). If not for routine use with commercial
poultry, then what was it used for? Has it become unavailable sometime in
the last five years?
Regarding the 3rd of 'two important points' (or perhaps the 'unimportant'
point among the 3), decrying the use of vancomycin for
troublesome-but-not-life-threatening infections, restrictions on the use of
vancomycin in hospitals are becoming common but, as a rule, we do not
design these restrictions according to vague distinctions between
troublesome and life-threatening infections, nor do I believe this is
helpful. Rather, for vancomycin therapy beyond a short-term prophylactic
or perioperative course, we generally require documentation of an infection
with a susceptible organism and lack of a more suitable alternative, or a
clinical response best explained by vancomycin therapy. The serious
toxicity, risks, and expense of vancomycin therapy often makes any
alternative agent more suitable if it is available, as effective, and
tolerated.
[I would like to make two points in response to comments about how
remarkable it is that vancomycin has exhibited such longevity as a
clinically useful agent. First, penicillin G as the first antibiotic (or
even sulfonamide, whose use preceeded penicillin by a few years) remains an
effective agent - even the drug of choice - for a number of common
infections. In this light, the longevity of vancomycin is far less
remarkable than most other antibiotics which have higher propensities for
the emergence of resistance. Second, since vancomycin acts by binding to
the substrate of a vital enzymatic reaction, it differs in a fundamental
way from most other agents for which resistance may arise from a single
mutation in an enzyme or ribosome. In this light, the longevity of
vancomycin is less remarkable than our lack - after 40+ years of searching
- of any other agents which act by targeting substrates.

[Thanks to Paul Axelsen for clarifying the ways in which Infectious Disease
specialists make decisions about the use of vancomycin, and for his other
comments. Now, I'm off to the feed store to look for avoparcin. - Mod.ES

As much as I agree with Prof. McDougald's view that more important to the
emergence of resistant strains is the [improper use of antibiotics in
humans, I disagree with the moderator's view that the long safety record of
avoparcin is a demonstration of its [negligible role in the emergence of
resistant strains. Antibiotic resistance has many timetables. It can be
reasonably fast, as with ciprofloxacin and _Staphylococcus aureus_ in
certain areas of the USA, but it can take a very long time, as with
cloroquine resistance [which took little more than a decade for
_Plasmodium falciparum_, but almost 50 years for _P. vivax_. We can't
expect micro-organisms to set their clocks with ours.

[After years of looking for the "smoking gun" around the practice of using
antibiotics to stimulate the growth of livestock, the volume of hard data
supporting the hypothesis that this practice has a major impact on human
medical practice is surprisingly small. I agree that it would be easiest
from the perspective of the medical practitioner to play it safe, and to
avoid using antibiotics in livestock management, but in a capitalist
democracy, we can't always have it our way. I am pleased with the quality
of the contributions to this discussion that we have received. I think
that all major issues have been addressed in some manner, and I will now
cut this thread. -Mod.ES
