10 more babies have tested positive for salmonella in France after drinking milk produced by the firm Lactalis, a group representing families said on Fri 26 Jan 2018.

Lactalis, one of the world's largest dairy groups, has recalled 12 million tins nationwide and from stores around the world after last month, December 2017, discovering salmonella bacteria in some baby milk at a factory in western France.

French authorities have said that _Salmonella_ Agona infections were reported in 38 cases between mid-August 2017 and December 2017, 36 of them clearly linked to Lactalis milk. But Quentin Guillemain, president of the Association of Families of Victims Contaminated with Salmonella (AFVLCS), told reporters that there were "at least 10 families to this date not accounted for" whose children had tested positive for _Salmonella_ after drinking Lactalis milk. Another case has been confirmed in Spain, and one is suspected in Greece. The recalls have stretched as far as China.

Leclerc, Auchan, Carrefour and Systeme U have all acknowledged that some baby milk recalled by Lactalis made it onto their shelves. The consumer protection body DGCCRF has performed 3600 checks in the past 2 weeks and found recalled products in 2 supermarkets, 13 pharmacies, one hospital and 6 other distributors, the economy ministry said.

[With the sheer scope and size of the recall and the number of countries that the potentially contaminated product was shipped to, it is surprising that there are not more cases reported. - Mod.LL
