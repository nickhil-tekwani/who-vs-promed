Slovakian health officials [have reported] an increase in the number of cases of the sexually transmitted infection syphilis in 2014 compared to 2013. Slovak media report 370 syphilis cases in 2014, a 23 per cent increase from 2013. The regions of Bratislava and Kosice have seen the most cases.

"6 children under 15 [years of age?] were diagnosed with syphilis, too, including a baby who was born with the disease in Trebisov district in the Kosice Region," the report notes.

Syphilis is primarily a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a bacterium [_Treponema pallidum_]. It is transmitted by unprotected oral, anal or vaginal sex. Early symptoms of infection may include a painless ulcer or chancre, rash, fever, swollen or enlarged lymph nodes, hair loss, and headaches. Symptoms may or may not be present. If left untreated, syphilis can cause serious health complications including heart problems, brain damage, blindness and even death.

[In many localities worldwide, the incidence of syphilis is increasing predominantly among men who have sex with men (MSM), a population that has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection and high-risk sexual behavior, such as lack of condom use, multiple anonymous partners and use of psychoactive "party" drugs and mobile phone dating apps -- for example, Tinder and Grindr, that facilitate anonymous "hook-ups". In some communities, MSM are also having unprotected sex with women, which has contributed to concurrent increasing incidence of syphilis in women and congenital syphilis.

The news report above does not characterize the cases of syphilis in Slovakia, except to say that 6 of the 370 cases in 2014 occurred in children under 15 years of age, including 1 case of congenital syphilis. The rising number of cases of syphilis in Slovakia may also be due in part to increased syphilis screening. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Slovakia is a country with a population of over 5 million in Central Europe bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east and Hungary to the south (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava). Slovakia is a member of the European Union and is subdivided into 8 regions: The Bratislava Region is located in the south western part of Slovakia; Bratislava is its capital and largest city, with a population of about 500 000; The Kosice Region with a population of 766 012 is located in the southern part of eastern Slovakia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko≈°ice_Region). - Mod.ML
