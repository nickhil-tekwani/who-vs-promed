Outbreak of rare bacterial infection hits students in South Korea
-----------------------------------------------
More than 140 South Korean students have been infected in an outbreak
of a rare bacterial disease in June 2005, the nation's state-run
disease agency said on Mon 4 Jul 2005.

According to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(KCDC), a total of 142 school students in the city of Guri, located
in the very east of Seoul, were infected with _Arcanobacterium
haemolyticum_ starting on 20 May 2005.

The non-lethal pathogen can cause tonsillitis, chronic skin ulcers
and other illnesses and is known to affect animals as well as humans.

"The infection of 142 students was discovered when the KCDC was
conducting epidemiological tests on 10 patients at a Guri hospital
suffering from unknown causes," said an official from the center.

The KCDC said that it has confirmed the infection by _A.
haemolyticum_ from samples taken from 8 patients.

It is the 1st reported case of a mass infection by the bacteria in South Korea.

Tough strain of bacteria found in Gyeonggi kids
-----------------------------------------------
A strong, antibiotics-resistant strain of bacteria [see below - Mod.
LL] has been spreading in the outskirts of Seoul among children and
teenagers with summer colds. The Korea Center for Disease Control and
Prevention announced that the bacteria, known as _Arcanobacterium
haemolyticum_, was found in more than 140 students with cold symptoms
in Guri, Gyeonggi province.

_Arcanobacterium haemolyticum_ is resistant to antibiotics, the
center said. Health authorities have said the bacteria could be
dangerous to people with compromised immune systems, who could
experience liver damage and falling blood pressure.

The center received information last month [June 2005] about 10
children hospitalized for an unidentified illness in Guri. While
investigating, health authorities came across more than 100
elementary, middle and high school students with similar symptoms.

Most students reported symptoms similar to those associated with
scarlet fever, including fevers and rashes. In severe cases,
students' blood pressure dropped, and doctors say their livers could
have been damaged. "Of the patients, 90.8 percent are students at the
same school in Guri," said Park Gi-dong, director general of the
center. "The disease is thought to have spread through dormitories
and classrooms where the students spend time together. The virus
could have already spread throughout the country."

[Initially named _Corynebacterium haemolyticum_, the bacterium now
termed _Arcanobacterium haemolyticum_ was 1st described in 1946 as
the pathogenic agent causing pharyngitis and cutaneous infections
among US servicemen and indigenous peoples of the South Pacific in
1946. As a result of its close resemblance to _Corynebacterium
pyogenes_, some investigators believed the bacterium to be a mutant
of this species and appended a subspecies name, _C. pyogenes subsp.
hominis_. Based on its biochemical and nucleic acid characteristics,
the bacterium was renamed and reclassified as the 1st member of the
genus _Arcanobacterium_, which means secretive bacteria, in 1982.

Primarily causing an exudative pharyngitis with a rash that may look
like scarlet fever, the spectrum of diseases caused by _A.
haemolyticum_ has been expanded to include invasive infections,
including sepsis and osteomyelitis. Epidemiologically, _A.
haemolyticum_ is likely spread through an unknown route by human
contact with people who are infected. The chronic carrier state
appears to be rare. The pathophysiology of the rash is unknown;
however, it is thought that the rash is caused by a bacterial
exotoxin.

Osterlund (Are penicillin treatment failures in _Arcanobacterium
haemolyticum_ pharyngotonsillitis caused by intracellularly residing
bacteria? Scand J Infect Dis. 1995; 27:131-34) found that, despite
being fully sensitive to penicillin in vitro, penicillin treatment
failures of _A. haemolyticum_ were frequent. The ability of _A.
haemolyticum_ to survive intracellularly for 4 days, thus creating
intracellular reservoirs of bacteria, might explain this dichotomy.
Osterlund also showed that erythromycin, an antibiotic known to
penetrate well intracellularly, efficiently killed these bacteria. -
