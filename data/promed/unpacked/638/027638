Death from amoeba brings swim warning
WICHITA FALLS, Texas - The death of a 9-year-old Oklahoma boy from an often
lethal and rare amoeba he inhaled while swimming has public health
officials warning swimmers to beware of stagnant water during the current
drought.
"Swimming in lakes and ponds in drought conditions and triple-digit
temperatures can be risky," said David Bergmire-Sweat, an epidemiologist
for the Texas Department of Health.
"For the majority of people who do it, they are fortunate. . . . But for a
few unfortunate, it can be lethal. It's sad."
The boy died Thursday of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM, after
he inhaled an amoeba called _Naegleria fowleri_ into his nose. He had been
swimming in Lake Arrowhead in Wichita Falls.
A spokesman with the local Public Works Department said it's best to swim
in swimming pools in this hot and dry weather. PAM is not contagious, and
the amoebas can't survive in properly treated and cleaned chlorine swimming
pools, he said.
Amoeba are more likely to invade lakes and ponds during hot weather because
the bacteria on which they feed is more abundant.
Health officials say temperatures in the North Texas, which have soared
above 100 degrees for almost two straight weeks, probably have contributed
significantly to bacteria growth.
"It's just dangerous to swim in lakes and ponds that aren't well taken care
of," said Mr. Bergmire-Sweat. "The heat is perfect for bacterial growth."
The amoeba enters the body through the nose and works its way to the brain
through spaces in the still-developing skulls of children, according to the
Texas Department of Health. Symptoms include severe headaches, high fever,
stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, seizures and hallucinations. The symptoms
usually appear several days after the amoeba enters the body.
Death usually occurs within a week, according to health officials.
