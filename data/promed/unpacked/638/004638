Eritrea: Reported meningitis outbreak under control - WHO
---------------------------------------------------
The onset of seasonal rains in Eritrea has helped to bring under
control an outbreak of meningitis that killed 1 child in the southern
Debub Zone, a WHO official told IRIN. Another 33 cases had been
reported in 9 villages in the zone, the WHO country representative in
Eritrea, Andrew Kosia, said on Wed, 23 Mar 2005.
"Luckily enough, it is under control now," he said. "What I can say
perhaps is divine intervention [played an important role] because
when it rains, that reduces transmission of the disease."
Between March and May, Eritrea's central highlands, where the Debub
Zone is located, along with other parts of the country, tend to
receive scattered rains (called the Azmera rains), followed by the
main rainy season (Kremti) between July and September.
"Any airborne disease like meningitis, when it rains heavily, [is
slowed because the rain] stops the spread of certain bacteria," Kosia
told IRIN in the capital, Asmara.
Kosia said a surveillance team from the Eritrean Health Ministry had
traveled to the Debub Zone after receiving information of a possible
outbreak, took samples and sent them for testing in Kenya and South
Africa.
"We are now going to vaccinate about 25 000 people [in Debub Zone],"
Kosia told IRIN. "This is one area where meningitis is endemic, but
the chances of it recurring are slim because we are now entering the
rainy season."

Meningococcal disease in Chad
---------------------------------
From 1 Jan -16 Mar 2005, the Ministry of Health has reported 387
cases including 53 deaths (case fatality rate, 13 percent) in Chad. 2
districts have reached the epidemic threshold: Bongor (124 cases and
6 deaths) and Moissal (64 cases and 16 deaths).
_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A has been confirmed in 9 out of
16 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
The Ministry of Health began a mass vaccination campaign on 11 Mar
2005 in the affected districts. The International Coordinating Group
(ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control will be
providing an additional 200 000 doses of bivalent vaccine. Medecins
sans Frontieres-Luxembourg is supporting the Ministry of Health in
implementing the mass vaccination campaign and WHO is providing
technical assistance for enhanced surveillance.
