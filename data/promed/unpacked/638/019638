Measles has hit 2758 people in Somalia, and anti-vaxxers in Minnesota aren't helping Somali-Americans either.

In late 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified a number of diseases that broke out across Somalia as a result of the country's drought, including measles, which now afflicts more than 30 children in Minnesota's Somali community. A WHO press release in late February 2017 pointed to widespread drought conditions as a major cause in the spread of diarrhea, cholera, and measles. This is in part due to the drought severely reducing the availability of safe, clean drinking water. WHO reports that in the 1st 7 weeks of 2017 alone, over 6000 cases and 65 deaths from diarrhea and cholera were reported in Somalia. A total of 2758 cases of suspected measles were reported as of September 2016.

"Somalia is now at a critical point as a result of this drought and environmental hazards and lack of basic services," said WHO regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr Mahmoud Fikri in the press release. "Less than half of the population in Somalia has access to basic health services. WHO is providing all possible support to address the ongoing challenges and reduce the dire consequences of drought and pre-famine."

Recently, measles has begun to ravage the Somali community in Minneapolis as well. More than 30 cases have been reported in Minneapolis, with most of these afflicting unvaccinated children.

On the heels of this, anti-vaccine activist Mark Blaxill addressed a crowd of 90 people on Sun night [30 Apr 2017], most of whom were Somali-American parents, reports the Star Tribune. Blaxill is the co-founder of the Canary Party, a political party which opposes vaccines and other medical advice. "It should be the right of every parent and family to make their own decisions," said Blaxill according to the Star Tribune.

Public health officials note that the vaccination rate in the Somali community has fallen amid fears of autism. "They're our families," Dr Paula Mackey, a worker at a clinic that treats many Somali-Americans, told the Star Tribune. "[Somali parents] are just trying to do what is right for their children, and this misinformation is hurting them."

Officially, measles was eradicated in the United States in 2000, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. The cases that do occur usually crop up due to international travel. Somalia's current epidemic may be due to travel between the Somali-American community and their home country.

As of 22 Apr 2017, there have been 61 recorded cases of measles in the United States so far in 2017 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. This is nearly the same total as 2010 and 2016, and more than the 2012 total. 2017 does remain well below 2014's count of 667 cases, both in total count and in rate over the course of the year.

An outbreak of measles in Minnesota has sickened more than 30 children in recent weeks, primarily in the state's large Somali-American community, where many parents avoid the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine [MMR] because of unfounded fears that it causes autism. "This has nothing to do with being Somali; it has everything to do with being unvaccinated," Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director of the Minnesota Department of Health, told CBS Minnesota last week as the number of cases grew.

Somalis are just the latest example of a tight-knit community in which the highly contagious disease has gained a foothold in the US in recent years. "With Somalis, we know that it's a community that's been targeted for misinformation from the anti-vaccine community and so that's a bit distressing," she said. Medical professionals and state health officials are working to contain the virus, but they expect more measles cases in coming weeks. A look at the situation:

Measles outbreak
----------------
As of Wed [3 May 2017], 34 measles cases were confirmed in Minnesota. It's the largest outbreak in the state since 1990, when 460 people contracted measles and three died. Nearly everyone infected is unvaccinated, and all but a few are of Somali descent. So far, 11 children have been hospitalized.

The source of the outbreak is unknown, said Ehresmann. But since measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, outbreaks in the US are typically caused when international travelers are infected overseas and bring the virus home.

Nine other states have seen measles cases so far this year [2017], but none has reported an outbreak of Minnesota's magnitude, according to CDC.

Why Somalis?
------------
Somali children are getting sick because the community has a low rate of immunization for MMR, Ehresmann said. Unvaccinated children from other communities are also at risk. According to the Health Department, 42 per cent of Minnesota-born Somali toddlers had received the MMR vaccine as of 2017 [compared with 88 per cent of non-Somali toddlers - Mod.LK].

But the community's immunization rate hasn't always been that low. In 2004, 92 per cent of Somali toddlers had the MMR vaccine. The community's immunization rate fell sharply to 70 per cent in 2008 amid a perception that autism was becoming commoner among Somali children.

A University of Minnesota study that examined 7-9 year olds in Minneapolis in 2010 found no statistical difference between the rate of autism among Somali children and white children, Ehresmann said.

Opting out of vaccines
----------------------
Minnesota law requires that a child be vaccinated before enrolling in child care, early education or school. But it also allows exemptions for medical reasons or "conscientiously held beliefs". A 2014 study by the American Board of Family Medicine found 35 per cent of Somali parents surveyed believed the measles vaccine causes autism, compared with 8 per cent of non-Somalis.

Research that links the vaccine to autism has been widely discredited. But Anab Gulaid, a University of Minnesota researcher who worked on the autism study, said autism is often diagnosed in children around the same age as they receive their measles vaccine, so some fears persist. "It's an emotional issue for people," she said.

Other communities with low vaccination rates have also been affected by measles in recent years. Nearly 20 people in the Orthodox Jewish community in Los Angeles were sickened by measles in December [2016]. 58 were sickened in 2013 when the measles swept through Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. In Ohio, 360 people got the measles in 2014 after unvaccinated Amish travelers visited the Philippines and brought the disease home.

Minnesota health officials say they'd like to see at least 95 per cent of the population immunized to protect everyone from measles, a highly contagious disease that can cause respiratory problems, brain swelling, or death.

Community fears
---------------
Dozens of Somali parents attended a recent meeting organized by groups that believe there's a link between vaccines and autism. Some in attendance said they would rather face measles, or a child's death, than a lifetime of autism.

Patti Carroll, with the Vaccine Safety Council of Minnesota, said the goal was to empower parents. "We did a presentation that helped the Somalis put the measles and the MMR vaccine into perspective," Carroll said. "It's their right to say no."

Sophia Mohamed, a New Brighton mother of 2 who believes her 16 year old son got autism after receiving the MMR vaccine as a toddler, said officials need to listen to parents like her. "We are not against the vaccine, but we want a safe vaccine," Mohamed said. "We have a choice ... I don't need any researcher to tell me. I know. I saw the results."

Medical community on alert
--------------------------
Evidence-based research has repeatedly shown no relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism, and there should be no hesitations about vaccines, said Patsy Stinchfield, senior director of infection control at Children's Minnesota hospital. "In medical science, there is no debate about the safety of vaccines," she said.

Stinchfield worked at the hospital during the 1990 outbreak and recalls when an entire floor was turned into a measles ward. Two of the 3 deaths that year were children at the hospital. The hospital has taken extra precautions.

On Tuesday [2 May 2017], two workers sat at a desk outside the clinic's main lobby, assessing all patients who entered for risk of measles. A negative air filter hummed in the background, sucking away contaminated air, while all the clinic's tiniest patients and parents were told to wear masks. Anyone with measles' symptoms is ushered in through a back door, away from other patients.

Amira Hassan, 4, came for a wellness check Tuesday [2 May 2017] and wore a mask in the waiting room. Her father, Mohamud Hassan, said she's been vaccinated, and he doesn't refuse a vaccine if a doctor says it's OK. Hassan, who is Somali, said rumors about vaccines persist, but it's best to ask a doctor or someone who knows. He chose vaccination, saying: "If your child is going to school, you don't want other kids to be affected too."

West Australians heading overseas, particularly to Bali, are being warned to make sure they have been vaccinated against measles, following a further case contracted on the island. WA Health medical epidemiologist Gary Dowse said there had been more than 20 separate importations of measles from Bali to WA since 2013, including 7 already this year [2017], which is more than for any other overseas travel destination.

"Unfortunately, it is not unusual for Australians to be infected with measles overseas, including in Bali, but the increase in the number of cases in WA and other states in recent months suggests there is an ongoing measles outbreak in Bali," Dr Dowse said. "With high vaccination coverage, naturally occurring measles has been eliminated from WA for around 20 years, but occasional cases and small outbreaks still occur associated with tourists or WA residents who are infected overseas."

He said every imported measles case was treated as a public health emergency because of the risk of local spread, including to those most vulnerable to infection such as infants too young to be vaccinated, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems. Travellers returning from Bali or other countries who developed a fever with other symptoms -- including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash -- within 2-3 weeks of returning home, should see their doctor.

Dr Dowse said public health staff had also been providing information to people who were potentially exposed to the most recent Bali measles case where they were known, but it was not possible to identify and specifically warn people who were in public places. People could have been exposed to the recent case at locations in Perth [listed in the URL above].

Measles is contagious for about 4 days before and after the development of the rash. Children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune.

Despite progress, measles kills 400 children a day, says WHO. After 31 measles cases in the Western Cape this yearâ there was also an emergency vaccination campaign in Stellenbosch and parts of the Western Cape.

"There has been a cluster of 15 cases in Gautengâ which is higher than usual numbers for measles. Ten of these cases were linked to one unvaccinated familyâ who were unvaccinated for religious reasons. Most of the cases were in City of Johannesburg. There has been one case in Ekurhuleni and one in Tshwaneâ" said Dr Melinda Suchardâ head of the Centre for Vaccines and Immunology at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. "In responseâ the Gauteng Department of Health has already conducted vaccination campaigns at the school the affected children attended. Due to the high priority given to measlesâ a wider vaccination campaign is now being conducted in whole province."

Suchard explained: "There has recently been a measles outbreak in the Western Cape which comprised 35 cases from January to March 2017. The outbreak was stopped by a vaccination campaign in that province. Measles is targeted for eliminationâ meaning we are hoping to stop the spread of the disease within South Africa by 2020."

The measles vaccine in the state system are provided for free and are usually given to children who are six months old and then again at 12 months. But some mothers forget to get the vaccine for their child when they turn one or they don't have money for transport to the clinic. There are also anti-vaxxers who don't vaccinateâ explained Blumberg. This results in some children not being protected from measles - a concern as the disease can spread quickly.

WHO says, "Measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available." It says that globally during 2000-2015 measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.3 million deaths - "making measles vaccine one of the best buys in public health."

Spike of measles cases in Gauteng Province, South Africa, including 10 cases connected to an unvaccinated family, for religious reasons. Mass vaccination under way
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a spike in measles cases in Gauteng - including 10 cases all connected to a family with children who were not vaccinated due to their religion. This increase in cases has led the department of health in Gauteng to embark on a mass vaccination campaign at schools and crÃ¨ches to prevent an outbreak of the highly infectious disease.

An emergency campaign will ensure all children in schools and crÃ¨ches are given the measles injection regardless of whether they were vaccinated as infants or not. The Gauteng campaign will vaccinate all children at schoolsâ aged from 6 months -- 15 years oldâ until 26 May.

National Institute of Communicable Diseases spokesperson Professor Lucille Blumberg said there had been more measles cases in the Western Cape and Gauteng than normal. "The Gauteng department of health is being proactive with their vaccination campaign and they are trying to prevent further cases and prevent a full blown outbreakâ" she said.

[According to a report in the Saturday Star (submitted by Kunihiko Iizuka) http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/family-linked-to-measles-outbreak-in-gauteng-8980247, there are now an unprecedented 17 cases in Gauteng, and 5 of the patients are under 5; one is aged 45, and the remainder are between 5 and 15. We only had 11 cases over the past year. Now we have 17 in a month.

A severe outbreak between 2009 and 2011 in South Africa included more than 18 000 confirmed cases and led to multiple deaths.

Last year [2016], a study in the SA Medical Journal, "A profile of anti-vaccination lobbying on the South African internet, 2011-2013," found South Africans were creating web pages or blogs for anti-vaccination lobbying [see report below]. These web pages claimed that vaccines were ineffective and that vaccination was profit driven. Christine Hewlett, who founded Vaccine Awareness SA, previously told the Saturday Star that she believed the number of people who refused vaccines was "very small, but there is a growing awareness. They may not all refuse vaccines, but they're certainly questioning vaccines."

"Many of these anti-vaccination lobbyists are parents, so it's possible a growing number of young South Africans parents are using a search engine to find information about vaccination and are encountering misinformation instead," said the study.

Previous global studies on internet-based anti-vaccination lobbying had not identified anti-vaccination web pages originating in South Africa (SA).
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective. To characterise SA [South African] internet-based anti-vaccination lobbying.

Methods. In 2011, searches for anti-vaccination content were performed using Google, Yahoo and MSN-Bing, limited to English-language SA web pages. Content analysis was performed on web pages expressing anti-vaccination sentiment about infant vaccination. This was repeated in 2012 and 2013 using Google, with the first 700 web pages per search being analysed.

Results. Blogs/forums, articles and e-shops constituted 40.3 per cent, 55.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent of web pages, respectively. Authors were lay people (63.5 per cent), complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners (23.1 per cent), medical professionals practising CAM (7.7 per cent) and medical professionals practising only allopathic medicine (5.8 per cent).

Advertisements appeared on 55.2 per cent of web pages. Of these, 67.6 per cent were sponsored by or linked to organisations with financial interests in discrediting vaccines, with 80.0 per cent and 24.0 per cent of web pages sponsored by these organisations claiming respectively that vaccines are ineffective and that vaccination is profit driven. The vast majority of web pages (92.5 per cent) claimed that vaccines are not safe, and 77.6 per cent of anti-vaccination claims originated from the USA.

Conclusion. South Africans are creating web pages or blogs for local anti-vaccination lobbying. Research is needed to understand what influence internet-based anti-vaccination lobbying has on the uptake of infant vaccination in SA.

The latest SA census (October 2011) found that 35.2 per cent of inhabitants have access to the internet, [17] a substantial increase from the 15 per cent reported in 2007. [18]

In the USA, where 81 per cent of adults use the internet, 72 per cent of internet users search for health information online. [19]

Of these, 77 per cent start their search using a search engine (Google, Yahoo or Bing), 13 per cent use a health information specialist website such as WebMD, 2 per cent use a general site such as Wikipedia, and only 1 per cent use social media such as Facebook. [19] Web pages sourced through search engines are therefore an important source of health information for most internet users in the USA.

There are no data from SA on online health information-seeking behaviour. However, this study found that some South Africans have created web pages for local anti-vaccination lobbying, with many having financial interests in discrediting vaccines, and that they have taken their misinformation from web pages largely originating in the USA. Now that the existence of SA internet-based anti-vaccination lobbying has been established, research is needed to understand what influence this has on the uptake of infant vaccination in SA.

The measles alarm continues in Italy, but in Calabria, one of the least affected regions, there have been only 18 cases this week, compared with last week [24 to 30 Apr 2017] when there were 29.

385 cases of measles were registered in Italy in April 2017; 5 times as many as occurred in the same month of 2016, when there were just 76. The virus hit all of Italy, but regions in the center and north of the country accounted for 92% of cases. The Istituto Superiore di SanitÃ  [ISS; higher institute of health] monitors weekly cases registered in the country and on 3 May 2017 released its latest bulletin http://www.epicentro.iss.it/problemi/morbillo/Infografica2017.asp. [see next report]

34 per cent of patients who have come into contact with measles have had at least one complication. 39 per cent were admitted to hospital; 15 per cent made use of the emergency room.

Giovanni Rezza, an immunologist at the ISS, explains: "Broadly speaking, measles does behave a bit like this. In the pre-vaccine era, there were epidemic waves every 2-3 years, in essence when a new susceptible population had been reconstituted. "[This year (2017), there are] 6 times more cases than in the 1st 4 months of 2016, a year in which cases numbered 859 in total. The most affected regions are Lazio (570 cases), Piedmont (429), Lombardy (241), Tuscany (236) and Veneto (135).

According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, the average coverage for vaccinations against polio, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B, pertussis, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ is 93.4 per cent, lower than in previous years (94.7 per cent in 2014, 95.7 per cent in 2013 and 96.1 per cent in 2012).

[9] Italy: Star Movement (M5S)
Date: Tue 2 May 2017
Source: New York Times Editorial Board [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/vaccination-populism-politics-and-measles.html?_r=0


One of the tragedies of these post-truth times is that the lies, conspiracy theories and illusions spread by social media and populist politicians can be downright dangerous. The denial of human responsibility for climate change is one obvious example; another is opposition to vaccination. A serious outbreak of measles in Italy and in some other European countries could well be the result of a drop-off in vaccinations caused by utterly misguided and discredited claims about their dangers.

Vaccines are among the greatest achievements of medical science, an easily and safely administered defense against once common and often deadly diseases like measles, polio, smallpox, whooping cough and cervical cancer. Yet fear of vaccines has spread over the past 2 decades, fueled in part by an infamous study published in the medical journal Lancet in 1998 and later retracted and completely discredited. ... In Italy, the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) led by the comedian Beppe Grillo has campaigned actively on an anti-vaccination platform, likewise repeating the false ties between vaccinations and autism.

To these and other skeptics, the measles outbreak in Italy should sound a piercing alarm. As of 26 Apr 2017, the Italian Ministry of Health had reported 1739 cases of the disease, compared with 840 in all of 2016 and only 250 in 2015. Of those stricken, 88 per cent had not been vaccinated. The danger was not only to them: 159 of the cases were health care workers infected by patients. Yet studies show that 97 per cent of people who receive the recommended 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine are fully protected. Most people today would not remember a time when measles -- or mumps, or polio -- were commonplace.

M5S may not be responsible for the entire outbreak, since vaccine skepticism predates the party's rise. Yet the percentage of 2 year olds given vaccinations has steadily fallen in recent years, from 88 per cent in 2013 to 86 per cent in 2014 and 85.3 per cent in 2015. WHO regards 95 per cent as the level to achieve "herd immunity", at which point the disease poses no threat to the entire community.

Combating vaccine skepticism is not easy, because even the countless studies by innumerable health groups affirming that there is no link between vaccines and autism have failed to penetrate the fog spread by Mr Grillo and his ilk. The Italian measles outbreak, unfortunate as it is, does give health authorities an opportunity to strengthen their case by pointing to concrete evidence of what inevitably follows when vaccinations drop off.

Five cases of measles were diagnosed in young adults residing in RÃ©union between 20 Apr and 3 May 2017. One of them had traveled outside our department. It seems that it is at the origin of the circulation of the virus.

"Measles is a very contagious infectious disease, transmitted by the air contaminated by the coughing or sneezing of an infected person," said the Indian Ocean Health Agency. The agency recommends that people under the age of 50 and those who plan to travel should check with health professionals that they are well protected against the disease.

The burden of disease from measles is entirely preventable and totally unnecessary. The increase in cases is largely a result of a study by Dr Andrew Wakefield (The Lancet February 1998), which has been refuted many times and was retracted by the journal that published it. Yet, anti-vaxxers continue to defend his views, and parents' fears push them to believe it. But the facts clearly support being exposed to the measles virus is a greater threat than any side effect or adverse reaction.

CDC estimates 146 000 deaths a year worldwide, mostly children, follow infection without vaccination. Global measles elimination is achievable and a public health priority. It is not sufficient to eliminate measles in developed countries alone, as one can see from the reports above, infected individuals carry the virus and expand the sphere of transmission wherever they travel. - Mod.LK]
