Fresh cattle disease breaks out in Zimbabwe
--------------------------------------------
HARARE: Agriculture officials in Zimbabwe Wed, 13 Aug 2003 reported a new
outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) on farms near here, weeks after an
earlier outbreak prompted a nation-wide vaccination of cattle. Abdul
Nyathi, director of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union, blamed the latest outbreak
on illegal cattle movements, especially by farmers taking up plots
allocated to them under the government's controversial agrarian reforms.
The government has seized thousands of farms from white farmers to resettle
landless black peasants, which has resulted in a mass re-location of
farmers and livestock in the country.
The first outbreak in Harare was reported at the end of July, and prompted
Mozambique and other regional countries to ban beef imports from Zimbabwe.
"This (latest FMD outbreak) is most likely a result of illegal movement of
cattle, and I appeal to farmers to cooperate with veterinary officers
carrying out vaccinations and cattle movement controls," said Nyathi. "It
is in the interest of the nation and farmers to eradicate the disease, and
as farmers, all we need to do is to respect the restrictions veterinary
officers have imposed," he added.
Zimbabwe, a major beef producer in Africa, has been hit in recent years by
a series of FMD outbreaks, which has forced some of its main meat
importers, such as the European Union and South Africa, to ban imports from
the country. The latest outbreak is in an area zoned for beef exports. Last
month, the government launched a nationwide vaccination exercise of cattle
for the FMD disease, but veterinary officials say drugs were insufficient
to cover all animals in the country.
