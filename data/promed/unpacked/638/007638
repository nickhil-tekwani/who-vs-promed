In early 2010 in Maros, South Sulawesi [Sulawesi Selatan], cattle
were reported dying from anthrax. "There were 2 cows that died of the
disease," said Murtala Ali, Head Livestock and Animal Health of South
Sulawesi province, on Thursday [28 Jan 2009].

He explained that the Makassar area has enzootic anthrax, with 25
cattle infected in 2005 [and 4 buffalo - Mod.MHJ]. In 2006, 9 cattle
died in Gowa District [in 3 separate villages - Mod.MHJ], and in
Jeneponto District, there were 32 cases in 2008 and 2009.

"We have the vaccination and treatment of these animals in hand,"
said Murtala. "We have 10 000 remaining vaccine doses from the 80 000
doses purchased earlier in the mail center. These were paid for out
of the State Budget Expenditure," added M. Kafil, Kapala Health
Sector Animal and Veterinary Public Health Office of Animal Husbandry
and Animal Health Sulawesi South.

[Let us just say that the reporting of this disease by the Indonesian
authorities is erratic and incomplete at best. But they try. During
the past decade, the effectiveness of the control of this disease in
Indonesia has fallen off markedly, which is unfortunate. - Mod.MHJ]
