USA (Florida):
- 3rd locality. 23 Aug 2016. (conf.) locally acquired case in Pinellas County, which includes St. Petersburg and Clearwater [some 265 miles (425 km) from Miami]. And the state reported 4 more cases in Wynwood, an area north of Miami where the 1st continental U.S. Zika outbreak was seen, bringing the total of locally acquired cases for Florida to 42.

- Miami Cases. 19 Aug 2016. (conf.) 36 cases, with 25 in the Wynwood neighborhood, 5 in the South Beach section of Miami Beach and 6 in undefined localities.
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/health/the-zika-virus-in-south-florida.html?_r=0

[Another 19 Aug 2016 report comments that because Miami and especially South Beach, are major tourist destinations, the appearance of Zika virus infections in this area are likely to have serious, adverse economic consequences. The area's high-rise buildings mean the aerial spraying that has been working in Wynwood won't work in Miami Beach. In addition, it will be more difficult to convince people to wear long sleeves and pants in a part of the city where people go to spend time on the beach.
(http://www.wfdd.org/story/new-zika-outbreak-hits-popular-tourist-destination-miami-beach)

- CDC recommendations. 19 Aug 2016. Concerning possible exposure in Miami Beach, Florida:
- Pregnant women should avoid travel to the designated area of Miami Beach, in addition to the designated area of Wynwood, both located in Miami-Dade County, because active local transmission of Zika has been confirmed.

- Pregnant women and their partners living in or who must travel to the designated areas should be aware of active Zika virus transmission and follow steps to prevent mosquito bites.

- Women and men who live in or who have traveled to the designated area of Miami Beach since 14 Jul 2016 should be aware of active Zika virus transmission; pregnant women should see their doctor or other healthcare provider about getting tested for Zika; and people who have a pregnant sex partner should consistently and correctly use condoms to prevent infection during sex or avoid having sex for the duration of the pregnancy.

- Pregnant women and their sexual partners who are concerned about potential Zika virus exposure may also consider postponing nonessential travel to all parts of Miami-Dade County.

- All pregnant women in the United States should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure during each prenatal care visit. Each evaluation should include an assessment of signs and symptoms of Zika virus disease (acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, conjunctivitis); their travel history; as well as their sexual partner's potential exposure to Zika virus and history of any illness consistent with Zika virus disease to determine whether Zika virus testing is indicated.

- Women with Zika should wait at least 8 weeks after symptoms start before trying to get pregnant.

- Men with Zika should wait at least 6 months after symptoms start before couples try to get pregnant.

- Women and men without confirmed Zika who traveled to this area should wait at least 8 weeks before trying to get pregnant.

- Women and men who live in or frequently travel to this area and who do not have signs or symptoms of Zika should talk to their healthcare provider to inform their decisions about timing of pregnancy.

- Genetically modified mosquitoes. 14 Aug 2016. (reported) The release of genetically modified male mosquitoes in Key Haven of the Florida Keys by Oxitec has aroused controversy. Each male mosquito released by Oxitec will carry a gene to prevent his offspring from reaching adulthood. Scientists expect that the genetically modified males will mate with wild females to undercut the population of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, as they have done in pilot field tests in other countries. There is significant local objection to the release because 1 on 1000 mosquitoes will be females which can bite, and because of concern about unanticipated effects of release of genes into nature.

[2] Placental infection

Abstract

The strong association of Zika virus infection with congenital defects has led to questions of how a flavivirus is capable of crossing the placental barrier to reach the fetal brain. Here, we demonstrate permissive Zika virus infection of primary human placental macrophages, commonly referred to as Hofbauer cells, and placental villous fibroblasts. We also demonstrate Zika virus infection of Hofbauer cells within the context of the tissue ex vivo using term placental villous explants. In addition to amplifying infectious virus within a usually inaccessible area, the putative migratory activities of Hofbauer cells may aid in dissemination of Zika virus to the fetal brain. Understanding the susceptibility of placenta-specific cell types will aid future work around and understanding of Zika virus-associated pregnancy complications.

Discussion

As primary human trophoblast cells of term placentas appear to be resistant to a productive ZIKV infection, at least at early time points (up to 72 hours), breaching of the maternal-fetal barrier appears to be necessary for vertical transmission to transpire. Potential means by which virus can be transmitted across the maternal-fetal barrier are diverse and may occur actively (exploiting a mechanism normally used to provide maternal aid to the fetus) or entail a passive event (surface tension resulting in breaks in the syncytium). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a well-described causative agent of congenital birth defects, has been found to co-opt the neonate Fc receptor-mediated IgG transport pathway (FcRn) to gain access into the fetal compartment by interacting with low neutralizing anti-HCMV maternal antibodies. DENV is hyperendemic in regions in which microcephaly has been associated with ZIKV infection, and DENV antibodies are known to have high serological cross-reactivity with ZIKV. It is intriguing to consider that preexisting circulating DENV antibodies within the mother could promote maternal antibody-mediated transcytosis of ZIKV across the resistant trophoblast layers to regions in which ZIKV-permissive cells (macrophages/fibroblasts) are actively surveying for signs of pathogens. These susceptible cells then serve as reservoirs for ZIKV within the placental compartment. We are currently developing models to test this hypothesis. If true, the congenital defects of ZIKV may be exacerbated within the Brazil outbreak by the presence of a population that has been previously exposed to DENV infections.

Summary

In summary, our data have shown that primary placental-specific fibroblasts and HBCs are permissive for ZIKV replication in isolated cultures in vitro while HBCs demonstrate susceptibility ex vivo in the context of placental tissues. Elucidation of the role that placental macrophages have during virus dissemination to the fetal brain will help our understanding of the pathogenesis of microcephaly and may lead to new strategies to prevent disease.

Specificity, cross-reactivity, and function of antibodies elicited by Zika virus infection.

Characterizing the Zika virus antibody response
Given the public health emergency that Zika virus poses, scientists are seeking to understand the Zika-specific immune response. Stettler et al. analyzed 119 monoclonal antibodies isolated from 4 donors that were infected with Zika virus during the present epidemic, including 2 individuals that had previously been infected with dengue virus, another member of the flavivirus family. Neutralizing antibodies primarily recognized the envelope protein domain III (EDIII) or quaternary epitopes on the intact virus, and an EDIII-targeted antibody protected mice against lethal infection. Some EDI/II-targeting antibodies cross-reacted with dengue virus in vitro and could enhance disease in dengue-infected mice. Whether dengue and Zika virus antibodies cross-react in humans remains to be tested.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus with homology to Dengue virus (DENV), has become a public health emergency. By characterizing memory lymphocytes from ZIKV-infected patients, we dissected ZIKV-specific and DENV-cross-reactive immune responses. Antibodies to nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) were largely ZIKV-specific and were used to develop a serological diagnostic tool. In contrast, antibodies against E protein domain I/II (EDI/II) were cross-reactive and, although poorly neutralizing, potently enhanced ZIKV and DENV infection in vitro and lethally enhanced DENV disease in mice. Memory T cells against NS1 or E proteins were poorly cross-reactive, even in donors preexposed to DENV. The most potent neutralizing antibodies were ZIKV-specific and targeted EDIII or quaternary epitopes on infectious virus. An EDIII-specific antibody protected mice from lethal ZIKV infection, illustrating the potential for antibody-based therapy.

Zika Virus Infects Neural Progenitors in the Adult Mouse Brain and Alters Proliferation.

Highlights

- Zika virus (ZIKV) can infect neural progenitors in the adult mouse brain
- ZIKV-infected adult NPCs show evidence of cell death
- Cell proliferation is also impacted in ZIKV-infected adult NPC populations

Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV)-related neuropathology is an important global health concern. Several studies have shown that ZIKV can infect neural stem cells in the developing brain, but infection in the adult brain has not been examined. 2 areas in the adult mouse brain contain neural stem cells: the subventricular zone of the anterior forebrain and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Here, using 6-week-old mice triply deficient in interferon regulatory factor (IRF) as a model, we show that blood-borne ZIKV administration can lead to pronounced evidence of ZIKV infection in these adult neural stem cells, leading to cell death and reduced proliferation. Our data therefore suggest that adult as well as fetal neural stem cells are vulnerable to ZIKV neuropathology. Thus, although ZIKV is considered a transient infection in adult humans without marked long-term effects, there may in fact be consequences of exposure in the adult brain.

Congenital Brain Abnormalities and Zika Virus: What the Radiologist Can Expect to See Prenatally and Postnatally.

Purpose

To document the imaging findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection as found in the Instituto de Pesquisa in Campina Grande State Paraiba (IPESQ) in northeastern Brazil, where the congenital infection has been particularly severe.

Materials and Methods

From June 2015 to May 2016, 438 patients were referred to the IPESQ for rash occurring during pregnancy or for suspected fetal central nervous system abnormality. Patients who underwent imaging at IPESQ were included, as well as those with documented Zika virus infection in fluid or tissue (n = 17, confirmed infection cohort) or those with brain findings suspicious for Zika virus infection, with intracranial calcifications (n = 28, presumed infection cohort). Imaging examinations included 12 fetal magnetic resonance (MR) examinations, 42 postnatal brain computed tomographic examinations, and 11 postnatal brain MR examinations. Images were reviewed by 4 radiologists, with final opinion achieved by means of consensus.

Results

Brain abnormalities seen in confirmed (n = 17) and presumed (n = 28) congenital Zika virus infections were similar, with ventriculomegaly in 16 of 17 (94 percent) and 27 of 28 (96 percent) infections, respectively; abnormalities of the corpus callosum in 16 of 17 (94 percent) and 22 of 28 (78 percent) infections, respectively; and cortical migrational abnormalities in 16 of 17 (94 percent) and 28 of 28 (100 percent) infections, respectively. Although most fetuses underwent at least one examination that showed head circumference below the 5th percentile, head circumference could be normal in the presence of severe ventriculomegaly (seen in 3 fetuses). Intracranial calcifications were most commonly seen at the gray matter-white matter junction, in 15 of 17 (88 percent) and 28 of 28 (100 percent) confirmed and presumed infections, respectively. The basal ganglia and/or thalamus were also commonly involved with calcifications in 11 of 17 (65 percent) and 18 of 28 (64 percent) infections, respectively. The skull frequently had a collapsed appearance with overlapping sutures and redundant skin folds and, occasionally, intracranial herniation of orbital fat and clot in the confluence of sinuses.

Conclusion

The spectrum of findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection in the IPESQ in northeastern Brazil is illustrated to aid the radiologist in identifying Zika virus infection at imaging.
