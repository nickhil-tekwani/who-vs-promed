Recently, the emergency department of the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University admitted 2 patients with severe epidemic hemorrhagic fever.

It is understood that the 1st patient admitted to the hospital was a young male, who became ill on [9 Dec 2021] with fever and chills. No special attention was paid, and he had been to a local clinic, but the effect was not good. On [12 Dec 2021], the patient's symptoms worsened and he went to several different local hospitals. The diagnosis was unclear. Because the patient was in critical condition, he was transferred to the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University on [14 Dec 2021].

When admitted to the emergency department of Ningxia Medical University, the patient was already in shock, had a fever, bleeding (conjunctival congestion), and kidney damage. Combined epidemiological history (the patient lives in a rural area, has cattle and sheep at home, and rats have infested in the yard and temporary work area). It is highly suspected that this patient has epidemic hemorrhagic fever. At the same time, we will try our best to treat patients and actively give symptomatic supportive treatment.

On [15 Dec 2021], the Ningxia Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the patient had a positive IgM antibody test for epidemic hemorrhagic fever, and was diagnosed with epidemic hemorrhagic fever (that, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], critical) based on clinical manifestations and epidemiological history. Due to his critical condition, the patient was admitted to a single room in the emergency intensive care unit for isolation and treatment.

In addition, the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University also received a 2nd case of epidemic hemorrhagic fever on the morning of [20 Dec 2021] and was diagnosed as epidemic hemorrhagic fever (critically severe) based on the epidemiological history and clinical manifestations. Single room isolation treatment [was carried out] in emergency and intensive care units.

Hemorrhagic fever, also known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, is caused by epidemic hemorrhagic fever virus (Hantavirus) and is a natural foci disease with rodents as the main source of infection. The main clinical manifestations are fever, bleeding, congestion, hypotension, shock, and kidney damage. Outdoor workers who work in the field where rodents are infested should wear long clothes, long pants, and masks to prevent virus infection. Once suspicious symptoms such as high fever appear, go to a regular hospital immediately to avoid delaying [treatment of] the condition.

[The report above does not indicate which hantavirus or hantaviruses are the ones involved in this and other HFRS cases of the season. There are 3 hantaviruses in China that cause HFRS and are endemic in their rodent hosts: the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_), the reservoir for both the Saaremaa and Hantaan viruses, and the brown or Norway rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the reservoir for Seoul hantavirus. Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of HFRS frequently in China. The occurrence of HFRS cases due to hantavirus infections in Chia is not unusual.

According to data released by the China CDC, the number of epidemic hemorrhagic fever cases in China from January to August in 2020 was 4359, and the death toll was 21. A 19 Dec 2021 report indicates that there is an inactivated vaccine available against Hantaan hantavirus (see Hantavirus - Asia (03): China (SA) 20211221.8700404). The report above does not mention vaccines as a preventive measure.
