China's booming southern province of Guangdong has reported more than
300 deaths from rabies [during 2005], the highest number in a decade,
as its increasingly affluent population buys more dogs, state media
said on Thursday [8 Jun 2006].
Rabies killed 306 people in the province last year, up 24.9 percent
from 2004, the China Daily said. "As living standards keep
increasing, more people feed dogs, and this increased contact means
more chance of infection," Professor Guo Xiaofeng of the South China
Agriculture University (SCAU) was quoted as saying.
Pet dogs were shunned in the days of Mao Zedong as a symbol of
bourgeois decadence and dog is still a popular restaurant dish. But
pets have become increasingly popular in the last decade with
improved living standards. During 2005, 330 000 people sought
treatment for rabies in Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, and 500
000 were vaccinated. There were 1.5 million reported dog bites or scratches.
Guo also said that education about rabies in rural areas, where most
infections took place, was important to encourage people to vaccinate
their dogs against the disease.
Some 2660 people died of rabies in China in 2004, according to
Ministry of Health figures.

[The elevation of the dog from culinary item to household companion
in Chinese society is being accompanied by an unexpected increase in
the burden of cases of human rabies. Previous reports from China have
described the containment of canine rabies in the capital by the
licensing and compulsory vaccination of domestic pets. A similar
policy will need to be implemented in rural areas throughout the
country and in the booming southern province of Guangdong to reduce
both the number of cases of human rabies and the very high number of
people seeking protection by vaccination.
