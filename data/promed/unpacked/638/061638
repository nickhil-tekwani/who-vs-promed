A pregnant woman from an area in Buenos Aires [province] was admitted to hospital with [a] hantavirus [infection], so the local health authorities are investigating how she was infected in order to predict if there are possibilities of more cases.

The patient is (currently) 28 weeks pregnant and was taken into the health system this past [5 Jan 2020] for a physical illness that later was recognized by the physicians attending her as [a] hantavirus [infection]; currently she is hospitalized in the interzonal hospital San Martin in La Plata.

The municipal Secretary of Health, Diego Schiaffino, stated that the woman "never met the serious condition criterion" and indicated that her progress was favorable, so that she will be released in the coming hours.

"We are dedicated to tracking down and evaluating [the situation] in order to see how and where she was infected. We wish to see if she was infected in the area, what is the situation where she lives, if she has traveled elsewhere, if she has worked in the countryside," the local official remarked.

To avoid panic in the population, Schiaffino stated that "the virus that generally circulates in the region is less aggressive and is not transmitted by the respiratory route, such as happened in Epuyen last year [2019]," a reference to an epidemiologically [investigated] outbreak that affected the Chbut [province] town and took the lives of 9 people.

In any case, he asked [the residents] to fight the longtail mouse, the vector [reservoir] of the disease [virus] that transmits the virus in its urine and feces.

This past Wednesday [8 Jan 2020], a football [soccer] player from the Etcheverry Neighboring Union was released from the same hospital after spending 10 days hospitalized also for [a] hantavirus [infection] that he contracted working as a gardener.

[The hantavirus responsible for these 2 cases is not mentioned. Cases of hantavirus infection with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from various parts of Argentina in recent years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina; in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Marciel virus (in the dark bolo mouse, _Bolomys obscurus_); Lechiguana and Central Plata (in central Argentina; in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina; in _O. longicaudatus_); Anajatuba and Juquitiba (in _Oligoryzomys forensi_) and Bermejo (western Argentina; in _O. chaoensis_). There is always the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these cases. - Mod.TY
