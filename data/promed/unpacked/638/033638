A significant fish kill that has now peaked in the Santee Cooper
system affected common carp only, widely considered to be an
undesirable species introduced to U.S. waters in the 1800s.
A disease-related fish kill affecting common carp only has peaked in
the Santee Cooper lakes system, according to Scott Lamprecht,
regional fisheries biologist for the S.C. Department of Natural
Resources at Dennis Wildlife Center in Bonneau.
The disease affecting the carp has been initially identified as
[being caused by] _Flavobacterium columnare_ -- a common bacterium always
present in the water -- by the Southeastern Cooperative Fisheries Disease
Group at Auburn University, and specimens have been sent to England
for additional screening.

[From moderator comment in ProMED 1999 ref. below:
Columnaris disease is the second leading cause of mortality in pond raised
catfish in the SE USA... Most species of fish are susceptible to
columnaris disease following some type of environmental stress and when
water temperatures are in the upper part of their preferred temperature
range... Schooling species of fish, like white bass, are especially
susceptible. Fish with this disease usually have yellowish-brown lesions on
their gills. These lesions result in the erosion of the gills by protein- and
cartilage-degrading enzymes produced by the bacteria. Skin ("saddleback")
lesions can be noted encircling the body of fingerlings; as well as lesions
inside the fish's mouth. _F. columnare_ can also be isolated from internal
organs (for example in a study in Mississippi, 40% of fish with external
lesions had isolations from internal organs) but the significance is
uncertain. Swelling of the posterior kidney has been noted. - MHJ]
