[The above summary report issued by the OIE following the notification of South Korea's 9th HPAI H5N6 outbreak includes a map (at the source URL) presenting the 9 outbreaks since the start of the current HPAI H5N6 event in South Korea.

South Korea's quarantine agency said [on Wed 20 Dec 2017] that at least 2 slightly different H5N6 strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza have entered the nation via migratory birds this winter [2017-18].

Highly pathogenic avian influenza is due to a variety of viruses that cause severe disease in birds and result in high death rates, according to the World Health Organization.

The new strain of HPAI H5N6 started its circulation in South East Asia in 2014. This strain is known to have caused, so far, 17 human cases, all in mainland China. The WHO web-page "Human infections with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus - China", last updated on Wed 6 Dec 2017, is available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-december-2016-ah5n6-china/en/. - Mod.AS
