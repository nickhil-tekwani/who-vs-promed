[A man] listens for the tell-tale death rattle at his oyster farm in
France's Arcachon Bay, as a falling tide exposes victims of a lethal
virus ravaging the nation's 157-year-old shellfish industry.

"You smell a particular odor and you hear the sound of shells," [the
33-year-old says,] sorting baby oysters in a wooden shack near the end
of a 12-mile [20 km] sandbar that shelters the bay from the Atlantic
Ocean west of the city of Bordeaux. "A putrid smell. Nobody
understands it."

A herpes virus has decimated oysters along France's 3410-mile [5500
km] coast for a 4th season, making the shellfish an ever-more
exclusive treat for year-end holiday meals that account for half of
the country's oyster sales.

Farm-gate prices for oysters have jumped 65 percent in 3 years because
of the disease, said Goulven Brest, head of France's shellfish-growers
committee. He frets that high prices, which help keep growers afloat,
and fewer oysters threaten an industry with USD 823 million in sales
in 2009.

"The consumer is losing interest in the product because we have less
to market," Brest said. "We can't charge more. We've reached a price
beyond which demand will plummet."

Retail prices for oysters in Paris have climbed to between USD 18.25
and USD 22 a dozen in some neighborhoods, from USD 15.65 and USD 18.25
a dozen in 2010, he said. Wholesale prices in October 2011 climbed 8.2
percent from a year earlier and 26 percent from 2 years ago [2009],
according to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies
in Paris.

The disease killing France's Pacific oysters, dubbed "la mortalite" by
growers, first emerged in 2008. It mostly strikes oysters under a year
old, researchers say.

Between 70 and 80 percent of France's young stock died this year
[2011], according to the institute.

[Herpes-infected shellfish are not new to science. In 2008, a huge
increase in mortality rates was detected in France. Then, a new
variation -- more virulent -- of the virus was detected and named
OsHV-1 microvar. Like the other strains of herpes that affect
mollusks, OsHV-1 microvar attacks young oysters during breeding
season, when the mollusks' bodies investing most of their resources on
reproduction and very little on maintaining their immune system.
Clinical signs of the disease may include high levels of mortality
particularly affecting juvenile stages of Pacific oysters. These signs
usually appear when water temperatures exceed 16 deg C (61 deg F).
This disease is not a threat to vertebrates, including humans.
