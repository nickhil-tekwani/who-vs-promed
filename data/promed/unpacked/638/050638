Russia: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
---------------------------------------------
Russian officials were forecasting record levels of hemorrhagic fever and
renal syndrome (HFRS) and various other animal-transmitted diseases for the
summer and fall of 2005 on the basis of climatic indices and rodent
population survey data. A series of unusually mild winters coupled with
favorable conditions during spring/summer breeding months over the past
several years has reportedly allowed rodent populations to increase to very
high densities in many areas of Russia. Rodent populations have reportedly
reached irruptive levels throughout much of southern Russia, from the
Pacific Far East island of Sakhalin eastward into the boreal forest and
temperate forest biomes of central and eastern Russia.
Health officials were predicting additional increases in rates of human
infections with animal-transmitted diseases for 2005, despite the fact that
frequencies of many animal-associated diseases -- such as hantavirus
infection, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, rabies, etc. -- had
already reached record levels in many areas of Russia during 2004, with
morbidity levels of as much as 5 to 10 times higher than average reported
in some localities.
Public health authorities in Russia reported in April 2005 that the
incidence of rodentborne HFRS nationwide during 2004 was 66.4 per cent
higher than the 2003 level, with a 180 per cent increase reported among
children under the age of 14. These new national statistics followed
previous announcements of a 13-fold increase in the incidence of HFRS in
Nizhnii Novgorod and a 21-fold increase in Sverdlovsk during 2004 [See
ProMED-mail Archive Numbers 20050210.0458 and 20050210.0458].
Russia's public health chief Dr Gennadii Onishchenko announced in March
2005 that 10 244 cases of HFRS -- including 377 cases in children under age
14 -- were reported from Russia in 2004. The national rate of HFRS
incidence for 2004 was cited as 7.1 per 100 000 persons. The general
incidence rose by 66.4 per cent, including a 2.8-fold rise among children
under age 14 (Ria Novosti, 10 Mar 2005). Officials reported that rates of
HFRS transmission in Sverdlovsk Oblast were 21 times higher in 2004 than
during 2003, and more than 8 times higher than the running average for the
region over the past several years. Rates of infection for tularemia in
Russia as a whole were reported to be 3 times higher during the 1st 9
months of 2004 than they were in 2003 [see: Ria Novosti
<http://rian.ru/society/health_services/20050310/39505347.html>].
Russian news media reports have cited local government officials as saying
the reported massive increases in animalborne diseases are attributable to
a combination of breakdowns in vaccination and rodent control programs at
the local and provincial levels due to reduced government funding levels
and massive increases in population densities of disease-carrying rodents.
Officials attributed an observed 6-fold increase in the number of
fox-transmitted rabies incidents among humans in Sverdlovsk Oblast during
January 2005 over 2004 levels to unusually high survivorship rates of young
foxes permitted by recent population explosions among their usual prey
species: rodents, rabbits, and other small mammals.
