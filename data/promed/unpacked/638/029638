Rates of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, chlamydia and "incurable" super gonorrhoea are reaching record highs, a shock report reveals. Millions of new infections have been recorded over the past 4 years alone in the USA, health chiefs have said. A drug-resistant strain of gonorrhoea is on the rise as sexually transmitted disease (STD) cases rocket worldwide.

It comes after it emerged cases of syphilis reported in England have reached the highest level since 1949 -- up almost 150% in 10 years. There has also been a worrying spike in gonorrhoea and the emergence of so-called super gonorrhoea -- which is drug resistant. And the latest report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests it is a worldwide trend (see reference below).

There were almost 2.3 million Americans with chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis last year [2017], up from 1.7 million in 2013, the CDC revealed. Their report, released in September [2018], said chlamydia was most common in women, whereas gonorrhoea and syphilis were more common in men. Syphilis infected almost 8 men to every woman, according to the findings. Teens aged 15 to 19 and adults aged 20 to 29 are the groups at highest risk of infection in the USA. And surprisingly, rates of gonorrhoea and chlamydia were among their highest in the typically conservative "Bible belt" areas of the South. Syphilis was most common in Nevada, California and Louisiana.

In the UK, public health officials warned of the spread of drug-resistant gonorrhoea -- thought to have been carried from Southeast Asia earlier this year [2018]. Commenting on the drug-resistant strain, the CDC said symptoms include a burning sensation while urinating and a green or yellow discharge.

A statement from the CDC said: "The emergence of cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhoea would significantly complicate the ability of providers to treat gonorrhoea successfully, since we have few antibiotic options left that are simple, well-studied, well-tolerated and highly effective."

There were 422 000 new STD cases in 2017, according to a Public Health England report earlier this year [2018]. Of these, there were 7137 diagnoses of syphilis -- a 20% increase compared with 2016 and a 148% increase from 2008. Cases of gonorrhoea were up 22% from 2016, while the number of chlamydia cases dropped 8%.

Those most at risk of infections were young heterosexuals aged 15 to 24, black ethnic minorities, and gay or bisexual men.

Meanwhile in Australia, STD cases increased by 107% and gonorrhoea increased by 63% between 2011 and 2016, CNN reported.

New cases of syphilis have skyrocketed nationwide in the past 5 years, and gay and bisexual men are responsible for nearly 70% of new infections, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"I am not surprised," said Quintin Robinson , an infectious diseases doctor at Atlanta-based AbsoluteCARE. "I see at least 2 to 3 cases of syphilis in my practice per week, primarily among gay and bisexual men living with HIV."

The CDC report [https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2018/press-release-2018-std-prevention-conference.html] showed that syphilis diagnoses increased 76% between 2013 and 2017. Gonorrhea diagnoses increased 67% (nearly doubling among men) in the same period.

What's driving the uptick in syphilis and gonorrhea cases is due to many factors, Robinson said. But he pushed back against an argument from critics of PrEP that the daily preventative measure against HIV leads gay men to engage in risky sex, and causes an increase in sexually transmitted infections (STIs). "The STI rates were increasing among gay/bisexual and other MSM [men who have sex with men] long before the rapidly growing uptake in PrEP, but the increase in STIs is due to many things," Robinson said.

He said that more routine STI testing -- PrEP users are screened for STIs every 90 days -- and the increase in condom-less sex are factors. But so is treatment as prevention, which is treating people living with HIV to lower the risk of new HIV transmissions by taking antiretroviral medication. The concept of "undetectable equals untransmittable" is also a factor, Robinson said. The CDC said [https://www.hivplusmag.com/undetectable/2017/9/27/breaking-cdc-officially-recognizes-undetectableuntransmittable-hiv-prevention] in 2017 that when antiretroviral treatment results in viral suppression in those living with HIV, that prevents [HIV] transmission to others. So when it comes to these increases in STI rates, Robinson said not to blame PrEP. "It's reductionist and unproductive to blame PrEP, as it effectively prevents HIV, which is a big deal," he said.

A 2016 CDC report [http://www.projectq.us/atlanta/gay_male_syphilis_rate_40_times_higher_than_others?gid=18025] showed that the rate of syphilis among gay and bisexual men was at least 40 times the rate of heterosexual men.

National Overview of STDs, 2017

Chlamydia
------------
"In 2017, a total of 1 708 569 cases of _Chlamydia trachomatis_ infection were reported to the CDC, making it the most common notifiable condition in the United States. This case count corresponds to a rate of 528.8 cases per 100 000 population, an increase of 6.9% compared with the rate in 2016. During 2016-2017, rates of reported chlamydia increased among both males and females, in all regions of the United States, and among all racial and Hispanic ethnicity groups.

"Rates of reported chlamydia are highest among adolescent and young adults and have increased in recent years. In 2017, almost two-thirds of all reported chlamydia cases were among persons aged 15-24 years. Among women aged 15-24 years, the population targeted for chlamydia screening, the overall rate of reported cases of chlamydia was 3635.3 cases per 100 000 females, an increase of 4.9% from 2016 and of 8.8% from 2013.

"Although rates of reported cases among men are generally lower than rates among women, reflecting the larger number of women screened for this infection, rates among men increased almost 40% during 2013-2017. Increases in rates among men may reflect an increased number of men, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM) being tested and diagnosed with a chlamydial infection due to increased availability of urine testing and extragenital screening."

Gonorrhea
------------
"In 2017, a total of 555 608 cases of gonorrhea were reported to CDC, making it the 2nd most common notifiable condition in the United States. Rates of reported gonorrhea increased 75.2% since the historic low in 2009 and increased 18.6% since 2016. During 2016-2017, rates of reported gonorrhea increased among both males and females, in all regions of the United States, and among all racial and Hispanic ethnicity groups.

"During 2016-2017, the rate of reported gonorrhea increased 19.3% among men and 17.8% among women. The magnitude of the increase among men suggests either increased transmission, increased case ascertainment (e.g., through increased extra-genital screening among MSM), or both. The concurrent increase in cases reported among women suggests parallel increases in heterosexual transmission, increased screening among women, or both.

"Antimicrobial resistance remains an important consideration in the treatment of gonorrhea. Therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin is now the only CDC-recommended treatment for gonorrhea. Since 2008, the percentage of isolates with elevated ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) has remained low and was only 0.2% in 2017. During 2014-2017, the percentage of isolates with elevated azithromycin MICs increased from 2.5% to 4.4%. Continued monitoring of susceptibility patterns to these antibiotics is critical."

Syphilis
---------
"In 2017, a total of 30 644 cases of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most infectious stages of the disease, were reported in the United States, yielding a rate of 9.5 cases per 100 000 population. Since reaching a historic low in 2000 and 2001, the rate of P&S syphilis has increased almost every year, increasing 10.5% during 2016-2017. Rates increased among both males and females, among all racial and Hispanic ethnicity groups, and in 72.0% of states and the District of Columbia.

"During 2000-2017, the rise in the P&S syphilis rate was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among MSM. In 2017, men accounted for almost 90% of all cases of P&S syphilis and MSM accounted for 68.2% of reported P&S syphilis cases among women or men with information about sex of sex partners. In states with consistent information on sex of sex partner, the number of P&S syphilis cases increased 8.6% among MSM, 17.8% among MSW, and 24.9% among women during 2016-2017. Among P&S syphilis cases with known HIV status, 45.5% of MSM, 8.8% of MSW, and 4.5% of women were HIV-positive in 2017.

"The 2013 rate of congenital syphilis (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) marked the 1st increase in congenital syphilis since 2008. Since 2013, the rate of congenital syphilis has increased each year. In 2017, there were a total of 918 reported cases of congenital syphilis, including 64 syphilitic stillbirths and 13 infant deaths. The national rate of 23.3 cases per 100 000 live births represents a 43.8% increase relative to 2016 and a 153.3% increase relative to 2013. This increase in the congenital syphilis rate has paralleled increases in P&S syphilis among all women and reproductive-aged women during 2013-2017 (155.6% and 142.8% increase, respectively)." - Mod.ML
