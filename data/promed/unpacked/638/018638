Animal behaviour suggests disease outbreak
------------------------------------------
There is growing concern about a possible outbreak of distemper in the
raccoon population in southwestern Ontario.

Holly Simpson of Chatham, a biologist with the Ministry of Natural
Resources, said on Thursday [14 Oct 2010] that some raccoons in the wild
are exhibiting abnormal behaviour, which is consistent with distemper or
rabies. "It's entirely possible," she said.

Simpson said she's received a large number of calls from the public
expressing concern about raccoons. Simpson said people should take
precautions to keep their pets shielded from wild raccoons. "We have sent a
couple of raccoon carcasses from Harwich to the University of Guelph for
analysis but so far haven't heard word," she said.

Simpson said several callers have suggested raccoons in the wild don't
appear to be healthy and are displaying unusual actions.

Paul Praill of Chatham, a hunter and trapper, said there appears to be a
large number of dead raccoons along the roadways. "I'm told there is a
rampant case of distemper among the raccoon population and it's causing
them to act in strange fashion," he said.

Praill said raccoons have been seen walking around yards and field in
circles, chasing people and coming out in daytime in large numbers. Praill
recommends hunters refrain from taking dead raccoons home with them. "They
are acting very, very unusual this fall," he said.

The Chatham-Kent Police Service said Thursday it has received a large
number of calls from citizens about raccoons. The calls, according to a
release, are generally complaints of raccoons in trees, backyards, sitting
near roadways looking at people. In consultation with the Ontario Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA), the police service is
recommending that raccoon concerns be directed to the OSPCA.

The OSPCA specialize in adoptions, canine control, cruelty investigations,
lost and found and offer 24-hour emergency service.

[Clinical signs of canine distemper in raccoons may include discharge from
the nose and eyes, a rough coat of hair, emaciated appearance, and unusual
behavior such as disorientation or wandering aimlessly. The animals' signs
become progressively worse and the disease is usually fatal. Distemper is
not the same disease as rabies, although some signs are similar.

Canine distemper runs its course rapidly. Distemper is often fatal and
death is usually attributed to a secondary infection such as pneumonia. Not
all raccoons get the disease and many survive the outbreaks.

Definitive diagnosis is based on laboratory analysis of affected tissues by
fluorescent antibody techniques.

The diseases can appear quite similar in raccoons. There are some people
who have seen distemper present as aggression, while others have only seen
the sick, disturbed, miserable looking creature. Perhaps it is a different
distemper strain since it is a virus, or perhaps it is individual
differences in the animals. However, the definitive diagnosis should always
be laboratory confirmation.

It is to be hoped that the authorities in this situation will be able to
clarify which disease they are currently dealing with.
