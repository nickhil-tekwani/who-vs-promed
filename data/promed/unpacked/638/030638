[We are informed that the causative agent has been serotyped by the KVI's FMD laboratory as FMDV-O.

Notably, about 2 weeks earlier in November (2015) another FMD outbreak, similarly caused by an FMDV-O strain (though genotypes may vary...), was identified in a sheep flock in the West Bank (Palestinian authority), namely in Jamain. According to the current OIE notification, the outbreak in Fassuta started on 13 Nov 2015; thus, the 2 outbreaks are chronologically rather close to each other, while distant (about 100 km [62 mi] as the crow flies). Jamain is situated southwest to Nablus, about 19 km [about 12 mi] from the demarcation line with Israel and about 32 km [about 20 mi] from the eastern border (with Jordan; see further details and map in archive no. 20151116.3795215).

The occurrence of 2 outbreaks on farms, which do not seem to have any direct or indirect contact between them, may reflect a wider circulation of the virus, in a regional context.

FMD has had, for decades, a seasonal pattern, epizootics typically starting in January-February, peaking in April-May. November used to be characterized as the month during which no FMD outbreaks were recorded. This pattern seems to have been undergoing a change since 2013.

The (inactivated, oil emulsion) FMD vaccines applied in Israel for the compulsory vaccination of livestock are the following.
In cattle -- a trivalent O/A/Asia1 vaccine, including the following vaccine strains:
1. Serotype O: O Manisa, O-3039, O-4625, O Israel 2007 (4 strains)
2. Serotype A: A- 4165, A Iran 05 (2 strains)
3. Serotype Asia 1: Asia1 Shamir (one vaccine strain).

In small ruminants (sheep and goats), a bivalent vaccine is applied, with the following vaccine strains included:
1. Serotype O: O Manisa, O-3039, O-4625 (3 strains)
2. Serotype A: A- 4165, A Iran 05 (2 strains).

As indicated in the OIE report above, the vaccine applied in the affected pig farm (Fassuta), is the cattle trivalent vaccine. - Mod.AS
