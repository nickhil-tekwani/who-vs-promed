Sheep pox epidemic spreading in Taiwan
--------------------------------------
More than 8000 sheep [sic; should read goats] infected with goat pox
virus (GPV), a disease that can be spread by the saliva, feces, or
skin of sheep, have been culled across Taiwan recently, health
authorities said Friday [28 May 2010].

According to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine (BAPIQ) under the Council of Agriculture, 8419 sheep at 56
farms scattered in 9 cities and counties in Taiwan have been killed as
a result of a rapid spread of the epidemic.

There are nearly 3000 sheep [sic; should read goat] farms around
Taiwan, which raise more than 200 000 animals.

Taiwan reported the 1st sheep pox (goat pox) [see comment] case in
July 2008, which broke out in a ranch in northern Taoyuan County among
a flock of goats that were allegedly smuggled into Taiwan.

The 2nd case erupted in early April this year [2010], when close to
800 GPV-infected sheep in central Taiwan's Yunlin County were killed.

"As the epidemic has showed no signs of abating, it is hard to predict
when it would ease up, " BAPIQ director-general Hsu Tian-lai said,
noting that goats from 2 more farms were detected to have contracted
goat pox virus Friday afternoon [28 May 2010].

Goats at the 2 ranches need to be observed at least for 3 months to 6
months to determine whether the epidemic still lingers, he explained.

He added that his bureau is considering purchasing 50 000 vaccines
[doses] from a pharmaceutical company in Jordan to contain the epidemic.

[The 1st occurrence of "sheep pox and goat pox" (the official OIE name
of the disease) in Taiwan was reported to the OIE on 8 Jul 2008; the
disease, affecting goats in 2 holdings in the north, was reportedly
eradicated by stamping out and declared as resolved on 5 Jul 2008 (see
ProMED-mail 20080709.2097). It will be interesting to find out if the
current, major outbreak, has been caused by a new introduction or by
residual infection from the previous outbreak.

Taiwan's goat population is, according to OIE's data, about 213 000
strong, held in 3006 establishments. The local sheep population is
negligible (less than 5000). The disease, which reportedly started on
18 Mar 2010, has so far been reported from 55 goat flocks. For an
interactive map showing all outbreaks, and for Taiwan's OIE reports on
the outbreak since 13 Apr 2010, including the recent follow-up report
of 28 May 2010, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9141>.

It will be interesting to note if the causative capripoxvirus in
Taiwan is pathogenic for goats only, or if it can infect sheep as
well. Specific goat or sheep targeted strains are recognized in many
countries; there are also strains which will affect both species (such
as the Kenyan 0240 strain).

A number of strains of capripoxvirus have had widespread use as live
vaccines in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, for example the 0240
Kenya sheep and goat pox strain used in sheep and goats, the Romanian
and RM-65 strains used mainly in sheep, and the Mysore and Gorgan
strains used in goats. - Mod.AS]
