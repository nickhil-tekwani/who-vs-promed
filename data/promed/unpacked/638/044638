Outbreak notice: hand-foot-mouth disease in Asia
------------------------------------------------
Since March 2008, a growing number of cases of hand-foot-mouth
disease (HFMD) have been reported in parts of Asia, mainly affecting
children. HFMD is common among infants and children. It is very
contagious and is spread through direct contact with the nose and
throat secretions, saliva, blister fluid, or stool of an infected
person. A large number of cases in the current outbreaks of HFMD in
Asia are reportedly caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71). However, other
strains of enterovirus can also cause HFMD.

In addition to the countries listed below, other countries in the
Western Pacific have also increased surveillance for HFMD. [The
available statistics as of Thu 3 Jul 2008 are listed below]

China
-----
On 16 Jun 2008, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(China CDC) posted a notice confirming that the HFMD outbreak peaked
on 14 May 2008, and is now in decline. According to Ministry of
Health spokesman Mao Qun'an, although over 176 000 cases were
reported last month [June 2008], the number of daily reported cases
decreased from 11 501 during the outbreak's peak to 3922 by 5 Jun
2008.

The provinces which have been most affected by this outbreak are
Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, and Hunan. A joint report from
China CDC and the Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in
China, released 19 May 2008, states that cases have also occurred in
other provinces, including Anhui, Hebei, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu,
Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and in the municipalities of
Beijing and Chongqing. As of 16 Jun 2008, over 370 cases have also
been reported in Macau SAR, according to China CDC.

Of the HFMD cases reported in China, most were in children 5 years of
age and younger, and of those tested in laboratories, the majority
were caused by EV71.

The Chinese government has enhanced its surveillance, prevention, and
control activities, including implementing a public awareness
campaign and monitoring water quality.

China (Hong Kong SAR)
---------------------
As of 2 Jul 2008, a total of 100 cases of HFMD have been reported in
Hong Kong, with 66 (66 percent) of the cases caused by EV71.

Singapore
---------
As of 2 Jul 2008, the Ministry of Health in Singapore has reported a
total of 15 776 cases. Since the end of May [2008] the number of
cases reported each week has been decreasing. Of these, none had
serious complications and none were fatal. As of 3 Jun 2008, 32
percent of cases tested this year in the Ministry's sentinel
surveillance system were positive for EV71. The Ministry is working
closely with preschools and child-care centers to help limit the
spread of HFMD and stresses the importance of good personal and
environmental hygiene, especially for children.

Taiwan
------
On 30 Jun 2008, the Central News Agency reported that the Taiwan
Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) had confirmed a total of 272
cases this year [2008], including 9 deaths. Due to the decreasing
numbers of cases reported each week, Taiwan CDC is reporting that the
outbreak is waning. The importance of good hygiene and prompt medical
attention for children showing severe symptoms has been encouraged.

Prevention measures for travelers
---------------------------------
No vaccine is available to prevent HFMD. There is no specific
treatment for people who are sick with this disease other than
treating symptoms, such as fever.

Travelers can take steps to prevent getting HFMD by practicing good
personal hygiene and following safe food and water practices. If you
are traveling in general, and especially to areas where HFMD has been
reported, follow these tips to help make healthy choices:

- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds,
especially before you eat, after you cough or sneeze, and after you
go to the toilet. If soap and water are not available, use an
alcohol-based hand gel (with at least 60 percent alcohol). Consider
packing alcohol-based hand gel in your luggage to ensure you have it
when needed.
- Eat foods that are fully cooked and served hot.
- Drink beverages that have been properly bottled and sealed (water,
carbonated drinks, or sports drinks).
- Do not put ice in drinks.
- Eat only fruits and vegetables that you can wash (with boiled or
bottled water) and peel yourself.
- Do not share eating utensils, such as forks, spoons, and cups.

Adults should help child travelers to follow these recommendations.
Infants, children, and adolescents are more susceptible to infection
and illness because they are less likely than adults to have cells
that fight infection from previous exposures to the enteroviruses
that cause HFMD.

Infection results in immunity to the specific virus that caused HFMD.
A 2nd episode of HFMD may occur following infection with a different
member of the enterovirus group.

Additional information
----------------------
HFMD is an illness caused by certain strains of enterovirus,
including EV71, which are common worldwide. Outbreaks of HFMD caused
by EV71 are not uncommon and have been reported by countries
throughout the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. EV71 can be
spread from person to person by direct contact with nose and throat
secretions (such as, by coughing or sneezing), saliva, fluid from
blisters, or the stool of infected persons. People sick with HFMD
often experience symptoms such as fever, sores in the mouth, and a
rash, occasionally with blisters. HFMD caused by EV71 may sometimes
lead to serious complications, including swelling of the brain
(encephalitis). Most cases of HFMD occur in children under 10 years
of age, but adults can also become infected.
