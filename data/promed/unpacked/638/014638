------------------------------------------------------------------
A similar problem was apparent in Belgium. Due to an apparent increase of leptospirosis in Belgian dogs, reported by veterinary labs since 2008, the question was raised if this could lead to an augmented zoonotic risk for their owners and families. On demand of the Belgian authorities, the following studies were instigated:

First, in a cross-sectional study in 1724 samples of healthy dogs and cats, some of these vaccinated against leptospirosis, 6.55 percent of the dogs tested positive (1/100) in the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) against a panel of 12 different leptospiral serogroups, still considered the gold standard screening test for leptospirosis. In the non-vaccinated dogs, the most frequently found serogroups were rather unexpectedly Australis, Grippotyphosa, and Pyrogenes, in descending order. Before 2002, the most prevalent canine serogroups were Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae.

About 5 percent of 588 cats had an antibody-titer equal or higher than 1/30. The lower MAT [microscopic agglutination test] titer in cats was interpreted as an indirect sign that cats are probably not optimal reservoirs for leptospira, with a lower antibody response. Clinical apparent leptospirosis is rare in cats, and their role in leptospira transmission to humans is unclear. This is in contrast with the (asymptomatic) dogs, of which it is known that this pet animal might excrete leptospira in its urine.

Second, additional data were obtained in a retrospective study of sera (n=2195) of dogs previously sent in for diagnosis of suspected illness: in total, 11.89 percent were found to be positive in MAT, with prevalences ranging from 8.96 percent (2002) to 15.54 percent (2007). Again, Australis was the most important serogroup (38.4 percent), followed by Grippotyphosa (18.6 percent), and Pomona (9.8 percent). The serogroup Canicola, often considered as typical for dogs, was found in only 1.5 percent. (Behaeghel I, Butaye P, Goossens E: Evolution of leptospirosis in Belgian dogs from 2002 to 2009. Abstract at the BSAVA Congress, Birmingham UK, 2011; https://biblio.ugent.be/input/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=1201756&fileOId=1216029).

Third, in an additional cluster of sick dogs study (n=95 dogs, being 22 seropositive, and 73 seronegative), no significant (that is, p less than 0.05) differences were found when comparing a selection of haematological and chemical (liver and kidney) lab results between these 2 canine groups.

Fourth, in a prospective study in 74 suspected (that is, mostly symptomatic) animals, 39.18 percent of sick dogs were found to be MAT positive (1/100). No data were available corroborating a similar illness in their owners.

In conclusion, leptospirosis is widely spread in the Belgian dog and cat population, at higher than suspected prevalence. As in humans, the clinical spectrum of leptospirosis in dogs encompasses the whole spectrum, from a high fatality rate to a subclinical infection, depending perhaps on the causative serovar. Cats appear to be asymptomatic carriers (reservoirs?). No clear risk factors for leptospirosis infections in these pets could be identified. Their demonstrated shift in serovars implicates however that industry should preferably opt for multiple-serovar (or subunit) vaccines. Finally, an impact on human leptospirosis of this apparent rise since 2008 of canine leptospirosis seemed unlikely, since there was no concomitant rise of registered seroconfirmed human cases, still averaging 5 (in 2008) to 16 (in 2012) per year in Belgium.

Fifth, pets other than dogs and cats can also transmit leptospira to humans, in particular rodent pets. _L._ Icterohaemorrhagiae from colonies of pet rats has been reported as the source of fatal human infections (Nicolescu M, Borsai L, Alamita I: Leptospirosis in Albino rats. Arch Roum Path Exp Microbiol, 1973; 32(2): 171-7). However, another emerging infection can perfectly mimic in humans all symptoms and lab anomalies of leptospirosis: rodent-borne human hantavirus infections. Even dual human infections (hantavirus + leptospira) have been described, probably transmitted from double-infected wild or pet rats. Misdiagnosis of leptospirosis-suspected cases, but in fact hantavirus-infected persons, could explain the so-called "therapeutic failures" with antibiotics applied in these human cases.

Some rodent species, including rats (_Rattus norvegicus_ or _R. rattus_) are multiplying reservoirs for hantaviruses, excreting, after horizontal infection and for their lifespan, hantaviruses pathogenic for humans. Since the early 1980s, several hantavirus laboratory outbreaks have been reported in technicians handling laboratory rats (Clement J, McKenna P, Leirs H, et al: Hantavirus infections in rodents. In: Osterhaus A, ed. Virus Infections of Rodents and Lagomorphs. 1994. Amsterdam: Elsevier Science BV. pp 295-316.). This potential source of exposure has dried up since the 1990s, due to systematical screening of laboratory rats for hantaviruses. However, a severe hantavirus infection was recently described in a British pet rat owner, needing -- for eventual life support -- both mechanical ventilation and acute hemodialysis for several weeks (Taori SK, Jameson LJ, Campbell A, et al: UK hantavirus, renal failure, and pet rats. Lancet. 2013; 381(9871): 1070. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60599-1).

Before commercialization, pet rats should undergo the same scrutiny as laboratory rats, since they could transmit 2 entirely different (bacterial and viral) pathogens to humans, resulting however, in exactly the same clinical picture, thus baffling the attending clinician.

Previously, hantavirus-seropositive cats have been described in China, Austria, and in the UK, without mentioning health problems in their owners. In Belgium, hantavirus-seropositive dogs and cats have likewise been reported, again without data of hantaviral pathogen transfer to their owners. Indeed, such a transfer seems unlikely, even when these cats or dogs have been eating hantavirus-infected rodents, since they are dead-end hosts for hantaviruses, just like humans. So far, infectious hantaviruses have never been demonstrated in the excreta of these pet animals.
