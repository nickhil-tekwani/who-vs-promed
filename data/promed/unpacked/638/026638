VIRAL GASTROENTERITIS UPDATE 2002 - UK & IRELAND(03)

[The outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis included in these updates have the
characteristics of "winter vomiting disease," and are presumed to be caused
by Norwalk-like viruses (i.e., caliciviruses classified in the genus
_Norovirus_), although this is rarely confirmed microbiologically. The UK
and Ireland seem to be particularly prone at present to outbreaks of
"winter-vomiting" disease in institutional settings. - Mod.CP]

Norwalk-like virus in Healthcare Facilities, U.S. versus U.K.
-----------------------------------------------
In a recent comment to the ProMED-mail post entitled "Norwalk-like virus,
cruise ship - USA (Florida) 20021026.5642" the moderator stated "It is
intriguing that the reports of Norwalk-like virus infection from North
America relate predominantly to food-borne outbreaks and outbreaks in
recreational settings, whereas the reports from Europe, and the UK in
particular, concern outbreaks in health-care establishments and schools."
While this may reflect a predilection on the part of U.S. reports to focus
on foodborne and recreational setting outbreaks, the real epidemiological
difference between the U.S. and the U.K. appears to be in the type of
healthcare facility affected by NLVs: in the U.K. hospitals and nursing
homes or other residential care facilities appear to be equally affected,
while in the U.S., nursing home outbreaks are relatively common, but
outbreaks in hospitals are rarely reported.
Recent ProMED reports have documented significant NLV outbreaks in
hospitals in the U.K. From 1992 to 2000 The Public Health Laboratory
Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre received reports of 1877
laboratory confirmed outbreaks of NLV infection in England and Wales,
affecting 57 000 people, 24 of whom died. There were 754 outbreaks in
hospitals, 724 outbreaks in residential care homes, 147 outbreaks in
hotels, 105 restaurants, and 73 in schools. In 85 percent of cases the mode
of transmission was person-to-person spread, and only 10 percent were
foodborne. (PHLS. Outbreaks of Norwalk-like virus infection. Commun Dis Rep
CDR Weekly 24 Jan 2002
<http://www.phls.org.uk/publications/cdr/archive02/News/news0402.html#Norwalk>).
Presumably as a reflection of the importance of NLV outbreaks in hospitals
in the U.K., a guide to their management was recently published (Chadwick
PR, Beards G, Brown D, et al. Report of the Public Health Laboratory
Service Viral Gastroenteritis Working Group. Management of hospital
outbreaks of gastro-enteritis due to small round structured viruses. J Hosp
Infect (2000) 45: 1-10.
<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/norwalk/hospital_srsv.pdf>).
In contrast, CDC examined 90 outbreaks of non-bacterial gastroenteritis
reported to 33 state health departments from Jan 1996 to Jun 1997, for
which it found NLVs by PCR in 86. Nursing homes were the most frequent
setting, accounting for 43 percent of the outbreaks and apparently all of
the healthcare facility outbreaks. Restaurants and events with catered
meals accounted for only 26 percent, and vacation settings (including
cruise ships) accounted for only 11 percent (Fankhauser R L. et al.
Molecular Epidemiology of "Norwalk-like Viruses" in Outbreaks of
Gastroenteritis in the United Statescfn1. Journal Infect Dis 1998;178:1571-1578
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/JID/journal/issues/v178n6/980618/980618.text.html#fn1#fn1>).
In a MEDLINE search for recent hospital outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis
in the U.S. I found only one report, in which nurses visiting their
colleague who was hospitalized with acute viral gastroenteritis were
implicated in the outbreak (Caceres VM et al, A viral gastroenteritis
outbreak associated with person-to-person spread among hospital staff.
Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 1998 Mar;19(3):162-7). In California in the
past 10 years, reports of nursing home outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis
have been common while none have been reported in acute care hospitals.
Assuming this difference is real, I welcome ProMED subscribers' comments on
the possible reasons. I would not expect basic infection control
precautions such as hand washing to differ dramatically. In questioning
colleagues, differences in admission rates and hospital ward structure have
been offered as possibilities.

England: Virus outbreak Causes Admissions Crisis at Epsom Hospital
--------------------------------------------------
New patients are being turned away from wards after a winter vomiting virus
swept through troubled Epsom Hospital. Patients on 4 wards at the hospital
in Dorking Road, Epsom have been struck down by the [virus]. Managers have
been forced to close affected wards off to newcomers to stop the virus
spreading further. This is bad news for the hospital where the number of
patients coming in is already limited by the number of beds being occupied
by patients waiting for social services care to be arranged before being
discharged. The Alex and Croft ward, 2 bays on the Britten ward, and a bay
on the Buckley ward have all been hit by the vomiting virus, but none of
the patients in the affected areas will be moved.
Dr Lindy Stevens, medical director at Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust,
explained that although the virus is unpleasant, it is very rarely
dangerous and the symptoms normally pass within 24 and 48 hours. She said:
"We are temporarily not introducing new patients to these areas so that the
virus can be isolated. The situation is now improving and is being reviewed
on a daily basis. We anticipate that the affected areas will be able to
accept new patients by the end of the week." But while the infection is
kept under control, friends and relatives of patients on the affected wards
are being asked to keep their visits brief and to keep contact to a
minimum. Dr Stevens added: "However, we would like to stress that it is
business as usual and we will still continue to admit patients via accident
and emergency and for planned operations."
An estimated one million people in Britain fall foul of the effects of the
virus every year, although most incidents are not reported to doctors or
health officials. Winter is usually high season for the virus because
people are more confined indoors in smoky, stuffy or crowded environments.
A spokesperson for the Public Health Laboratory Service, which monitors the
levels of such viruses, said: "Cases are going up but that is what we would
expect to see at this time of year."

Scotland: Viral Outbreak Threatens Scottish Soccer
--------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of [viral gastroenteritis] is sweeping through Scottish soccer.
The [virus infection] forced Scottish officials to call off a League Cup
game on Wed 30 Oct 2002 at Aberdeen against Motherwell. And the outbreak
briefly put question marks around Sunday's Aberdeen at match at Celtic
Park, Glasgow, and perhaps another game on Sun 3 Nov 2002 between Edinburgh
rivals Hibernian and Hearts. Hibernian was the last club to play at
Aberdeen. The Aberdeen-Celtic match was eventually given the go-ahead on
Friday with Aberdeen saying the situation had [improved]. "Things have
improved greatly and only 5 players have been sent home today," a club
spokesman said.
