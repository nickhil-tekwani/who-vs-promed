Fear returned to Mauritania from the emergence of a new epidemic of Rift Valley Fever. This has been noted following information from the Sheikh Zayed Hospital in Nouakchott, yesterday evening [30 Sep 2012], about the death of a [20-year-old] man due to RVF.

The Mauritanian Ministry of Health has delegated a medical mission to the north of the country, where the village where the victim came from is located.

There is also suspicion of RVF as the cause of death of a young woman, yesterday [30 Sep 2012], in the state of Brakna.

[RVF in humans may be indicative for the circulation of the virus in livestock, where it may cause mass abortions and high mortality in offspring of ruminants, particularly sheep and goats.

Confirmation of the reported cases in humans and information on the current RVF situation in Mauritania's livestock is anticipated. - Mod.AS
