A 14-year-old boy has died of hantavirus infection in Okanagan,
British Columbia. Medical Health Officer Dr. Rob Parker says the boy
was most likely infected in his home, which was in a semi-rural area
and had an infestation of mice. Hantavirus infection is [associated]
with a respiratory ailment caused by [inhaling] air contaminated
with a virus from deer mouse droppings. Parker says he won't release
the boy's name or his community in order to protect the family's
privacy. The boy died last Friday [16 Jun 2006] in the Children's
Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia.
He says there is no increased risk to the general public because of
the case, pointing out that hantavirus is not transmitted from person
to person.

[The 1st documented case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Canada
occurred in Alberta in 1989. Subsequently 7 species or tentative
species of hantavirus have been identified in Canada: _Prospect Hill
virus_, _Bloodland lake virus_, _Topografov virus_, _Sin Nombre
virus_, _New York virus_, _El Moro canyon virus_ and _Blue river virus_.
Only Sin Nombre virus and New York virus are known to be pathogenic
to humans. The principal reservoir of Sin Nombre virus is the deer
mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), and that of New York virus is the
white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_).
Hantavirus-infected deer mice have been found in every province
except Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Deer mice infected with
viral strains closely related to New York virus have been found in
eastern Canada (Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario).
Mice infected with strains related to Sin Nombre virus and have been
found west of Ontario. Consequently the hantavirus responsible for
the death of the teenager in British Columbia is likely to be Sin
Nombre virus. - Mod.CP]
