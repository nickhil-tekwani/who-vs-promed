The Health Ministry has noted that the number of deaths caused by
Dengue Fever is increasing and that the number of infected is greatly
increasing in Male and the atolls.
Public Health's Director General Ibrahim Shaheem said that 2 children and one
man have died so far in 2006 because of the disease. The Health Ministry said
that 10-12 new cases are reported daily. This means that more than 300 new
cases are reported monthly.
Health Ministry's Medical Director Dr. Ahmed Raazee said Tuesday that
each day, at least 2 cases of the most dangerous forms of Dengue,
namely Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Hemorrhagic Shock, are
also reported.
The Ministry said that the number of those infected with the disease
is increasing throughout Maldives. The Ministry said that since
dangerous forms of dengue are being found, the number of fatalities
is also increasing. However fatality statistics were not disclosed.
The Health Ministry said that they are carrying out awareness
programs about the disease [which is] spread by a daytime-biting
mosquito and that those involved in treating the infected are being
informed of how to carry out the treatment and that [measures] are
being [taken] to control mosquitoes.
Dr. Raazee said that the public should be aware that if a medicine
other than Paracetamol is taken to lower fever, it could be
dangerous. "The best thing to do is to give Paracetamol. Then liquids
should be given," Dr. Raazee said.
"Ways to prevent mosquito bites should be found. For example mosquito
repellant sprays are available cheaply. Those should be used."
Special programs being planned to control dengue fever
------------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever is present in different parts of the Maldives, and
measures will be taken immediately to give protection from it, said
Public Health on Tuesday [7 Feb 2006].
Deputy Director General Ibrahim Shaheem said that dengue fever is a
danger that we must always be aware of and that appropriate measures
are being decided upon. "These measures will be in effect in about 2
days," he said.
Public Health records show that the percentage of people who have
sought treatment for dengue fever has remained constant for some
months now. Shaheem said that, on average, about 5 new cases of
dengue fever are reported every day.
"Among the people who have caught the fever, there is no one who is
seriously ill yet," he said. "It is children who catch dengue the
most."

Queensland Health yesterday confirmed that there are now 7 cases of
dengue in the suburb, with the latest onsets of the illness reported
on 2 Feb and late January 2006.
The cases were found in 3 different streets in Cranbrook, with the
health authority yesterday issuing a warning in the area where the
cases were found, which includes Ross River Rd from Alice to Wattle
and Louise streets, and from Banksia and Cadiz courts to Gilli
Crescent and Jannila Avenue.
This follows an outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease in the area
between late December [2005] and mid-January [2006].
4 people from the same house, aged from 19 to 79, were affected by
the disease while another case was reported on 28 Jan 2006.
Townsville City Council Community Safety Committee chairwoman
Councillor Jenny Hill said council staff inspected 140 properties out
of 205 in the area, and 8 per cent were found to have mosquitoes
breeding on the premises.
"Most people have been good and helpful. If they're home they've made
sure the staff have had access, but the big problem is just trying to
reinforce that message that people need to check their own property,"
Cr Hill said. "If you are mowing your grass and you see containers
full of water, make sure you empty them."
She said residents should not be confused about any spraying for mosquitoes
the council was doing in other areas of Townsville. Following torrential rain
recently, the council undertook a concerted air and ground attack on saltmarsh
mosquitoes in freshwater and saltwater breeding sites in a 300-ha area
stretching from Cungulla to the Town Common and offshore to Magnetic Island.
"Any spraying we do or anything we do like that is useless for
dengue," Cr Hill said. "The dengue mosquito is a mosquito that
primarily exists in household areas, so we need householders to look
at potential breeding places. We talk about pot plant bases, paint
trays, bird baths, dog bowls, buckets and those sorts of things. It
requires a lot of manpower to manage, but everyone wants to get this
right, while mosquitoes are out there, to prevent dengue fever being
spread."
Cr Hill said there was no cause for alarm. "Residents shouldn't be
alarmed, they need to be careful, and they need to heed warnings from
public health and council, which are to check your back yards
regularly and remove any empty container that can hold water," she
said. "That way you can lessen the risk of contracting ... dengue fever."
There were 18 confirmed cases of dengue fever in Townsville last year
[2005], and one death in far north Queensland.
A dengue epidemic broke out in Townsville in the early 90s, leaving
900 people infected.

The Tropical Population Health Unit is warning people to destroy
mosquito breeding sites after one more case of dengue fever was
confirmed in Townsville. There are now 6 cases, all of them in the
suburb of Cranbrook.
[During January 2006], a family of 4 contracted the mosquito-borne
illness and there have been 2 more cases in the past 2 weeks.
John Piispanen from the Tropical Population Health Unit says there is
still the potential for dengue to spread across the city.
"The other item of concern is that officers from Townsville,
Thuringowa and ourselves are still finding significant amounts of
breeding out there, and that just means that [there is] the potential
for dengue to spread, and it will spread quickly from here if we
can't contain it, the potential is still there," he said.
"So the message to the public [is] still the same, I suppose the good
one for north Queensland is 'just don't get bitten by a mosquito.'"

Singapore's worst dengue fever outbreak is under control following a
sharp drop in the number of people infected.
>From an average of 99 weekly cases in December 2005, the number fell
to 61 in January 2006, Minister for the Environment and Water
Resources Yaacob Ibrahim told parliament.
"I am pleased to inform members that the dengue situation in
Singapore has improved and is now under control," the minister said
on Monday.
The city state's worst-ever dengue fever outbreak left 19 people dead
during 2005 and more than 13 000 infected with the disease, which is
caused by the Aedes mosquito. At the peak of the outbreak the number
of new cases reached more than 100 people a day, the health ministry
said last year.
The wealthy Southeast Asian city-state, which has built a reputation
as one of the cleanest in the region, set aside 30 million Singapore
dollars (18.4 million US) to contain the outbreaks.

5 persons have died so far in 2006 because of meningitis and
hemorrhagic dengue, conditions that are affecting coastal areas in
Ecuador, Dr. Ivan Zambrano, Ecuadorian Minister of Health, announced
last Thursday.
He pointed out that the main epidemics caused by the intense rainy
season are classic dengue fever (561 confirmed cases) and hemorrhagic
dengue fever (23 confirmed cases, including 3 deaths).
He indicated that coastal provinces mostly affected by dengue fever
are Guayas (310 cases) and El Oro (Peruvian Border, 118 cases).
Dr. Zambrano stated that the sanitary situation in Ecuadorian coast
is "worrisome" because of the effects of heavy rainfalls.
Former Ecuadorian Minister of Health, Dr. Willington Sanchez, warned
in June 2005 that 850 000 Ecuadorian citizens were at risk for
developing deadly hemorrhagic dengue fever. "We have a high
population density, nearly 850 000 persons living on the coast who
have had classic dengue fever in the past few years, and these
persons are at risk for developing hemorrhagic dengue fever", he
affirmed.

The Colombian city of Yopal was trying to stem a dengue outbreak that
has already claimed the life of an 11-month-old baby, health
officials said Friday. "We're facing an emergency," said Dr. Juan
Eduardo Duran, director of the main hospital in Yopal, 210 kilometers
west of Bogota.
An outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease is common during the summer
months of January and February in Yopal, where the city's 100 000
mostly poor residents deposit water in open-air tanks, the doctor
said. But since the start of the year, the city has reported 23 cases
of the more lethal dengue haemorrhagic fever, compared to just 5
during all of 2005.
"Everything is pointing an epidemic of great proportions," Duran told the
Associated Press. To control the spread of the disease, officials have begun
fumigating the town. An 11-month-old baby boy died in a Bogota hospital in
late January [2006] after doctors in Yopal struggled for 5 days to keep him
alive.

Some 2000 people in Vietnam's southern Mekong Delta were infected with dengue
fever in the January - early February period of 2006, of whom one died, local
newspaper Saigon Liberation reported Monday.
[for country profile see
<http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/vietnam.html>]
Most of the sufferers are from the provinces of Hau Giang, An Giang
and Dong Thap, where weather conditions and the local people's habit
of storing water in containers at their houses favored the
development of mosquitoes -- the disease's transmitter.
To minimize the number of new infections, local health workers are
encouraging residents to kill mosquitoes and their larvae more
actively.
Vietnam reported 49 400 cases of dengue fever infections, including 51
fatalities in 2005, down 32.7 percent and 49.5 percent, respectively, from the
previous year [2004], , according to the country's General Statistics Office.

A 2-year-old girl has been diagnosed with dengue fever, but due to
the rising number of dengue fever patients at local hospitals, she is
confined to a cot in a corridor of the hospital. Her 38-year-old
mother stays by her side.
"During visiting hours, the corridor will be full with people passing
through, but what can I do? All the treatment rooms are full," the
mother explained.
The number of dengue fever patients at the hospital, according to
director Mulyo Hartono, has risen markedly throughout February 2006.
Over the last 4 weeks, his hospital has treated 87 dengue patients.
"Starting 5 Feb 2006, dengue patients keep coming in and the
available rooms are limited," Mulyo said.
Most of the patients, he said, were children, while the children's
ward could only accommodate 20 patients. "Today, there are at least
35 pediatric patients with dengue at the hospital, so more than a
dozen have just been put out in the hallway," he said.
Meanwhile, the head of Yogyakarta's health agency, Choirul Anwar,
blamed the rise in dengue cases on local residents, who he claimed
had been negligent in keeping their surroundings clean.
"We've visited (dengue fever) patients' houses, and in areas like
Umbulharjo and Giwangan, no houses are free from mosquito larvae. Out
of 100 houses visited, all had areas where larvae were growing,"
Choirul told The Jakarta Post by phone.
