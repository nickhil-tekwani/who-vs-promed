SALMONELLA INFECTIONS, REPTILES (02)

We have good news and bad news regarding the iguana and boa constrictor with
Salmonella at the Tennesee Aquarium. The good news is that there is little
reason for the aquarium to rid itself of the iguana and boa constrictor. The
bad news is that all the reptiles and amphibians probably carry Salmonella.
There are over 2,300 serotypes of Salmonella. Of these, over 40% have been
found almost exclusively in reptiles and amphibians. There appears to be a
commensal relationship between Salmonella and reptiles, and even wild
reptiles caught in the Amazon forest from areas where no humans were thought
ever to have lived have had Salmonella cultured from their stool. Multiple
studies have shown that reptiles and amphibians in zoological parks and in
the wild carry Salmonella, and we have conducted a study in pet stores
showing that with a single sample, 59% of reptiles had stool cultures yield
Salmonella. There is increasing evidence that if cultured frequently enough
all reptiles will be shown to carry Salmonella--it is just that shedding in
stool may be intermittent and culturing practices are not 100% sensitive. In
fact, a recent, as yet unpublished study of laboratory housed iguanas showed
just that; all shed Salmonella in their stool if cultured frequently enough.
So, it is expensive and unnecessary to test reptiles for Salmonella unless
they are sick.
What this means from a public health point of view is not that zoos and
aquariums should not involve these animals in their educational programs,
but that a few precautions should be taken. First, very young children and
people who are immunocompromised should not touch reptiles and amphibians.
Second, children that are capable of thoroughly washing their hands
(probably 5 years old or older) should be supervised while washing their
hands after touching the reptiles after the exhibit. This presents a good
educational opportunity in any case. To be prudent, program personnel may
choose to exhibit the reptiles in cages or have a handler hold the reptiles
outside the cages but not allow any visitors to touch them. This would
greatly reduce the chance that anyone would get Salmonella infection
(except, of course, the handler, who would want to wash her or his hands
afterwards!).
