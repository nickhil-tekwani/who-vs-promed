Marine deaths linked to toxin
-------------------------------
An algae bloom that sickens birds and mammals is 'especially
virulent' this spring. A particularly virulent outbreak of a
naturally occurring toxin off the California coast has been linked to
the deaths of hundreds of marine mammals and birds in recent weeks,
researchers said Thursday.
"I have been doing this work for 35 years and I have never seen
anything like this as far as the number of species affected, other
than an oil spill," said Jay Holcomb, director of the International
Bird Rescue Research Center in San Pedro. Local beaches have been
littered with sick and dead pelicans, sea lions and dolphins. "We
have very serious concerns about what is happening to seabirds and
how it may affect populations, especially California brown pelicans,
who are heading into breeding season," he said.
The toxin, domoic acid, is produced by microscopic algae and has
become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Scientists suspect the
upsurge has been caused by such things as overfishing, destruction of
wetlands and pollution, all of which have harmed fisheries and
allowed algae to flourish. Although the toxin has not been
definitively linked to all the recent deaths, many of the dead
animals -- including 5 species of birds -- tested positive for domoic
acid poisoning, said scientists at the rescue center and the Caron
Laboratory at USC.
Domoic acid, which accumulates in shellfish and fish and is then
passed on to the birds and animals that eat them, has occurred each
spring over the past decade as ocean water warms and algae bloom. But
this year's algae are "especially virulent," according to the rescue
center. The center is working closely with the Caron Laboratory,
which is conducting analysis of sick birds found on beaches.
"In 5 years of study I have not seen a bloom this large at this
particular time of year," said Professor Dave A. Caron, the lab's
director and a biological oceanographer. "It's having an
extraordinary impact on pelicans and many other species."
Dead birds began littering Southland beaches in March [2007].
Staffers with the bird rescue center walking the beaches reported
seeing "dead birds everywhere," including grebes, gulls, cormorants,
American avocets and loons. Scientists are particularly concerned
about the toxin's effect on brown pelicans, which declined
precipitously in California after DDT entered their food chain and
caused the large seabirds to lay eggs with shells too fragile to
support their weight. The birds remain on the endangered species
list, although they have made considerable gains in recent years.
In the past several weeks, dozens of sea lions, dolphins and even
whales have also washed ashore dead or dying from Venice to San Luis
Obispo. Earlier this month [April 2007] in Ventura, an 8-foot
juvenile minke whale washed up dead near the end of San Pedro Street
at San Buenaventura State Beach. Lifeguards buried it in the sand.
In Santa Barbara, a 29-foot sperm whale washed ashore 9 Apr [2007]
near Isla Vista. In both instances involving whales, investigators
collected tissue samples from the carcasses in an effort to pinpoint
the cause of death, but the carcass of the sperm whale may have been
too decomposed to yield a final answer.
The Marine Mammal Center near Sausalito in Northern California said
it has been overwhelmed with sick sea lions who eat the same fish as
pelicans: anchovies and sardines. Whether an animal lives or dies can
depend on how much of the poison it ingests. Widespread outbreaks of
domoic acid poisoning are known by scientists to strike sea lions as
well as dolphins. These mammals pick up the acid by eating anchovies
and sardines that have fed on toxic algae.
Although the algae have been around for eons, they have bloomed with
extraordinary intensity along the Pacific Coast in recent years. That
explosion of harmful algae, in turn, has caused toxins to move
through the food chain and concentrate in the dietary staples of
marine mammals, causing poisoning that scrambles the brains of the
animals and leads them to wash ashore.
In humans, domoic acid poisoning can cause vomiting, nausea,
diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, confusion,
disorientation, loss of short-term memory, weakness, seizures,
cardiac arrhythmias, coma and possibly death, according to the bird
rescue center. Humans can be affected after eating contaminated
shellfish, but cannot be poisoned simply by swimming in the ocean.
"In my opinion, domoic acid is the new DDT," Holcomb said. "If the
effects of domoic acid (DA) poisoning are cumulative in the brain,
and we don't know that yet, it could have serious consequences on the
population of California brown pelicans."
