Oregon health officials suspect 2 more illnesses are part of a raw milk outbreak traced nearly 3 weeks ago to a farm near Wilsonville. William Keene, senior epidemiologist with Oregon Public Health, said the 2 adults had both consumed raw milk from Foundation Farm, including one who continued to drink it after being warned about the outbreak.

Keene said one was sickened by _Campylobacter_, the other by _Cryptosporidium_, making 21 likely cases in the outbreak. Ten others were infected with _E. coli_ O157. One of the worst foodborne pathogens, _E. coli_ O157:H7 was on rectal swabs from 2 of the farm's 4 cows. Milk and manure from the farm also tested positive for the same bacteria.

State epidemiologists did not test the cows or the environment for these other organisms, so they don't know for sure that the new cases are linked to Foundation Farm milk, but Keene said it's likely. "There is a long list of pathogens that people can get from raw milk," he said.

Four children who drank the milk were hospitalized with acute kidney failure, which is associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7. As of Fri 27 Apr 2012, they were still in the hospital, Keene said.

Two of the patients, aged 14 and 13, are Portland area middle schoolers. The others are 3 and one years old. A 5th child from Lane County, who drank the milk while visiting relatives in the Portland area, was hospitalized and released.

Foundation Farm, located on 5 acres in the Stafford area, had a herd-share operation for a least a year selling parts of cows to 48 families. In return, they had regular access to the raw milk.

Health officials also interviewed most of the families. They were surprised that a person continued to drink the milk even after being advised that it was contaminated. Keene said the 2nd patient went looking for a new source.

Just under 3 percent of Oregonians drink raw milk, according to a survey by Oregon Public Health. They tend to be passionate about it, despite public warnings.

"We've documented yet another unfortunate incident where people missed the boat on one of the great advances in public health, pasteurization," Keene said.
