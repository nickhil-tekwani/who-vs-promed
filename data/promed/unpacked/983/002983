Bladen County virus warning issued
----------------------------------
ELIZABETHTOWN, July 4: Health officials have issued a warning to Bladen
County [North Carolina residents after a chicken tested positive for
Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). EEE virus is associated with a
potentially deadly sickness spread by mosquitoes. It is not transmitted
from person to person. Humans rarely exhibit signs of the disease, but it
can be fatal. The virus was located during routine blood tests last week.
The chicken is among 54 sentinel flocks in 28 counties that state health
officials monitor for strains [sic of encephalitis viruses.
A nine-year-old girl who died last week in Asheville was being treated as a
suspected case of another strain [sic of encephalitis called La Crosse
encephalitis. A laboratory is testing the girl's blood and spinal fluid to
confirm the cause of her death. Doctors say people rarely die of this
strain of the virus.

[Eastern equine encephalitis is a flavivirus. La Crosse virus is a
bunyavirus. The latter is one of fourteen members of the California
serogroup of bunyaviruses and the one responsible for the vast majority
cases of encephalitis. The natural vector, _Aedes triseriatus_, exists
predominantly east of the Mississippi river in the United States which
makes the second part of this report significant, if confirmed. In endemic
areas a high proportion of squirrels and chipmunks are seropositive. -Mod. CP
