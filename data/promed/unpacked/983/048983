To date, 1578 severely sick or dead harbour seals were found at the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein, with the vast majority reported from the islands of Sylt, Helgoland, Amrum, and Foehr. Only few more dead seals were found over the last couple of days [19-20 Nov 2014] and most of these animals seemed to be dead for a while. Therefore, the National Park Administration is expecting the disease to subside. Almost 90 percent of harbour seals in the area survived the influenza epidemic.

In Lower Saxony few more than 100 dead animals were found and influenza H10N7 was confirmed. In the Netherlands, first dead harbour seals were reported, while results of the laboratory analysis are pending.

[Influenza A viruses are classified according to subtypes that are a combination of 16 possible HA (hemagglutinin) and 9 possible NA (neuraminidase). In the past (1979-1983, 2012), influenza A virus was isolated from seals that died from pneumonia in New England (USA).
