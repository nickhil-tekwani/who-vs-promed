More than 90 guests developed salmonellosis after visiting a popular
restaurant in central Stockholm. It is the largest outbreak of the
bacterium in Sweden in over 3 years, Svenska Dagbladet reports.
Six of the guests at Hurry Curry restaurant also contracted bloodstream
infection after the bacteria entered their circulatory system. Most of the
cases of food poisoning occurred between 12 and 16 Oct 2006, and many of
those infected have not yet recovered.
"It was a slightly more poisonous type of bacteria than we are used to
seeing. I don't know how many people in total needed to go to hospital, but
a person of normal health will get over a salmonella infection. But many of
them are not well yet," epidemiologist Birgitta de Jong told Svenska Dagbladet.
The infection seems to have spread from a batch of mung beans. Health
authorities have praised the restaurant for its handling of the outbreak.
Staff immediately suspected that the mung beans were the cause and removed
the offending batch. No further infections were reported.

[The serotype of the outbreak organism is not stated nor is in what dish
the mung beans were served. The apparent number of cases with persistent
symptoms one month after onset with salmonellosis is unusual, although the
manifestation of illness in these prolonged cases is not stated.
ProMED thanks Brent Barrett for this submission. - Mod.LL]
