1. It seems the daily update newsletter out of DRC is being revived. Here's some info from Fri [26 Jul 2019], I think.
+11 cases, looks like 12 deaths (4 confirmed, 8 in the community. Outbreak totals: 2641 cases, 1773 deaths.

2. The report that came out overnight (currently available thru WhatsApp only) catches up a bit on the days last week for which there was no update. This shows the number of people released from treatment centers (CTE) having been cured:
19, Beni; 9 Mabalako; 6, Katwa; 1 Butembo

3. Big jump yesterday (27 Jul 2019): +18 cases. That's the highest single day increase in July 2019, though one other day (19 Jul 2019) also recorded 18 cases.

4. Most of these 18 #Ebola cases are from Beni (11). I believe 3/18 are health workers. If yes, that would bring health worker infections to 145. But there's been a fair amount of discrepancy lately with different places listing different HCW numbers, so not sure.

5. Of the 18 #Ebola cases confirmed Sat [27 Jul 2019], 7 were children under the age of 18. Actually, all are 9 & under. Five remain alive; 2 have died; 6 weren't vaccinated; no info on #7.

[Middle East Monitor, abridged, edited]
https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190726-south-sudan-no-confirmed-ebola-case/

Ebola virus. Suspected case in South Sudan earlier this week has NOT been confirmed.
------------------
South Sudan is free from Ebola after reports of a suspected case early this week, which has caused panic among citizens of the African country, the deputy information minister said Friday [26 Jul 2019], Anadolu reported.

"Health Minister Dr Riek Gai Kok has announced in today's [26 Jul 2019] cabinet meeting that there is no Ebola case in South Sudan so citizens should not panic," Lily Albino Akol said.

"There is no confirmed Ebola case in the country. Early this week there was a scare whereby a patient [40-year-old woman] has shown symptoms related to Ebola, including bleeding, and people thought that it might be Ebola," she said.

"However, the preliminary results from the laboratory tests on the Ebola case in Juba have proven that the patient does not have the virus," Akol told journalists after the cabinet meeting.

According to Dr. Riek Gai, more samples have been sent to Uganda for further verification.

[3] Response
- Tue 23 Jul 2019. Uganda (Kikuube)
[Observer, abridged, edited]
https://observer.ug/news/headlines/61425-cnooc-halts-works-in-kikuube-over-ebola-scare

China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) Uganda Ltd., a Chinese firm licensed to operate the Kingfisher oil field, has halted activities in Kikuube district due to an Ebola scare.

The suspension of activities follows the death of a suspected Ebola patient at the Buhuka health centre on Sat 20 Jul 2019. Reports from the area indicate that the said patient who reported to the health centre with Ebola-like symptoms was a Congolese national who had crossed into Uganda for treatment.

CNOOC Uganda public relations supervisor Amina Bukenya confirmed that all their field staff in the area have been recalled to Kampala for health and safety reasons. She says the decision is in line with the company's health, safety and environment (HSE) requirements that emphasize the safety of workers at all times.

Bukenya says the workers will return to the field once the Ministry of Health and other partners assure them that the place is free of Ebola. CNOOC, which has a camp in the area, has since been closed off to any outsiders and instructed all its staff to stay within the camp.

Sources indicate the Petroleum Authority of Uganda has also advised its staff to suspend activities in the area. Dr Joseph Kobusheshe, the director of environment, ICT, and data management, in his communication to all the Authority's staff says the victim was a fisherman living within the area.

It is not yet clear whether the company Total, which operates in Bugungu area, will join CNOOC to halt its activities. Total's PR field coordinator Chris Ocowun said all activities in the field are going on normally, though precautionary measures have been instituted at the camp. He says visitors are not being allowed into the camp and that screening facilities have also been established at the entry to the camp.

- Sat 27 Jul 2019. Saudi Arabia
[Telegraph Star, abridged, edited]
https://telegraphstar.com/saudi-arabia-suspends-visas-to-pilgrims-from-congo-fearing-spread-of-ebola/

Saudi Arabia has suspended issuing visas to pilgrims from the Democratic Republic of the Congo over fears that Ebola could spread during next month's [August 2019] Hajj pilgrimage there.

Wed [24 Jul 2019] morning, a note issued by the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited last week's move by the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the Ebola outbreak in DRC's eastern North Kivu and Ituri provinces a public health emergency of international concern. WHO has pleaded to all countries to not impose a ban on any country on account of Ebola being widespread, but Saudi Arabia has ignored this plea from WHO, keeping its citizens' safety above international relations.

- Sun 28 Jul 2019. UN World Food Program
[VOA News, abridged, edited]
https://www.voanews.com/africa/un-double-food-rations-ebola-affected-people-dr-congo

The U.N. World Food Program says it plans to double food rations to assist 440 000 people affected by the Ebola virus and their contacts over the next 6 months to respond to escalating needs in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The dramatic scale-up of food assistance is aimed at providing essential nutritional support to thousands of people affected by the Ebola virus. Recipients will receive food for 28 days. This is 1 week longer than the 21-day incubation period, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms.

The World Food Program says the operation also will allow agencies working to contain the deadly virus to keep tabs on the health situation of contacts of victims and their families, as well as of confirmed and suspected cases.

WFP spokesman Herve Verhoosel explained that beneficiaries of this expanded program will be required to come to specific distribution sites every week to pick up their food rations. "And, when they receive the food, the health team can make the medical check needed in that 21-day period."

Verhoosel says people who have been infected by the Ebola virus and who have recovered will receive food rations for one year.

To encourage community cooperation, he says WFP is planning to quadruple the number of primary schools in Ebola-affected areas that will receive nutritious hot lunches. He says chronic malnutrition is rife in this area, and for many children, this is the main or only meal of the day. He says the number of children slated to receive school meals will rise from 17 000 to 70 000.

Verhoosel says WFP urgently needs USD 50 million over the next 6 months to carry out its operation in conflict-ridden North Kivu and Ituri provinces, as well as in neighboring Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.

[The arrangement of having potential Ebola virus contacts pick up food from health centers is a good one, assuring they will be checked regularly for signs of infection. And increasing the availability of hot lunches in schools will help not only with Ebola, but also other diseases such as measles, which are exacerbated by poor nutritional status. - Mod.LK]

[4] Research review
ref: Hoenen T, Groseth A, Feldmann H. Therapeutic strategies to target the Ebola virus life cycle. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2019 Jul 24. doi: 10.1038/s41579-019-0233-2. [Epub ahead of print]

Abstract
Following the Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa, there has been increased awareness of the need for improved therapies for emerging diseases, including viral haemorrhagic fevers such as those caused by Ebola virus and other filoviruses. Our continually improving understanding of the virus life cycle coupled with the increased availability of "omics" analyses and high-throughput screening technologies has enhanced our ability to identify potential viral and host factors and aspects involved in the infection process that might be intervention targets. In this review, we address compounds that have shown promise to various degrees in interfering with the filovirus life cycle, including monoclonal antibodies such as ZMapp, mAb114 and REGN-EB3 and inhibitors of viral RNA synthesis such as remdesivir and TKM-Ebola. Furthermore, we discuss the general potential of targeting aspects of the virus life cycle such as the entry process, viral RNA synthesis, and gene expression, as well as morphogenesis and budding.
