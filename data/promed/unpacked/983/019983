The regional laboratory for influenza diagnosis among birds in the
coastal city of Varna has established a positive result for H5N1 flu
in a common buzzard, the National Veterinary Service announced.

Veterinary inspectors found the bird dead in Konstantin and Elena
resort in the district of Varna while carrying out monitoring on
influenza among domestic and wild birds in Bulgaria.

Samples have been sent to the National Diagnosis and Research
Veterinary Institute in Sofia for confirmation. The results are
expected at the beginning of next week. DG SANCO has been notified.

[The Konstantin and Elena coastal resort, on the eastern side of
Varna, is about 70 km south of the Romanian border, about 250 km south
of the Danube Delta (Tulcea district), where 2 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1
were reported earlier this month (March 2010), map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/01bP>.

For a picture of a common buzzard, _Buteo buteo_, see
<http://i.pbase.com/g6/62/693062/2/84653171.cTcAnylu.jpg>. During
2006, dead common buzzards were found H5N1-infected in Denmark, Sweden
and Germany.

In case the buzzard is confirmed to be H5N1 positive, this will be an
additional indication about the significant role of wild, migratory
birds in the maintenance and spread of the disease. Enhanced
surveillance in other countries around the Black Sea is to be
anticipated.

The appearance of H5N1 in Romania's Danube delta in fall 2005 heralded
an epizootic involving Romania, Turkey and Ukraine. - Mod.AS]

[With H5N1 again reported in neighboring Romania -- OIE Alert, 16th
March 2010 (see ProMED archive below) -- there is always the risk of a
repeat of what happened in Bulgaria in 2006, though not apparently in
2007. So whatever one's reservations on a single bird, Bulgaria should
be on the alert for more surreptitious avian threats, whether from
infected poultry or migrating flocks. Dead buzzards or swans (both
migratory) are hard to miss, but smaller sick birds can be effectively
invisible." - Mod.MHJ/JW]
