Despite the intense vaccination drive undertaken by the Department of Health and Family Welfare against Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), popularly known as monkey fever in the district, one person has died due to it and 12 positive cases have been reported in the year 2016 so far. In 2015, one person had lost her life due to KFD and 48 positive cases were reported. Of the 12 cases reported this year, 10 are from Tirthahalli taluk [sub district] and one case each from Hosanagar and Sagar taluks. A 19-year-old girl from Raave village, Hosanagar taluk, who had been to her grandparent's house in Kaanukoppa village, Tirthahalli taluk, has died due to the disease during this period.

The department had undertaken the vaccination drive in the affected areas in December 2015 and in March this year. Shankarappa, District Surveillance Officer told The Hindu that, of the total number of positive cases reported every year, more than 80 percent of the cases will be recorded during summer. This year, only 12 positive cases have been reported so far. He said that the vaccination drive undertaken by the department has yielded positive results and the situation was very much under control.

From the past 4 years, KFD was confined to Tirthahalli and Hosanagar taluks. This year [2016], a positive case has been reported from Shetty Camp village near Kargal town in Sagar taluk. As per the guidelines, the vaccination should be undertaken in a radius of 5 km [about 3mi] around the place where the positive case is reported. The department has launched vaccination drive around Shetty Camp village now, he said.

Shimoga, officially renamed as Shivamogga, is a city and the district headquarters of Shimoga District in the central part of the state of Karnataka, India.

Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is a tickborne viral disease transmitted from monkeys to humans through tick bites. High fever, joint pain, bleeding from the nose and gums are among the symptoms of the disease. A number of KFD cases are reported from Karnataka state every year.

Although the formalin inactivated vaccine available has been used for years to control KFD, the increasing trend of the disease in the last 5 years, irrespective of routine vaccination requires a comprehensive review of vaccination strategy/formulation. - Mod.UBA]
