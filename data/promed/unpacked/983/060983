H5N1 mutations unveiled at H5N1 meeting
---------------------------------------
New details about the H5N1 transmission studies emerged today during a Royal Society conference on the topic in London, but with Dutch export restrictions blocking what one research group could share. Scientists who led the 2 studies in question both took the stage during the 1st day of a 2-day meeting to discuss a host of issues on the topic, from basic research to ethics. The Royal Society is offering a live webcast of the meeting. Fresh information about the 2 controversial studies comes just days after the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) reversed an earlier recommendation that the studies be published in redacted form, due to concerns about an accidental or intentional release of the modified H5N1 viruses.

Yoshihiro Kawaoka, DVM, PhD, who leads a group from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, gave a detailed look at his team's H5N1 studies on ferrets. He highlighted 4 mutations that his group produced, one of which is found in nature. 3 of the mutations were on the head of the virus HA [haemagglutinin protein] and one was on the stalk. The findings will appear in a future issue of Nature.

He said using a hybrid between H5N1 and the 2009 H1N1 virus allowed his group to focus on the haemagglutinin portion. Kawaoka added that the mutant strains weren't lethal to the animals and that the pathogenicity was less than that of the 2009 pandemic virus. Viruses containing the mutations were highly sensitive to antiviral drugs, and they reacted to sera from humans vaccinated against H5N1 [perhaps this should read sera from infected patients?]. Kawaoka added that his group's data could have implications for public health polity makers. "Our information allows us to find the right virus for the production of stockpiled vaccines," he added. of the mutations -- the one found in nature -- had loss of a glycosylation site, a characteristic that Kawaoka said is linked to transmissibility in humans, and a pattern increasingly seen in countries such as Egypt in which the H5N1 virus has infected humans. "We can use the information to understand what's happening in nature," he said, adding that better surveillance is needed to assess the risk of circulating strains.

Though the other research group, led by Ron Fouchier, PhD, at Erasmus University in the Netherlands, used a different virus strain in their ferret studies, "we found striking similarity -- mechanistically, a very interesting finding," Kawaoka said. However, Fouchier said today [3 Apr 2012] that he could only share the redacted version of his study at the conference, because the Dutch government hasn't yet lifted export controls on the information. While he couldn't disclose the mutations, he said the 2 studies provide more unanimous expert advice to countries that battle H5N1 threats. The group's findings will be published in an upcoming issue of Science.

Though the NSABB's reversal helps clear the way for publication in the 2 journals, the status of a voluntary moratorium on H5N1 research is unclear. In February 2012 a World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel recommended a host of measures, which included a research moratorium, pending a biosafety review of the practices at the labs.

One theme that wove through several of the Royal Society presentations today [3 Apr 2012] is the need for more discussion to tackle issues related to H5N1 transmission research. Keim [Paul Keim, PhD, acting director of the NSABB and a microbial geneticist at Northern Arizona University] and many of the other presenters said scientists need to come up with a framework and guidelines themselves to avoid lawmakers stepping in to steer policies, which would likely be even more burdensome.

[The rather scant information released so far indicates, not unexpectedly, that the mutations affecting transmissibility so far identified are all located in the HA genome subunit of the avian A(H5N1) influenza virus genome. The release of more precise information is still awaited. - Mod.CP]
