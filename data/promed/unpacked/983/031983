Soybean rust is caused by 2 species of the fungus _Phakopsora_ (_P.
pachyrhizi_ and _P. meibomiae_). _P. pachyrhizi_ is mainly found in Asia
(Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand)
and is the more aggressive species. _P. meibomiae_ occurs in the Americas
(Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rico, Puerto Rico). The disease was first detected
in 1994 in diseased soybean on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.
Of considerable current interest are reports of soybean rust in Africa.
According to Clive Levy, Plant Pathologist, Commercial Farmers Union,
Harare, Zimbabwe, it has been present in Rwanda and Uganda (since 1998),
and in Mozambique, Nigeria and Zambia (mid- to late 1999). Levy indicated
that the disease is likely present in Kenya, Tanzania and Malawi, but these
reports have not been confirmed. He also confirmed the occurrence of a
severe infection of rust in January of this year on an early-planted "trap"
crop in southeastern Zimbabwe about 150 km north of the South African
border. Levy reported to me in an e-mail message on 5 Mar 2001 of a likely
outbreak of the disease in the South African provinces of Mpumalanga and
KwaZulu-Natal, but that report needs to be confirmed. In his opinion,
soybean rust is now endemic in the southern central African region. The
status of the disease in eastern Central Africa and West Africa is unknown.
According to Reid Frederick, Molecular Biologist, USDA, Ft. Detrick, MD,
PCR analyses have confirmed that the soybean rust pathogens from Hawaii and
Zimbabwe are _P. pachyrhizi_. PCR-based diagnostic assays have also been
developed for either species of the fungus. Extensive screening for
resistance to the pathogen has been underway at the Chiangmai Field Crop
Research Center (Thailand) and the Rattray Arnold Research Station in
Harare (Zimbabwe). Numerous races of the pathogen have been found and thus
any resistance breeding program must include testing of a wide array of races.
There is no resistance to the disease in any of the commercial soybean
lines in the United States and there is some doubt that fungicides would be
cost-effective for large acreage application. According to Levy, control of
the disease using triazole-based fungicides is very effective when applied
from flowering onward, but late spraying, as these South African farmers
face, is unsatisfactory, especially once the disease "explodes" during
filling of the pods.
It will be interesting to determine how the pathogen develops under South
African conditions because the highland and coastal growing areas are very
different, and are atypical of those in central Africa. Conditions in
KwaZulu-Natal are similar to southern Queensland and northern New South
Wales where the disease was previously a problem. According to the
Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation, serious outbreaks
of this disease occur approximately every 4 years, often causing yield
losses of up to 20%. The disease is favored by cool wet weather, and it
survives from season to season on native _Glycine_ spp.
