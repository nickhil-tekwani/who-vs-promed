Conclusions and recommendations from the 2005 meeting of the Expert
Surveillance Panel on Equine Influenza Vaccines
-----------------------------------------------
These recommendations were made following a meeting, which was held
on 1 Apr 2005, of the Expert Surveillance Panel on Equine Influenza
Vaccines and relate to the composition of vaccines for 2005 and
beyond.

1. Influenza activity in 2004

Outbreaks of equine influenza in Argentina, Canada, Croatia, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, the UK and
the USA were reported during 2004. The outbreak that occurred during
February and March in France was widespread and affected vaccinated
as well as unvaccinated horses.

All influenza activity was associated with H3N8 viruses. There were
no reports of serological or virological evidence of H7N7 (equine-1)
subtype viruses circulating in the equine population. Nevertheless,
diagnostic laboratories should continue serological and virological
monitoring and, when using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for rapid
diagnosis, should ensure that primers specific for H7N7 virus as well
as H3N8 virus are used.

2. Characteristics of recent isolates

All viruses characterized antigenically and/or genetically from
Europe and North America during 2004 belonged to the "American"
lineage. In hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests using
post-infection ferret antisera, all viruses isolated in Europe were
most closely related to the A/eq/Newmarket/5/2003 reference strain,
whereas viruses isolated in South Africa and the USA were more
closely related to A/eq/South Africa/4/2003. Antigenic differences
between the 2 geographically separate groups of viruses were,
however, not consistently observed. The HA1 sequences of American
lineage viruses isolated since 2003 in America, Europe and South
Africa all fall within a single phylogenetic sub-group, previously
referred to as the "Florida" lineage (Lai et al., 2001; 2004). The
viruses isolated in America since 2003 (represented by A/eq/South
Africa/4/2003 and A/eq/Ohio/2003) are characterized by 2 further
amino acid changes in antigenic sites compared with the viruses
isolated in Europe; these additional changes appear to contribute to
greater antigenic drift from the A/eq/Newmarket/1/93-like viruses
currently included in vaccines.

3. Recommendations for the composition of equine influenza vaccines

During the period January 2003 to April 2004, H3N8 viruses of the
"American" lineage caused widespread outbreaks in Europe, with
well-vaccinated horses frequently affected. These viruses, together
with those responsible for recent outbreaks in South Africa and
circulating in North America, were antigenically closely related to
the currently recommended vaccine strains -- A/eq/South
Africa/4/2003-like. No viruses belonging to the "European" lineage
were characterized during 2004. The last isolation of a virus
belonging to the "European" lineage was made in 2003. Nonetheless,
the recommendation remains that a European lineage virus be included
in vaccines, and monitoring for the circulation of European lineage
viruses will continue.

It is recommended that vaccines contain the following:

a. an A/eq/South Africa/4/2003 (H3N8)-like virus (American lineage).
A/eq/Ohio/2003 is as equally acceptable as A/eq/South Africa/4/2003.

b. an A/eq/Newmarket/2/93 (H3N8)-like virus (European lineage).
A/eq/Suffolk/89 and A/eq/Borlange/91, currently used vaccine strains,
continue to be acceptable.

4. Reference reagents:

Reference reagents specific for the recommended European lineage
vaccine strains are available for standardization of vaccine content
by single radial diffusion (SRD) assay and can be obtained from the
[UK] National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC),
<http://www.nibsc.ac.uk/catalog/standards/preps/sub_flu.html>.
Reagents for the new recommendation will be prepared at the earliest
opportunity.

3 equine influenza horse antisera (anti-A/eq/Newmarket/77 [H7N7],
anti-A/eq/Newmarket/1/93 [H3N8] and anti-A/eq/Newmarket/2/93 [H3N8])
are available as European Pharmacopoeia Biological Reference
Preparations (EP BRPs) for serological testing of equine influenza
vaccines by the single radial hemolysis assay. These antisera are
also available from the OIE Reference Laboratory in Newmarket (UK)
for use as primary standards in diagnostic serological testing.
Pooled equine serum obtained post infection with A/eq/South
Africa/4/2003 (H3N8) virus is currently the subject of an
international collaborative study to establish this serum as an EP
BRP/OIE primary standard to supersede the anti-A/eq/Newmarket/1/93
(H3N8) serum.
