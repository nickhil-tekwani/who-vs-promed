The department [state equivalent] governor's office, through its Departmental Health Services (El Servicio Departamental de Salud; SEDES), reported that cases of canine rabies are occurring in district 9, Tierras Nuevas area (Comarapa neighborhood) and Las Americas (El Trigal neighborhood).

Joaquin Monasterio, director of SEDES, requested that the residents of the affected zone go immediately to the area health center if bitten by street [unowned] dogs or if canine rabies is suspected in the immediate family. Monasterio stated his concern that on 13 Feb [2012] the LIDIVET laboratory reported a positive rabies case in a street dog captured in the El Trigal neighborhood, whose owners have not been located.

"This task was done together with the municipal pound, to comb the area and capture street animals. Also, a barrier was established around another positive case in the Comarapa neighborhood, vaccinating 7 people who were in contact with the dog and capturing street animals in the area," [said Monasterio].

Johnny Ruiz Justiniano, the [authority] responsible for the Zoonoses Program, a unit of SEDES, explained that they continue to look for the owners of the stray dog or people who have been bitten by a local breed of dog, medium size, one or 2 years of age, brown and white, that is moving around the area of the Honorato Mejia school.

"We have spoken with the Neighborhood Council and teachers at the school, so that they help with the search, asking if anyone has lost their dog and up to now, nobody knows where the animal is from. This has us worried because there are people who are bitten by dogs and do not go to the health center for medical evaluation" [said Ruiz Justiniano.]

[Rabies in dogs, occasionally with transmission to humans, has continued to occur sporadically in Bolivia over the past 7 months. Unless thorough culling of street dogs is done over a very large area, an intensive vaccination campaign in the area will be more helpful in reducing the risk of further transmission to domestic animals and humans. Public education is critical in order to convince dog and cat owners to maintain their animals vaccinated against rabies.
