In response to the RFI in "Anthrax - Kenya (06): (NT) bovine, susp. RFI", 20151117.3796350"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is an ongoing outbreak of lumpy skin disease [LSD] in Chuka and the wider Meru region in Kenya. Several deaths of cattle have been confirmed. Exact numbers on morbidity and mortality are not available. The outbreak has been ongoing for about one month. The local veterinary office is undertaking ring vaccination.

[The information above on LSD [lumpy skin disease] in Kenya has been received in response to ProMED-mail's RFI in a posting which included the following data: "Over 20 cows have been reported dead after a mysterious disease hit a village in Chuka Igambang'ombe Constituency [Tharaka Nithi county]".... "Veterinary officers who toured the region said the signs and symptoms of the animals could be those of ramp skin and anthrax."

ProMED-mail could not identify a disease named "ramp skin" and published a RFI. The current response may indicate that "ramp" may have been an erroneous citation of "lumpy". It is thus plausible that, on top of anthrax, LSD could have been involved in the "mysterious disease" in Tharaka Nithi county.

Regarding anthrax, subscribers are referred to Mod.MHJ's commentary in posting 20151117.3796350.

On 30 Sep 2015, veterinary experts in Kenya warned about the risk of animal and zoonotic diseases upsurge during the set to start El Nino rains period. Rift valley fever (RVF) and lumpy skin disease (LSD) were specifically named as potential hazards; see at http://www.hivisasa.com/kiambu/news/82534.

Later, herders were encouraged to vaccinate their cattle against anthrax, black leg, and lumpy skin disease, explaining that while LSD is mostly spread by insects, the causative agents for black leg, and anthrax can be ingested by the animals while feeding in the grazing fields. The herders were notified that vaccines were readily available at affordable prices; see at http://www.hivisasa.com/kiambu/agriculture/83176.

LSD is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease has spread, during recent years, to the Middle East and southeast Europe (including Azerabaijan, Georgia, Chechnya, Greece).
