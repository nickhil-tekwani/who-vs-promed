72nd Annual General Session of the International Committee of the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), 23 - 28 May 2004
----------------------------------------------------
The 72nd Annual General Session of the International Committee of the
Office International des Epizooties (OIE), which is the World Organisation
for Animal Health, was held in Paris from 23 to 28 May 2004, within the
context of the Organisation's 80th anniversary.
The General Session notably brings together representatives appointed by
the Governments of the 167 OIE Member Countries.
Approximately 500 participants representing the Member Countries,
intergovernmental organisations (FAO, WHO, World Bank, WTO etc.) and many
non-governmental organisations took part in the event.
The main points dealt with during the Session were as follows:
- Within the framework of its standard-setting work, the Committee adopted
international standards aimed at providing better safeguards for the
sanitary safety of world trade in terrestrial and aquatic animals and
animal products. New criteria related to the consideration of new animal
diseases and zoonoses by the OIE have also been proposed and discussed or
adopted, as well as new standards among others about foot and mouth
disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and diseases of bees;
- Improvements in the effectiveness and quality of the Veterinary Services
responsible for disease surveillance and control, and consideration for the
role played by veterinary para-professionals;
- The sanitary situation of all Member Countries has been examined in detail;
- Special attention was given to simplifying the chapter on BSE in the
Terrestrial Animal Health Code, notably regarding subsequent changes to the
different categories of BSE status of Member Countries and the safety of
animal products without risks for consumers;
- Discussions have also taken place on the preparation of the OIE IVth
Strategic Plan (for the period of 2005-2010) which will be adopted in 2005;
- Discussions also dealt with the updating of international standards on
avian influenza so as to improve control of the disease and provide greater
protection for importing countries while eliminating unjustified barriers
to trade;
- Member Countries also adopted the guiding principles of the animal
welfare policies that the OIE will conduct as part of its new mandate as
the international reference organisation for animal welfare issues;
- The Committee decided to establish a world animal health and welfare
fund. This should be fed by public and private support funds aimed at
sustaining the OIE projects;
- On the fringe of the Session, the OIE and the FAO signed a new agreement
aimed at coordinating the efforts of the 2 organisations to control animal
diseases and zoonoses throughout the world within the framework of their
respective mandates. The Agreement was signed on behalf of the OIE by its
Director General, Dr Bernard Vallat;
- The General Session welcomed the accession of 3 new Member Countries,
namely Brunei, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. As of May 2004, the OIE has 167
Member Countries;
- 2 technical items were debated during the Session and gave rise to
Resolutions passed by the International Committee:
- Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases: challenges and opportunities
- Animal identification and traceability
The high level of scientific expertise of the speakers and the quality of
the debates that followed the presentation of each technical item will have
served to promote the global application of concepts that are essential for
improved control of animal diseases and zoonoses.
