2 cats in Jefferson County were diagnosed recently with bubonic plague, a
discovery that in addition to previous finds has epidemiologists wondering
whether a plague cycle is beginning anew in Colorado.
The cats, which live about 12 miles apart, are among 8 felines statewide
that have caught the disease so far in 2004. Last week, a 54-year-old Weld
County woman was hospitalized with the plague.
"Plague activity, after a 4- to 5-year absence, is starting to make a
comeback," said John Pape, a state health department epidemiologist.
Cats can transmit plague to people by scratching, biting or coughing. While
the plague has killed millions of people throughout history, it can be
treated with antibiotics if it is caught in time.
In Jefferson County, the cats diagnosed with the plague are free-roaming
outdoor cats, said David Volkel, a Jefferson County environmental health
specialist.
The county health department issued an advisory on the finds last week.
The cats suddenly became lethargic, were taken to the veterinarian and were
diagnosed within the past several weeks, Volkel said. Although health
officials aren't sure how the cats caught the disease, typically cats will
contract it after being bitten by infected fleas, Volkel said.
He cautioned people to watch their outdoor cats for signs of illness, which
include lethargy, a swollen neck, coughing and trouble breathing.

[Plague is caused by _Yersenia pestis_ and transmitted most often by flea
bites.
When sylvatic outbreaks occur in rodent populations, domestic cats can be
infected by fleas on the rodents or by direct contact with infected rodent
tissues -- as they chomp on squirrels or other rodents. The incubation
period in cats may be short, a day or 2, and marked by a fever of up to
41.5 C and lymphadenopathy. Typical buboes often occur in the head and
neck, and can be mistaken for cat fight abscesses. Dogs are considered to
be less susceptible.
The report above mentions bubonic plague, which is of zoonotic concern, as
individuals may contract disease from either infected fleas or contact with
purulent discharges or blood from the cat. An even greater threat occurs
when the disease in cats progresses to pneumonic plague. This has been
documented in cats, including transmission to veterinarians and owners.
Antibiotic treatment is effective in cats, but the threat of plague is only
one of many reasons that people should keep their pets free of fleas. - Mod.TG]
