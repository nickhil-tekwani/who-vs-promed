A new case of avian influenza has been found in Daegu, triggering fears that the disease may be spreading across the country, officials said Wednesday [18 Jun 2014].

According to Daegu Metropolitan Government (DMG), the H5N8 virus was found in 3 chickens that recently died at a poultry farm in Okcheon [North Chungcheong Province].

"The presence of the highly pathogenic virus has been confirmed," said an official from DMG. Since late last month [May 2014], 100 chickens and 94 geese have died on the farm.

This case follows 2 separate cases reported in Hoengseong, Gangwon Province, last Saturday [14 Jun 2014] and in Muan, South Jeolla Province, earlier this week [week of 16 Jun 2014].

Bird flu cases were rampant earlier this year [2014], but had not been reported until last week [week of 9 Jun 2014].

The virus is deadly, resulting in massive deaths of many bird species.

The H5N1 subtype of the virus can be transmitted to humans; but H5N8 has not been found to infect people.

Authorities in Daegu are stepping up efforts to contain the disease, setting up checkpoints to disinfect vehicles and prohibiting poultry from being transported within 3 km [about 1.9 miles] from where the outbreak was reported.

All the surviving birds (13 geese and 388 chickens) at the farm were culled.

The farm is known to have bought 107 baby geese from a farm in Hongseong [South Chungcheong Province] on 14 Jun 2014.

This is the 1st outbreak since 2008 in the city.

Bird flu outbreaks have been common this year [2014], affecting all parts of the country.

In February [2014] alone, more than 13.8 million birds were culled. Studies are underway to keep track of infection routes, as many believe migratory birds are to blame.

Many also questioned the possibility of human infection, as authorities found the virus was transmitted to dogs in the previous outbreak.

See OIE's interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14668).

The disease control policy applied by South Korea during the event is "stamping out without vaccination."

Daegu is a metropolitan city surrounded by the province Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang Province).

Official confirmation of this outbreak and of the 2 earlier new outbreaks mentioned in the above media report, including their details, is anticipated. - Mod.AS
