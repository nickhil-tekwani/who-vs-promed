For the 1st time human infection with the tropical Usutu virus has been detected in Germany. It was confirmed in donor blood, when a total of 4200 blood samples were analyzed for antibodies.

The information was released by Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist with the Bernhard Nocht Institute (BNI) for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg on Monday [20 Aug 2012].

The affected man from Gross-Gerau (Hesse) claims to have experienced no symptoms of illness.

Originating from Africa last summer [2011], Usutu virus has been the cause of a mass die off of blackbirds in southwest Germany. Again this summer dozens of birds have died. Usutu virus was found in mosquitoes (_Culex pipiens_) in Germany and can be transmitted to humans.

According to the BNI the donor blood was collected in January this year [2012] from the outbreak region between Frankfurt and Freiburg. According to experts, the infection of the man at that time was rather recent. Schmidt Chanasit warned against overestimating the finding: "Yes, there has been an infection, but it is not dramatic; after all it is only one of 4200 blood tests- just do not panic," he said.

The infection can be associated with fever, headache and rash, according to the virologists. In elderly or debilitated people, the virus could, as a worst case, cause inflammation of the brain. The disease can only be transmitted through a mosquito bite, the mere touch of a diseased bird does not cause infection. Schmidt Chanasit urged the doctors to send in samples if patients show suspicious symptoms.

Outside Africa, the virus had appeared the 1st time in 2001 in the Vienna area; in 2009 2 immunocompromised patients in Italy became infected.

During this summer [2012] thousands of birds have died already in Southwest Germany, "Fight against mosquitoes plague (Kabs) in the Palatine Forest Lake," the Scientific Director of the Municipal Action Group Norbert Becker, said. "Dead birds are reported by the hour."

The region around Neustadt an der Weinstrasse and Landau and the Rhine-Neckar region to the Kraichgau in Baden-Wurttemberg is affected by the mass mortality.

"It's even worse than last year," said Becker. There are areas where no more blackbird are be seen. The affected area this year is much larger than in 2011. The situation is so dramatic because the mosquitoes, with current temperatures, find ideal breeding conditions. Becker and his team and have already collected nearly 300 dead blackbirds, Becker said.

The Usutu virus was found already in the summer 2011 in the border region of Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse and Baden-Wurttemberg where it infected and killed hundreds of thousands of blackbirds. The virologist Chanasit Schmidt is convinced: "The virus will keep us busy for the next few years."

[With the repeat of blackbird mortality seen last year (2011), and now, human infection, there is additional evidence that Usutu virus has become endemic in Germany. As Mod.AS noted in the ProMED-mail post of 16 Sep 2011, "USUV 1st detection outside Africa took place in Vienna, Austria, in 2001, causing deaths in blackbirds (_Turdus merula_) and great gray owls (_Strix nebulosa_). In 2002, USUV was still circulating in Austria, demonstrating that USUV has managed to overwinter in a local bird-mosquito cycle in central Europe. More recently, USUV-specific RNA or antigen was also detected in birds or mosquitoes in Hungary, Switzerland, Italy and Spain. In the summer of 2009, USUV-related illness were reported in 2 immunocompromised patients in Italy. Antibodies were detected in UK in wild birds in 2002."

Usutu is a member of the mosquito transmitted flaviviruses belonging to the Japanese encephalitis virus group.

ProMED thanks Sabine Zentis for sending in the above report and its translation. Roland Hubner of the Belgian Superior Health Council also sent in this report, along with the following reference that assesses human risk of Usutu virus infection.
