According to the Ministry of Health, from November 2008 to April
2009, a total of 43 cases of yellow fever [YF] were confirmed in Rio
Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo [states]. Of that total, 16 died.

In Rio Grande do Sul there were 18 confirmed cases and 7 people died.
In Sao Paulo, between February and April 2009, the Ministry of Health
recorded 25 confirmed cases and 9 deaths.

The situation in Porto Alegre worsened after the deaths of monkeys.
The [state] capital was included in the zone of risk of infection
after the State Secretariat of Health confirmed the death of 2
monkeys from the disease [YF] in a forest in Guaiba, a neighboring
city of Porto Alegre.

The confirmation of deaths in Sao Paulo [state] has led Parana to
intensify vaccination against yellow fever at the border with [Sao
Paulo] state.
