MPATT responds to Minister Imbert: There is an acute viral problem
-----------------------------
The Medical Professionals Association of Trinidad and Tobago (MPATT) on
Thursday provided figures from a laboratory in south Trinidad to support
the view that there is a problem with an unidentified virus as well as
dengue. MPATT was responding to Health Minister Colm Imbert's assertion of
a political motive behind reports of a high number of suspected dengue
cases at San Fernando General Hospital. In a statement last Thursday, MPATT
referred to a major laboratory in San Fernando that received 192 blood
samples for testing for patients suspected of having dengue fever. While 81
were positive for acute virus infection and 42 of them exhibited profiles
supporting previous dengue infection, there were 111 cases whose cause of
illness was not determined. "The vast majority were jaundiced and bedridden."
MPATT said the data was from one of at least 10 labs in South and did not
include all the data from all labs from January to the present. TT
experienced a dengue epidemic in 1981 involving strains I, II, IV. Type III
appeared in the US in 1983, and in 1986, the first case of dengue
haemorrhagic fever was reported in St Lucia. Trinidad and Tobago's first
case was documented in 1992. "We have the Aedes aegypti mosquito
transmitting both dengue and yellow fever, and aedes albopictus
transmitting dengue," MPATT said. According to "official" statistics for
2000, this country has 91 percent coverage for yellow fever [?vaccination
coverage]. However, MPATT said the last WHO coverage survey in 1986 found
only 48 percent of the population was adequately protected against yellow
fever.

[The differential diagnosis for acute febrile jaundice illness is rather
large, amongst which are concerns for the viral hepatidities,
leptospirosis, and yellow fever. In a 1998 ProMED-mail posting (Howler
monkeys, vaccination: RFI 19970122.0123), Dr. Hospedales, the
Medical Epidemiologist at CAREC (Caribbean Epidemiology Center) in
Trinidad provided information on Yellow Fever in Trinidad: "...Trinidad has
periodic epizootics of YF, [the last of] which "spilled" into the human
population in 1979/80 with 17 cases acquired in sylvatic locations. Two
epizootics have occurred since, without human cases. One was island-wide
in 1989/91 and a smaller one was in 1995/6. One of the reasons [that no
human cases have occurred recently] may be the high coverage of the human
population with yellow fever vaccine, estimated to be some 80 percent of
the population (higher in areas around the forests)."
More information on the studies to date on this undiagnosed illnesses would
be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
