_Beet soil-borne virus_ (BSBV) and _Beet virus Q_ (BVQ) are 2 members of
the genus _Pomovirus_ that are transmitted by _Polymyxa betae_. BVQ and
BSBV are commonly found in fields where _Beet necrotic yellow vein virus_
(BNYVV), the causal agent of rhizomania disease, is present (Henry et al.
1986; Koenig et al. 1998; Meunier et al. 2003). During the growing season
of 2006, 26 roots of sugar beet exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms of
rhizomania were collected from 3 fields located in Inner Mongolia and
Xinjiang Provinces for a survey to determine whether BSBV and BVQ were
present in China. Viral RNA was extracted from partially purified viruses
of beet roots as described by Han et al. (2000) and tested by RT-PCR
[reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction] using 3 specific
primer sets and designed to amplify coat protein genes for BSBV, BVQ and
BNYVV respectively.
Of the 26 beet samples, 15 gave positive reactions for BSBV, 21 for BNYVV
and 14 for both BSBV and BNYVV. BVQ was not detected in any sugar beet
sample tested. Subsequently, three RT-PCR products amplified in sugar beet
samples collected from different locations with the primers specific to
BSBV were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that these
submitted sequences shared nucleotide identity of 98-99 percent with the
German BSBV isolate. The partially purified viruses from infected sugar
beet root were used for mechanical inoculation of _Chenopodium quinoa_ and
_C. amaranticolor_, and local lesions were observed on inoculated leaves.
Furthermore, BSBV was also confirmed by RT-PCR (as described above) in the
local lesions that appeared approximately 5 days after mechanical
inoculation.
Combined, the RT-PCR detection, nucleotide sequences and symptoms on
inoculated host plants confirm the presence of BSBV in Inner Mongolia and
Xinjiang. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the occurrence of
BSBV in China.

In China, yellowing disease of sugar beet has been reported previously,
with _Beet yellows virus_ (BYV; genus _Closterovirus_) regarded as the
viral agent (Liu et al., 1981). During a survey in September 2006, the
incidence of diseased sugar beet showing yellowing symptoms ranged from 5
percent to 30 percent. The symptoms observed were mainly yellowing,
developing mostly in the interveinal tissue of old- and middle-aged leaves
(Figure 1). These symptoms were similar to those reported previously for
yellowing disease caused by poleroviruses (_Beet western yellows virus_,
BWYV; _Beet mild yellowing virus_, BMYV; _Beet chlorosis virus_, BChV) in
other countries (Hauser et al., 2000; Stevens et al., 2005).
To identify the viruses involved, 64 samples of sugar beet were collected
from fields in different provinces (Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Beijing, Hebei,
Jilin and Heilongjiang). Total RNA was extracted from leaf tissue and
tested by RT-PCR using a universal polerovirus primer pair and
BYV-specific primers. Amplification products of the expected size for a
polerovirus (ca. 1100 bp) were obtained in 41 samples, whereas BYV was not
detected in any sample tested. Five of these RT-PCR products were selected
(2 from Inner Mongolia, and 2 from Gansu, 1 from Beijing), cloned and
sequenced. Comparisons showed that these sequences shared between 88-91
percent nucleotide identity with BWYV (USA isolate), while sharing only
73-75% identity with a French BMYV isolate, and approximately 70 percent
identity with BChV. In addition, spherical particles measuring 26 nm in
diameter were also observed in some samples by electron microscopy.
In addition to the sugar beet samples, 4 samples of diseased lettuce were
also collected from Beijing. These showed yellowing symptoms and were
tested positive by RT-PCR with the polerovirus primers. One sample was
sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that it shared between 88-98 percent
sequence identity with BWYV, including the Chinese isolates from sugar
beet described above.
Based on these data, BWYV was confirmed as a causal agent of yellowing
disease of sugar beet and lettuce in Northern China. To our knowledge,
this is the 1st definitive identification of BWYV in China.

[3] 1st Report of _Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_ ,
9 cucurbitaceous species - China

In the late summer of 2006, viral symptoms were observed on cucurbitaceous
field crops growing in many regions of China. These included yellowing
(Figure 1), sometimes combined with severe mosaic and in some cases, fruit
malformation. The observed incidence of disease symptoms ranged from 30
percent to nearly 100 percent. Given the symptoms and the presence of
large numbers of aphids, infection by _Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_
(CABYV; genus _Polerovirus_, family _Luteoviridae_) was suspected. CABYV
is the first luteovirus reported that naturally infects cultivated
cucurbits (Lecoq et al., 1992; D`Arcy et al., 2005).
A survey was carried out for CABYV using samples collected from 9
different cucurbit species: cushaw (_Cucurbita moschata_), squash
(_Cucurbita pepo_), calabash gourd (_Lagenaria siceraria_), cucumber
(_Cucumis sativus_), suakwa vegetable sponge (_Luffa cylindrical_),
watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_), muskmelon (_Cucumis melo_), wax gourd
(_Benincasa hispida_) and bitter gourd (_Momordica charantia_); collected
from selected fields in 10 different provinces: Beijing, Shanghai,
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Henan, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia and
Yunnan. Total RNA was extracted from fresh leaf samples and RT-PCR
[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction] was performed as
described by Han et al. (2000), using a primer set designed from a
published CABYV sequence. In total 54 out of 111 samples tested positive,
including samples taken from all 10 provinces and all 9 curcucrbit
species. Subsequently, representative RT-PCR products from 4 different
cucurbit species were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that
these sequences shared between 93.5ï¿½95.0 percent identity with a French
isolate (CABYV-N). In addition, spherical particles approximately 26 nm in
diameter were also observed in some samples by electron microscopy.
These results demonstrate that CABYV occurs widely in China, being found
on all the 9 different cucurbitaceous species surveyed. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the 1st report of the occurrence of CABYV in China.

[_Beet soil-borne pomovirus_, family _Togaviridae_: the fairly small genus
_Pomovirus_ is transmitted by soil-inhabiting fungi and by mechanical
means. Pomoviruses occur in temperate climates and their natural host
range is very narrow. Crops affected by members of this genus include
beet, potato and bean. BSBV occurs in Europe and was first reported in the
US in 1994. Susceptible host genera are _Beta_, _Chenopodium_ and
_Spinacia_ only. It reduces yield in sugar beet by about one fifth.
Disease management may be attempted by controlling the fungal vector.
_Beet western yellows polerovirus_ and _Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows
polerovirus_, family _Luteoviridae_: members of this family are
transmitted by specific aphid vectors and are distributed in all climatic
zones. They are largely confined to phloem tissue resulting in yellowing
symptoms. _Polerovirus_ is also a fairly small genus including species
infecting crops such as beet, potato, tomato, cereals and cucurbits.
Poleroviruses may invade non-phloem tissue when co-infecting with, for
example, potyviruses. BWYV is probably distributed worldwide and affects
over 150 species including beet, lettuce, sunflower, cabbage, bean, pea,
chickpeas, tomato, capsicum and cucumber and occurs worldwide. For CABYV,
wild cucurbit species may serve as reservoirs for crop inoculation. This
virus has been reported from Europe, Africa and the U.S. Control of these
viruses may be attempted by controlling vector insects and reducing the
amount of available reservoir plants.
