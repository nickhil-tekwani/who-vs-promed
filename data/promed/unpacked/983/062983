An unspecified number of Yangon (previously called Rangoon) residents
have been diagnosed with plague, a contagious disease primarily
transmitted by rodents (mostly rats), according to the Burmese
Ministry of Health (MOH) in Naypyidaw.

An epidemiologist at the MOH who asked to remain anonymous told The
Irrawaddy that some people infected with plague were found in Yangon
in June 2010 but all survived after treatment by the MOH. "It was the
1st time in decades that we found plague in Yangon," said the MOH
official.

The MOH has yet to make a public statement regarding the diagnosis of plague.

The MOH and other ministries have developed and implemented a project
to eradicate rats for the prevention of plague, according to a MOH
official in Naypyidaw. "Rat eradication is secretly going on in
different departments," he said. An official from the Yangon
Municipal Committee said it had formed special task forces for rat
eradication and has killed tens of thousands of rats on a daily basis.

The MOH reportedly has determined through laboratory experiments that
rats migrating to the south from Naypyidaw are carrying bacteria for
contagious disease such as the plague, and it was developing a
treatment program should the disease spread.

A plague awareness program has started among government staff in
Naypyidaw, according to a source.

State-run newspapers recently warned that the plague can be
transmitted to humans by fleas, but it failed to mention that the
disease had already infected people in Yangon. An official with the
Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department (LBVD) said people who
find rat corpses should take them to the nearest LBVD department for
examination.

[The manifestations of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in these reported
cases is not stated. Most cases are due to bubonic plague following
the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender
lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague
should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever,
chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of
possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person
usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being
bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the
bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they
spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal
condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes
the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The
infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and
breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients
are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress
rapidly to death.

There were 2 issues of rodent control mentioned in the posting that
could cause many more cases of human plague. If rodent eradication
programs are introduced without a parallel program to spray for
fleas, the fleas will flee the dead rodent and increase the risk of
feeding on humans. Picking up a dead rat for examination can even
more so put the "picker-upper" at risk. - Mod.LL]
