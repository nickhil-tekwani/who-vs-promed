In a recent study published in the Journal of Hepatology in Feb 2022, researchers describe the first cases of acute hepatitis related to _Orthohepevirus_ C infection (HEV-C), also known as rat Hepatitis E virus, detected in Europe:

Abstract
--------
Background & Aim: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the only member of the _Hepeviridae_ family with zoonotic potential. Nevertheless, this consideration was reassessed because recent evidence reported several cases of acute and chronic hepatitis linked to the _Orthohepevirus_ C genus. Because the circulation of _Orthohepevirus_ C in rodents has been described worldwide, the risk of zoonotic transmission is plausible globally.

Methods: _Orthohepevirus_ C RNA was retrospectively evaluated in 2 cohorts of patients in follow-up in Spain. The first cohort included patients with acute hepatitis without an etiological diagnosis after screening for hepatotropic virus infection. The 2nd cohort included patients diagnosed with acute HEV infection, defined as positivity for anti-HEV IgM antibodies and/or detectable HEV RNA in serum.

Results: Cohort 1 was composed 169 patients (64.4% male, median age 43 years) and cohort 2 by 98 individuals (68.3% male, median age 45 years). Of the individuals included in Cohort 1, 2 (1.18%; 95% CI: 0.2-3.8) showed detectable _Orthohepevirus_ C RNA in serum. In Cohort 2, of the 98 included patients, 58 showed detectable HEV RNA, while 40 only showed positivity for IgM antibodies. Among those bearing only IgM antibodies, _Orthohepevirus_ C RNA was detected in one (2.5%; 95% CI: 0.06-13.1) individual. All strains were consistent with genotype C1. The infection in 2 patients resulted in mild acute hepatitis with self-resolution. In the other one coursed as severe acute hepatitis, deceasing because of liver and renal failure.

Conclusions: We described 3 cases of _Orthohepevirus_ C in patients with acute hepatitis, resulting in the first description of this infection in Europe. The prevalence obtained in our study suggests that _Orthohepevirus_ C can be an emerging disease in Europe.

Abstract
--------
"Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants belonging to _Orthohepevirus_ species A (HEV-A) are the primary cause of human hepatitis E. However, we previously reported that _Orthohepevirus_ species C genotype 1 (HEV-C1), a divergent HEV variant commonly found in rats, also causes hepatitis in humans. Here, we present a clinical-epidemiological investigation of human HEV-C1 infections detected in Hong Kong, with an emphasis on outcomes in immunocompromised individuals.

"Methods: A surveillance system for detecting human HEV-C1 infections was established in Hong Kong. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HEV-C1 cases identified via this system between 1 Aug 2019 and 31 Dec2020 were retrieved. Phylogenetic analysis of HEV-C1 strain sequences was performed. Infection outcomes of immunocompromised individuals with HEV-A and HEV-C1 infections were analyzed.

"Results: HEV-C1 accounted for 8 of 53 (15.1%) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed HEV infections in Hong Kong during the study period, raising the total number of HEV-C1 infections detected in the city to 16. Two distinct HEV-C1 strain groups caused human infections. Patients were elderly and/or immunocompromised; half tested negative for HEV immunoglobulin M. Cumulatively, HEV-C1 accounted for 9 of 21 (42.9%) cases of hepatitis E recorded in immunocompromised patients in Hong Kong. Immunocompromised HEV-C1 patients progressed to persistent hepatitis at similar rates (7/9 [77.8%]) as HEV-A patients (10/12 [75%]). HEV-C1 patients responded to oral ribavirin, although the response to the first course was sometimes poor or delayed.

"Conclusions: Dedicated RT-PCR-based surveillance detected human HEV-C1 cases that evade conventional hepatitis E diagnostic testing. Immunosuppressed HEV-C1-infected patients frequently progress to persistent HEV-C1 infection, for which ribavirin is a suitable treatment option."

Additionally, a case was reported from Canada in 2019: Andonov A, Robbins M, Borlang J, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus linked to severe acute hepatitis in an immunocompetent patient. J Infect Dis. 2019; 220(6): 951-955; https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiz025/5288497.

It is important to know that diagnostic testing for this virus, now reported in Europe and North America after first characterized in Hong Kong, can be problematic. - Mod.LL
