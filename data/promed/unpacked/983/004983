Officials have investigated at least 12 cases of hepatitis linked to a heart clinic in West Virginia. The infections have been linked to injectable medications given during cardiac stress tests at the Raleigh Heart Clinic, local news media outlets reported; 8 patients receiving cardiac stress tests have tested positive for hepatitis C, and 4 others have tested positive for hepatitis B, said Allison Adler, director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Resources. Adler said there has been no evidence of HIV transmission. The investigation started in November 2014, after a patient with no risk factors for hepatitis C was diagnosed with the virus.

State Health Commissioner Dr. Rahul Gupta said Thu 25 Mar 2016 that during inspections, Department of Health and Human Resources investigators witnessed several areas of improvement for the clinic.

"There are single-use vials," he said of the clinic. "You have a drug in one vial for a patient's one-time use. But we find that it is often used for multiple uses. So that's one way of transmitting it because you can change the needle but there's always a risk with the vial."

Gupta said the extent of how many individuals were exposed to the pathogens is unknown. Officials are now urging about 2300 patients of the Raleigh Heart Clinic to be tested for hepatitis B and C as well as HIV.

The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports that the Raleigh Heart Clinic has not commented on the matter.

[With contamination of one-dose vials with either hepatitis B or hepatitis C (or perhaps HIV as well), it seems clear that gross deviation from infection prevention procedures may have occurred. - Mod.LL

Why the delay between detection of the problem in 2014 and action in 2016? - Mod.JW
