Transfer of the demon disorder of syphilis from mother to child has ceased in several Caribbean countries in the last decade. This great progress, achieved after centuries of disease, has been declared in Puerto Rico, Anguilla, Antigua and Bermuda, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, the Cayman Islands, and, as of 2021, the Dominican Republic. [The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) report below cites Dominica, not the Dominican Republic, as having achieved elimination of congenital syphilis as a public health problem in 2021. - Mod.ML]. Not all countries are so fortunate. Cases of infant syphilis have been increasing since 2016 in the USA and Canada.

In the face of superstitions and stigmas, eliminating syphilis in infants is becoming a reality. The year 2030 is the World Health Organization's declared time-point to end the spread of sexually transmitted infections to infants. Quests are taking place around the globe to screen all pregnant women, a universal process. Blood samples are used to check for signs of syphilis infections in the 1st 1/3 of pregnancy.

All positive mothers are treated, all infants checked. This seems a simple process. However, such campaigns need homes, communities, hospitals, and regions to collaborate with determination and without shame or blame. Such arrangements have been effectively reinforced in the Caribbean by community groups, midwives, and politicians.

Syphilis is a serious disease and not a malign horror from a museum. Fetuses and infants can be protected. We owe this to them.

[Congenital syphilis (CS), caused by vertical transmission of the bacterium _Treponema pallidum_ from mother to fetus, can cause serious health problems for the newborn, including prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal death, as well as causing miscarriage and stillbirth. The overall goal for WHO is the global elimination of congenital syphilis "as a public health problem", not a total cessation of mother-to-fetus transmission of syphilis, as implied by the news report above. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has defined elimination of congenital syphilis as a public health problem as corresponding to an incidence of 50 cases or fewer per 100 000 births (including stillbirths) (https://www.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2012/Elimination-print.pdf).

WHO recognized the elimination of maternal-to-child transmission of syphilis as a public health problem in 8 Caribbean countries and territories: Cuba in 2015; Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2017; and Dominica in 2021 (https://www.paho.org/en/news/14-5-2021-dominica-celebrates-elimination-mother-child-transmission-hiv-and-syphilis).

In the United States, reported cases of congenital syphilis have increased each year since 2013; in 2013 the rate of congenital syphilis was 9.2 cases per 100 000 live births. In 2015, there were 499 cases of congenital syphilis (Table 41 https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/STDSurveillance2018-full-report.pdf), which rose to 2000 cases in 2020 (57.3 cases per 100 000 live births) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/overview.htm). These increases in congenital syphilis mirror increases in syphilis among reproductive-aged women. In 2020, there were, in addition, 149 congenital syphilis-related stillbirths and infant deaths.

In Puerto Rico, rates of congenital syphilis were 16.0 per 100 000 live births in 2015, which rose to 28.3 in 2018 (Table 41, https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/STDSurveillance2018-full-report.pdf).
