Bomet residents have been warned against consuming dead animals' meat, following an outbreak of anthrax disease. The county veterinary services director Dr Wilson Serem said at least 100 people from across the county who ate meat from dead cattle have been treated and discharged from various health facilities.

Speaking to the press in Bomet town on Friday [29 Aug 2014], Serem said the cases were reported at Merigi in Bomet East, Mutarakwa (Bomet Central), Kongasis (Chepalungu) and Kipsonoi in Sotik, where 15 animals that have died tested positive for the disease.

He said his department has bought 40 000 doses of vaccine from the Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Institute to help contain the situation. The vaccination campaign will be rolled out this week, and more than 300 000 head of cattle are targeted. The officer said 10 000 head in the worst hit areas have been vaccinated. "This is severe, and we are not taking any chances. We have endeavoured to curb the menace," Serem said.

[Anthrax has been present for many years in Kenya with minimal attention paid to it. Possibly this will have caught the authorities' attention and may initiate regular annual vaccination of the livestock.
