The most recent surveillance statistics from Algoma Public Health [APH] suggest that sexually transmitted infections have been increasing in the region over the past year. In 2021, public health officials saw gonorrhea rates climb to 105 infections per 100 000 people, which is 87.5 per cent higher than the provincial average and higher than Algoma's 5-year average.

According to Dr John Tuinema, associate medical officer of health for APH, 63 per cent of gonorrhea infections in the region were in the 15-34 age range. "I would say the overall trend is that typically later teens to mid-thirties would be the majority of sexually transmitted infections," Tuinema said.

_Chlamydia_ infection rates were about 278 infections per 100 000 people in 2021, which Tuinema says is in line with Algoma's 5-year average of 260 per 100 000, but still above the provincial average of 208 per 100 000.

Syphilis infections were also on the rise last year [2021], with a rate of about 12 infections per 100 000 people in 2021, which Tuinema calls an "alarming increase" from Algoma's 5-year average of about 3.7 per 100 000. "We're still significantly lower than the province when it comes to syphilis. They have about 17 per 100 000. But still, for us it's quite a jump," he said.

Tuinema says it's difficult to identify the contributing factors to the increase in sexually transmitted infections in Algoma, but says that a lot of the health unit's sexual health work had to be put on hold while resources were being diverted elsewhere during the COVID-19 pandemic. "As we are moving through COVID and starting to turn to our previous work, it's going to be really important to look at these questions more closely -- figure out what our baselines are currently, and really dive into what the contributing factors might be," he said.

Sexually transmitted infections need to be treated, Tuinema says, in order to ensure that they are not passed on to another individual. "If somebody is worried that they might have a sexually transmitted infection, either because they're showing symptoms or because they had a sexual encounter and they're worried they might have an infection that doesn't show symptoms, they can reach out to Algoma Public Health for our sexual health line for more information, or they can go see their primary care provider and set up testing in order to clarify whether or not they have an infection," he said.

[Algoma District (pop., 114 094 residents in 2016) is a district in the Northeastern Ontario subregion in the Canadian province of Ontario, close to the Canada-US border; Sault Ste. Marie (pop., about 73 000 residents in 2021) is the seat and largest city in the Algoma District (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algoma_District). A map showing the location of the Algoma District can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Algoma+District,+ON,+Canada.

The news report above notes recent increases in syphilis and gonorrhea in the Algoma District, but fails to characterize the patient population affected or factors contributing to this increase. In recent ProMED posts, illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, has been cited as a contributing factor to recent increases in syphilis cases in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. Recent reports from Canada, also note an increase in syphilis in women and an increase in congenital syphilis. More information on this outbreak in Algoma District would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
