China: More than 200 Students in Taonan (Jilin Province) Hospitalized
with Suspected Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
From 6:00 p.m. on Wed 29 Jun 2005 onwards, some students of the 10th
Middle School in the City of Taonan (Jilin Province in northeastern
China) came down with fever and sore throat. By 11 am on Fri 1 Jul
2005, a total of 223 students had the above symptoms. 207 students
were admitted to hospital for treatment.

The Provincial Health Bureau rushed epidemiologists and specialists
in infectious disease, [together with specialists in respiratory,
nervous and digestive disorders] to Taonan to conduct investigations.
Through detailed examination of patients and after lab tests, the
illness was diagnosed as influenza.

At present, ill students are in Taonan Municipal Hospital, Shizhong
Hospital, and Shibaojian Hospital. After receiving treatment for
symptoms, the temperature of 171 students has already returned to
normal and symptoms are basically resolved. They remain hospitalized
for observation. The cause of the students' illness has not been
conclusively determined. At present, all hospitalized students have
been isolated.

After the illnesses became known, the Provincial Secretary Wang
Yunkun and other leaders demanded that the cause of the illnesses be
rapidly determined, treatment implemented, and the safety of the
students ensured. All levels of the public health apparatus [must]
establish specialized medical teams and organize the entire city's
medical personnel to spare no effort [to confirm the diagnosis] and
[organise appropriate treatment].

Taonan City's 10th Middle School is an ordinary intermediate school.
Most of the [affected pupils] are 1st- and 2nd-year boarding
students. There are a total of 1053 1st- and 2nd-year students in the
school. Of these 556 are boarding students. The school started
school-wide vacation on Thu 30 Jun 2005 and has established a "School
Guard Team".

[The diagnosis of influenza must be regarded as no more than
provisional. The description of the illness is not specific enough to
suggest a precise diagnosis. The abruptness of onset, the
predominance of sore throats, and the rapid resolution of symptoms do
not suggest influenza. Many other viruses and non-viral pathogens
could be responsible. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
