The USA is experiencing person-to-person outbreaks of hepatitis A in unprecedented numbers during the vaccine era (1). As of May 2020, 33 states had reported hepatitis A outbreaks involving approximately 32 500 cases, 19 800 (61%) hospitalizations, and 320 deaths since 2016 (1). These infections are spreading primarily through close contact among persons who use drugs and persons experiencing homelessness, as well as among men who have sex with men (MSM) (2).

During these outbreaks, hepatitis A infections occurring among food handlers have raised public alarm and resulted in calls for vaccinating all food handlers, often prompting health departments to divert limited resources away from populations at risk. However, the risk for secondary transmission from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons is not well understood. To characterize this risk, a novel, structured survey was developed and conducted using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (version 9.5.13; Vanderbilt University); among 30 state health departments reporting person-to-person hepatitis A outbreaks during 1 Jul 2016-13 Sep 2019, 29 states responded (3,4).

26 states (89.7%) submitted complete information regarding secondary transmission events associated with food handlers (Table; See original URL for Table. - Mod.LL). Among 22 825 hepatitis A outbreak cases reported from these 26 states during 1 Jul 2016-13 Sep 2019, 871 (3.8%) were among food handlers; 587 (67.4%) hepatitis A-infected food handlers reported one or more risk factors (i.e., drug use, unstable housing or homelessness, MSM, or incarceration) during the 15-50 days before symptom onset. Associated with these 871 hepatitis A-infected food handlers were 8 (0.9%) secondary transmission events (Table), which resulted in 57 secondary cases.

Of 29 states, 18 (62.1%) submitted complete information for public health response activities related to hepatitis A-infected food handlers. Among 275 cases in food handlers from these 18 states, 271 (98.5%) investigations and 63 (22.9%) public notifications took place.

Ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks have been prolonged and costly to control (5). These study findings indicate that the risk for secondary infection from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons in these outbreaks is low (less than 1.0%). Therefore, public health efforts to preemptively vaccinate all food handlers would be ineffective at mitigating the current risk for person-to-person outbreaks. To optimize resources, health departments should assess the risk for secondary transmission of hepatitis A from infected food handlers on a case-by-case basis and prioritize vaccination efforts in situations where secondary transmission risk is deemed high (6).

Approximately 2/3 of the hepatitis A-infected food handlers in this survey reported risk factors commonly associated with the current person-to-person outbreaks. This underscores the importance of vaccination strategies targeting the populations at highest risk (i.e., persons who use drugs, persons experiencing unstable housing or homelessness, MSM, and persons who are or were recently incarcerated) as the cornerstone of an effective public health response.

[This data provides information to support not routinely immunizing food handlers against HAV. While focusing on high-risk groups for HAV is certainly more cost effective, those groups are difficult to access for HAV immunization. Essentially any day, one can Google hepatitis A and find several reports of HAV infection in a food handler. - Mod.LL
