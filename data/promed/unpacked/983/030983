A public health investigation has been launched following an outbreak
of food poisoning among children in Sandown. The outbreak has caused
around 30 school age children to be affected over the past 2 weeks by
one of the commonest forms of food poisoning, campylobacter. Symptoms
include vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pains, which can last for up
to 5 days.

The source of the outbreak has not been confirmed, but is subject to
an ongoing investigation by the Isle of Wight Council and the Health
Protection Agency [HPA].
