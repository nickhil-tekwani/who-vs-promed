CHIKUNGUNYA (17): FRANCE ex REUNION

In the Bouches-du-Rhone [area], 150 oviposition traps were placed to see if
_Aedes albopictus_ was present. This refers to _Aedes albopictus_, the
mosquito that carries the chikungunya virus, and also that of dengue.

Meanwhile, the Institute de Veille Sanitaire (INVS) has called for
vigilance by tourists visiting Reunion Island, where 57 cases of
chikungunya have been detected since 17 Mar [2010]. An infected patient was
diagnosed [here in France] in the region of Arles. He is a patient
returning from La Reunion and infected by chikungunya [virus].

"This [is an] imported case," said Jean-Jacques Coiplet, the territorial
delegate from the Regional Health Agency (LRA) for Bouches-du-Rhone. In
2009, we then had 7 cases of chikungunya and dengue," he added. "The risk
now is that indigenous cases develop."

Assume that _Aedes albopictus_ disseminates either of the diseases here.
And this hypothesis is not excluded because since 2009, _Aedes albopictus_
is found in Italy, then in the Mentone area, and has been seen in 2
neighborhoods of Marseille: the 11th and 12th boroughs. Hence, the
recommendation of virologists inviting the population of these
neighborhoods to be vigilant about using repellents and not leaving water
catchments. Jean-Jacques Coiplet wants [to be] reassuring, however: "To
develop indigenous cases, there must have encounter between an infected
mosquito and when it is competent [for virus transmission]."

Since 1 May [2010], the prevention plan against the spread of chikungunya
[virus] has been active: mandatory reporting of the disease and also
intervention by the Interdepartmental Agreement for Mosquito Control. 150
oviposition traps were placed in the Bouches-du-Rhone [area]. Mosquitoes
lay eggs but there are insecticides that prevent eggs [larvae] from
developing. For now, _Aedes albopictus_ was seen in 2009 [but] has not
reappeared.

[Although no _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes have been detected so far this
year (2010), it is prudent to carry out surveillance and prepare for
control measures in the area as this vector has been present in this part
of the Mediterranean coast recently, and likely is still present currently
in coastal France and nearby Italy. The local health authorities clearly
wish to avoid a chikungunya outbreak similar to the one that affected Italy
in 2007 [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20071210.3980].
