INFANT BOTULISM, POSSIBLE BABY FOOD LINK - USA (CALIFORNIA)(02)

A recent ProMED-mail post (Infant botulism, poss. baby food link -
USA (CA): recall 20070420.1295) derived from a press release from the
Mendocino County Department of Public Health, suggests incorrectly
that the patient had foodborne botulism possibly acquired from
recalled Earth's Best baby food. The patient had typical infant
botulism type A (diagnosed in this Program's laboratory).
Yes, the patient had been fed baby foods manufactured by Earth's
Best, but she had not been fed any of the recalled items (apple peach
barley and apple peach barley wholesome breakfast).
The recall was undertaken voluntarily by the company because, we are
told, an acidification step had been omitted. This omission resulted
in the product turning dark, which caused parents to contact the
company, which then initiated the recall. To the best of this
writer's knowledge, no _Clostridium botulinum_ organisms or toxin has
ever been found in the product.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Arnon for his clarification that the infant
had not consumed any of the recalled baby food. As stated by Dr.
Arnon, the recall was because of a manufacturing error, which
resulted in a product with an environment able to allow germination
of _C. botulinum_ spores, specifically the omission of an
acidification step. ProMED-mail posts recalls of food products
related to botulism risk -- even when there are no human cases
(unlike other food recalls when human cases are needed for posting)
-- because of the higher potential for fatalities if unrecognized. It
is almost always the case that, like in this situation, omission of a
production step results in the product being recalled because of a
greater risk of germination of spores and NOT because botulinum
spores or toxin have actually been found in the product. - Mod.LL]
