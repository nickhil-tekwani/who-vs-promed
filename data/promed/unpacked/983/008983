53 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Rostov
-----------------------------------------------------
[According to data from the Rostov province Territorial Directorate
of the Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare]
since March [2008], 53 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) as a consequence of tick bites have been recorded in the
Rostov Oblast of Russia. The most seriously affected areas are the
Orlov, Martinov, and Zimovnikov districts. More than 4000 people have
sought medical care following a tick bite.

[Currently an increase in the incidence of CCHF has been recorded in a
number of Russian territories. One fatal case has been reported in
Volgograd. The fatality rate from CCHF varies from 9 percent to 50
percent. Treatment is mostly symptomatic. After a tick bite, some but
not all are hospitalised. Care might include hospitalisation,
observation, immune serum parenterally and hyperimmune gammaglobulin.
The antiviral drug Ribavirin is frequently used, but its effectiveness
has not been proven.
