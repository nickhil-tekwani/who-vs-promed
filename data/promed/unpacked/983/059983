VIRUSES SURVIVE AIRCRAFT TOILET TREATMENT (02)
==============================================

re: failure of aircraft toilets to inactivate viruses, and the feared
"spread" of pathogens around the world
As long as aircraft sewage systems store their waste then discharge it into
the on-ground sewage system, why is this a public health issue? It is no
more a threat than an individual using the toilet upon landing and
discharging pathogens into the standard [or non-standard - mhj] sewage
system. The points to be concerned are then:
1. accidental discharge from the aircraft in flight;
2. the training and protection of ground crew; and
3. the functioning of the local sewage system.
