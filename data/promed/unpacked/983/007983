Abstract
--------
Sao Paulo, a densely inhabited state in southeast Brazil that contains the 4th most populated city in the world, recently experienced its largest yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreak in decades. YFV does not normally circulate extensively in Sao Paulo, so most people were unvaccinated when the outbreak began. Surveillance in non-human primates (NHPs) is important for determining the magnitude and geographic extent of an epizootic, thereby helping to evaluate the risk of YFV spillover to humans. Data from infected NHPs can give more accurate insights into YFV spread than when using data from human cases alone. To contextualise human cases, identify epizootic foci and uncover the rate and direction of YFV spread in Sao Paulo, we generated and analysed virus genomic data and epizootic case data from NHPs in Sao Paulo. We report the occurrence of 3 spatiotemporally distinct phases of the outbreak in Sao Paulo prior to February 2018. We generated 51 new virus genomes from YFV positive cases identified in 23 different municipalities in Sao Paulo, mostly sampled from NHPs between October 2016 and January 2018. Although we observe substantial heterogeneity in lineage dispersal velocities between phylogenetic branches, continuous phylogeographic analyses of generated YFV genomes suggest that YFV lineages spread in Sao Paulo at a mean rate of approximately 1km [0.6 mi] per day during all phases of the outbreak. Viral lineages from the 1st epizootic phase in northern Sao Paulo subsequently dispersed towards the south of the state to cause the 2nd and 3rd epizootic phases there. This alters our understanding of how YFV was introduced into the densely populated south of Sao Paulo state. Our results shed light on the sylvatic transmission of YFV in highly fragmented forested regions in Sao Paulo state and highlight the importance of continued surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in sentinel species.

Author summary
--------------
Since July 2016, the southeast region of Brazil has experienced the largest yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreak in decades. Sao Paulo is the most densely populated state in southeast Brazil. The outbreak has caused serious public health concern in the state, as YFV does not normally circulate widely there and most of the 21 million inhabitants were correspondingly unvaccinated against YFV when the outbreak began. In Brazil, YFV typically circulates among non-human primates (NHPs), and human cases represent isolated spill over events from this predominantly sylvatic cycle. Understanding the epidemiological dynamics and spread of YFV in NHPs is therefore critical for contextualising human cases, and guiding vaccination strategies that can better protect local human populations. Here, we aim to contextualise human cases, identify epizootic foci and uncover the rate and direction of YFV spread in Sao Paulo. We analyse the geographic and temporal distribution of observed cases of YFV in NHPs in Sao Paulo state, and identify 3 distinct phases of the epizootic. We generate virus genome sequences from 51 YFV-positive cases and perform phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses aimed at understanding the spatial spread of YFV in Sao Paulo state. Analyses of these data indicate that YFV spread from the north of Sao Paulo state into more densely populated southern regions. Although we observe substantial heterogeneity in the rate at which different sampled YFV lineages spread, the typical rate of spread was low with a mean rate of approximately 1 km [0.6 mi] per day. This is consistent with a scenario in which the majority of transmission events occurred between NHPs primates and sylvatic vectors across forested patches.

[The above report provides an interesting overview of the unexpected yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, in 2016-2018. Fortunately, the spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission to humans in the forest patches did not further extend to the urban cycle involving _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vectors transmitting the virus between humans there, despite abundant populations of this mosquito in the state. The situation in Sao Paulo illustrates the dilemma of having a vaccination policy for human populations in localities at potential risk of infection but where the history of lack of YF occurrence suggests that the risk of infection is low. Although the vaccination response in Sao Paulo state was relatively swift, 778 human cases with 262 DEATHS occurred (see Yellow fever - Americas (36): PAHO/WHO 20181208.6196116). The question of vaccination coverage of the human population in Brazil remains open because the virus is endemic in the country and cases can be expected as has happened in Santa Catarina state that had 15 YF cases in April of this year (2020).

The current expansion of yellow fever in South America raises concern for public health and also about potential conservation problems for susceptible non-human primate species in the continent. Brown howler monkeys (_Alouatta guariba_) and especially golden lion tamarins (_Leontopithecus rosalia_) are threatened with extinction. As Mod. PMB commented earlier, "Developing a vaccine to be used in golden lion tamarins can be a powerful tool, but there are some issues that need to be considered. First, applying the vaccine to 500 wild tamarins may be risky, as it involves capturing and restraining wild animals, so this should be fine-tuned to minimize the probability of seriously injuring the tamarins in the process. Using an effective vaccine in 500 individuals would preserve those individuals during an outbreak, but yellow fever is not a transient problem for South American non-human primates of the Atlantic rainforest, so in parallel non-vaccinated tamarins should be monitored to evaluate the evolution of resistance or tolerance, or otherwise they will be dependent on vaccination in aeternum. (see Americas (06): Brazil, monkey, conservation concern 20200403.7180314).
