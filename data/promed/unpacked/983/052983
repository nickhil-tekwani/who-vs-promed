[1] Cholera - Afghanistan (Kandahar)

An outbreak of cholera has swept Southern Afghanistan, with several
thousand cases reported in Kandahar Province, a spokesperson for the
health department says. 80 percent of cholera patients are children
under 5. Cholera killed several dozen children over the past 2
months.

According to the health department official, the outbreak was caused
by outrageously poor sanitary conditions. Medical personnel have
limited access to the cholera affected areas because of the continuing
military operations in the province.

[2] Cholera - Cameroon

The death toll and the number of reported cases of cholera continue
to rise across Cameroon: nearly 7718 cases reported in 9 out of 10
regions and 256 deaths attributed to the epidemic. Cameroonians
continue to struggle in containing this killer disease.

Plan [a children's organisation working with communities in 48
developing countries to alleviate child poverty] in Cameroon has been
deploying teams of community volunteers "cholera soldiers" in its 7
operational regions: Centre, South West, North West, West, Littoral,
North, and Far North. The Centre region with more than 2558 cases
reported is hardest hit, although in part through the efforts of Plan,
the number of new cases being reported there has slowed to almost
none.

"This outbreak has been lingering for the past 2 years. The defenses
of those particularly vulnerable to the disease, small children under
5 and women, are low," said Plan Cameroon country director Famari
Barro. "Plan programs in the region are underpinned by the importance
of clean, potable water and basic hygiene and sanitation to prevent
the spread of disease."

[3] Cholera - Nigeria (Adamawa)

An outbreak of cholera has claimed over 30 lives, mostly women and
children, in Mubi South and Maiha local government councils of Adamawa
State, while another 200 are still hospitalized in critical condition
in various medical establishments in the area.

To date, 19 deaths have been reported in Mubi South local government,
while another 17 persons have also been confirmed dead of similar
ailment in Maiha local government, resulting in serious tension and
general apprehension in the affected communities.

Mr Mathias Gumpi, a medical officer in one of the government health
centres in Mubi South local government council, told correspondents
that the council would not be certain that the sickness killing the
people was cholera until the results of medical tests of some of the
samples collected were out. The 2 local councils have been subjected
to repeated occurrences of cholera.

[4] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Manicaland)
Date: Thu 9 Jun 2011

http://reliefweb.int/node/406671


Chipinge is the new epicentre of Zimbabwe's latest cholera outbreak,
according to the latest WHO epidemiological report. It showed that the
eastern Manicaland province accounted for about 95 percent of all
incidents reported since the beginning of 2011. More than 573 cholera
cases had been reported in Chipinge by the end of May [2011], nearly
63 percent of the 936 incidents recorded countrywide since January
[2011].

The Zimbabwean reported in March [2011] that a cholera time-bomb was
ticking at ARDA [Agriculture & Rural Development Authority] Estate in
Chipinge where the state-owned company was allegedly supplying
untreated water from the river straight to taps. More than 3000
households in Chipinge were at risk of contracting cholera,
particularly in Ward 26 at ARDA Estates where farm workers are being
provided with raw water from a nearby river.

Cholera has become a perennial disease in Zimbabwe where the water
and sanitation infrastructure has collapsed due to lack of
maintenance. It claimed more than 4200 lives in an outbreak between
September 2008 and July 2009 that also infected nearly 100 000 people.
According to the WHO report, the cholera death toll has risen to more
than 40 since the beginning of 2011.

A total of 936 cumulative cholera cases had been reported by the 3rd
week of May 2011, a 24 percent rise in the number of cases since the
end of April [2011] when 755 cases were recorded in 10 of Zimbabwe's
62 districts. The death toll stood at 25 at the end of April.

At least 886 or 95 percent of the current cases were reported from
the eastern Manicaland province which is also home to the
controversial Marange fields where artisan miners are digging for
alluvial diamonds.

[6] Cholera - Chad

An outbreak of cholera has been reported from Chad with the onset of
the rainy season. A health ministry official revealed that so far 102
people have died from the disease and the number is expected to go
up.

Country Director of aid group Oxfam, Abakar Mahamat, said that the
cholera outbreak is reported from Chad in the rainy season because
during this time, latrines flood and contaminated water collects in
stagnant pools.

According to the government, only 0.6 percent of households use
proper latrines, while 88 percent of the households use open spaces.
Another reason for cholera in the country is that the majority of
Chad's population drinks water from open wells or rivers. This water
is not safe for drinking due to the risk of [fecal] contamination and
various waterborne diseases.
