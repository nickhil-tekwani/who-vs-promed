[This OIE notification confirms the information included in 20161028.4591328. According to information from the local press, the above (and additional) HPAI outbreaks in Kerala involved domesticated ducks. Pictures and further data are available at http://www.ndtv.com/topic/kerala-bird-flu.

The statement "stamping out applied" is in need of clarification. According to the above report, out of 157 766 susceptible birds, of which 115 cases/mortalities were registered, 21 131 have been destroyed. Partial culling is defined as "modified stamping out."

A more current source reports that the disease has been spreading in the district Hisar in the Indian state Haryana, similarly affecting ducks; see at http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/after-kerala-hisar-begins-culling-of-ducks-in-the-wake-of-bird-flu-at-resort-264900.html, which says:

"Around 150 ducks were culled in Hisar district of Haryana to prevent spread of bird flu after samples of dead birds from a local resort tested positive for avian influenza. The Centre also asked the Haryana government to take steps to control bird flu after the samples of ducks sent from a Haryana Tourism resort at Hisar were found positive. ...

"'We are on high alert,' Hisar Deputy Commissioner Nikhil Gajraj said and added that all precautionary measures are being taken to prevent spread of virus. Entry to the Blue Bird tourist complex has been restricted, he added."

The same source referred to the HPAI H5N8 situation in other parts of India as follows:

"The Action Plan of Animal Husbandry for Preparedness, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza was released by the Centre in 2015. Giving an update on bird flu situation in various parts of the country, the Centre said that the control and containment operations are being carried out at various epicenters in Kerala.

"'A video conferencing was conducted by this Department on 2 Nov 2016 to review the situation in Kerala and preparedness of the neighboring states namely Karnataka and Tamil Nadu,' the statement said.

"There is no further report of mortality from any part of Punjab where post operation surveillance is going on.

"In Delhi, the Centre said that 6 ducks at Madipur Lake reportedly died on 3 Nov 2016.

"'The samples have been collected by the Department of Animal Husbandry, Delhi. There is no report of mortality from any other part of Delhi. The Delhi Government has carried out disinfection process at all the affected sites as per Action Plan on Avian Influenza,' the statement said."

An official confirmation of the spread of HPAI into Haryana is anticipated. - Mod.AS
