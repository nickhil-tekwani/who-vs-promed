Angola: Marburg death toll rising; 2nd northern province involved
-----------------------------------------------
Another young woman has died of Marburg virus infection in Angola,
officials said, as the death toll in the deadly outbreak rose to almost
equal the most serious outbreak ever recorded. Some 121 people have died
since the hemorrhagic fever virus first broke out in the northern town
[province] of Uige in October 2004, while 5 more people, including a
Portuguese citizen, have been hospitalized, bringing the toll of sick to
132. Until now, the most serious recorded outbreak of the disease was in
the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2000, when 123 people died.
A South African travel clinic on Sunday [27 Mar 2005] warned travelers
planning to go to Angola to stay away from the country "for at least a
week," quoting reports that residents of the capital Luanda, especially
expatriates, were contemplating evacuating the country.
The young woman died on Sunday [27 Mar 2005] at a hospital in Uige some 300
km (180 miles) north of Luanda, and 3 people with the disease, including
one child, were admitted there, while in Luanda, a 12-year-old girl and a
Portuguese national were hospitalized.
Luanda provincial health director Vita Mvemba said in the capital: "One
Portuguese citizen who has visited Uige was admitted on Sunday [27 Mar
2005] at the military hospital, and one girl, about 12 years old, has been
transferred from the Cacuaco Health Centre to the Americo Boa Vida
hospital." Cacuaco is a suburb about 6 km (4 miles) north of Luanda on the
road to Uige. "The girl is from Luanda. She has been admitted with a fever
for the last 2 days at the Cacuaco Centre. Today [Sun 27 Mar 2005], she
started bleeding. That's why we urgently had to transfer her to the Americo
Boa Vida hospital," Mvemba said.
Alberto added: "3 Chinese experts in epidemiology have gone to join medical
teams in Uige in the battle against the Marburg virus."

Ebola-like virus death toll rises
------------------
The toll from the Ebola-like Marburg virus in Angola has risen to 122,
after a baby died in the northern town of Uige, a government spokesman
said. The virus, which first broke out in Uige province last October
[2004], has now spread to the capital, Luanda. A health minister described
the situation as "critical".
Angola has sought to allay fears over the spread of the virus, saying there
was no need for people to leave the country or cancel plans to visit. The
South African-based Netcare Travel Clinic said travellers should stay away
from Angola for at least a week. However, Deputy Health Minister Jose van
Dumen told the BBC that the situation had improved with the arrival of
international medical aid.
The Marburg virus causes fever, vomiting and bleeding.
Health ministry spokesman Carlos Alberto told the AFP news agency the
baby's 19-year-old mother died on Sunday morning. "This is extremely
serious - strong preventative measures are needed to contain this outbreak
of Marburg disease, " he said earlier. The number of people hospitalised
with the virus has also risen by five to 132, including a Portuguese
citizen and a 12-year-old girl in Luanda. The outbreak is now approaching
the most serious recorded, when 123 people died in the Democratic Republic
of Congo between 1998 and 2000. UN and aid agency officials are working
with the Angolan government to contain the virus. A pregnant woman was
reportedly its first victim in the country's northern Cabinda province on
Saturday, having travelled there from Uige.
The virus was first identified in 1967 among laboratory workers in Europe
who had been working with monkeys. According to the World Heath
Organization (WHO), 3/4s of the virus' victims have been children. The
European Union announced last week that it would give UDS 650,000 (UK
pounds 348,000) to fight the disease.
Its early stages are marked by diarrhoea, stomach pains, nausea and
vomiting. As it develops, patients can experience chest pains, severe
internal bleeding and eventually, death.

Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever death toll continues to rise
-----------------------------------------------
Health officials in Luanda are worried that 3 patients who died of the
Marburg [hemorrhagic fever] maybe have come into contact with more people
in Luanda. The death toll from the disease in Angola rose to 112 on Friday
[25 Mar 2005], with 3 deaths reported in Lusaka for the 1st time. "We are
running tests on family members and people they might have been in contact
with to rule out infection of others," health official Vita Vemba told
Lusa. A 15-year-old boy, an Italian aid worker and a Vietnamese doctor had
died in Luanda, health officials said, according to the Portuguese news
agency Lusa. 2 other cases of the Marburg illness were detected in Luanda.
All 5 patients had come from Uige, the province along the Congo border
where the outbreak was 1st reported.
"Marburg virus disease occurs very rarely and appears to be geographically
confined to a small number of countries in the southern part of the African
continent," WHO has said. "When cases do occur, the disease has epidemic
potential, as it can spread from person to person, most often during the
care of patients." Previous outbreaks have indicated that the risk of
infection is increased by close contact with bodily fluids of infected
people, which may occur during treatment or burial practices, WHO said.
About 3/4ths of cases have occurred in children under 5, and a small number
of health care workers are among those adults infected, WHO said on Tuesday
[22 Mar 2005].

Kenya: help sought to stop Marburg epidemic
-----------------------------------------------
Kenya has sought the help of the World Health Organization to stop the
deadly Marburg virus from spreading into the country. The virus has killed
120 people in Angola. The Director of Medical Services, Dr. James Nyikal,
said WHO will give advice on surveillance measures later this week [final
week March 2005]. Kenya is particularly concerned, because it is among the
few countries in which [Marburg] virus has struck twice before; in 1980 and
1987. It killed 2 people on both occasions, but was swiftly contained
before it could spread further.
Dr. Nyikal said that: "We have talked to WHO to advise us on what to do. We
do not take chances whenever an outbreak is reported in the region." Kenya
took the action soon after 21 Mar 2005, when laboratory tests confirmed
several people who have died in Angola since November last year [2004] were
infected with the virus.
Medical experts and WHO say it is transmitted through close contact with
infected patients and body fluids. In the 1st cases of infection, relatives
and friends of infected patients become victims, as it initially displays
symptoms similar to those of malaria, typhoid and other common diseases.
Homes of infected persons soon become centers of death, as anyone coming to
contact falls ill and dies. Patients experience agonizing severe diarrhea,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, severe chest and lung pains, sore throat
and cough. It later progresses into severe bleeding and death. Marburg
spreads fast and is easily spread to doctors and family members caring for
infected loved ones. "When cases occur, the disease has epidemic potential,
as it can spread from person to person, most often during the care of
patients," WHO said in a statement last Wednesday [23 Mar 2005].
WHO names Kenya among the few countries in sub-Saharan Africa where the
disease appears to be geographically contained. Cases have occurred in
Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda and South Africa.
However, the virus was first identified in Germany and Yugoslavia, where it
had traveled with green monkeys imported from Uganda. It attacks
sporadically, killing its victims and disappearing for years before
resurfacing. However, despite intensive investigations over the years,
research has failed to find an animal reservoir of the virus or to
determine where it hides in nature between outbreaks.
Yesterday [Sun 27 Mar 2005], the director of the Kenya Medical Research
Institute, Dr. Davy Koech, said the institute was closely monitoring events
in Angola and assessing the need for a response here. He said there was no
need yet to screen visitors in Kenya's airports and border posts, but added
it would be easy for even untrained people to suspect a case if one landed
in the airports. "Because there are no direct flights from Angola to Kenya,
it is unlikely that a traveler would land in the airport without advanced
symptoms. The disease would have shown up in the time people spend
connecting flights," Dr. Koech said.
In the 1st case in Kenya in 1980, one person was infected in the Mt. Elgon
area, not far from the Uganda region where the monkeys had been trapped. He
spread the virus to his attending physician, who survived. The virus
disappeared, only to emerge again in Kenya in 1987. The infected man died.
It was suspected that the man infected in 1980 may have contracted the
virus in a cave where he had visited. But when medical researchers put
animals in the cave, no virus was traced, and the animals remained healthy.
The virus was first identified in 1967, when simultaneous outbreaks were
reported among laboratory workers in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany and in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia. 7 people died in the outbreak, in which 31 people
were infected. Investigations revealed the victims had come into contact
with monkeys imported from Uganda. It disappeared for 8 years, reappearing
with an infection of a man in South Africa who had recently traveled from
Zimbabwe. The man infected his traveling companion and a nurse. While the 2
survived, the man died. The largest recorded outbreak, according to WHO,
occurred between 1998 and 2000 in the DRC, where it killed 123 people out
of 149 infected.
WHO recommends that containment of an outbreak of Marburg virus disease
requires rapid tracing and isolation of contacts. People living near
outbreak zones are educated on ways to avoid infection, and communities are
informed of the risks associated with traditional burial practices.

Angola: Canada sends unique mobile laboratory
-----------------------------------------------
Canada is sending a one-of-a-kind portable laboratory to Angola to help
contain [the Marburg hemorrhagic] fever outbreak that has killed more than
100 people since October 2004. Dr. Heinz Feldman, an expert in deadly
pathogens, is set to arrive in the southwestern African country on Tue 29
Mar 2005 as part of a global response to halt the spread of Marburg fever,
a viral disease with no cure or vaccine that doctors have said can be
"rapidly fatal."
Feldman and Allen Grolla, a laboratory technician, will be able to quickly
diagnose cases of Marburg virus infection, which health officials on the
ground have been unable to do. So far, only 5 cases have been confirmed,
but at least 112 people have died from the virus, according to Angolan
officials. Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director of Canada's National
Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said on-site testing is critical,
because early symptoms, such as fevers and headaches, are vague and not
necessarily telltale signs of the disease. "It's very important in the
middle of this kind of an epidemic to be able to make a diagnosis quickly,
because there's lots of different causes of fever," Plummer said.
Health experts are acutely concerned about this outbreak for several
reasons. About 3/4ths of those infected are children under 5, and its scope
is unusually large; the majority of other outbreaks have involved one or 2
cases. It can also take a long time to curb the spread of the virus, which
has a mortality rate of more than 90 percent. The last outbreak of Marburg,
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, took 2 years to control, said Dick
Thompson, spokesman for the World Health Organization.
Unease grew last week [4th week March 2005], after Marburg was detected in
the Angolan capital of Luanda, a city of nearly 3 million. Medical experts
fear hospital staff may have been inadvertently exposed, further
transmitting the virus. In response, the WHO is sending a team of
laboratory experts, epidemiologists and infection-control specialists under
the auspices of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.
Canada's mobile lab has been used to test cases of Ebola [hemorrhagic
fever] in Congo and the global transmission of SARS at Hong Kong's
Metropole Hotel. "If SARS taught us in the past, and as we're worrying now
with avian influenza, we live in a global environment, and these bugs
really know no bounds," Thompson said.
The Public Health Agency of Canada has issued a travel advisory since the
outbreak. It was first noticed along Angola's border with Congo, in Uige
province. Authorities initially feared the deaths were caused by Ebola,
which still exists in nature in Congo. Previous outbreaks have indicated
that the risk of infection is increased by close contact with bodily fluids
of infected people, as may occur during treatment or burial practices, WHO
said. It has an incubation period of 3 to 7 days. Between 1998 and late
2000, Congo recorded the largest outbreak of Marburg virus on record, when
149 cases were reported, with 123 deaths.
