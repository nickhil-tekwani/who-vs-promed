----------------------------------------------------------------------
It should be clarified that vultures can, in fact, pass viable anthrax spores in their feces if they eat meat contaminated with spores -- Lindeque & Turnbull (1994) found that 50 percent of vultures tested that had been feeding on known anthrax carcasses in Namibia passed up to 174 cfu/g [colony-forming units per gram] of feces, with a mean of 34 cfu/g. This was not nearly as much as they found in the feces of some other scavengers (hyena, black-backed jackal), but it definitely can happen.

Scavengers can also play a cleansing role if they ingest the vegetative form of the bacterium before it is able to sporulate -- as the moderator pointed out, the vegetative cells cannot survive passage through the intestinal tract. Given this cleansing effect and the fact that relatively few spores are shed in scavenger feces compared to the very high doses necessary for contracting fulminant infection, it is doubtful that scavengers play a major role in spreading anthrax through their feces (or, I would suggest, their vomitus).

It is also highly doubtful that vultures covered in blood spread anthrax by bathing in waterholes -- the dilution effect alone ensures that hosts will be very unlikely to ingest a high enough dose from very slightly contaminated water. In addition, vultures are usually the 1st scavengers to arrive at a carcass, and usually do so before vegetative cells have a chance to sporulate; thus, the chance that they actively move spores around on their feathers after being covered in fresh carcass blood is low. The biggest contribution scavengers likely have to anthrax spread is by opening carcasses and allowing vegetative cells to escape into the environment, thus increasing their chances of sporulation rather than death through competition with putrefactive microbes within the carcass.

[Yes, but it is a mite more complicated. To quote myself:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299709000612

"Spores will survive passage through the scavenger intestinal tract but vegetative cells will not; for example we were unable to find any positive turkey vulture (_Cathartes aura_) faeces (n = 20) under a roost in the middle of a significant distribution of confirmed deer anthrax deaths in West Texas in 2005 (Hugh-Jones, unpublished data). Spores but not vegetative cells survive passage through the acid (pH 1-1.5) vulture stomach (Anon, 1979 and Houston & Cooper, 1975). Anthrax spores were recovered from approximately half of the faeces from jackals (_Canis mesomelas_), vultures (_Gyps africanus_, Torgos tracheliotus_, _Trigonoceps occipitalis_), and hyaenas (_Crocuta crocuta_) collected in the vicinity of carcasses in the Etosha National Park [Northern Namibia] but not at a distance; the fecal spore density was extremely variable (Lindeque and Turnbull, 1994). In Argentina Saggese et al. (2007) recovered spores from 1/14 cloacal swab samples from Chimango caracaras [falcons] (_Milvago chimango_). In general, scavengers are fairly resistant to infection but cases are seen (Edebes, 1976, Hugh-Jones & de Vos, 2002, and Kraneveld & Mansjoer, 1941) and antibodies noted, such as, in lions (Turnbull et al., 1989), and in 3 species of northern Namibian vultures (Turnbull et al., 2008a).

The problem with vultures and marabou storks is not the spores in them but the spores on them (Pienaar, 1967). After feeding they fly to a bathing site, a cattle water-trough, a pond, a pool, a 'mini' dam, which is normally nearby. Vegetative cells in the blood-contaminated feathers will sporulate in the water within 15-68 h (Lindeque and Turnbull, 1994). The spore load from an individual bird might be slight (Turnbull et al., 2008b) but as approximately 50-185 birds may feed on a zebra or 250 on an elephant carcass, the cumulative spore off-load, say in a cattle water trough, can present a very real risk. This water contamination is transient. Vultures devour animals rapidly when hungry, for example impala soft tissues within one hour and the carcass within half a day, but sporulation occurs only after the carcass has been opened and exposed to the air for a number of hours. Thus, vultures greatly reduce the total volume of infective material in the vegetative form while spreading spores to their bathing sites."

Go to the article itself to see the references. The Pienaar paper of 1967 is a key reference on the impact of the newly installed water troughs on anthrax incidence in the KNP (Kruger National Park). The consensus is that vultures are a benefit in their rapid reduction of carcasses and minimal local soil contamination. Unfortunately the worker vultures then retire to bathe and as their numbers can be significant the few watering places accumulate spores and later subsequent cases. On the other hand, vultures gorged with food are content to rest and maybe hunt just for choice morsels, ignoring further anthrax carcasses which are thus left for other species to scavenge. From this arose the folk belief in Texas and Louisiana that vultures will not feed on an anthrax carcass ... easy to assume if the rancher had missed seeing the initial deaths.

Other scavenger species are not as tidy as vultures and will drag and scatter tissue all around and away from a carcass because of the competition. For example the environmental contamination, which is significant, from foxes, crows, wolves, and bears feeding on a single wood bison can cover some 100 sq m [1076 sq ft]. Around a dead cow it is spatially more modest but the spore load in the soil is still heavy, and bones will be found scattered widely. - Mod.MHJ]
