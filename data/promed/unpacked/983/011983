The Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock met on Monday [20 Jun 2022] in Bujumbura with development partners to discuss the mechanisms to be put in place to deal with Rift Valley Fever [RVF) disease and decide on possible contributions in the fight against it according to the action plan already submitted. The minister of the environment, agriculture and livestock, Deo Guide Rurema recalled that since last April [2022], Burundi has been attacked by Rift Valley Fever disease.

At the first meeting with development partners, they set up a technical team which drew up a roadmap that outlined actions to be put forward to contain the disease, in particular the mobilization of funds, the acquisition of vaccines and the vaccination campaign.

Figures show that 13 provinces are affected by this disease; 827 cows have been infected and 323 of them have already died.

[From the above report, it is not clear if funds have yet been mobilized, vaccines acquired, and a vaccination campaign carried out. According to Burundi's immediate notification of its RVF event to the WOAH (World Organisation for Animal Health; formerly the OIE), dated 3 Jun 2022 (ProMED post 20220605.8703685), RVF in cattle was recorded in 3 provinces (Muyinga, Kirundo and Ngozi), with starting date given as 10 Apr 2022. No human cases had been confirmed in Burundi as of that point in time, though, reportedly, the veterinary services were collaborating with the country's public health authorities to carry out surveillance.

On 6 Jun 2022, local media reported the number of RVF cases in cattle in each of the 8 affected provinces as of 1 Jun 2022 (Post archive no 20220606.8703714).

According to the current information, 13 of Burundi's 18 provinces are now affected by RVF. The continued absence of human cases is unusual. It will be interesting to note if samples from infected animals (reportedly, cattle, sheep, and goats) have been submitted to an RVF reference laboratory and if the virus strain involved has undergone genotyping. Further information from sources in Burundi would be appreciated. - Mod.AS
