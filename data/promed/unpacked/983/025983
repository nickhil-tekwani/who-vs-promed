Typhoid outbreak extends to capital hit by water supply problems
-----------------------------------------------
The typhoid outbreak in Gabon has spread to the capital Libreville, which
has been grappling with water shortages for the past 2 weeks, Health
Ministry officials said on Tue 25 Jan 2005.
The outbreak of this water-borne disease began in the northern town of Oyem
in December 2004, but officials said there were now more than 100 cases
nationwide, including 12 in Libreville. The city is home to more than half
of Gabon's 1.2 million population.
The number of confirmed typhoid cases nationwide has doubled from 50 2
weeks ago, but, so far, only one death has been reported.
Doctors from the Central Hospital of Libreville (CHL), the country's
largest public hospital, warned that difficulties in early diagnosis of
typhoid, and the fact that patients who had been treated for typhoid could
remain carriers of the disease, meant that the full extent of the outbreak
in the capital would not be evident for some time.
The disease first appeared in Oyem, a town of 35 000 people near the
northern frontiers with Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, following 2 months
of disruption to the local water supply.
Now the same problem has hit Libreville. Water company officials have
blamed dry weather for water levels in the river which supplies the city,
but they have also admitted that the main pump which lifts water from the
river to the city's water treatment system has broken down.
Water shortages were previously unknown in this densely forested country
crisscrossed by large rivers, but the population of Gabon's main towns has
increased rapidly in recent years, and the water supply network has failed
to keep pace with this expansion.
Many people from Oyem work in Libreville, 411 km to the southwest, but go
home by car or plane on the weekends. This makes it likely that the
infection spread to the capital from the north. Health officials said that
within Libreville and other coastal towns, there was a strong risk of
spread through the consumption of raw shellfish, which is a popular food in
the region.
The WHO estimates there are about 16 million cases of typhoid a year
worldwide, of which approximately 600 000 end in death. About 70 percent of
all fatalities occur in Asia.
