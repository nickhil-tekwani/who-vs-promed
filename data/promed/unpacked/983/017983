Several cases of blue-ear pig disease have been discovered at a
breeding centre in Gia Lai Province's Pleiku City, according to the
deputy chief of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's
Animal Health Department, Hoang Van Nam.

Nam said it had been reported that the group of pigs had been
vaccinated against the disease last month [March 2009]. The incident
is under investigation.

[In 2007, porcine reproductive & respiratory syndrome (PRRS) affected
4 provinces and 2 cities in Viet Nam. It has reemerged in China and
is presently affecting the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui
and Guizhou; see:
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/23/content_7652514.htm>.

PRRS is caused by a virus which was 1st isolated and classified as an
arterivirus as recently as 1991. The disease syndrome had been 1st
recognized in the USA in the mid 1980's and was called "mystery swine
disease." It has also been called blue ear disease. The name porcine
arterivirus has been proposed recently.

The virus of PRRS has a particular affinity for macrophages,
particularly those found in the lung. Macrophages are part of the
body's defenses. Those present in the lung are called alveolar
macrophages. They ingest and remove invading bacteria and viruses but
not in the case of the PRRS virus. Instead, the virus multiplies
inside them, producing more virus, and kills the macrophages. Once it
has entered a herd, it tends to remain present and active
indefinitely.

Up to 40 percent of the macrophages are destroyed, which removes a
major part of the body's defense mechanism and allows bacteria and
other viruses to proliferate and do damage. A common example of this
is the noticeable increase in severity of enzootic pneumonia in
grower/finisher units when they become infected with PRRS virus.

It may take up to a year for all breeding stock, particularly in
large herds, to become infected for the 1st time, and although the
virus appears to spread rapidly in a herd, it may be some 4-5 months
before at least 90 percent of the sows have become seropositive. Some
sows remain naive. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for sow herds 1-2
years after infection to contain less than 20 percent of serological
positive animals. This does not, however, necessarily mean they are
not still immune nor does it mean that they have stopped passing on
immunity to their offspring. Adult animals shed virus for much
shorter periods of time (14 days) compared to growing pigs, which can
excrete for 1-2 months.

The clinical picture can vary tremendously from one herd to another.
As a guide, for every 3 herds that are exposed to PRRS for the 1st
time, one will show no recognizable disease; the 2nd would show mild
disease, and the 3rd moderate to severe disease. The reasons for this
are not clearly understood. However, the higher the health status of
the herd, the less severe are the disease effects. It may be that the
virus is mutating as it multiplies, throwing up some strains that are
highly virulent and some that are not.

PRRS infects all types of herds, including herds of high or ordinary
health status and both indoor and outdoor units, irrespective of size.
