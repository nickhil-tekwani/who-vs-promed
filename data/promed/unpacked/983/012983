If you're hooking up, the AIDS Committee of Newfoundland wants you to make sure you're not catching one of the sexually transmitted diseases currently on the rise. The committee is so alarmed, it's holding a news conference Monday [1 Dec 2014] about the rise of syphilis, gonorrhea and HIV in Newfoundland and Labrador.

The campaign is particularly targeted at people in the age range of 30-49, many of whom, they say, are re-entering the dating field after divorce or death of a spouse and have forgotten the perils of sexually-transmitted diseases. They may also be under the misunderstanding that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is curable, when it is only treatable.

Citing recent information in the media from Eastern Health, Gerard Yetman, executive director of the AIDS committee, said a poster campaign will be launched to increase the awareness of sexually transmitted disease and how to get tested.

So far this year [2014], there have been 20 new cases of syphilis and 51 cases of gonorrhea. These new cases are primarily occurring in men who have sex with men between the ages of 30 and 49, Yetman said, but added it's not just men who should be concerned. The increase in syphilis and gonorrhea also indicates an increase in HIV infection in the province, as it's easier for HIV to spread with a sexually transmitted illness, he said. "You don't see AIDS posters all over the place, anymore. (AIDS) is not in media as much as used to be. Unfortunately that's translated into it's curable," Yetman said.

The committee has been working with Eastern Health's communicable disease department to create the poster campaign, Yetman said. Emphasis for many years has been on educating teens about sex and sexually transmitted illnesses, so the new campaign will be geared toward the older age group and target sites like health clubs and workplaces. On Monday [1 Dec 2014] -- International World AIDS Day -- the committee's chairman, Philip Lundrigan, is also expected to make a call for more funding and HIV education in the province.

[Newfoundland and Labrador, which incorporates the island of Newfoundland and mainland Labrador to the northwest, is the most easterly province of Canada, with a combined population of 526 702 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador). Approximately 92 percent of the province's population lives on the island of Newfoundland (including its associated smaller islands). Half of the province's population (262 410) lives on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, which includes the city of St. John's, the province's capital and largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Peninsula). Most of the population is concentrated in St. John's Metropolitan Area, with a population of 200 600 as of 2012 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador). The largest community in mainland Labrador is the town of Happy Valley - Goose Bay, which was once a refueling point for plane convoys to Europe in World War II and is now where the site of NATO tactical flight training in Canada and the Canadian Force Base Goose Bay is located. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Labrador).

The increasing incidence of syphilis that is occurring in Newfoundland and Labrador, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), is similar to that which is occurring worldwide, including other parts of Canada (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below). The news report above, however, does not indicate where in the province syphilis and gonococcal disease is occurring, nor does it characterize the affected population other than saying that new cases of syphilis and gonococcal disease are primarily occurring in men who have sex with men (MSM) between the ages of 30 and 49. The news report also does not indicate the frequency of HIV-coinfection with syphilis or gonococcal disease, nor does it say directly whether the number of new cases of HIV infection is actually increasing, other than saying that the increase in syphilis and gonorrhea "indicates" an increase in HIV infection in the province.

However, a rising incidence of syphilis may not necessarily be accompanied by a rising incidence of HIV infection; there may be a discordant trend, with an increasing incidence of syphilis and a falling or stable incidence of HIV infection. In fact, in a prior ProMED-mail post (Syphilis - Canada (02): background 20120211.1038978), Dr. Steve Berger pointed out that the increasing incidence of syphilis in Canada since the year 2000 was accompanied by a continued decline in the incidence of HIV infection. As an explanation, another recent ProMED-mail post reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV-infected MSM without causing a rising incidence of HIV infection (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642). Information about what is actually occurring in Newfoundland and Labrador would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
