Vegetable growers face disease threat
--------------------------------------
Tomatoes, potatoes, and vine crops are at risk due to wet weather
this [2010] spring and summer. Late blight and downy mildew --
diseases that attack tomatoes, potatoes, and vine crops such as
cucumbers and squash -- have been confirmed in Ohio, threatening
vegetable farms and backyard gardens.

"What's different this year [2010] is that both diseases have
appeared in Ohio earlier than we have seen before," says Sally
Miller, Ohio State University and Ohio Agricultural Research and
Development Center. Recent rainy and stormy weather most likely
created favorable conditions for these diseases, since their spores
are carried by winds and they thrive in wet environments.

Downy mildew was found on cucumbers in northeast Ohio, following
reports of the disease in Ontario, Canada. Late blight was confirmed
on tomatoes in east-central Ohio. This follows confirmations of late
blight in potatoes, tomatoes or both in Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Kentucky, and New York. "People need to be on the alert for these
diseases and prepare for their possible arrival on farms or gardens,"
Miller says.

Late blight has been found on potatoes in Walsh County, North
Dakota's leading potato producer. The disease is "very serious" and
can hurt both yields and quality, said Nick David, North Dakota State
University and the University of Minnesota.

Producers need to scout fields and apply fungicides as needed, he
said. He also urged potato producers to destroy cull piles of
flowering potato plants and volunteer potatoes in wheat fields
because the piles are a potential source of inoculum.

Cool, wet conditions this spring [2010] led to late blight, David
said. The disease occurs only rarely in North Dakota, with outbreaks
last year [2009] and in 1994. This year's [2010] outbreak comes 2
months earlier in the growing season than in 2009, giving the disease
more time to potentially damage growing potato plants, he said.

Late blight was found earlier in Dickey County, in southeastern North
Dakota. The disease also has been found in southern Manitoba [on
tomato, see link below]. So far, it has not been found in Minnesota.
Warm, dry weather would help to control the disease, David said.

[Late blight
------------
Late blight of tomato and potato is caused by the fungus-like
organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop
loss. The pathogen can affect leaves, stems, and fruit of tomato
causing spots, lesions, and rotting, and in potato it affects leaves
as well as tubers. The disease can spread rapidly within a crop and
destroy it within a few days. It is spread by contaminated plant and
other material, wind, and water. Under favourable conditions,
epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

Disease management requires an integrated approach and includes
phytosanitary measures, removal of solanaceous weeds, and volunteer
crop plants serving as pathogen reservoirs, limiting free moisture in
the crop, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material
(tomato transplants, potato seed tubers), fungicide sprays of crops,
and crop rotation. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility
to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being
counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen, with new strains
evolving frequently.

In the US in 2009, an outbreak of late blight on tomato was suspected
to have originated from infected tomato seedlings distributed widely
from Alabama (ProMED-mail post 20090519.1875). Earlier in 2010, a
nationwide alert was issued (ProMED-mail post 20100519.1648) due to
the expected remaining high levels of inoculum. So far in the current
season, the disease has been reported from the US states of
Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, and northern Texas, and
from the Canadian province of Manitoba (see links below).

Cucurbit downy mildew
---------------------
Downy mildew caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ is a
devastating disease of cucurbits and has been reported from different
locations worldwide. Different pathovars with variable host
preferences seem to exist, and, for example, a strain that affects
cucumbers may not necessarily affect melons. By affecting the leaves
and thus the photosynthetic potential of its host, downy mildew
reduces yield and fruit quality, and it can eventually kill the host.
Under favourable conditions, plantings can be infected so rapidly
that they appear to have been frosted.

The fungus survives on cultivated or wild cucurbits, and volunteer
crop plants or weeds may serve as sources of inoculum. It is spread
by wind, rain splash, mechanical means, and with infected plant
material. Disease management may include fungicides, phytosanitation
to eliminate inoculum, cultural measures (for example crop rotation)
and use of cultivars with low susceptibility or resistance. In 2007,
a new strain was reported in the US (ProMED-mail post 20071023.3448),
but it is not clear which strains are involved in the outbreaks
reported in Ohio and Ontario in item 1.
