Pet dogs are at risk from palm oil washed up on beaches on the Hampshire and Dorset coast [England], dog walking groups have warned.

New Forest Dog Owners' Group said it has been alerted to 5 reports of the substance between Hengistbury Head and Milford on Sea in the past fortnight.

Dogs are vulnerable to sickness if they eat the contaminated palm oil in solid form. Local councils said any sightings should be reported.

Dog owners have been told to keep their pets away from the white waxy substance, which smells like diesel.

Kate Hurcombe from the New Forest Dog Owners' Group said: "It's not clear how much a dog has to eat before it causes a problem.

"It seems to be when there is a lot of wind so the stormy weather brings it ashore."

Several animals were poisoned when similar palm oil solids washed ashore along the South West Coast last year [2014].

Bournemouth, Christchurch and New Forest Councils urged dog walkers to report any suspected sightings of palm oil on beaches.

Palm oil has a wide variety of uses and is found in food, soaps and shampoos, and biofuels.

[There is a wonderful picture of this at the source URL.

Due to severe storms in 2014, palm oil is now washing up on the beaches of Southern England.

Palm oil is a natural product used mainly in food processing and it can legally be released into the sea by ships. However, palm can be contaminated with fuel waste and other toxins and in solid form can be extremely harmful to dogs.

There has been concern for some years about the effects of legally dumped palm oil, but the concern is growing, not only in terms of its damage to the tourist industry but its possible ill effects on marine mammals as well as dogs on beaches.

Perhaps the 1st mention of palm oil, looking rather like chunks of lard, or perhaps waxy lard, washing ashore in the UK was in 2013.

Palm oil is very toxic to dogs and can cause vomiting and diarrhoea (as can any overload of fat) but can also cause kidney damage and liver failure. If you suspect your dog has eaten palm oil, it is crucial to get him to an emergency vet within an hour in order to ensure the best outcome, according to some UK veterinarians.

Undoubtedly the amount of palm oil to be dumped at a shipping facility could be costly, so one wonders if the regulations are likely to prohibit ocean dumping of palm oil any time soon.

Yet there are dog foods that contain small amounts of palm oil as a filler or binder and as an oil source, so surely there is a certain amount that is required to elicit effects in animals. - Mod.TG
