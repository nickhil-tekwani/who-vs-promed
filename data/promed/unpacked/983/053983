A 79 year old diagnosed with a hantavirus infection died after suffering cardiac complications while remaining hospitalized since 23 Jun [2018]. The victim, from the La Lagunita de Pedasí community in Los Santos province, became the 2nd person to die of a hantavirus infection this year [2018], according to regional health authorities.

Carlos Muñoz, regional epidemiology coordinator for the Los Santos region, indicated that the patient was hospitalized for 18 days in the Joaquín Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital, in Las Tablas city, and although recovered from pulmonary symptoms, was unable to overcome medical complications with which she presented. According to what he said, she was on mechanical ventilation and intubated, but these measures had been removed, and she expired on her own.

He added that in this past month of June [2018], 13 hantavirus infection cases were closed in the Los Santos region, with the last cases reported in children less than 10 years old, residents of the Tonosí and Las Lajas regions in Las Tablas.

[This case appears to be the same 79 year old woman who was then in intensive care in the hospital but still alive as reported in a 26 Jun 2018 report [see ProMED-mail Hantavirus - Americas (43): Panama (LS) 20180627.5879628].

There has been a recent increase in the number of hantavirus infections in Los Santos province. Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned.

As mentioned before, there is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. However, as noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces and saliva, the source of human infections. - Mod.TY
