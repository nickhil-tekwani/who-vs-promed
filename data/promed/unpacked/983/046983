Update: Another dog food added to recall list
---------------------------------------------
Diamond Pet Foods is voluntarily recalling another type of dog food because of potential exposure to salmonella, according to The Associated Press.

The recall, announced Friday, applies to samples, 6-pound bags and 18-pound bags of Diamond Naturals Small Breed Adult Dog Lamb & Rice Formula dry dog food manufactured 26 Aug 2011. [Most dog food manufactured in August of 2011 is likely to already be sold, so the problem must have been from a retained sample. – Mod.TG]

The product was distributed in Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.

Missouri-based Diamond Pet Foods has issued a massive recall of dog food made at its Gaston, S.C., after salmonella was found at the facility.

Other brands that have been recalled include, Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul; Country Value; Diamond; Diamond Naturals; Premium Edge; Professional; 4Health; Kirkland Signature products, Costco's private label; and Taste of the Wild.

Natural Balance Pet Foods, Candide Pet Foods, Solid Gold Health Products for Pets and WellPet LLC have also issued voluntary recalls, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The latest recall -- of Diamond Naturals Small Breed Adult Dog Lamb & Rice Formula dry dog food -- covers the following production codes and best-before dates:
-- DSL0801, 26-Aug-2012
-- DSL0801, 27-Sept-2012
-- DSL0801, 18-Oct-2012
-- DSL0801 (samples)

[Voluntary recalls are usually issued from the pet food manufacturer with the knowledge of the US FDA. This is the second recall in a short time related to salmonella.

If you have handled the food, wash your hands thoroughly before preparing your own food, or eating out of your hand.

Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease caused by bacteria of the genus _Salmonella._ Many different kinds of _Salmonella_ can make people sick. Most people have diarrhea, fever, and stomach pain that start 1 to 3 days after they get infected. These symptoms usually go away after 1 week. Sometimes, people have to see a doctor or go to the hospital because the diarrhea is severe or the infection has affected other organs.

The severity of salmonellosis in dogs and cats varies from a subclinical carrier state, which is the most common, to one of acute enterocolitis. This may include fever, anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea -- possibly with mucus or blood, and abdominal pain (infection is often associated with mesenteric lymphadenitis). Cats may present with prolonged periods of fever and anorexia without diarrhea. Additionally either the cat or the dog may develop septicemia or endotoxemia. Salmonellosis in cats has also been caused "song bird fever," reflecting association with predation on infected migratory birds.

The role of dogs and cats in zoonotic transmission
--------------------------------------------------
_Salmonella_ infections in dogs and cats deserve special comment for several reasons related to zoonotic transmission:

_Salmonella_ spp. can be isolated from healthy dogs and cats at rates of up to 36 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Dogs and cats tend to shed _Salmonella_ organisms for very prolonged periods of time after infection. Dogs and especially cats can shed _Salmonella_ organisms in both their feces and saliva, meaning that transmission can occur via licking.

Dog food and dog treats may be a source of _Salmonella_ infection for both dogs and humans that handle the treats. Dogs and cats may suffer salmonellosis as a "reverse zoonosis," with infection transmitted from human-to-dog and subsequently back to other humans.

Similarly, outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections in large animal teaching hospitals have been linked to the introduction of bacteria from infected human personnel, with subsequent spread to animals and then back to other human workers.
