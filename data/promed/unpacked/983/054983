Federal animal health inspectors said they discovered the virus that
causes foot & mouth disease (FMD) present in some calves in 3 towns
[in Mato Grosso Do Sul], where an outbreak occurred in October 2005,
the local Estado newswire reported Thursday [15 Feb 2007].
The Mato Grosso do Sul [municipalities affected] include Eldorado,
Mundo Novo, and Japora, all on the Paraguay border and all the focus
of a large FMD disease outbreak that started on 10 Oct 2005.
The Agriculture Minister press office did not confirm the report. The
Animal Health Department of the Agriculture Ministry was meeting
Thursday [15 Feb 2007] to discuss the recent blood tests.
Calls to various animal health officials and Mato Grosso do Sul
ranching associations were not returned.
According to the newswire's report, 2.7 percent of the 11 449 blood
samples of young calves showed signs of the virus in the blood
stream. Those cattle will likely be slaughtered.
Mato Grosso do Sul is Brazil's No. 1 cattle state and has been banned
from international beef markets since late 2005. The disease hasn't
been reported outside of the original contamination zone.
The state was testing new cattle on some 444 properties to see if the
2005-2006 cattle culling in the region had eliminated the virus.
Brazil is the world's No. 1 beef exporter.
