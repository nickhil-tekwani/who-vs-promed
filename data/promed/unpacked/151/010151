The Brazilian government reported on Friday [31 May 2019] a case of atypical mad cow disease [Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)] in an animal in Mato Grosso state, according to a statement from the country's Agriculture Ministry. The ministry said the case of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), was detected in a 17-year-old cow. It said it collected the necessary material for tests and incinerated all other parts of the cow. "No part of the animal entered the food chain; there are no risks for the population," the statement said.

The case was considered "atypical" as the animal contracted the BSE protein spontaneously, rather than through the feed supply. Classical cases of mad cow [BSE] are caused when cattle are fed brain or spinal tissue of other ruminants, which is now forbidden in nearly all beef producing countries, including Brazil.

In 2012 in Brazil, tests showed that a cow that had died 2 years earlier in Parana state had developed the protein that causes mad cow disease [BSE], though the animal never developed the disease and died of natural causes.

The World Organisation for Animal Health maintained Brazil's status as a country with an insignificant risk of BSE at that time, after it confirmed the atypical Parana case. Even so, several countries including South Korea, China and Egypt banned some or all beef imports from Brazil, the world's top exporter. That trade was later reopened.

Brazil's Agriculture Ministry said it had informed all importers on Friday [31 May 2019] about the case, as well as the World Organisation for Animal Health.

[BSE is fortunately infrequent these days and, when seen, is the spontaneous atypical disease, not the classical BSE associated with contaminated cattle feed. As subscribers may not be au fait with this disease, I am inserting my fellow moderator AS's commentary of 2014:

"Following the publication of Brazil's 1st BSE case in December 2012, about 2 years after the initial detection of the case in a 13-year-old cow in Parana, there were published concerns addressing the declared safety for the consumers of Brazil's beef and the credibility of the country's BSE surveillance (see ProMED-mail post 20121209.1444250). The BSE case was later identified by the reference laboratory as 'atypical'. To address the questions raised, on 20 Dec 2012 OIE published a press release entitled "Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) case in Brazil: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers" (http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy-bse-case-in-brazil-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers/). For subscribers' convenience, the entire document is copied herewith:

'Q. Is beef meat produced in Brazil safe for consumption?
A. Eating red meat (that is, deboned skeletal muscle meat) poses no risk to consumers, regardless of the BSE risk status of the cattle population of the producing country. Besides, in this case in Brazil, the dead animal was destroyed and did not enter the food or feed chain.

Q. Are import bans on Brazilian beef and beef products justified according to OIE's recommendations?
A. The international standard for BSE provides recommendations on the safe trade of meat and other products, even from countries with BSE. The OIE's international standards are democratically adopted by all OIE Member Countries; but the World Trade Organization rules allow its Members to apply trade restrictions on a provisional basis while awaiting further information.

Q. Does this case lead to a suspension of the current OIE disease status of Brazil?
A. BSE is a disease for which the OIE established official recognition of the sanitary status in countries and zones. The OIE has defined a transparent, science-based, and impartial procedure for the recognition of BSE risk status of Member Countries. Brazil is recognised as having a negligible BSE risk, that is, the most favourable category.

As the OIE procedure is based on an overall assessment of risk, the occurrence of a BSE case does not automatically lead to a suspension of the BSE risk status, except in the event of a change in the epidemiological situation indicating failure of the BSE risk mitigating measures in place. So far, there is no reason for suspending Brazil's BSE risk status. Epidemiologic aspects of this event will be examined and discussed at the next meeting of the Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases in February 2013. [The report of the meeting is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/SCAD/A_SCAD_Feb2013.pdf].

Q. Why such a delay in the notification of BSE case?
A. BSE is a complex disease, not easily diagnosed. According to statements made by Brazilian animal health authorities, national regulations, and routine procedures applicable to suspected neurological diseases in a country with a negligible risk were followed but had some logistical problems in a national laboratory, leading to the delay in obtaining confirmatory diagnosis.

Q. What does atypical BSE mean?
A. There are naturally and sporadic occurring forms of encephalopathies in several mammalian species, including man. The pathogenesis of sporadic forms of BSE (which would be called "atypical" to distinguish them from the forms occurring through contaminated feed) is currently under scientific investigation. At present time, the OIE does not yet recognise an atypical form of BSE as a distinct entity for the purpose of its international standards; therefore, it is not mentioned in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which does not distinguish between different forms of BSE.'

At present, Brazil is included among the 25 countries listed as having a "negligible BSE risk" status (see http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/). - Mod.AS"

Results of the typing at Weybridge [Central Veterinary Laboratories, England] are anticipated with interest as these results would confirm the atypicality of this recent case.
