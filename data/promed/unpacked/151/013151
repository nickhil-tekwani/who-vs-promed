[1] Rabies vaccine scam - Oklahoma

A man working out of retail store parking lots in southern Oklahoma
may have charged hundreds of pet owners a fee to administer worthless
rabies shots, a state official said Wednesday [29 Sep 2010].

The dogs and cats may be at risk for the viral disease because it's
not known if a real vaccine was used or if it was stored properly,
said Cathy Kirkpatrick, executive director of the Oklahoma State
Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. The animals are not considered
vaccinated because state law requires the rabies vaccination be
administered by a veterinarian or someone under the supervision of a
veterinarian, she said.

As a result, if one of the dogs or cats bites a person or a pet, the
dog or cat will have to be quarantined for 10 days to see if rabies
signs develop, she said. In some cases, the animal may have to be
euthanized so that its brain tissue may be submitted for rabies
testing.

"This is a public health issue," Kirkpatrick said. She said the
rabies vaccinations were given by James Allen, of Ardmore. He is
setting up shop under the name Dog City Animal Rescue in various
retail parking lots in southern Oklahoma, she said. He has advertised
on the Internet site Craig's List, saying that he's giving rabies
shots for USD 10 each, Kirkpatrick said. He issues a signed
certificate of vaccination, listing himself as a veterinarian
technician.

The Oklahoma State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners has an
investigator gathering information. Allen is not cooperating. Allen
is not licensed by the state to give rabies shots, Kirkpatrick said.
"He claims that he's in the process of getting his veterinary
license, but he's not even a (veterinarian) technician," she said.

"You can't say you're a technician unless you're registered with us."
A veterinarian technician must go through 2 years of college courses.
Allen apparently buys the vaccine at farm and ranch stores. Anyone
can buy the vaccine.

"Just because you can buy clippers and scissors, you can't make
yourself a barber," Kirkpatrick said.

Most farm and ranch stores sell the rabies vaccine for USD 3, she
said. He was reported seen 12 Sep 2010 giving rabies shots at a
Walmart parking lot in Sulphur, she said.

If apprehended, Allen could face misdemeanor counts accusing him of
providing veterinary services without being licensed to do so, she
said.

Murray County assistant district attorney John Walton said Wednesday
[29 Sep 2010] he is willing to review any information or complaints
the agency receives to determine whether to pursue criminal
proceedings against Allen.

[This sort of scam has cost lives abroad. The US no longer has the
canine strain of rabies, but we do still have rabies among raccoons,
skunks, foxes, and bats, among other species, and dogs still tangle
with them. Please do not misunderstand this statement. The rabies
virus has different strains, generally named for the animal they were
isolated from. However, a strain is not confined to the animal it is
named after. For example the raccoon strain of rabies can affect
canines and canines can develop rabies, it is just the raccoon
strain. - Mod.TG]

A stray cat in Durham has tested positive for rabies, Public Health
officials warn. The young cat was found in the Bennett Memorial Road
area of Durham. The stray cat is described as a young gray tabby with
white fur on the chest and gold eyes.

Health Department officials ask residents that visited facilities,
businesses and residences in close proximity to where the stray cat
was found, that may have come in contact with the animal since 19 Sep
2010 to immediately contact their physician.

Residents are also asked to call the Durham County Health Department
at (919)560-7600 to report their recent contact with the animal.

The Rowan County Animal Control reported the 11th case of rabies of
the year [2010]. The agency received a report last Wednesday [6 Oct
2010] that a raccoon that bit a dog was positive for rabies.

The owner, of Tyler Court in Granite Quarry, told animal control his
female chihuahua mix fought with a raccoon. The owner said the dog
was not current on its vaccine.

The dog was temporarily held in quarantine at the county animal
shelter until notification of the test results. The raccoon was
submitted for rabies testing. The dog was euthanized per the owner's
request.

residents near Galilee Road in Smithfield.

A case of rabies was confirmed on Friday (15 Oct 2010) in a cat found
in the 2100 block of Galilee Road.

Animal Control officers are concerned about possible exposure of
unvaccinated animals, particularly pets in the area. Anyone who sees
an animal acting in an unusual manner is urged to call Johnston
County Animal Services at (919)934-8474.

Lab results have confirmed that a cat that bit a woman in Fort
Oglethorpe last week [5 Oct 2010] had the rabies virus.

Jon Klepper, environmental health manager with the Northwest Georgia
Public Health District, said lab results confirmed Friday [8 Oct
2010] that the half-grown kitten had the virus and animal control
officers are trying to find its litter mates to see if the other cats
are also rabid.

The woman who was bitten lived on Barnhardt Circle and Klepper urged
nearby residents to be sure their animals are up to date on vaccines
and to report any animals they notice behaving strangely.

The woman, who was bitten on [5 Oct 2010], has gotten a few shots in
the series of injections used to treat the virus and is expected to
be fine after completing treatment, he said.

"A lot of people would not have even thought to bring the cat in,"
Klepper said. "Had she not done that she might have been dead in a
month or 2." Last year [2009] authorities found a rabid bat and
raccoon in Catoosa County, but a cat with rabies has not been found
in the county since at least 2006.

<http://www.independentmail.com/news/2010/oct/12/attacks-rabid-animals-rise/>


While there has not been a problem with rabies cases this year [2010]
in Franklin or Hart counties, there has been a recent rash of rabid
skunk and raccoon attacks, according to Franklin County Environmental
Health manager Louis Korff. Korff said that last week [week of 4 Oct
2010] his office answered 3 calls from citizens regarding rabid
skunks that had bitten their pets.

"All of the sudden we've had this freakish rash of skunk attacks,"
Korff said. "Unfortunately 2 of the dogs were unvaccinated and they
were euthanized and one is under a 45-day quarantine. USD 5 for a
vaccination could have avoided this." The Northeast Georgia animal
shelter in Lavonia will be sponsoring another low-cost rabies clinic
Saturday [16 Oct 2010] at the shelter on Bear Creek Road. Horse
owners are also welcome to bring their horses, according to shelter
manager Sheri Lockhart. "We are allowing them to bring their horses
Saturday and park their trailers next to the shelter," she said. The
cost of the rabies vaccine is USD 5 for 1 year and USD 10 for a
3-year vaccine.

In Hart County, there has also been a spike of raccoon attacks
according Hart County Environmental Health manager David Laird.
"We've had 3 raccoons between 25 Aug 2010 and 10 Sep 2010 that tested
positive and we also had a cat that tested positive during that time,
which is very rare," Laird said. "Up until that time we had only had
one positive case in Hart County this year [2010]." The person who
found the cat on the side of the road, picked it up and it bit her.
The unidentified teen is now having the rabies series for humans, he
said.

"We just encourage folks to get their pets vaccinated. That's the
only way to minimize the issue," Larid said. "I'm thinking that the
dry weather is driving these animals out. And when you chain your dog
it can't run away from a rabid animal; it just doesn't have a chance,
so please, please get your animals vaccinated for rabies," Korff said.

This Saturday's [16 Oct 2010] rabies clinic takes place from 10 a.m.
to 2 p.m. at the shelter on Bear Creek Road.

An uptick in rabies cases and a recent Duval County case that exposed
6 people to the deadly virus have public health and animal
authorities calling for more awareness of the disease.

Rabies, which is most often transmitted by wild animals, especially
raccoons, is deadly for cats and dogs if they aren't vaccinated
against it. And where humans are exposed, an intensive post-exposure
prophylaxis regimen is required. Raccoons, as well as cats, foxes,
and bats, are the most common animals found to be rabid in Northeast
Florida. According to Florida Department of Health statistics, fewer
than a dozen confirmed cases of rabid animals typically are confirmed
in this region each year.

The alert issued this week is the 7th of the year for Duval County,
which, according to Florida Department of Health's surveillance
statistics, is the highest number of cases here since 2001. But
Hilton Manuel, an environmental specialist with the Duval County
Health Department, said he doesn't see it as a huge outbreak. There
have been years with 15 cases, he said. Still, the most recent case
is enough to give pause to many experts.

The animal, a house cat that was apparently outdoors only for a few
hours, contracted rabies because it wasn't immunized, Manuel said.
But the family who owned the cat did not know it was rabid until a
week after it started displaying neurological symptoms. Other
symptoms include hind leg paralysis, refusal to eat or drink and,
less commonly, foaming at the mouth. Rabies causes animals to go from
docile to extremely aggressive. [And even from energetic to lethargic
and docile - Mod.TG] "It's a very violent disease," he said.

By the time the family took the cat to a veterinarian, Manuel said,
it had bitten or scratched 6 people, including a young child. The cat
had not been vaccinated. Rabies vaccines are required for all cats
and dogs, both in Duval and surrounding counties.

Manuel said he is "pretty positive" the cat was bitten by a raccoon
while outdoors. Raccoons are a main rabies vector because they can
carry the virus without having signs, and nearly half test positive
for it, said Scott Trebatoski, chief of the city's Animal Care and
Protective Services. In other animals, rabies is nearly always fatal.
[Other infected animals eventually die of the disease. - Mod.TG]

The message, Trebatoski said, is this: Every pet needs to be
vaccinated against the threat of rabies.

A Windward Way man is undergoing treatment after being bitten on his
foot Wednesday (13 Oct 2010) by a suspected rabid fox. The man, who
was not identified, was standing in his driveway when he noticed the
small grey fox, according to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office.
The incident happened at about 11 a.m.

After biting the man's foot, the fox ran away. The man went to Twin
Cities Hospital for treatment. Foxes are cautious by nature and will
not typically confront a human in broad daylight.

The Oneida County Health Department reported Wednesday (13 Oct 2010),
a pitbull terrier in Rome was euthanized after it the showed signs
and signs of rabies. Last month [September 2010] the pitbull killed a
skunk, but because the dog consumed most of the skunk there was not
enough of the carcass left to test. [Interesting, it only takes the
brain to test for rabies, so one would guess the doge ate the head.
Most animals eat the intestines and the muscles, not the head. -
Mod.TG] The dog had not received a rabies vaccination, the Health
Department said.

The department states that last week [week of Oct 2010] the dog began
drooling excessively, refused food and water, and walked in circles
while in his cage. The pitbull was euthanized at the Rome Humane
Society. The health department reports 10 animals have tested
positives for rabies since 1 Jan 2010.

A 2nd rabid bat has been confirmed in the Forest of Friendswood
subdivision, according to the Friendswood Police Department. The bat
was reported to Friendswood Animal Control on Thu 7 Oct 2010. The bat
was submitted to the Texas Department of State Health Services the
same day. The health department reported test results on 8 Oct 2010.
The test results were positive for rabies.

The bat was found in a backyard in the 500 block of Twin Pines. The
location is near the 800 block of Hackberry where a confirmed rabid
bat was found on 27 Aug 2010. A dog belonging to the homeowner on
Twin Pines is being quarantined at home for 45 days as a precaution.
The dog is current on its shots, but did receive a booster this week.
It cannot be confirmed if the bat bit the dog.

Another bat found the week of 29 Aug 2010 was also submitted to the
state lab. That bat was too decomposed for testing.

The Texas Department of State Health Services website reports that
laboratory-confirmed rabies cases often peak in September and
October. According to the site, humans should not touch bats or any
other unfamiliar animal. If a bat is found, contact authorities so
that the bat may be taken to a lab and tested for rabies if needed.
The dead bats are tested if there is known or suspected contact with
animals or humans. Friendswood residents can call the animal control
office via the police department at 281-996-3300.

[11] Canine (coyote, dog) - Michigan
Date: Thu 14 Oct 2010
Source: Examiner.com [edited]
<http://www.examiner.com/dogs-in-national/dog-attacked-by-coyote-rabies-scare-dictates-long-quarantine>


A small dog was attacked in its own backyard on Tuesday morning [12
Oct 2010] by a coyote. On 3 Oct 2010, a Maltese was also attacked by
a coyote not far from Tuesday's attack. Officials believe that it is
the work of the same coyote.

The dog, a rat terrier, will have to be placed in quarantine at the
Oakland County Animal Shelter for a 6-month period because the owners
were not able to produce a certificate of rabies vaccination.

The extended stay at the animal shelter is expensive -- a whopping
USD 28/day. Over the course of 6 months, the owners will be facing a
bill in the thousands. Had the owners decided to skip the long
quarantine period, the dog would have to be euthanized.

Rabies is a required vaccine that is not to be skipped. The Troy
incident is a strong reminder of why it is dangerous (and potentially
expensive) to skip this vaccine. If your dog is attacked by a wild
animal and you can not provide proof of the dog's vaccination for
rabies, your dog will face euthanasia or a long period of quarantine.

If your dog inflicts a bite on a person or to another animal and you
can not provide proof of the rabies vaccination, not only will your
dog face a long quarantine or euthanasia, but a the bite victim will
also suffer.

People that may have been exposed to the rabies virus have to undergo
a series of painful shots. Dogs bitten by a suspected rabies carrier
have to be quarantined or euthanized.

Bottom line, dog owners must take precautions against the deadly
rabies virus. Dog owners can obtain a 1 year or 3 year rabies vaccine
for their dog. It is important to keep proof of the vaccination on
hand in the event of a bite incident. Simply put, the consequences of
skipping this vaccine are far too severe -- make sure that your dog
is up to date.
