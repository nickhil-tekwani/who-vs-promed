State health officials said tests show that raw goat milk from a
Longmont dairy is responsible for sickening 30 people, including 2
children who are in the hospital. Health officials said Thursday [8
Jul 2010] that samples of unpasteurized milk from the Billy Goat
Dairy tested positive for the strains of _Campylobacter_ and _E.
coli_ that have made the people sick.

On 29 Jun 2010, the Boulder County Department of Public Health
ordered the dairy to stop distributing milk to the 43 households that
buy a "share" of a goat for USD 40 a month in return for a gallon of
raw milk a week. Dairy operator Bill Campbell has been certified to
produce raw milk since January 2009. Campbell says he's working to
comply with department regulations.

Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment has isolated
_Campylobacter jejuni_ and _E. coli_ O157:H7 from the goats, the goat
milk and the patients involved. There are a few cases of co-infection
with both bacteria. Further tests, including PFGE, are pending.
