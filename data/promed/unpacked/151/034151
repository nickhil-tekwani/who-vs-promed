Investigations into cases of swan mortality in Iran
-----------------------------------------------------
Information received on 7 Feb 2006 from Dr Hossein Hassani, Head of
Iran Veterinary Organization (IVO), Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture,
Tehran:
Report date: 7 Feb 2006.
On 2 Feb 2006, within the framework of the Avian Influenza Passive
Surveillance Plan in place for wild birds in Gilan province, there
was a report describing a few mortalities among swans in 2 wetlands
(Selkeh and Espand). Immediately, all specific activities were
implemented according to OIE guidelines and recommendations, all of
the native birds in 6 villages considered as epidemiological units at
risk (within a 2-km radius) were destroyed and sampled and their
owners were compensated by IVO.
Sera were tested using haemagglutination inhibition (H5, H9 and
Newcastle disease) and tissue samples were tested by RT-PCR. All
results were negative.
Tissue samples taken from swans will be sent tomorrow morning to the
OIE Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle disease in
Padua, Italy, in order to perform some virological tests.

Croatia and Russia (Astrakhan region). Results of the laboratory
investigations at Weybridge and Padua are anticipated with concern. -

Farms in northern Nigeria are destroying thousands of chickens that
have died in the past few days as laboratories seek to determine the
cause of the deaths, authorities said on Tuesday.
Researchers at 2 laboratories testing samples from the dead poultry
said they could not yet say for sure why the birds died.
They are testing for bird flu, a strain of which has killed more than
70 people in Asia, and for a range of other poultry viruses such as
Newcastle disease.
"I believe between 10 000 and 15 000 poultry have been destroyed so
far," said Jide Coker, chief consultant epidemiologist at the Health
Ministry in the capital Abuja, adding that standard procedure was to
burn carcasses.
Authorities have sought to play down fears that the poultry deaths
could be Africa's first outbreak of avian influenza. Initial tests
found bacteria in the samples that could have contributed to the
birds' deaths, including _Escherichia coli_, better known as _E.coli_.
Newcastle disease is a highly contagious viral infection in poultry
for which there is no treatment. The virus causes, at worst, only
minor illnesses in humans. _E. coli_ is a type of normally harmless
bacteria that can cause serious diseases under certain conditions.
Poultry started dying in abnormally high numbers over the weekend at
the Sovat farm in Danbare village in the northern state of Kano.
Other farms in Kano and in neighbouring Kaduna state are also
affected.
The National Veterinary Research Institute in central Plateau state,
which is testing some of the samples, says it has capacity to
identify bird flu but not specific strains of that disease.
If test results, expected within the next few days, point towards
bird flu, the institute will send samples to a laboratory in the
Italian city of Padua that would be able to determine whether the
deadly H5N1 strain was present.
Many Africans live at close quarters with poultry, creating an ideal
environment for the virus to jump to humans.
Experts also say the continent is on the flight-path of migratory
birds thought to carry the disease.
