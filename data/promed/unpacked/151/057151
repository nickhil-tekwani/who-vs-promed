On 25 Aug 2016, State Veterinarian Jim Logan was notified by USDA APHIS that a Wyoming origin race horse had tested positive in California for equine piroplasmosis, a reportable horse disease. Subsequent testing of other horses in Wyoming that were associated with the positive animal has shown there are 13 additional infected horses involved that belong to one owner in Wyoming as well as another horse belonging to one owner from Utah.

Soon after receiving news of the infected horse in California, Dr. Logan, along with USDA APHIS and the Wyoming Pari-Mutuel Commission, were able to establish quarantine, testing and movement protocols on the associated horses in Wyoming. These animals are currently under quarantine at the owner's property.

"We are currently dealing with a horse disease in Wyoming that is specific to race track activities and is not a threat to the general equine population in the state," said Logan.

Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a parasitic infection of equidae that can be spread naturally to equids by ticks or by humans to equids through contaminated needles, syringes, and treatment/surgical equipment and products. The organism that causes the disease is a protozoa named _Theileria equi_ and another strain named _Babesia caballi_. Clinical signs of the disease are fever, anemia, anorexia, depression, and jaundice. Some infected animals may carry the disease without showing any clinical signs.

Horses affected with EP may be treated under quarantine at the owner's expense. This is an expensive and very time-consuming process that can take over 2 years. Other options include lifetime quarantine at a state-monitored location or euthanasia. Dr. Logan and veterinary staff are working with the owner to determine the future disposition of affected animals.

Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations prohibits the interstate movement of EP positive equines, but it does not restrict intra-state movement of exposed animals. Therefore, following consultation with the USDA APHIS Equine Epidemiologist, Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) veterinarians may allow permitted movement of test negative animals to other Wyoming race tracks this racing season.

"We are not concerned about horse to horse transmission of this disease," he said. "The transmission risk of concern is from human (trainer/owner) use of contaminated equipment or product among horses."

On the advice of Dr. Logan, the Wyoming Pari-Mutuel Commission has issued an order, which will go into effect on 8 Sep 2016, requiring all horses that enter a sanctioned race track in Wyoming to have a negative _Theileria equi_ cELISA test within 12 months prior to the event. Dr. Logan and USDA APHIS are currently working with Director Will Laegreid of the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) to enable the lab to conduct testing for EP. This is expected to take about 10 days.

Until WSVL is able to conduct EP testing, veterinarians asked to test horses pursuant to the Pari-Mutuel Commission order can send samples to Colorado State University Laboratory, National Veterinary Services Laboratories or other approved laboratories.

For more information on EP, please contact the Wyoming Livestock Board at 307-857-4140.

[Equine piroplasmosis is a tickborne protozoal infection of horses by _Babesia caballi_ or _Theileria equi_ (formerly _Babesia equi_) of the phylum Apicomplexa. The 2 organisms may infect an animal concurrently.

Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range from acute fever, inappetence [lack of appetite], and malaise, to anemia and jaundice, sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. The disease may be fatal in up to 20 per cent of previously unexposed animals. The tick vectors exist in the United States, and epidemics of piroplasmosis were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The incubation period for _T. equi_ infections is 12 to 19 days, and infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10 to 30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often nonspecific.

In acute cases, the animal is usually emaciated, jaundiced, and anemic. The liver is typically enlarged and dark orange-brown. The spleen is enlarged, and the kidneys are pale and flabby. Petechial hemorrhages may be seen in the kidneys, and subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages in the heart. There may also be edema in the lungs and signs of pneumonia. In chronic cases, common symptoms include mild anorexia, poor exercise tolerance, weight loss, transient fevers, and an enlarged spleen (palpable on rectal examination). Foals infected in utero are usually weak at birth, and rapidly develop anemia and severe jaundice.

The differential diagnosis for piroplasmosis includes surra, equine infectious anemia, dourine, African horse sickness, purpura hemorrhagica, and various plant and chemical toxicities.

Equine piroplasmosis can be diagnosed by identification of the organisms in Giemsa stained blood or organ smears. _B. caballi_ merozoites are joined at their posterior ends, while _T. equi_ merozoites are often connected in a tetrad or "Maltese cross." Organisms can often be found in acute infections, but may be very difficult to find in carrier animals. In carriers, thick blood films can sometimes be helpful.

Because babesia organisms can be difficult to detect in carriers, serology is often the diagnostic method of choice. Serologic tests include complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The IFA test can distinguish between _T. equi_ and _B. caballi_.

Other methods of diagnosis include DNA probes, in vitro culture, and the inoculation of a susceptible (preferably splenectomized) animal with blood from a suspected carrier. In addition, pathogen-free vector ticks can be fed on a suspect animal, and babesia identified either in the tick or after the tick has transmitted the infection to a susceptible animal.

Disinfectants and sanitation are not generally effective against the spread of tickborne infections. However, preventing the transfer of blood from one animal to another is vital.
