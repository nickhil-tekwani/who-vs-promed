Seaweed farming faces [a] dilemma with ice-ice disease. The Philippines is known to have more than 800 species of seaweeds, 2 of which are used in farms to extract carrageenan, a food enhancer. These are _Eucheuma_ and _Kappaphycus_, a source of livelihood for Filipinos in coastal areas. However, farmers are shying away because of lower yield caused mostly by the ice-ice disease.

Only a small number of researchers in the world have sought to study the disease and how seaweeds can resist it. When seaweeds are stressed because of a change in climate conditions, it causes them to produce a substance that attracts bacteria in the water and induces the hardening of the seaweed tissues, therefore, turning them white.

According to Dr Danilo Largo, University of San Carlos in Cebu City, there are 2 main causes of ice-ice disease: unfavorable conditions, caused by high water temperatures, high light intensity or irradiance, slow water movement and salinity; [and] opportunistic microorganisms that thrive when seaweed's resistance is at its weakest. "Bacteria can be abundant when seaweeds are stressed," he said. "We need to have a deeper understanding of the disease."

According to [the] Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, the attack of the ice-ice disease has caused deterioration of seaweed plants and decrease in yield. "In normal growing periods, there is a 70 percent harvest of healthy seaweeds, but when there is ice-ice disease outbreak, we are lucky to get around 40 percent," [they] said. The Seaweed Industry Association suggested to do research on new strains of seaweeds resistant to this disease [and] to look into the way farmers plant seaweeds.

[Seaweeds can be affected by viruses, bacteria, parasitic algae, and fungal infections (for example _Pythium_, _Petersenia_, and _Phycomelaina_ species). Little is known about their diseases, but in recent years the bleaching disease ice-ice (or ais-ais; see also ProMED-mail post 20090309.0978), sometimes likened to coral bleaching, has been reported from several areas.

It is thought that a number of bacterial species that were previously known either as benign environmental epiphytes or at least species that are normally not pathogenic on seaweeds (for example _Alteromonas_, _Aquimarina_, _Agarivorans_, _Bacillus_, _Pseudomonas_; see links below) can become opportunistic pathogens in modified environmental conditions. Physiological stress due to changes in salinity, ocean temperatures, and light intensity results in weakening of hosts. This may make the plants susceptible to the microorganisms which then affect the chloroplasts in epidermal cells and so turn parts of the plants white. Furthermore, bacterial growth may also be facilitated by compounds excreted by the plants as a stress response.

Seaweed species are used in many maritime countries as a source of food, for industrial applications, and as a fertiliser. The major utilisation of these plants (for example, _Porphyra_ and _Chondrus_ species) as food is in Asia where seaweed cultivation has become an important industry in some areas. Seaweeds, both farmed and collected from the wild, can form an important part of the diet in tropical coastal communities and are eaten cooked as vegetables, fresh as salad components, or dried and ground to a meal.
