A synthetic marijuana outbreak in Central New York that has led to a rash of hospitalizations is showing no signs of letting up.

Since [1 Apr 2015], the Upstate Poison Control Center has received reports of 179 people -- most of them in Onondaga County -- who received hospital care after using the illicit drug. There have been 11 cases since [1 May 2015].

Poison control centers nationwide have reported 2576 cases through 4 May 2015.

"My staff says all they are doing is taking calls about synthetic marijuana," said Michelle Caliva, the center's director.

Users of synthetic marijuana, often called "spice" or "spike," are experiencing seizures, hallucinations, extreme agitation and violent behavior, elevated heart rates, and high blood pressure. Some arrive at emergency rooms comatose. Caliva said most of the cases in New York are clustered in Onondaga County and New York City.

There have been no deaths reported in Central New York. But the drug has been linked to several recent deaths in Pennsylvania, Alabama, and other states.

Synthetic marijuana has been around since 2009, but the adverse effects users are experiencing in the latest outbreak are different. Officials suspect the chemical composition of the drug has changed. Caliva said the Upstate Poison Control Center has sent out samples of the drug for analysis and is awaiting results.

Synthetic pot often contains dried, shredded plant material, and chemical additives that are responsible for its mind-altering effects, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

[These types of synthetic drug poisonings are becoming more common. People seem to want a "high" or find the taste appealing, but these synthetic drugs are extremely dangerous, perhaps more than the natural or non-synthetic versions.
