The health authorities of Honduras strengthened sanitary surveillance in
the occidental region, bordering with El Salvador, after a child died of
rabies in the border area, official sources informed this agency Tuesday.
The child had been bitten by a bat six months ago, but his parents did not
pay attention to the case and he developed rabies which was the cause of
his death, said the Vice Minister of Population Risks, Ellieth Giron.
As as result of this incident, the Minister of Health instructed all health
personnel to strengthen epidemiologic surveillance in the border
departments, in order to prevent new cases.
