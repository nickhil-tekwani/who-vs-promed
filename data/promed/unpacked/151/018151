[In October 2021, Sweden reported one outbreak of Newcastle disease (NCD). A summary of this event, including control measures applied, is available in a PowerPoint report presented in November 2021 at the ScoPAFF [Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food, and Feed] meeting to the European Commission (see https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2021-12/reg-com_ahw_20211116_nd-swe.pdf).

"Sweden has for many years applied a strict non-vaccination policy as regards NCD; Sweden also has the status as a non-vaccinating country as regards ND according to EU legislation.
