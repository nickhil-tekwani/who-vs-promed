The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Agency (APHIS) has reported the Miami Animal Import Center will be temporarily closed to new arrivals of horses beginning on [Sat 19 Jan 2019] in response to illness in a handful of horses quarantined at the facility.

APHIS is investigating to determine the specific cause of illness, but salmonella is suspected, and the facility is stepping up biosecurity and taking additional precautions to prevent any further disease spread. The temporary closure is effective on Sat 19 Jan 2019.

APHIS is conducting environmental testing at the facility, and the samples will be sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for diagnostic testing.

To date, 6 horses have fallen ill with signs, such as diarrhea, fever, and lameness. Despite receiving immediate medical treatment, 3 of the horses have died. The other 3 horses are recovering. APHIS will share more information once it is available.

[Salmonellosis is one of the most commonly diagnosed infectious causes of diarrhea in adult horses. Clinical manifestations range from no abnormal clinical signs (subclinical carrier) to acute, severe diarrhea and even death (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/digestive-system/intestinal-diseases-in-horses-and-foals/salmonellosis-in-horses?). In this report, 3 animals have already died.

The most virulent _Salmonella_ serovars in horses belong to serogroup B, which includes _S. typhimurium_ and _S. agona_. Serogroups C and E include also several species that will cause clinical disease in horses.

Owners should be made aware of the zoonotic risk of _Salmonella_ spp infection. Hopefully all caretakers in the facility have been made aware of the risk and are exercising strict hygiene methods.

This outbreak could affect any other animals due to arrive at the import location. Owners looking to import horses coming through the Miami, Florida, location should inquire in advance of shipping an animal. - Mod.TG]
