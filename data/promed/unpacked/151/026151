The Joint Director of Health Services in Dibrugarh district, Dr Udayan Kumar Baruah on Thursday [28 Jun 2018] claimed that there are only 2 villages which are highly Japanese encephalitis (JE) sensitive.

"We want to clarify that in Dibrugarh, only 2 villages are highly JE sensitive. So far, 35 cases of Japanese encephalitis have been reported from Dibrugarh district, and only 4 persons died of JE," said Dr Baruah.

He also said that from January this year [2018], they have detected 84 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and the deaths of 13 people.

"We are doing fogging where the JE cases have mostly been detected. Fogging is very costly, and fogging cannot fully control JE. People should keep their houses clean. We are conducting awareness camps on JE to control the disease. Vector-borne diseases take place during monsoon, so everybody should keep their surroundings clean," the Joint Director of Health Services said.

Dr Baruah added that they are taking all precautionary measures to control JE by conducting awareness camps at the village level. "We are doing fogging in block levels. Every year, the highest cases of JE are reported from Naharoni," Dr Baruah said.

[The number of AES and Japanese encephalitis cases is increasing in Assam during this monsoon season. Both JE and AES cases are reported in northeastern India, including Assam state every year. As is often the case, a minority of AES cases are due to JEV infections. The etiology of AES has been unclear but debated in the past decade. It is odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination in the report above, which would be more effective at preventing JE cases than fogging of residences. The _Culex_ mosquitoes that transmit JE virus breed in extensive wetlands including rice paddies.

As noted previously, a recent publication of investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 AES outbreaks indicated that scrub typhus, caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, was the etiology in about 60 percent of those AES cases. In the report above, there is no mention of scrub typhus.

As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption and scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_). One hopes that the prospective studies on collaboration with the USA CDC as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children progresses will provide additional information about the etiology of AES. The JE and AES season is now underway in northeastern India, and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018).
