Republic of the Congo: Officials Confirm Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials on Fri 14 Nov 2003 confirmed Ebola hemorrhagic fever as
the cause of 11 deaths in the northern forests, signaling the Republic of
Congo's second outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever this year. Blood
specimens from corpses suspected to have been infected with Ebola virus
have tested positive, national public health chief Damase Bozongo said. "We
can now affirm that Ebola [virus is the cause of the outbreak]," he told
reporters. A World Health Organization spokesman, Boniface Bibousse, also
verified the [cause of the] outbreak in the Cuvette West region, saying
that WHO was sending 2 epidemiologists to the area on Sat 15 Nov 2003.

First reports from the remote northern region emerged 31 Oct 2003. Ebola
hemorrhagic fever, one of the world's deadliest viral diseases, causes
rapid death through massive blood loss in up to 90 percent of those
infected. In June 2003, Republic of Congo health authorities announced the
end of an Ebola epidemic that killed over 120 people in the same Cuvette
West region. That epidemic -- believed to have been started by contact with
infected gorilla flesh, which is eaten in parts of sub-Saharan Africa ---
broke out in January [2003].

The WHO says Ebola hemorrhagic fever has killed more than 1000 people since
the virus was first identified in 1976 in western Sudan and in [the
Democratic Republic of the Congo] this country's larger, eastern neighbor.
