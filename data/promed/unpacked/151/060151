[Swine vesicular disease (SVD) is a contagious disease of pigs,
caused by an enterovirus and characterised by vesicles on the
coronary bands, heels of the feet, and occasionally on the lips,
tongue, snout, and teats. Strains of SVD virus vary in virulence, and
the disease may be subclinical, mild, or severe, the latter usually
only being seen when pigs are housed on abrasive floors in damp
conditions. The main importance of SVD is that it is clinically
indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), and any
outbreaks of vesicular disease in pigs must be assumed to be FMD
until investigated by laboratory tests and proven otherwise.
SVD has been eradicated from most European countries; according to
OIE's (World Animal Health Organization) most recent available data,
during 2005 the disease was only reported in Italy, namely in Abruzzo
(4), Calabria (5), Campania (3), and Sicilia (1), totalling 13
outbreaks (all affected and contact/suspected animals were reportedly
culled). In 2004, SVD was reported to OIE from Portugal as well. The
disease is still present in Far East countries.
According to the EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS),
table 11: Animal Disease Situation per Country and per Disease, 51
outbreaks of SVD were reported from Italy throughout 2006, none from
any other EU country, including Portugal. During 2007 (1 Jan - 20 Apr
2007), 53 outbreaks have already been reported from Italy, none from
Portugal or any other EU country; see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/table_11_2007/adns_200407_en.pdf>.
SVD virus has been classified as a pig enterovirus, in the family
_Picornaviridae_. Antigenically it is related to the human virus
coxsackievirus B5. There are reports of seroconversion to SVD virus
in laboratory workers handling the agent. Clinical disease was
reported to be mild with the exception of a single case of meningitis
associated with SVD virus infection. However, there have been no
reported cases of seroconversion or disease in farmers or
veterinarians working with infected pigs. Under experimental
conditions, it has not been possible to show transmission of
coxsackievirus B5 between pigs. - Mod.AS]
