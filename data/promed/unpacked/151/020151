The Junagadh district administration on [Mon 5 Feb 2018] restricted movement of all kinds of equine animals (belonging to the horse family) including horses, donkeys and mules, following detection of fatal glanders disease in Jamalvadi area of the district.

The notification of restriction was issued under the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Disease in Animal Act, 2009. According to an official statement by the Junagadh district administration, legal action will be taken against those animal owners who violate this notification.

Junagadh's veterinary doctor Hemal Gujarati told TOI, "We found this disease in the horses brought from north India. Last year [2017], we found 2 infected horses which were brought from north India."

The disease is commonly contracted by consuming food or water contaminated by the nasal discharge of carrier animals. After an incubation period of about 2 weeks, affected animals usually have blood infection and high fever. A thick nasal discharge is seen and the animal has trouble breathing and develops other respiratory problems. Death occurs within a few days of infection.

The disease is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. Glanders can cause ulcers in the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and skin of the animal. Humans and other animals are also susceptible to the infection.

The statement further said that officials of the animal husbandry department have started inspection of houses and are sending blood samples to laboratories for testing.

In July 2016, as many as 40 equines including over a dozen horses and mules, across the state, were put to sleep after they were found infected with this highly contagious and fatal disease found in the horse family.

There are around 18 500 horses and ponies besides over 40 000 mules and donkeys in Gujarat, according to the state animal husbandry department.

[India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equid disease, is endemic. According to the OIE records, the annual, countrywide numbers of reported glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide in India were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5; 2016 - 22. India's OIE annual report for 2017 is not yet available.

No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy." Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref. 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref. 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available; however, prior use of _B. mallei_ as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed _B. mallei_ as a biodefense concern. This encouraged, in the past, studies addressing the development of a human vaccine (ref. 2).
