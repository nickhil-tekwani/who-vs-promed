50 cattle died in Panuco because of rengue and paleta diseases.

Mr. Jaime Vega-Gomez, President of the Regional Farmer's Committee
reported this occurrence took place mainly in Nuevo Panuco, Aquiles
Serdan, and Jaboncillo communities.

He assured that "these viruses are now under control," after cattle
breeders had their animals vaccinated; however, he recognized this
outbreak occurred because of lack of a prevention attitude.

Mr. Vega-Gomez emphasized that "the problem is already under control,
there are many factors causing this situation, particularly in
Chicayan, where many rural communities are located."

He said farmers had been given free advice in order to prevent cattle
dying from rengue and paleta diseases, 2 conditions that affect
different organs of these animals.

Rengue disease is defined as a condition in which cattle lose
strength in their hip joints and their are not capable of standing;
while paleta disease affects their muscles and may lead to liver,
brain or other organs damage; once the animals become infected,
recovery is a very rare occurrence, so animals must be terminated and
incinerated, since eating their meat may have deleterious consequences
for people.

"At least we are certain that these viruses are controlled;
nonetheless, the drought season currently in place may also cause
mortality in cattle, because of lack of pasture," said Mr.
Vega-Gomez.

[This disease is most likely a virus, [we cannot find reference to or
cause of the disease despite extensive search - Mod.DK] but the
drought in parts of Mexico has prevented the grasses from growing. The
pastures are consequently over-grazed and the animals are hungry. This
causes the animals to be in a weakened state immunologically and more
susceptible to a virus. - Mod.TG]
