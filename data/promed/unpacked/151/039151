Days after a foodborne illness was linked to Blue Bell ice cream products, a state inspection of an Oklahoma plant later tied to the infection praised the facility for having no violations and doing a "great job," according to a copy of the inspection report.

Inspectors had no reason to check for _Listeria_ during the routine 18 Mar [2015] review as no problems were detected and the facility didn't have a history of issues linked to the illness, said Stan Stromberg, director of the food safety division for the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. "With an organism like _Listeria_, you cannot do a visual inspection," Stromberg said on Thursday [9 Apr 2015].

Tainted Blue Bell ice cream products have sickened 8 people -- 5 in Kansas and 3 in Texas. 3 of the 5 in Kansas have died and health officials there say listeriosis [the illness caused by _Listeria_] might have been a contributing factor in the deaths.

Blue Bell has temporarily closed its facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and shut down a production line at its facility in Brenham, Texas, where the company is headquartered. Blue Bell has also recalled more than 25 of its products since last month [March 2015].

In the one-page report about the Oklahoma plant, provided to The Associated Press in response to an open records request, an inspector wrote "No Violations Observed!" and "Keep it up!" At the time of the inspection, _Listeria_ had only been traced to Blue Bell's Brenham facility. Blue Bell issued its 1st recall on 13 Mar [2015]. Stromberg said Oklahoma officials didn't learn until 22 Mar [2015] that _Listeria_ was connected to a product produced by the Oklahoma plant.

Stromberg said his agency has been at the plant ever since, working with the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies to determine a cause of the _Listeria_. "Once you identify where it is, _Listeria_ is relatively easy to control. But it's going to be like looking for a needle in a haystack," he said.

Officials in Washington [State] can attest to the difficulty of tracking down _Listeria_ at a plant. At least 2 people became ill after the _Listeria_ was detected in products manufactured by Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream. The company responded by issuing a recall in December [2014]. It addressed health safety concerns and was given approval to resume operations a month later.

"You may just be working to keep your plant really, really clean, but you also need to work to keep it in good repair because that organism can slide into a crack on the door, or get into the crack where the wall and floor meet," said Lucy Severs, food safety manager for the Department of Agriculture in Washington.

Stromberg said he didn't believe there was any sort of breakdown in the inspection process in Oklahoma, as officials don't normally submit samples for laboratory testing as a part of routine reviews, unless there were problems such as with cleanliness. No such problems were detected in the 18 Mar [2015] inspection, which is one of 8 to 10 done each year at the plant.

Before the recall, the facility in Brenham had last been fully inspected in February [2015] and the Texas Department of State Health Services had found a couple of minor issues. The Brenham facility is inspected monthly.

"Over the years, Blue Bell has had a good inspection record and very few issues, none leading to any enforcement issue (i.e. penalty)," agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams wrote in an email.

In a statement Thursday [9 Apr 2015], Blue Bell said, "the fact that our products may be linked to these events is very distressing to us. We are sorry for this news and we are doing everything possible to determine the cause of the outbreak."

Listeriosis is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called _Listeria monocytogenes_, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. The disease primarily affects pregnant women and their newborns, older adults, and people with immune systems weakened by cancer, cancer treatments, or other serious conditions.

The CDC said Thursday preliminary tests indicate another 3 people hospitalized at some point from 2010 to 2012 appear to have a similar strain of _Listeria_ as the others, but further testing is necessary before confirming a connection.

According to an update Wednesday night [8 Apr 2015] from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been 8 people sickened by strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ linked to Blue Bell Creameries products in Kansas and Texas.

The outbreak now consists of 2 clusters of illnesses that are likely linked to Blue Bell brand ice cream.

Blue Bell Creameries Cluster 1 consists of 5 patients reported from Kansas during January 2014 through January 2015 who were all hospitalized at a single hospital for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis. Of the 4 ill people for whom information is available on the foods eaten in the month before _Listeria_ infection, all consumed milkshakes made at the hospital with a Blue Bell brand ice cream product called "Scoops."

Whole genome sequences of _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains isolated from 4 of the patients were found to be highly related to sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from "Scoops" and 2 other products made on the same line at the company's Texas facility. These products were recalled by Blue Bell Creameries on 13 Mar 2015.

Cluster 2 consists of 3 patients reported from Texas between 2011 and 2014 who were all hospitalized for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis. Whole genome sequences of their _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains were highly related to sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from another Blue Bell ice cream product -- 3-oz. institutional/food service chocolate ice cream cups made at the company's Oklahoma production facility. The cup products were recalled by Blue Bell Creameries on 23 Mar 2015.

3 additional patients with listeriosis during 2010 through 2012 whose isolates have PFGE patterns similar to those of others in the cluster have been identified in the PulseNet database. Further testing is underway to determine whether these illnesses may be related to this outbreak. Results of this testing will be reported once they are available.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains from a 1-pint container of Blue Bell brand banana pudding ice cream collected from the company's Oklahoma production facility. This contaminated product was produced in the same facility but on a different line from the 3-oz. institutional/food service ice cream cups previously recalled.

On 3 Apr 2015, Blue Bell Creameries reported that they had voluntarily suspended operations at their Oklahoma production facility.

On 7 Apr 2015, Blue Bell Creameries announced a 3rd product recall that included banana pudding ice cream pints and other products made on the same line that were produced between 12 Feb 2015, and 27 Mar 2015, at their Oklahoma facility.

Further testing of environmental and product samples from Blue Bell Creamery facilities is ongoing.

CDC recommends that consumers do not eat any recalled products or Blue Bell brand products made at the Oklahoma production facility and that retailers and institutions not sell or serve them. This advice is particularly important for consumers at higher risk for listeriosis, including pregnant women, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems.

State and local health officials, CDC and FDA continue to work closely on the investigation.

[ProMED-mail previously reported that listeriosis in 5 Kansans (3 of whom died), who had developed this infection while hospitalized, was traced to eating _Listeria_-contaminated ice cream manufactured by a Blue Bell Creameries facility in Brentham, Texas (Listeriosis - USA (04): (KS) fatal, nosocomial, ice cream 20150315.3231917). All consumed milkshakes made at the hospital with a Blue Bell brand ice cream product called "Scoops" (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/ice-cream-03-15/).

The above news reports add 3 additional people from Texas who developed listeriosis linked by genotyping to _Listeria_-contaminated Blue Bell ice cream products between 2011 and 2014, made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma production facility. This brings the total number of listeriosis cases linked by genotyping to Blue Bell to 8. The 2nd news report above says that these 3 additional cases from Texas also developed their infection while hospitalized, like the 5 from Kansas. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease caused by _Listeria_.
