Lyme disease takes wing on its spread inland
------------------------
When the red, red robin comes bob, bob, bobbin' along, it may be
throwing off ticks infected with Lyme disease. You may be just
walking in your yard when a tick hops on you and bites.

Robins, blue jays, thrushes, wrens, and other common birds can be
Yale of the disease, according to researchers at the Yale University
School of Public Health in New Haven.

That may help explain the spread of Lyme disease north from the
Connecticut coast to the state's interior, as well as to other states
in New England.

It's further proof -- if more is needed -- that blame for spreading
Lyme disease can't be pigeon-holed to 1 or 2 species.

"Robins are capable of transmitting the disease," said Robert
Brinkerhoff, a post-doctoral student at the School of Public Health
and lead author of a paper on the bird/Lyme connection published in
the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.

"It makes total sense," Maggie Shaw of the Newtown Tick-Borne Disease
Task Force said Monday [28 Dec 2009]. "Birds, coyotes, deer, bear may
all carry Lyme disease."

However, Shaw said she believes one species -- white-tailed deer --
is most responsible for the perpetuation of Lyme disease. "It's
because of the numbers of ticks they carry," Shaw said of deer, which
can each carry dozens of ticks at a time.

Black-legged ticks are the insects [Ticks belong to the class
Arachnida, not Insecta] most responsible for spreading the bacteria
that causes Lyme disease. In their 3 stages of life -- larval,
nymphal, and adult -- these ticks must have a blood meal.

It's long been known that white-footed mice are the ubiquitous
reservoirs of the Lyme bacteria in nature. When newly hatched ticks
feed on mice, the ticks become infected with the bacteria. When the
ticks then bite humans for another feeding, the humans are infected.

Deer are especially available for the 3rd blood meal that ticks must
have in the fall to survive and breed.

But Brinkerhoff of Yale said deer don't spread Lyme disease to ticks,
and neither deer nor white-footed mice are long-distance travelers.

The researchers at Yale, looking at records and research done in the
past, found at least 70 common species of birds that can carry the
bacteria, Brinkerhoff said.

Therefore, he said, the Yale research suggests that birds can carry
the ticks -- especially larval ticks -- with them as they fly. If the
bird is infected with the Lyme bacteria, the bird's blood can spread
the bacteria to the ticks.

Kirby Stafford, an entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station in New Haven, said the station did some of the 1st
Lyme/bird research several years ago. He said when songbirds migrate
north, they're more likely to pick up tiny larval and nymphal ticks,
carrying them along for a ride. "Certain birds are reservoirs," he
said. "Certain birds aren't."

Shaw said along with research on how Lyme disease spreads, she'd like
the state Department of Public Health to spend money to teach people
how to avoid tick-borne infection. "There is no statewide program in
place for disease prevention," she said. "To me, that's incredible."

[Lyme disease is spread by more than birds. Our society is a very
mobile society and one that travels with its pets. Pets are not the
only ones capable of transporting the disease as well as its vector,
the tick. Ticks will happily hitch a ride on any warm blooded host,
including human beings.

Furthermore Lyme has been widespread in the United States for several
decades. Lyme Disease has been documented in nearly every country in
the world. While the disease was only officially named in 1987, it
has been around, the symptoms recognized for hundreds of years prior
to the naming of the disease.

Lyme disease, or borreliosis, is an emerging infectious disease
caused by at least 3 species of bacteria belonging to the genus
_Borrelia_. _Borrelia burgdorferi_ Sensu Lato (2) is the main cause
of Lyme disease in the United States, whereas _Borrelia afzelii_ and
_Borrelia garinii_ cause most European cases. The disease is named
after the village of Lyme, Connecticut, where a number of cases were
identified in 1975. Although Allen Steere realized in 1978 that Lyme
disease was a tick-borne disease, the cause of the disease remained a
mystery until 1982, when _B. burgdorferi_ was identified by Willy
Burgdorfer.

Lyme disease is classified as a zoonosis, as it is transmitted to
humans from a natural reservoir among rodents by ticks that feed on
both sets of hosts (3). Hard-bodied ticks of the genus _Ixodes_ are
the main vectors of Lyme disease (1). Most infections are caused by
ticks in the nymphal stage, as they are very small and may feed for
long periods of time undetected (3). Larval ticks are very rarely
infected (4). Tick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size
of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that
prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite.
However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1 percent of
recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease; this may be due to
the fact that an infected tick must be attached for at least a day
for transmission to occur (5).

In Europe the vector is _Ixodes ricinus_, which is also called the
sheep tick or castor bean tick (6). In China _Ixodes persulcatus_
(the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector (7). In North
America, the black-legged tick or deer tick _(Ixodes scapularis_) is
the main vector on the east coast (4). The lone star tick (_Amblyomma
americanum_), which is found throughout the Southeastern United
States as far west as Texas, is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease
spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (8), though it may be implicated in
a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness,
which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease (9). On the West Coast of
the United States, the main vector is the western black-legged tick
(_Ixodes pacificus_) (10). The tendency of this tick species to feed
predominantly on host species such as lizards that are resistant to
Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease
in the West (11, 12).

While Lyme spirochetes have been found in insects as well as ticks
(13) reports of actual infectious transmission appear to be rare (14)
Lyme spirochetes have been found in semen (15) and breast milk (16),
however transmission of the spirochete by these routes is not known
to occur (17). Congenital transmission of Lyme disease can occur from
an infected mother to fetus through the placenta during pregnancy.
The risk for fetal harm is much higher in the 1st 3 months of
pregnancy than later. Prompt antibiotic treatment almost always
prevents fetal harm. Pregnant Lyme-disease patients cannot be treated
with the 1st-choice antibiotic, doxycycline as it is potentially
harmful for the fetus. Instead, erythromycin is usually given; it is
less effective against the disease but harmless for the fetus (18).
