About 100 people in Bandarlampung have been
affected by an outbreak of chikungunya, a usually
non-fatal [see comment below] viral fever spread
by mosquitoes. The outbreak has been centered in
the village of Langkapura in Kemiling district.
Most of those infected have not sought medical
treatment because they cannot afford to go to a
community health center or see a doctor.
Chikungunya, which is similar to dengue fever, is
characterized by high fever and severe joint
pain, or arthralgia, that can last for up to a
week. The virus that causes the disease is spread
though the bite of either the _Aedes africanus_
or the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito, which also can carry dengue fever virus.
A 30-year-old female resident of Langkapura
village, said she had suffered high fever and
joint pain for the last 10 days. "The doctors
said I have chikungunya. The sad thing is that my
husband and child are also infected ... my child even fell unconscious."
Nurdin, head of a neighborhood unit in the
village, said the chikungunya outbreak started
last month [April 2007]. "Initially, only dozens
of residents were infected, now that number has
jumped to about 100. Nurdin asked the
Bandarlampung authorities for help in dealing
with the outbreak. "Many of the sufferers are
already better, but the number of new infections
is still on the rise," Nurdin said.
He said authorities had only fumigated the
village once to kill the mosquitoes. "We want
more fumigation." Nuryahman, who staffs a mobile
community health unit, said he had taken blood
samples from 12 people and sent the samples to
the laboratory of the Health Research and Study
Agency in Jakarta. "However, we have not yet
received the results (of the lab tests)."
Bandarlampung Health Office head Reihana said
Langkapura was particularly vulnerable to
chikungunya outbreaks because of the poor
sanitation in the village. He also said much of
the village was filled with bushes and
water-filled potholes. "Such conditions are ideal for the mosquitoes to breed."
Chikungunya was 1st recognized in epidemic form
in east Africa in 1952 and has continued to cause
major epidemics in Africa, India and Southeast
Asia. Its name comes from the Swahili word
"chikungunya," which means "that which bends up,"
referring to the contorted posture of patients
afflicted with the disease as a result of the
severe joint pain. In Indonesia, the disease was
1st reported in 1973 in Samarinda, East
Kalimantan. The latest outbreak of chikungunya
was in 2002 in Bekasi, West Java and Purworejo and Klaten in Central Java.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[Contrary to a previous statement by a
ProMED-mail Moderator, Dr. C. J. Petershas
(University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, TX
77550-0609 <cjpeters@utmb.edu>) has queried
whether there are any documented instances of
death from chikungunya virus at all, anywhere. "I
suppose any febrile illness could knock a very
compromised person off his perch, but I haven't
even seen that documented." Clarification is sought.- Mod.CP]
[This question is addressed in a recent review
(Lancet Infectious Diseases 2007
May;7(5):319-27.) "As recently discussed by
Stephen Higgs, by the summer of 2006 some 155
deaths might have been directly or indirectly
caused by the disease in the ongoing R�ion
outbreak. By March 14, 2006, the French health
authorities had collated 96 serologically
documented cases in R�ion residents who
required intensive care; 79 of these patients
were adults, and the male/female sex ratio was
1:4. 228 patients with a mean age of 78 years
died. The possible link between chikungunya virus
infection and multiorgan failure is under
investigation. The maximum estimated incidence of
severe chikungunya virus infection is 34 cases
per 200 000 population (less than 0.02%). The
reasons why these severe clinical manifestations
of chikungunya had not previously been described
are unclear. It may be noteworthy, however, that
this is the first time that chikungunya has
occurred in a country largely free of other
tropical diseases (except for dengue) and that has European health standards."
There is clearly excess mortality associated with
chikungunya outbreaks, some of which is in the
elderly, and there is evidence for severe disease
as an unusual manifestation. Well documented and
often severe neonatal infection was also seen for
the first time in R�ion in babies born to infected women. - Mod.LM]
