Contaminated Drinking Water Sickens More Than 1000 in Ecuador City
-------------------------------------
QUITO, Ecuador (AP) - One child has died and more than 1000 people have
fallen ill in an Ecuadorean city after drinking water was contaminated
by cow manure from farm runoff.
Nearly 1200 people in the city of Ibarra, 50 miles north of Quito, have
been treated for diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration, Ibarra hospital
director Jose Albuja said Saturday, 9 Oct 2002.
The medical emergency began Thursday, 7 Oct, when more than 500 people
were hospitalized and a 2-year-old died from a severe bacterial infection.
Hospital official Patricio Nieto said _E. coli_ bacteria was responsible for
the sickness.
The water was contaminated when water tainted with cow manure penetrated
a broken drinking water pipeline, said Luis Enriquez, director of the
state water utility. Ibarra Mayor Mauricio Larrea declared a sanitary
emergency in the city Thursday and officials have shut down the water supply
to clean it.

The cholera outbreak in Kasai Oriental Province in the south of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to worsen, with a total
of 672 people affected by the epidemic, which broke out on 19 Sep 2002,
according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies.
Within a 7 day period alone, 222 cholera cases - representing an
increase of 33 percent - were reported with 10 more deaths within that
week, the number rose to 50, representing an increase of 20 percent, the
Federation said on Tuesday, 5 Nov.
Health authorities had said this trend was continuing, particularly in
the city of Mbuji-Mayi and the villages of Bakamba, Kamaleka, Kambanga
and Tshilunde, the Federation reported, while government health officials had
said that the true total number of cases and deaths might never be established
due to problems affecting access, communications and cultural traditions.
"The situation will certainly be exacerbated by the rainy season, which
has just started," the Federation said. "Urgent actions may be required
from local authorities and humanitarian agencies if the situation
deteriorates further."
A crisis committee called stop cholera was convening regular meetings to
coordinate the activities of the different agencies, including the
provincial DRC Red Cross committee, and international relief NGOs such
as the Belgian sections of Medecins Sans Frontieres and Memisa, as well
as Caritas, Catholic Relief Services, and Health Net. Should the
situation deteriorate further, the Federation said it would consider
issuing an international appeal.

Nigeria: Cholera Outbreak Responsible for 10 Deaths
--------------------------------------------------------
LAGOS (Reuters) - At least 10 people have died from a cholera outbreak
in a village in the northeastern Nigerian state of Taraba, officials said
on Thursday, 7 Nov 2002.
Regional authorities said the outbreak in Mayo-Lope village in Lau local
government area of Taraba, had spilled over from neighboring villages in
Adamawa state, where scores of people had earlier reportedly died of the
waterborne infection.
"10 people have been killed since the cholera outbreak was reported on
Sunday, 3 Nov, 7 of them died on the first day," Taraba state government
spokesman Aaron Artimas told Reuters. He said drugs and medical personnel had
been dispatched to the area to help contain the situation, while efforts had
been intensified to avert a spillover to other districts.
Local newspaper reports put the death toll at 33 and said the figure
could be much higher because the outbreak had reportedly spread to 4
other nearby districts.

Cholera outbreak claims 13 lives in Basilan island
---------------------------
ZAMBOANGA CITY - 13 people, mostly children and elderly died of cholera on
Basilan Island, authorities said on Saturday, 2 Nov 2002.
Christopher Puno, provincial spokesman, said 20 others have been afflicted
with the bacterium, most of which are residents of Tapiantana Island in
Sumisip. The ages of the fatalities were between 5 months and 5 years and
between 30 and 72.
"The record that we have is only for those reported cases but Vice Governor
Lukman Akbao said there are more people inflicted," Puno said. He said the
provincial government feared the epidemic might claim more lives, which broke
out last 22 Oct 2002.
"Due to poverty, almost all those inflicted by the disease have yet to
be admitted to local hospitals," Puno added. He also said the provincial
government has now bought anti-cholera vaccines. A medical team of the United
States Forces based in Basilan is also taking action to contain the spread of
cholera.
