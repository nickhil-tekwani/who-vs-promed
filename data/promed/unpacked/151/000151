There was a well-publicized instance of vaccine-associated tuberculosis in
the early part of this century (I don't have my history books available for
date). It was known as the Lubeck Disaster (Lubeck with an umlaut in
Northern Germany). A batch of BCG vaccine had been contaminated and large
numbers of children develop acute disseminated tuberculosis.

Just to add an historical note: a tragic event in the history of BCG
vaccination occurred in 1930 in Lubeck. A laboratory error resulted in
vaccine being prepared from a virulent organism, leading to the death of 73
children and much trepidation regarding widespread use of the vaccine.
