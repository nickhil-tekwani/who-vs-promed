Since May, a catastrophic epidemic has stricken the largest group of
Mediterranean monk seals. Of 270 seals living in a pair of caves on West
Africa's Mauritanian coast, only about 70 have survived the disease, Albert
Osterhaus (Erasmus University, Rotterdam) told Science News. In the August
28 Nature, the team reports that most of the seals they examined harbor a
dolphin morbillivirus, a virus similar to the one that causes distemper in
dogs.
Osterhaus linked an earlier die-off of Baltic seals, caused by a related
morbillivirus, to immunity-suppressing organochlorine pollution (SN:
7/2/94, p. 8). In the monk seals, however, he found no signs of a
predisposing factor.
Only about 600 Mediterranean monk seals remain in the wild, mostly in
groups of about 20. Osterhaus hopes that if many of them are inoculated
with a distemper vaccine developed for their Baltic kin, they will weather
this threat to their survival.
