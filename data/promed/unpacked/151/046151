Trench fever found in homeless
The homeless may be at especially high risk for trench fever -- a
louse-borne bacterial infection first recognized among World War I troops,
French researchers report. Improvements in hygiene were credited with
making this infection uncommon, but it may be "far more prevalent than is
currently recognized", conclude a team of researchers at the Centre
Hospitalier Universitaire Flix Houphouet-Boigny, and the Centre National de
la Recherche Scintifique, both in Marseilles, France. Their findings are
published in the January 21st issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
Trench fever first came to public attention after thousands of soldiers
contracted the illness while fighting in the trenches of World War I. The
disease is caused by infection with the _Bartonella quintana_ bacterium,
which is transmitted from human to human via body lice. Trench fever is
characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headaches, and body pain.
Although the disease responds to antibiotic therapy, left untreated, it can
trigger a life-threatening inflammation of heart tissue. In their study,
the French team examined rates of _B. quintana_ infection in blood samples
obtained from 71 homeless patients visiting a Marseilles hospital during
1997.
They report that "samples from 21 patients (30%) had positive results...
for _B. quintana_." This level of infection is nearly double that reported
by the same authors in 1996 (16%) "and confirms the existence of an
outbreak (of trench fever) in Marseilles." "For homeless people, the risk
of exposure to _B. quintana_... is associated with the presence of body
lice," the authors report. In fact, they found that 9 out of 10 patients
whose blood cultures tested positive for the bacterium suffered from lice
infestation.
Trench fever may be affecting poor and homeless populations around the
world, the authors warn. According to one 1996 study, one in five homeless
patients living in Seattle, Washington, tested positive for _B. quintana_
infection. A second study, published last year, found high levels of
infection in conjunction with an outbreak of typhus in the East African
nation of Burundi.
"The potential for outbreaks of other louse-borne infections, such as
epidemic typhus and relapsing fever, cannot be ignored, and active
surveillance programs should be encouraged," the investigators conclude.
