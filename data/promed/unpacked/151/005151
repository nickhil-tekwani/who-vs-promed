Just 2 days after Sweden reported their 2nd detection of HPAI H5N6 in wild terrestrial birds, the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Jordbruksverket) today [16 Mar 2018] announced their 1st outbreak in poultry by this recently reassorted virus.

Bird flu has been found in a small backyard holding in Ãƒ-sthammar Uppsala County. The virus was analysed by the National Veterinary Institute (SVA), and found to be HPAI H5N6. It is the 1st discovery of this AI type in poultry in Sweden. This virus, recently circulating in Europe including Sweden, has never infected humans [in Europe; see comment. - Mod.AS].

To avoid its spread to poultry, it is important that poultry producers and owners of hobby birds apply appropriate infection control procedures, preventing contact between domestic poultry and wild birds, says Karin Ahl, deputy head of the unit for equine, poultry and game. We recommend that feeding wild birds near kept birds be avoided.[The press release includes additional guidelines addressing sanitary measures].

So far this reassorted (from HPAI H5N8) H5N6 virus hasn't produced anything close to the impact of last year's record HPAI H5N8 epizootic across Europe. In many ways, it behaves similarly to the behavior of H5N8 during its 1st brief event in Europe, during spring 2015. By Autumn 2016, 18 months later, HPAI H5N8 underwent evolutionary changes, gaining enough virulence and transmissibility to spark a record-setting avian influenza epizootic across whole Europe. [see Ref 1 in the commentary]. The H5N8 event deserves to be seen as a reminder that future H5N6 seasons might (though not necessarily will) behave differently than its 1st season.

HPAI H5N6 has been reported, by now, in Europe from Greece, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, and the UK. The genetic background of Asian and European HPAI H5N6 strains was briefly reviewed in http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/12/genetic-tests-reveal-more-about-new-h5n6-reassortant. See also Dr Brown's observations in post 20170305.4880867.

In relation to HPAI H5N6 in humans, reported from Far East Asia, please see WHO risk assessment presented and discussed in post 20161212.4689184.
