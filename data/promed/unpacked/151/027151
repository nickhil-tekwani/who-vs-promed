Here is the latest response from the NJ man that was awaiting me this morning.
It looks like they are ruling out some things but have yet to pin point the
source of his problem. More tests are planned but the next update will
probably be awhile due to the inability to obtain appointment times in a
reasonable time frame. I'm going to suggest that he not delay in having
lead checked out.

Yes, still here. I've been out of the office for the last three days.
Sorry for not getting back sooner.
I had three appointments this week. Monday and Tuesday at the internal
medicine physician and Thursday with the neurologist. Results from the
blood work on Monday revealed a drop in the white cell count and a normal
differential. I asked him for the exact levels but he continued to give me
the "within normal" response. He then told me that if my next blood test
proved to be normal, that there was very little he could do for me. So much
for him. I also saw the neurologist and passed all of his physical exams.
He said that the fasiculations could very well be stress related and that
there would be nothing he could do for me except put me on Klonopin. I
rejected this option until he could tell me that he had ruled out a
majority of the potential diagnosis that you had forwarded to me. He agreed
to give me an EMG, a review of all blood work to date and more blood work
if necessary after the EMG. If these items turned up negative, he would do
a spinal tap to rule out several other possibilities.
So that's where I stand. I will pursue the additional blood work and tests
that you suggested with the neurologist. If all tests are negative I will
then move on to a toxicologist, which someone you mentioned recommended.
Sorry, not much to report for the amount of time I spent at the doctors
offices this week. It seems like neither of these physicians really want to
diagnose this thing. My next appointment is Aug 24 for white cell blood
work and Sept 1 for the EMG (his earliest availability).
Thanks again for your concern and the wealth of information. I'll forward
as much as possible after the next appointments.
PS. I checked the http://www.nei.nih.gov/publications/histo.htm site you
mentioned in your last e-mail. The symptoms don't appear to be the same. My
vision is very good and I have not been seeing spots or patches. I just
seem to have twitches on the left side of my face which affect my left
eyelid at times. The site, however, is packed with useful info on many
other illnesses and they have a nice search facility.

[The following are some of the messages I forwarded to Jim for reforwarding
to New Jersey. As this is progressing slowly, I do not plan to post
anything new until next week. Any suggestions from members will, of course,
be passed on immediately to Jim & NJ. - Mod.MHJ

Normally, I don't reply to these, but this poor fellow seems really
desperate.
The obvious conditions (HIV, hepatitis viruses) have been ruled out. A
negative Lyme [disease serology does not rule out _Borrelia burgdorferii_,
and may need more specific testing (Lyme Western blot, or when highly
suspected, PCR from specific body fluid such as synovial (joint) or CSF).
_Histoplasma capsulatum_ is by far and away the most likely endemic fungus
associated with bat guano; the literature is ripe with cases involving
spelunckers, and can cause a myriad of symptoms including pericarditis (can
cause positional chest pain), musculo-skeletal findings, and in rare, but
not unheard of cases, CNS disease (more likely in the immunocompromised
populations, but can occur in purportedly immunocompetent persons).
Cryptococcal disease is not very common with bat-guano; it is more a
feature of exposure to pigeon droppings or bird coops. It can result in
disseminated forms in persons with otherwise intact immunologic systems,
but seizures can occur (usually in association with a meningitis and
changes in level-of-consciousness).
The exposures to mountain biking leaves leptospirosis in the differential,
although low white cell counts are usually (but not exclusively) seen in
this infection, and it can mimic other spirochetal diseases in presentation.
Ticks can transmit a number of rickettsial organisms, but on the East Coast
(did I get the affected person's geographic home correct), these are
usually Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Likewise, seizures may be associated,
but at this stage, the infected person is usually moribund. In addition to
RMSF, ticks can transmit a non-Lyme borrelial species that causes
"relapsing fever"--this isn't supposed to cause significant focal
neurologic events. If there is a missed tick, and one is still present on
his body, "tick bite fever" can actually result in numerous neurologic
complaints with or without fever and myalgias (muscle aches), and is a
result of circulating tick antigens.
Given the food habits (raw meats), I would also evaluate for
macro-parasites that can lead to CNS involvement such as cystercercosis,
sparagonomiasis (_Diphylobothium latum_ or fish tapeworm from poorly
prepared sushi), and if he has eaten "drunk crabs" in the Philippines, then
paragonomiasis. Most of these macro-parasites cross tissue plains and will
cause an eosinophilia ("allergic" response white count), and usually have
some GI symptoms.
It is unlikely that this represents human ehrlichiosis as the white count
is low with this disease.
And, are we sure these are seizures the person is experiencing, and not
rigors (shaking chills), which may be associated with a number of other
processes including too-numerous-to-count bacterial processes (rat bite
fever- he's in NYC, bacterial endocarditis, etc).
I'll leave the toxicology stuff to our toxicology colleagues.

I've been following the discussion and agree that histoplasmosis should be
tested for at the outset. The one website I would check with respect to the
involvement of the CNS and specifically the eyes would be the National Eye
Institute at the NIH <http://www.nei.nih.gov/publications/histo.htm>. This
site is deals with the issue of Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome which has a
number of similarities to the list of symptoms provided by the individual.
