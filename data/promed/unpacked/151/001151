Mystery illness kills 100 horses at farm
----------------------------------------
As many as 100 horses died at a farm outside
Summerfield during the past 10 days after the
animals became ill, littering the farm's
pastures. The death toll is unprecedented, say
state veterinary officials. The cause of the
illness, so far, remains a mystery.

Owners of EquiTransfer, Jose Davila and his wife,
Francis Ramirez, both veterinarians, had to
euthanize the horses after the animals showed
neurological problems and began collapsing. The
couple say they think the cause of the illness
was contaminated hay that wreaked havoc on the animals' nervous systems.

Davila and Ramirez would not say who they bought
the hay from, but said that EquiTransfer is the
supplier's only customer and that they have
disposed of all of the suspect hay. Davila said
they did not want to name the supplier because of
potential legal consequences that could result if
the hay turns out not to have been the problem.

"I wouldn't wish this on anybody," Davila said
Wednesday regarding the death of so many horses.
"[The horses] started trembling and fell on the
ground. It was like they were having seizures."

Meanwhile, Davila and Ramirez have sent samples
from the dead horses, as well as from the hay, to
toxicology labs in New York and Pennsylvania to
determine what caused the illness on the 87-acre
farm. The farm also sent 2 dead horses to the
University of Florida Veterinary Medical Center
to conduct necropsies, but those reports failed
to find an apparent cause of what sickened the horses.

The farm, on South County Road 475, is an embryo
transfer facility in which Davila takes
fertilized eggs from donor horses and implants
them in surrogate horses. Davila said he doesn't
know the financial loss due to the disease, but
estimates it to be in excess of several hundred
thousand dollars. He said his horses are insured.
The couple said that the suspect hay arrived 26
and 27 Sep 2008 and that by 28 Sep the 1st few
horses became sick. "When we saw 2 or 3, that wasn't common," Davila said.

Within hours, the couple said many more horses
showed neurological problems, including twitching
muscles, inability to stand and seizure-like
signs. Davila and Ramirez contacted other local
veterinarians to help treat the horses and rid
the animals of potential toxins in their stomachs.

By last Friday [3 Oct 2008], antitoxins had also
arrived from the University of Florida veterinary
college, which the farm used to treat the sick
horses, Davila said. EquiTransfer also gave the
antitoxin to its healthy horses as a precaution.
There are at least 400 horses on the farm. Davila
said he is not sure whether the treatments
worked, or whether horses got better on their own.

When the disease was at its worst on the farm,
horses were "dropping like flies," he said. A few
horses could still begin to show signs of the
disease, but most appear healthy now, Ramirez
said. Davila said soon after his horses started
dying he informed veterinarian Mike Short, with
the state veterinarian's office, which is part of
the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

"If you look at what's occurred, there's no
evidence it was contagious," Short said Thursday.
"It looks like it's mostly associated with hay."

The death of so many horses on a single farm
because of contaminated feed, however, is
something most veterinarians have never heard of.

"It sounds fairly improbable to me, but stranger
things have happened," said Diane Kitchen,
another state veterinarian with the Florida Department of Agriculture.

"We've never heard of anything like this on these
numbers." Carol Clark, a veterinarian with
Peterson & Smith Equine Hospital in Ocala, said
the most likely cause was something the horses
ate, but only the toxicology tests would be able
to show what made the horses die. Clark said
there were many ways hay can become contaminated.
Poor storage of hay can cause mold contamination,
she said, but added that toxins in mold generally
do not cause the kinds of problems EquiTransfer saw with its horses.

If dead animals are accidentally wrapped into the
hay, that could also contaminate it, she said.
But that would contaminate only the single bail,
not all the other bales delivered to the farm,
she said. [Dead animals baled into hay would
generally produce botulism intoxication. - Mod.TG]

Another culprit could be botulism, Clark said. In
the case of botulism, the bacteria _Clostridium
botulinum_ produces spores which sticks to the
hay when it is cut and baled. The spores become
bacteria, which produce a deadly toxin. The
bacteria thrive in environments absent of oxygen.
In some cases, grass that is cut and wrapped and
allowed to ferment, which is conducive to the
deadly bacteria's growth if not handled
correctly, Clark said. The processed hay is
called haylage and is typically given to cattle
because cattle are less susceptible to botulism,
Clark said. [Cattle are just as susceptible to
botulism intoxication. It is an old tale that
that cattle are not as susceptible. - Mod.TG]

Horses are highly susceptible to the disease and
many veterinarians, including Clark, do not
recommend haylage be given to horses.

Davila said the hay he gave his sick horses was
haylage, but that it was inoculated to make it
safe for horses. It is unlikely state animal
officials will get involved to ensure the
supplier's hay, if any is left, is not sold to
another farm, though. That's because Steve
Dwinell, a Florida Department of Agricultural
official, said the state only regulates animal
feed, not hay. Feed includes supplements such as
protein mixes, hay is essentially dried grass.

"There has to be evidence of some regulated
commodity" for the state to investigate, Dwindell
said. "[Hay] is not considered a regulated feed."

There have been 4 complaints from citizens made
with Marion County Animal Control against the
farm since 2005, county records show. When Animal
Control investigators visited the site, they
found the complaints unfounded and the horses well-fed and healthy.

As for the farm's latest problems, the
department's spokeswoman, Christy Jergens, said,
"As of right now, there doesn't look to be any
legal problems. If something else is found, that
could be a different situation.

[It is generally not advisable to feed haylage to
horses. There are a number of fermentation
factors in haylage that are usually not suitable
to horses. Dead animals baled into hay can and
does produce botulism intoxication in animals
that consume the hay. Furthermore, there are a
number of toxic plants that could have contributed to this.

The article does not tell us if this hay/haylage
was produced locally or trucked from some other
location. Therefore it is difficult to know which plant could be responsible.

We look forward to an authoritative report
regarding the necropies of the horses, contents
of the stomach and analysis of the hay/haylage. ­ Mod.TG]
