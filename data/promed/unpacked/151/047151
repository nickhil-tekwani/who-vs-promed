Thousands of dead fish and birds littering the Lake Erie shoreline are
victims of a deadly botulism outbreak.
The botulism and the lethal toxin it produces have killed mainly freshwater
drum -- a common fish species also known as sheepshead -- and seagulls.
Scientists suspect Lake Erie's waters have turned deadly because the
introduction of alien species such as zebra mussels has dramatically upset
the lake's ecosystem. The presence of invaders such as zebra and quagga
mussels and the round goby, a pest fish, has made it easier for botulism
bacteria to grow and produce the toxin, said Jeff Robinson of the Canadian
Wildlife Service in London [Ontario].
Scientists believe the deadly chain of events begins when botulism bacteria
[_Clostridium botulinum_ - Mod.TG], which occur naturally in lake sediments,
are absorbed by mussels. Gobies, which grow to a maximum of about 20
centimeters, spread the bacteria and its toxin up the food chain when they
eat the mussels and are in turn eaten by other fish or birds. Gulls ingest
the toxin and die after eating sheepshead that have gobbled toxin-tainted
mussels.
Sheepshead float when they die, while gobies, lacking a swim bladder, sink
to the bottom, Robinson said. A few dead gobies have been caught in currents
and washed ashore, but Robinson suspects many more are on the bottom. The
outbreak is not expected to threaten the region's sheepshead population
because the fish are so plentiful, Robinson said. There's no market for
sheepshead, considered a coarse fish, so there's no commercial catch to
reduce their numbers.
The botulism outbreak could potentially kill loons, mergansers, and other
fish-eating birds that begin migrating through the area later in the fall.
The birds die after eating botulism-tainted fish.
Robinson said nothing can be done to stem botulism outbreaks, since gobies,
an apparent key player, are one of the most numerous species in the lake.
"There will be no opportunity to remove them from the system," he said.
BOTULISM SAFETY
- Avoid harvesting fish or birds acting abnormally, since people can ingest
the botulism toxin by eating these creatures. Cooking may not destroy the
toxin.
- If you must handle dead fish or birds on the beach, wear protective
plastic or rubber gloves.
- Keep pets away from dead birds or fish along the shoreline to prevent them
from falling ill.
- The toxin must be ingested to be harmful. There's no risk from swimming in
water where botulism is present. [The botulism began in the sediment of the
lake, and has been spread up the food chain through various species
consuming other infected species. The bacteria may be in the water, but the
toxin causing the problem is actually in the organisms, not the water
itself. - Mod.TG]
[There were similar die-offs in Lake Erie in 1998, 1999 & 2001. The 2001
outbreak was found to be due to type E botulism. I wonder why there were no
reports in 2000 -- there might be a clue there. - Mod.JW]
