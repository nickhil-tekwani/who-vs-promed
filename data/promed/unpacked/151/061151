The epidemiology of the first 12 human A (H1N1) cases reported in mainland
China
-----------------------------------------------------
From 11 May to 25 May 2009, 12 human A (H1N1) Influenza cases were
reported mainland. Through the original data from China CDC
(<http://www.chinacdc.net.cn>), the cases show the following
epidemiological features:

1. they are all imported cases through international airplanes;
2. the airplanes departed from USA (7 cases), Canada (4 cases), or
Australia (1 case);
3. the airplanes arrived in Beijing (8 cases), Shanghai (2 cases), or Hong
Kong (2 cases);
4. 7 of the 12 cases had moved to other provinces or municipalities in
China before they were identified;
5. They are 2-69 years of age;
6. 10 of them are male and 2 are female, presumably due to the fact that
the majority of the passengers in the airplanes were male;
7. only 2 were considered suspected cases on arrival at the airport through
body temperature scanning;
8. only the above 2 felt uncomfortable during the flight, and the others
felt uncomfortable or had a fever only after they arrived at their final
destinations (several hours to 6 days later);
9. the confirmations were reported 1-6 days (mean: 3.55 days, SD: 1.97
days) after they arrived in their destination airport;
10. none of them developed severe illnesses, and up to the present, 4 have
recovered and left hospital.

These epidemiological data are interesting as they suggest that
1. if the prevalence of the A (H1N1) infection among the international
airplane passengers is comparable to that in the departure countries, there
should be many more cases in USA and Canada than the official records (more
than millions?);
2. if the prevalence of the A (H1N1) infection in the international
airplane passengers is higher than in the departure countries, some of the
12 cases should have become infected during traveling. Therefore, airplane
passengers should take some measures to prevent themselves becoming
infected during the journey;
3. some domestic cases have probably emerged in Australia since one of the
12 cases had traveled from Melbourne on 21 May 2009 and had developed fever
during the flight. He had no traveling history to other countries recently.
Therefore, he is not only an imported case in China mainland, but also a
domestic case in Australia;
4. considering only 2 of the 12 cases were identified as suspected cases at
the arrival airports, it is not possible to block future imported cases
coming to mainland China through air traveling;
5. considering 7 of the 12 cases had dispersed to other provinces or
municipalities in China before they were identified, and some of them felt
uncomfortable and confirmed only several days after they arrived, it should
be of quite high possibility for the imported cases to transfer the virus
to other people living around them and spark outbreaks in mainland China in
the near future;
6. currently, the 12 cases suggest that people in China are susceptible to
[H1N1 virus] infection and that the infection is not that severe at least
up to the present.

[This lucid epidemiological analysis of the 1st cases of influenza A (H1N1)
virus infection in mainland China confirms some of the basic features of
the outbreak. The rapid global spread of infection is determined in large
part by the short duration and ubiquity of commercial air travel. Other
features are the general mildness of the illness and the high proportion of
inapparent to apparent infections. Also, as commented previously, the
absence of fever in the early stages of illness renders the use of
temperature scanners at airports ineffective in identification of carriers
of infection.

The analysis above indicates that the infection is likely to take hold
widely in mainland China. Furthermore the prediction of the existence of
cryptic cases of infection in Australia has been confirmed. - Mod.CP]
