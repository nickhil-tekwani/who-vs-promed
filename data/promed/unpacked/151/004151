[The identification of the disease in the wild boar population of
Chechnya may herald its introduction into domestic pig farms.
However, effective separation of the populations, combined with the
relative scarcity of pig farms in this predominantly Moslem country,
may forecast a less pessimistic scenario locally. Further spread of
the disease among the dense wild boar population may, however,
enhance its introduction into more ASF-receptive, pig-raising areas
within and outside the Caucasus.

African swine fever (ASF), a porcine viral disease against which no
vaccine is yet available, has been spreading in the Caucasus since
May 2007. Russia is the 3rd country officially notifying the disease,
following Georgia (which has, so far, reported 61 outbreaks) and
Armenia (15). According to unofficial sources, the actual number of
outbreaks is higher; they are observed mainly in free-range backyard pigs.

ASF is (unofficially) known to have been spreading also in the
conflict territories of Abkhazia Autonomous Republic,
Nagorno-Karabagh (a de facto independent republic in Azerbaijan) and
Southern Osetia (in Georgia). The complex political situation in the
Caucasus is not supportive of the highly needed regionally
coordinated ASF control efforts. - Mod.AS]
