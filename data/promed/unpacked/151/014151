Sleeping Sickness Strikes Hard
------------------------------
There has been an alarming upsurge of sleeping sickness in Uganda and
several other East and Central African countries.
The infection rate has reached the devastating peak of the 1930s in Uganda,
Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Angola, the
International Scientific Council for Trypanosomiasis Research and Control
said.
The Council, which is an organ of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU),
said, "The infection rate has now reached the peak it had attained in the
1930's."
"The situation has been declared 'very serious' in East and Central African
countries, namely Uganda, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Angola, while the disease has re-emerged in Togo, Benin, Congo, Cote
d'Ivoire, Ghana and Gabon."
IRIN, the UN's integrated regional information network, quoted the Council
yesterday as saying "the strong incidence of trypanosomiasis highlights the
failure of former methods and the urgent need to elaborate efficient methods."
IRIN said Burkina Faso's Prime Minister Ernest Paramanga Yonly launched a
campaign on Friday to eradicate the disease in Africa.

[The message from the International Scientific Council for Trypanosomiasis
Research and Control highlights previous reports indicating a re-emergence
of trypanosomiasis in Africa. The situation has been hidden by the local
wars in Central Africa, which made surveillance and reporting almost
impossible. However, the situation has been revealed by 2 sources. Reports
from Medicins sans Frontieres show that trypanosomiasis in the Democratic
Republic of Congo by year 2000 had reached levels higher than in the 1920s,
when control measures began. Other evidence has been the increasing number
of tourists returning from East Africa with trypanosomiasis, as reported
through TropMedEurope. - Mod.EP
