An ethnic Tibetan doctor working in Nepal says the rate of hepatitis B infection is soaring in Tibet because of a lack of education and vaccinations. Dr Lhamo Sharpa, a Nepal based Tibetan doctor, says 61 percent of Tibetans living in Nepal are infected with the virus, which harms the liver and can cause serious long term health problems in some people.

Dr Lhamo, who directly works with researchers in Tibetan areas of China, told VOA that rural Tibetans are especially vulnerable because of a lack of access to proper vaccinations. She added that a study she and her colleagues conducted shows that at least 64 percent of women in rural Tibetan areas give birth at home and are not told about vaccines available for their babies. "Those who give birth at home don't go to hospitals unless they are sick," said Dr Lhamo. "They don't go to hospital because they are not aware of the vaccines and that is a problem."

Hepatitis B is usually transmitted from infected people through blood or body fluids. The lack of education is a contributor to its spread. Dr Lhamo believes many monks get hepatitis B through sharing razors or going to hair salons that do not sterilize their equipment.

Questions have also been raised in the media about the quality of hepatitis B vaccines produced in China.

[As shown in this publication from 2002, Shrestha SM, Takeda N, Tsuda F, Okamoto H, Shrestha VM: High prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection amongst Tibetans in Nepal. Trop Gastroenterol 2002; 23(2): 63-5; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12632970:

"Tibetans have been living in Nepal since 1959. Study of the prevalence of viral hepatitis among them showed that they have a high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Prevalence of total HBV infection and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among them was 61 percent and 16 percent compared to 10.0 percent and 0.7 percent respectively among the Nepalese. The predominant HBsAg subtype among the Tibetans was 'ayw'. Perinatal and childhood transmission was found important in the spread of HBV infection among the Tibetans."

The overall percentage of Tibetans with active HBV infection in 2002 was 16 percent, a quite high number and 61 percent in total had evidence of present or past evidence of infection. The 61 percent number in this posting likely reflects serologic evidence of active and past infection together as well. - Mod.LL
