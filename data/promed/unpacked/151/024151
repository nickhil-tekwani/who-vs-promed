Discovery of squirrel pox in the Borders has prompted fresh fears for
the future of Scotland's red squirrel population. Antibodies to the
virus, which is harmless to greys but fatal to red squirrels, were
found in a blood sample from one of 10 grey squirrels trapped at
Floors Castle, Kelso, part of the Roxburghe Estate.

The disease was responsible for effectively wiping out the red
squirrel population in England.

Last night [22 May 2008], experts called on the public to be vigilant
and for landowners to trap the greys amid fears the disease is spreading.

The Duke of Roxburghe said: "This is an extremely disturbing
development. While we have been undertaking serious efforts to
control the spread of grey squirrels on the Roxburghe Estate, this is
the 1st time one has tested positive for squirrel pox.

"It is all the more vital that control efforts are stepped up by
farmers and landowners in this part of the Scottish Borders,
particularly those close to the Border, if we are to safeguard the
population of red squirrels. I would urge all those not currently
carrying out trapping to do so."

It is likely that the grey squirrel carrying the virus will have come
up the Tweed Valley from Northumberland. It is the 1st time the
antibodies have been detected in the region.

The pox was first detected in Scotland in 2005 and last month [April
2008], 2 red squirrels died from the virus in the Thornhill area of
Dumfries and Galloway. There was also a fatal outbreak in Lockerbie
in May [2008].

[Squirrel pox is a viral disease affecting red squirrels, killing
them within 15 days of infection. It is carried by grey squirrels,
which show no symptoms of disease, so that they continue to thrive
and breed while carrying the virus. It is thought to have been
brought into Britain with grey squirrels introduced into southern
England from America in the early 20th century. Several pox-like
disease outbreaks in red squirrels were recorded over the decades,
but the virus was first confirmed during a disease outbreak in East
Anglia in the 1980s and it has since worked its way steadily northwards.
