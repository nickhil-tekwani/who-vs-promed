Outbreak of botulism in buffalo herds in Campos, RJ
---------------------------------------------------
An exogenous poisoning, called hydric botulism and caused by the ingestion of toxins through contaminated water, led to the deaths of 163 buffaloes, 65 percent (105 animals) of them pregnant or lactating.

Mortality was recorded over a period of 5 months, during study in a swampy and low-sloped area in Campos dos Goytacazes. The diagnosis was confirmed by Professor Eulogio Queiroz de Carvalho and his PhD student Raphael Mansur Medina, from the Laboratory of Animal Morphology and Pathology (LMPA) of UENF [State University of Norte Fluminense] "Darcy Ribeiro", and veterinarians Serafim Saldanha Braga de Azeredo, of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and supply (MAPA), and Claudio Vilela Vieira, coordinator of the Agency for Agriculture of Rio de Janeiro.

In most cases, cattle had breathing difficulties, normal alertness, and neurological signs of flaccid paralysis of musculature, which made locomotion difficult. Collections of green water with high amount of organic matter were observed in the pastures where the animals died.

According to Queiroz de Carvalho, the occurrence of botulism depends on a number of factors, including the intensity of environmental contamination by _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, in addition to the presence of the substrate and the existence of optimal conditions for their multiplication and the formation of toxin. The production system used (the husbandry practices) benefits the spread of this disease. The organic waste left in the environment determined the shape and intensity of the outbreak.

In the analysis performed in the Laboratory of Animal Infectious Diseases, UNESP/Aracatuba, botulinum toxin type C was detected, which led to the confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and pathological and epidemiological characteristics of hydric botulism. Also analyzed were samples of liver, intestinal contents, and rumen contents of animals necropsied, on which lesions consistent with malnutrition were diagnosed. In Queiroz de Carvalho's opinion, this factor may have contributed to the worsening of the effects of the toxin found in the environment and in the organs examined.

Sporadic outbreaks of botulism in cattle are reported in the states of Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goias. In the state of Maranhao there are descriptions of outbreaks of enzootic botulism in buffaloes, related to the presence of vegetal matter in the puddles formed during drought periods and eaten by animals.

[Botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Spores of these bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and other sources of organic matter combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria. Bovids are most commonly affected by types C and D.

Enzootic botulism in buffalo herds raised in Brazil was described by Langenegger and Doebereiner (1988), in the northern state of Maranhao.
