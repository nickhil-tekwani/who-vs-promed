Soybean samples from northern Mato Grosso have been sent to Embrapa
[Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation] to check for the
presence of a disease called Crazy Soybean II. The disease was first
discovered in Brazilian soybean fields several years ago, and since
then it has been found sporadically in central Brazil.

The organism that causes the disease is yet unknown, and the origin
of the disease is also a mystery. During the 2010/11 growing season,
the distribution of the disease and the severity varied by region,
but it was mostly found in isolated fields in central and northern
Mato Grosso. On a localized basis, the disease can cause economic
losses, but on a statewide basis, it appears to be another disease
that farmers must watch and try to manage.

In June of 2010, researchers formed a working group to monitor the
distribution of the disease and to try and ascertain the causal
organism. Since all the soybean fields in Brazil receive fungicide
applications to control soybean rust, this new disease is probably
not a fungus. Speculation is that a virus may be the cause of the
abnormality.

[The condition of Crazy Soybean II (CSII) was reported in 2009 in all
the major soybean producing states of Brazil: Goias, Parana, Para,
Maranhao, and most occurrences in Mato Grosso. Yield losses of up to
40 percent were reported.

Symptoms have been described to include abnormal leaf development,
unusually high flower and pod abortion, and pods that are heavier but
with fewer seeds than normal. Infected soybean plants remain green
when normal plants start to dry off, and seed pods never mature.

Since a causal organism has not yet been identified, it is unclear
how the samples referred to above could have been "tested." Instead,
they may have been subjected to visual inspection, and symptoms were
considered to resemble CSII.
