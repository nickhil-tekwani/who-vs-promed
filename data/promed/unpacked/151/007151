--------------------------------------------------------------
[Paragraph 9 of the above posting , titled "Paula
Menzies (Canada) Â­ Q-fever & Coxiellosis in
Canada", included the following text:
"Coxiellosis is not reportable for humans, but
annually notifiable. No actions are taken after
diagnosis, no routine surveillance".
In response, the following commentary has been
received from Dr Varga, Ontario's Ministry of Health. - Mod.AS:]

I would like to clarify Christine Bijl's
recorded minutes on "Paula Menzies (Canada) -
Q-fever & Coxiellosis in Canada" presentation.

Q fever in Canada is not reportable in animals
under the Health of Animals Act, Reportable
Diseases Regulations. However, Q fever is
reportable in humans in Ontario under the Health Protection and Promotion Act.

[Following the above information, we requested
and kindly obtained from Dr Varga the following additional clarifications:

Q1. Is every case (or suspected case) of Q fever
in a human, officially notifiable in Ontario? In
case the answer is yes -- to whom is it reported?

A1. My answer is yes. Every suspected human case
is tested for Q fever. In Ontario a legislated
health care professional (LHCP) if suspecting a Q
fever case could submit a sample to the Public
Health Laboratory for testing. In case of
positive sample, a report would be sent to the
LHCP and an immediate treatment will follow.
Because the Q fever is reportable in Ontario,
every Q fever case will be reported to the
Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.
Therefore the remark of "No actions are taken after diagnosis" is not accurate.

Q2. Is every case (or suspected case) of Q fever
in a human officially notifiable in Canada (thus
a national requirement)? In case the answer is yes -- to whom is it reported?

A2. Nationally Q fever is not reportable in Canada.

Q3. Is there in Canada a provision requiring
annual (accumulated?) but not immediate
notification of Q fever, as apparent from Bijl's recordings?

A3. There is no national requirement of reporting
Q fever in humans (no accumulated annual
reporting requirement and no immediate
notification requirement). Q fever is not
included among diseases under national surveillance.

Clearly, Ontario -- the Canadian province most
seriously affected by Q fever -- applies
specific, and more intensive, policy and measures.

We are grateful to Dr Varga for the initial
response and for the additional information on
the Canadian Q fever policy. - Mod.AS]
