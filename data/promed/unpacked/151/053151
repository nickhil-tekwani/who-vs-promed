Outbreak of suspected Norwalk virus infection closes pediatric ward
-------------------------------------------------------------------
WATERLOO REGION (Ontario): An outbreak of what's suspected to be Norwalk
virus infection has closed the pediatric ward at Cambridge Memorial
Hospital and placed a handful of patients in isolation at Grand River
Hospital's Freeport Health Centre in Kitchener. Dr Verne Glavin, an
infectious disease specialist at Cambridge Memorial, said yesterday that a
dozen children in hospital were being treated for vomiting, diarrhea, and
fever. A dozen staff on the ward had similar symptoms. Initial diagnoses of
gastroenteritis have been made and lab results will confirm if the cause is
the highly contagious Norwalk virus.
"It seems to be identical to Sunnybrook," Glavin said. The Toronto hospital
shut down its emergency room last week because of a Norwalk outbreak.
Brantford General Hospital is also working to contain a possible outbreak.
The illness strikes rapidly, with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal
cramps, headache, fatigue, and sometimes low-grade fever. Norwalk usually
runs its course in one to 2 days, but can continue to be passed on for a
few days after symptoms subside. It can easily spread from unwashed hands
or by eating food prepared by someone who is ill. Glavin said hospital
staff decided on Monday to close the pediatric ward to new admissions.
Grand River Hospital and Guelph General Hospital have been asked to take
any additional patients while the Cambridge ward and kitchen are
disinfected and until sick patients are well enough for discharge. But it
may be 4 or 5 days before the ward reopens, Glavin said. Ill staff have
been advised not to return to work until 48 hours after their symptoms
disappear. Staff on duty are being urged to be extra vigilant about
handwashing.
Meanwhile, 4 Freeport patients are being kept in their rooms and one more
is being watched for possible Norwalk virus. Family and friends of patients
in that area have been asked not to visit. Ruth Schertzberg, director of
infection control at Grand River, said the hospital had 6 patients on
medical wards sick with gastroenteritis about 2 weeks ago and sporadic
cases have occurred throughout the hospital. Norwalk hasn't hit St. Mary's
Hospital, spokesman Peter Sweeney said. No outbreaks have yet been reported
at long term care facilities. However, the region's public health
department reported a sharp increase in cases of both gastrointestinal and
respiratory illnesses in schools and daycare centres.
