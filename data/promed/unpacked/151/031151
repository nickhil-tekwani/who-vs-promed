Regarding the role of migratory birds in the spread of WNV across
North America, there are more unknowns than knowns. Yes, it is clear
that some birds are important vertebrate reservoir hosts (although
the most important species may vary regionally), and that many
passerines are competent reservoir hosts (unpublished data), and that
many passerines migrate long distances. Thus, epidemiologists
recognize the potential for migrating birds to introduce WNV into new
locations.

However, there are no hard data that this has occurred in North
America, although some observations are best explained by the
migratory bird virus dispersal theory (see for example:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no4/01-0217.htm>

Several groups are currently working to find better evidence to
support this theory.

However, other possible dispersal mechanisms for WNV have been proposed.

The important fact is that WNV clearly is spreading relatively
rapidly. The mechanism of spread is largely an academic question (and
an interesting one), but the reality is that whatever the mode of
spread, there doesn't seem to be much we can do about it. [As yet. -
Mod.MHJ] Therefore, as always, our focus should be on implementing
effective surveillance, prevention, and control to reduce the risk of
disease transmission to other domestic animals and humans.

Regarding the specific questions posed by Professor Nash, here are my answers:

1) Do we know which migratory birds are bringing the virus in?

WNV is already present in many known regions of North America, and
most likely in many as yet unknown regions as well. Migratory birds
are found everywhere, and movement of some birds occurs during all
seasons. Any bird may become infected if it passes through a focus
of transmission. Whether it can fly to a new location in an
infectious state remains unknown.

2) If we know which birds, can we determine their point of origin?

Since migratory birds breed throughout North America, we would not be
able to identify an origin of a particular bird species (if one
species was even implicated). Anyway, a more likely scenario is that
migrating birds pick up the infection during their migration, rather
than bringing the infection from their point of origin. This is
because reservoir birds remain infectious to mosquitoes for only a
brief period (about 5 days or less). There would be no way to know at
what point along the migration route they became infected.

3) If so, is there a WNV outbreak at the birds' migratory point of
origin in humans or other animals there?

As already stated, we already know that there are WNV transmission
foci all over North America, because of the good surveillance being
conducted in most states and provinces. What we don't know at present
is whether there are foci of transmission in the American tropics
where birds might become infected before their spring migration.
This, however, would not be unexpected.
