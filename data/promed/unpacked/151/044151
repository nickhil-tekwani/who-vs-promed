Capripox virus, or lumpy skin disease [LSD], which infected at least 265 animals in the district [Kochi, Kerala] until now, has left dairy farmers here worried. However, Laiby Paulin, district animal husbandry officer, sought to allay fears, saying the outbreak has been contained. "The newer cases show only mild infection," she said.

She said the disease was 1st reported at Valayanchirangara, 7 km [4.3 mi] from Perumbavoor, on 11 Jan 2020. "This is the 1st time the disease is being reported in the country [sic; please see commentary. - Mod.AS]. In the State [Kerala], the disease was 1st reported from districts like Palakkad and Kozhikode in November last year [2019]," she said.

"A vector, biting fly (_Stomyxos calcitrans_), and mosquitoes transmit the disease endemic to African nations like Zambia. The mortality rate is between 1% and 5%, and the morbidity between 10% and 15%," Laiby said.

No cattle deaths have been reported from the district due to the disease, which damages hides and leads to loss of milk, abortion, and sterility. "Until now, the outbreak has affected cattle in 39 panchayats in the district, and 3500 doses of vaccines were provided," Laiby said. "The disease starts with fever, which lasts 2-3 days. Nodules measuring 2-5 cm [0.8-2 in] appear on the skin. When the infection becomes severe, pus forms in the nodules and causes pain," she said.

To curb the spread of vectors that spread the disease, the department has recommended strict vector control.

[India submitted its 1st and only report on lumpy skin disease [LSD] to the OIE on 18 Nov 2019, informing 3 outbreaks in the state of Odisha. Reportedly, the event had started 12 Aug 2019. The report with map is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=32387. The 3 outbreaks started almost simultaneously (12, 17, 20 Aug 2019), which may be indicative of a common source.

Outbreaks in Kerala or in any other state in India are yet to be notified.

According to the OIE report, vaccination against LSD is prohibited in India. Vaccination has become known to be the most effective measure to control LSD. The disease is vector-borne, with a seasonal pattern. It is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
