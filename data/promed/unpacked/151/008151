State food safety officials issued a warning Thu 20 Jul 2006 about
some frozen stuffed chicken entrees that contain uncooked chicken.
Investigators from the state health and agriculture departments said
29 people in Minnesota have become ill after eating frozen chicken
entrees that weren't cooked long enough to kill salmonella bacteria.
They recommended against microwaving single-serving chicken products
-- even when it's listed as an option on labels. They said the
products should be baked in the oven to an internal temperature of
165 degrees.
The entrees include chicken cordon [bleu], chicken kiev, and chicken
with broccoli and cheese. They are usually pre-browned, but contain
raw chicken. Most of the cases were traced to products manufactured
by Aspen Foods in Chicago and Serenade Foods of Milford, Indiana, and
sold under a variety of brand names, including store brand names,
state officials said.
The USA Department of Agriculture issued a limited recall in Mar 2006 after
the salmonella outbreak was identified. However, epidemiologists have found
that new cases of illness continue to occur.

[In March 2005, 4 cases were reported in Minnesota -- see ref. below -- and
this year there are 29. The onset of the 2006 cases is not stated.
As the post notes, pre-browned -- but not totally precooked --
frozen chicken entrees ought to be baked to appropriate internal
temperatures rather than microwaved, even if there are instructions
on the package for microwaving. - Mod.LL]
