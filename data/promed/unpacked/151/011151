Investigators traced a cluster of legionellosis cases at a horse race track in West Virginia to a poorly maintained hot tub in the jockey locker room. In a twist, they found that many people who became infected did not have direct exposure to the hot tub. Instead, they likely breathed in mist that escaped through various pathways, including a crack in the floor of the office space above the locker room, explained Jared Rispens, MD, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer in the CDC's Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice.

In all, Rispens and colleagues identified 17 cases [of legionellosis], including 10 confirmed or suspected cases of legionnaires' disease and 7 suspected cases of Pontiac fever, a milder form of legionellosis.

They launched the investigation after an employee at the race track tested positive for legionnaires' disease in October 2018. They zeroed in on the hot tub, which was located one floor below the office space in a small room with no exhaust system, Rispens said.

"We had a number of reports from jockeys and users of the hot tub that sometimes they would add their own bleach because of the perceived lack of sanitation," Rispens said. Water and biofilm samples from the hot tub came back negative for _Legionella_, unsurprisingly, Rispens said, because the tub had been hyper-chlorinated and drained before it could be tested.

But they found that 10 confirmed or suspected patients had exposure to the hot tub or an adjacent hallway. The rest were apparently exposed in a 2nd-floor office suite. Rispens said they used fog machines to visualize air flow in the facility and discovered several pathways that mist could have traveled from the hot tub to other areas, including through the facility's ventilation system and the crack in the floor. "These factors could have created an environment where aerosol containing _Legionella_ from the hot tub was introduced to higher floors via the thermal stack effect and/or passive ventilation and recirculated to occupied areas," Rispens and colleagues wrote.

Humans can become infected with _Legionella_ in 2 ways: through the inhalation of contaminated water droplets, or aspiration of contaminated water. Since legionnaires' disease was discovered in 1976, many potential sources for exposure have been identified, including cooling towers, hospital hot water systems, windshield washer fluid, dishwashers, street cleaning trucks, and water births.

[A common source legionellosis outbreak is usually confirmed by clinical isolates of _Legionella_ having matching genotypes. However, the news report above fails to say whether genotyping of clinical isolates was done in this outbreak that involved 17 cases, including 10 confirmed or suspected cases of legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the disease, and 7 suspected cases of Pontiac fever, a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis. Usually, a source is confirmed on the basis of matching genotypes for the clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_. A hot tub was implicated as the source, but no _Legionella_ were isolated from the hot tub, because of its prior disinfection.

Ten patients had exposure to the hot tub or an adjacent hallway, and 7 others were apparently exposed in a 2nd-floor office suite through a crack in the floor between the rooms. Legionellosis is frequently acquired by inhalation of an infectious aerosol. Aerosols can spread for a distance the source via air currents, so that an infected individual might not have to be in the same room as the source. For example, in the 1976 outbreak in Philadelphia, most cases of legionnaires' disease were at a convention held at a particular downtown hotel, but some patients, called at the time "Broad Street" pneumonia cases, were only passers-by within the vicinity of the hotel (https://www.nap.edu/read/4795/chapter/32#437).

There have been several outbreaks of legionnaires' disease where the cause was traced back to a hot tub. (See prior ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, spa pool - UK (England) 20060929.2787.) A hot tub (AKA spa pool or whirlpool spa) is designed for seating a small number of people in a rather confined space. The water temperature is kept between 30 to 40 C [86-104 F], the optimum temperature for _Legionella_ to grow in a contaminated hot tub. (At temperatures below 20 C [68 F], the bacteria are dormant, and at temperatures above 60 C [140 F], _Legionella_ are killed over time.) The water in a hot tub is not usually drained between uses, so it has to be continually filtered and cleaned. The piping for the air and water circulation and the filter provide a large surface area on which _Legionella_ form a biofilm, which is a thin layer of slime formed by micro-organisms in water systems that provides protection from adverse conditions.

The hot tub has a circulator pump to ensure the water flows around the occupants. Aerosols of _Legionella_ are apparently formed when the circulator agitates the water. People can inhale these infectious aerosols. Exposing the lungs to the bacteria could then lead in susceptible people to legionnaires' disease or Pontiac fever. - Mod.ML
