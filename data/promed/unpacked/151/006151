[The previous WHO Update of 17 Jun 2005 (Update 22) reported that the
Ministry of Health in Angola has reported a total of 422 cases and
356 deaths in Uige Province. 21 contacts are being followed in Uige
municipality and 111 in other municipalities. The reduced case number
and number of deaths reported above now come closer to the numbers
reported by Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) in ProMED-mail post
"Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Angola (49) 20050712.1981." However, the
figures do not correspond precisely, perhaps supporting the
observation of Dr. Sprecher of MSF that: "Marburg is hard to detect.
Its symptoms, which include high fever, diarrhea and vomiting, are
non-specific and similar to those of common tropical diseases, such
as malaria. Marburg fever is not as dramatic and gory as media
reports portray it to be. Patients don't bleed profusely from every
orifice," - Mod.CP]
