[1] ECDC update with French cases without German link
Date: Wed 29 Jun 2011

Update since 28 Jun 2011
------------------------
In the EU/EEA, 885 HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] cases, including
31 deaths, and 3170 non-HUS cases, including 17 deaths have so far
been reported. Germany reports 28 non-HUS STEC [Shiga toxin producing
_Escherichia coli_] cases since the last update. Sweden reports 1 new
non-HUS STEC case, who does not have any known links to Germany, and
claims not to have eaten sprouts. The latest known date of onset of
diarrhea for cases is 23 Jun 2011 in Germany.

On Fri 24 Jun 2011, France reported a cluster of patients with bloody
diarrhea, who had participated in an event in the commune of Begles
around Bordeaux on 8 Jun 2011. As of 28 Jun 2011, 8 cases of bloody
diarrhea and a further 8 cases with HUS have been identified. 11 of
these patients had attended the event in Begles. They are 7 women and
4 men, between 31 and 64 years of age. Infection with _E. coli_
O104:H4 has been confirmed for 4 patients with HUS.

The French authorities are investigating this new cluster of STEC. 9
of the cases reported having eaten sprouts at the event on 8 Jun 2011,
and leftovers are currently being analyzed. These suspected sprouts
were locally produced, and were not imported from the farm implicated
in the outbreak in Germany.

Thorough investigations are now being carried out to determine the
suspected vehicle of infection for the cases reported in the French
cluster, and whether there is any link between that cluster and the
large outbreak reported from Germany.

[By noting the EU number of daily cases of HUS and non-HUS cases and
their total as well as deaths reported, the daily trends of the
numbers can be seen:

Date (2011): New HUS / New non-HUS / New Total / Overall Total
Deaths
Mon 6 Jun: 3 / 67 / 70 / 22
Tue 7 Jun: 13 / 83 / 96 / 23
Wed 8 Jun: 48 / 266 / 314 / 25

Fri 17 Jun: 14 / 92 / 106 / 39
Mon 20 Jun: 12 / 74 / 96 / 40 (3 day gap)

Tue 28 Jun: 4 / 97 / 101 / 48
Wed 29 Jun: 0 / 29 / 29 / 48

Total cases: 4055 with 48 deaths -- 1.18 percent case fatality rate.
Cases have continued to occur as the last onset of symptoms to date
is only 6 days ago, 23 Jun 2011!

The cases do not necessarily reflect date of onset of disease but
rather when the diagnosis was made and reported. The number of newly
reported cases per day clearly decreased from the corresponding day in
the previous week. - Mod.LL]

[2] Epidemiological fenugreek seed link

New trace-back investigations in German and French _E. coli_
outbreaks are pointing to 2 lots of fenugreek seeds that were imported
from Egypt, according to the latest threat assessment from European
officials.

Sprouts from Egyptian fenugreek seeds are suspected in both a cluster
of French _E coli_ O104:H4 illnesses and the large outbreak in Germany
involving the same strain, the European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said
in a risk assessment today [29 Jun 2011]. But the agencies cautioned
that there is no lab evidence yet tying the seeds to the outbreaks.

The ECDC and the EFSA said they have urgently requested that the
German-based company that imported the seeds help them track other
customers who received fenugreek seeds from the 2 lots.

Officials suspect that Egyptian fenugreek seeds imported in 2009 are
linked to the French cluster and that a batch from 2010 is linked to
the German outbreak. The ECDC identified the seed importer as AGA SAAT
GMBH, based in Dusseldorf, Germany. It said a UK company that
reportedly supplied the sprout seeds linked to the French cluster
obtained the seeds from AGA SAAT GMBH.

So far investigators have not found a sprout connection to a Swedish
_E coli_ O104:H4 case reported yesterday [28 Jun 2011], but the
investigation is ongoing, the ECDC said. The patient, a man from
southern Sweden, does not have a travel history to Germany and does
not recall eating sprouts. Food safety experts have cautioned that
sprout consumption can be hard to trace, because the item often
appears inconspicuously in salads, sandwiches, and garnishes.

Warnings about sprout consumption should cover all sprouts, because
seeds sold for sprouting are often sold as mixes, and
cross-contamination could occur during repackaging, the ECDC said. The
ECDC and the EFSA are urging consumers not to grow their own sprouts
and to avoid eating sprouts unless they have been thoroughly cooked.

If the link between the French cluster and the German outbreak is
confirmed, more _E coli_ O104:H4 cases are expected in Europe, along
with other countries that received the contaminated seeds, the ECDC
warned. It urged clinicians to be on alert to quickly identify new _E.
coli_ infections that might be part of clusters or the outbreak.

[A common link at the seed level would explain why locally sprouted
produce could contain the same pathogen. We await the probable finding
of other cases like the Swedish non-linked case and another previously
reported from Denmark, and the epidemiology of those cases.

Fenugreek (_Trigonella foenum-graecum_) is a plant in the family
Fabaceae. Fenugreek is used both as a herb (the leaves) and as a spice
(the seed, often called methi). The plant is cultivated worldwide as a
semi-arid crop and is a common ingredient in many curries -- see more
info and picture in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenugreek. -

says:
"But the agencies cautioned that there is no lab evidence yet tying
the seeds to the outbreaks." - Mod.JW]
