Meningitis toll rising in Burkina Faso
----------------------------------------
Health officials in Burkina Faso say that more than 600 people have
died so far this year in an outbreak of meningitis.
The officials say the strain of the disease, known as W-135, is found
only in Saudi Arabia, and they believe it was brought to Burkina Faso
by Muslim pilgrims returning from Mecca after the Hajj.
Last week the authorities said they would start offering free vaccines
and health care to fight the disease, but World Health Organization
officials say there are just 25 000 doses of vaccine for the Saudi strain
in the world, and none are available in Burkina Faso.
Last year, meningitis [including serogroup W135 claimed almost 2000
lives out of some 13 000 cases reported in Burkina Faso.
The worst outbreak in recent years was in 1996, when 4000 people died.

Meningococcal disease in Burkina Faso - Update 2
----------------------------------------------
As of 20 Mar 2002, WHO has reported 3 579 cases including 544
deaths (case-fatality rate, 15%) in the entire country. Twelve out of 15
districts have reached the epidemic threshold and 13 districts are on
alert for reaching the threshold. Vaccination campaigns were carried
out in 2001 and recently in 2002 (see previous report) .
_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory
confirmed in cases from 5 districts by the WHO Collaborating Centre
for Reference and Research on Meningococci, Oslo, Norway.
A Crisis Committee has been set up by the Ministry of Health, Burkina
Faso. A WHO team is working with the Committee to consider the
most appropriate strategy to control the outbreak, given the presence of
the W135 strain. Measures include epidemiological surveillance,
collection and testing of samples, social mobilization, training and
coordination.

Meningitis Deaths Now 544, New Strain Present
----------------------------
Meningitis has killed 544 people in Burkina Faso since January [2002
a leading government health official, Dr. Jean Wango, secretary-general
of the Health Ministry, said on Wednesday, but he called for calm.
Since January [2002, he said, there had been 3574 cases of meningitis
in Burkina Faso; 10 of the country's 53 health districts have been
declared epidemic zones, with at least 10 cases reported for every 100
000 inhabitants. Officials said the high death rate was due to low levels
of vaccination.
Meningitis is an infection of the fluid in a person's spinal cord and the
fluid that surrounds the brain. In Africa, the disease often surfaces
during annual dry seasons when strong desert winds blow south,
raining in dust over the area. Wango said the dust and heat wave
presented favourable conditions for the disease, which affected
thousands of people from Senegal, in the west of the continent, to
Ethiopia in the east.
Officials are offering free vaccinations and health care for people in the
13 worst hit health districts in Burkina Faso, while the World Health
Organisation (WHO) has said it would provide the government with
1.9 million doses of vaccines.
Officials also said a new strain of the disease, the W135 meningitis
germ present in Saudi Arabia, has appeared in Burkina Faso, most
likely brought by pilgrims from Mecca in 2000. Vaccines to counter
this strain are not yet available in Burkina Faso where, officials said; till
now only meningitis forms A and C were present.
Researchers from at the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and WHO are in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger
investigating the Saudi meningitis strain. A WHO specialist on
meningitis told IRIN on Thursday that there was a worldwide scarcity
of the Tetravalent vaccine (which combats the meningitis strains A, C,
Y and W135). Saudi authorities, the official said, were now demanding
that all pilgrims to Mecca be vaccinated against meningitis before being
allowed entry into the country.
In January, health officials launched a US $1.66 million "mass
prevention campaign" against meningitis aimed at immunising 3 million
people aged from 2- 30 years. In 2001, meningitis killed 1854 of the 13
293 cases registered in Burkina Faso; but the worst recent occurrence
was in 1996 when 4000 died.
[Prior to the Hadj related meningococcal W135 outbreaks in 2000 and
2001, W135 was a sporadic isolate in cases of W135. Of interest is the
warning of possible W135 outbreak activity related to the Hadj in 1995
(ref. 8). This outbreak in Burkina Faso suggests that serotype W135
may [now be a predominant "player" in meningitis outbreaks in the
classical meningitis belt in sub-Saharan Africa. It had already been
identified as one of the serotypes in circulation in Burkina Faso at the
end of 2001 (ref.1), [responsible for 37% of cases - JW.
Currently, vaccine that includes the W135 component is not used in
Africa for meningitis control programs. It is not clear from these
articles if W135 is the predominant strain responsible for the outbreak
or just for small numbers of isolates tested that were positive for
W135. Information on the true contribution of W135 to the ongoing
outbreak is important. If W135 becomes a predominant organism
responsible for meningitis epidemics in Africa, it carries significant cost
implications for the region in terms of meningitis control programs and
activities.
