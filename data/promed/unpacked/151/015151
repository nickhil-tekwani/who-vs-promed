Researchers determined that Chapare virus likely spread from person to person during a deadly outbreak in Bolivia, according to findings presented at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual Meeting.

Chapare virus belongs to a family of viruses known as arenaviruses, which include pathogens such as Lassa and Machupo viruses. Arenaviruses are usually spread via contact with an infected rodent or its feces, according to the CDC.

Researchers found that Chapare virus caused at least 5 infections near La Paz, Bolivia in 2019, 3 of which were fatal, and infections occurred through encounters with infected patients.

It was only the 2nd Chapare virus outbreak on record, according to a press release. The 1st occurred in 2004, 370 miles away from the more current outbreak, and consisted of a small cluster and only one confirmed case. Patients in the 2019 outbreak reported fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting, bleeding gums, rash, and pain behind their eyes.

According to the release, the latest outbreak "surprised health authorities" because they initially only knew that it was a hemorrhagic fever presenting similarly to Ebola. This "sparked a rapid mobilization of infectious disease experts," according to the release.

Outbreak data showed that a medical resident, who later died from Chapare [virus infection], may have been infected while suctioning saliva from a patient, according to findings presented at the meeting. Another patient, an ambulance medic who survived infection, was likely infected while resuscitating the medical resident during transport. Additionally, researchers were able to detect viral RNA in the semen of another survivor more than 168 days after infection, raising the possibility of sexual transmission.

"Our work confirmed that a young medical resident, an ambulance medic, and a gastroenterologist all contracted the virus after encounters with infected patients, and 2 of these healthcare workers later died," Caitlin Cossaboom, DVM, PhD, MPH, an epidemiologist with the CDC's Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, said in the press release. "We now believe many bodily fluids can potentially carry the virus."

Cossaboom and colleagues think Chapare virus could have been circulating in Bolivia for several years, with some infected patients being wrongly diagnosed as suffering from dengue. Although the cause of the outbreak is still unknown, the researchers presented evidence that Chapare viral RNA was detected in pigmy rice rats [genus _Oligoryzomys_] and small-eared pigmy rice rats [_Oligoryzomys microtis_] from areas near La Paz [department].

According to Cossaboom, the confirmation of human-to-human transmission demonstrates that anyone dealing with suspected cases "must take extreme care" to avoid contact with items contaminated with blood, urine, saliva, or semen.

[Last year (2019), ProMED-mail posted a report of these 5 Chapare virus-infected patients in La Paz department, 3 of whom died (see Chapare virus - Bolivia: (LP) 20190719.657399). The above report provides additional information about those cases and the evidence for person-to-person transmission of this virus, as well as persistence of virus RNA in semen for 168 days.

It would be interesting to know whether infectious virus was also present in semen for this extended period or just reflected the presence of non-infectious fragments of the viral RNA. The rodent hosts are most likely infected chronically, but asymptomatically, shedding virus in excreta. The human index case above probably acquired his virus from the infected rodent.
