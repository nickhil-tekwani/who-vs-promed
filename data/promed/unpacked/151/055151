JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS: VACCINE UPDATE

Further to the ProMED-mail posting Japanese
encephalitis - Taiwan & Taiwan ex China (GD)
20100713.2348 of 13 Jul 10, the moderator
mentions: "...There are 2 JE virus vaccines
available, an attenuated product (SA 14-14-2)
manufactured in China and an inactivated one (Biken) from Japan..."

To my knowledge:
- at least in the USA and Canada, the SA 14-14-2
JE vaccine is inactivated although the vaccine
strain used is "attenuated" (?
"neuroattenuated"), that is, IXIARO manufactured
by Intercell AG (I don't believe it is manufactured in China).
- the inactivated Biken vaccine, called JE-VAX in
the USA and Canada, is no longer manufactured and
is essentially no longer available for use.
- there are other SA 14-14-2 JE vaccines
manufactured, for example in China, that are
"live" but these are not marketed in the USA or Canada.
- there are several other JE vaccines
manufactured, principally in Asia, such as,
JENCEVAC from (I believe) Green Cross/Korea.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Tepper for the update on
the current status of JE virus vaccines for use
in Canada and the USA. Another alert ProMED
subscriber also indicated that the Biken vaccine
is no longer being manufactured and the new JE vaccine is IXIARO.

The 12 Mar 2010 issue of the CDC Weekly Morbidity
and Mortality Report has an extensive report on
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices for JE virus vaccines
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5901a1.htm>
stating in the introduction:

"JE vaccines licensed in the United States
------------------------------------------
Two JE vaccines are licensed in the United
States; an inactivated mouse brain--derived
vaccine (JE-VAX [JE-MB]) and an inactivated Vero
cell culture-derived vaccine (IXIARO [JE-VC]).
JE-MB has been licensed in the United States
since 1992 for use in travelers aged Â„1 year. In
2006, production of JE-MB was discontinued, and
the remaining supplies are limited. JE-MB had
been manufactured in Japan by The Research
Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka
University (Biken, Osaka, Japan) and is currently
distributed in the United States by Sanofi
Pasteur (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). In March
2009, FDA approved JE-VC for use in persons aged
17 years or older. JE-VC is manufactured by
Intercell Biomedical (Livingston, United Kingdom)
and is distributed in the United States by
Novartis Vaccines (Cambridge, Massachusetts).
Because JE-VC is approved only for use in persons
aged 17 years or older, JE-MB remains the only JE
vaccine approved for use in children in the
United States. To meet the JE vaccine needs for
children in the United States, Sanofi Pasteur has
reserved its remaining JE-MB inventory for use in
children aged 1-16 years. Health-care providers
should contact Sanofi Pasteur to order doses of
JE-MB. Other JE vaccines, including
live-attenuated SA14-14-2 JE vaccine, are
manufactured and used in Asia but are not
licensed for use in the United States."

This report provides additional information on
composition, immunogenicity, storage requirements
and adverse events for each of the 2 vaccines.

The WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine
Safety states on its undated website
(<http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/topics/japanese_encephalitis/en/index.html>):
"Licensed JE vaccines include inactivated mouse
brain-derived vaccines, a Vero cell-derived
inactivated vaccine, and a live attenuated
SA14-14-2 vaccine produced in primary hamster
kidney cells. Currently, there is no JE vaccine
which is WHO-prequalified. Recognizing the burden
of disease, more countries are introducing JE
vaccination into their routine paediatric
schedules. The inactivated mouse brain-derived
vaccine is gradually being replaced by the live
attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine. In addition,
several candidate vaccines are in late stage
development, and are expected to be licensed in
the near future. With improved vaccines becoming
available, the global demand for JE vaccines is
projected to more than double by 2012. Last
