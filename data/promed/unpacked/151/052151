[This report confirms a previously suspected geographic addition to
the extent of these Asia 1 serotype outbreaks. Since December 2005,
there have been outbreaks in ShanDong, Ningxia, Jiangxi, Gansu,
Qinghai and now Hubei province.
There was no mortality in the cases identified here. This is compared
to the almost 50 percent mortality from the Asia 1 strain recently
seen in Viet Nam.
