Possible West Nile virus transmission to an infant through breastfeeding
--------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Michigan
Department of Community Health (MDCH) continue to investigate West Nile
Virus (WNV) infection in a woman who received a blood product later found
to contain evidence of WNV, and in her child, who was exposed to breast
milk later found to be WNV-positive by TaqMan速 (1). This report updates the
findings of this investigation.

On 2 Sep 2002, a woman aged 40 years delivered a healthy infant but needed
transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBC) for anemia. The
patient received the first unit 6 hours after delivery and the second on
the following day. The second transfusion was derived from the same
donation as a unit of platelets given to a liver transplant recipient who
developed confirmed West Nile meningoencephalitis (WNME); the blood donor's
original tubing segment from this common donation was WNV positive by
TaqMan速 (1). About 2 hours after delivery, the patient developed a migraine
headache, photophobia, and anomia. The patient had a history of migraine
headaches. When she was discharged 2 days after delivery, her headache was
resolving. She developed a severe, persistent headache 8 days later that
differed qualitatively from her migraine headache. The patient reported
developing fever 12 days after delivery, and 3 days later she was admitted
with a fever of 102.8 degrees F (39.3 C) and peripheral white blood count
(WBC) of 2900/mm3 (normal: 3900-11 100 / mm3). Laboratory examination of
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed a WBC of 134/mm3 (normal: <10/mm3)
with 10 per cent neutrophils, a protein concentration of 57 mg/dL (normal:
12--60 mg/dL), and a glucose concentration of 57 mg/dL (normal: 40--70
mg/dL). Computerized tomography of the head was normal. A CSF sample tested
at MDCH was positive for WNV-specific IgM. The woman recovered from WNME
and was discharged from the hospital.

On the day of delivery, the mother began breastfeeding her child and
continued (6 days after symptom onset) through the second day of her
hospital admission for WNME. An undiluted sample of breast milk obtained 16
days after delivery tested positive for WNV by TaqMan速 and for WNV-specific
IgM and IgG antibody at CDC. Virus culture of this specimen is pending.
Testing of a second sample of breast milk collected 24 days after the
implicated transfusion was WNV RNA-negative by TaqMan速 at MDCH and CDC but
a 1:400 dilution of this sample was again WNV-specific IgM positive at CDC.
Although the infant has remained afebrile and healthy, a serum sample from
the infant at age 25 days was WNV-specific IgM positive in testing
performed at MDCH and CDC. No cord blood or other products of conception
were available for testing. The mother reported that the infant has had
little outdoor or other exposure to mosquitoes.

Editorial Note:
Since WNV was first recognized in the United States in 1999, the infant in
this report is the youngest person reported with WNV-specific IgM. Although
clinically well, this child was born to a woman who developed WNME 9 days
after receiving WNV-contaminated blood after delivery and was breastfed for
the first 17 days. IgM antibodies might be expressed in human milk at low
concentrations, but passive transfer of IgM antibodies through breast milk
is inefficient (2). As a result, the presence of measurable WNV-specific
IgM in the infant suggests independent IgM production by the infant as a
result of WNV infection.

Although WNV genetic material was present transiently in breast milk, the
specific timing and source of the infant's infection remain unclear.
Because neither WNV nor WNV-specific nucleic acids have been identified
previously in human breast milk, the implications of this finding are
unknown. In addition, maternal infection probably occurred when the mother
received a transfusion during the immediate postpartum period, making it
unlikely that infection occurred in utero. Because of the infant's minimal
outdoor exposure, it is unlikely that infection was acquired from a
mosquito. Therefore, breast milk must be considered as the most likely
source of infection.

WNV illnesses in children aged <1 year appear to be rare. From 1999 to
2001, no cases were reported to CDC. In 2002, 4 infants with WNV illnesses
have been reported (ages 2, 3, 9, and 11 months) to ArboNET (CDC,
unpublished data, 2002). Retrospective investigations are under way to
determine if these infants were potentially infected with WNV through
breastfeeding. Laboratory investigations, including attempts to culture WNV
from additional breast milk samples, are under way. Until live virus is
cultured from breast milk, or until definitive data are obtained to
document WNV transmission through breast milk, the findings described in
this report should be interpreted with caution.

The infant described in this report remains healthy. Because the health
benefits of breastfeeding are well established (2) and the risk for WNV
transmission through breastfeeding is unknown, these findings do not
suggest a change in breastfeeding recommendations.

[This is now year 4 for West Nile virus activity in the USA, with this year
being the worst in terms of geographic spread and numbers of human and
animal cases. Given this, the finding that there have been only 4 cases of
WNV infection in infants less than 1 year of age *reported* to date
suggests that if infection is occurring among infants, WNV is not
entertained as a possible diagnosis for the mild, self-limiting febrile
illness it produces.

The last paragraph of the editorial comment of this report is crucial:
"Because the health benefits of breastfeeding are well established and the
risk for WNV transmission through breastfeeding is unknown, these findings
do not suggest a change in breastfeeding recommendations." - Mod.MPP]
