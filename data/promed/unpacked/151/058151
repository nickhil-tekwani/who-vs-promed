A downtown Chicago hotel is spreading the message to recent guests that they may have been exposed to a bacterium that causes respiratory infections. 3 recent cases of a fast-spreading, sometimes fatal disease have been traced to the JW Marriott hotel at 151 W. Adams St., the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

The bacteria, _Legionella_ [spp.], spreads through the inhalation of contaminated water vapor, and can cause Legionnaire's disease, a severe form of pneumonia, Fox Chicago reports. Symptoms include headache, chills, chest pain and fever. The disease often mirrors regular pneumonia, and can only be confirmed by a urine test, infectious disease expert Dr. John Segreti told CBS Chicago. [The diagnosis of Legionnaire's disease can also be confirmed by culture or PCR of respiratory secretions and serology, in addition to the Legionella urinary antigen test.]

Dr. Kathy Ritger with the Department of Public Health told WBEZ that not all exposures lead to illness, but any recent guests experiencing respiratory problems should seek medical attention.

A hotline has been set up by Chicago Department of Public Health to answer questions from people who may have been exposed, according to ABC Chicago. That phone number is available at the source URL, above.

[Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis; more than 70 percent of cases of Legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf). The news report above does not say how the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was made, nor what the species of _Legionella_ was implicated in the 3 cases associated with the Chicago hotel.

The following has been extracted from the U.S. CDC document Travel-Associated Legionnaires' Disease at http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/faq.htm:

"About 20-25 percent of all Legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated. Legionnaires' disease is important to diagnose and to report because its identification implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to be exposed. Clusters of Legionnaires' disease associated with travel to hotels or aboard cruise ships are rarely detected by individual clinicians or health departments; travelers typically disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms. Therefore, a travel history should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms."

Because of the multi-state nature of travel in the U. S., national-level surveillance is necessary to detect outbreaks of travel-associated Legionnaires' disease. The CDC relies upon state and local health departments to conduct this surveillance.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype in patient specimens suggests transmission from a common source. Because _L. pneumophila_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir should be demonstrated by means of genotyping methods (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

Frequently, however, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks because the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. In the latter case genotyping of clinical isolates is, of course, not possible.

Chicago, with approximately 2.7 million residents, is the largest city in the state of Illinois, the 3rd most populous city in the United States, and is an international hub for finance, commerce, industry, telecommunications, and transportation, with O'Hare International Airport being the 2nd-busiest airport in the world in terms of traffic movements; in 2008, the city hosted 45.6 million domestic and overseas visitors (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago). - Mod.ML
