Recent concerns about a parasitic tapeworm have come up in letters to
the editor and at Idaho Fish and Game Commission meetings.

The tiny tapeworms -- known as _Echinococcus granulosus_ -- are not
new to Idaho. And health experts say incidents of human disease from
this tapeworm are rare.

The tapeworm is endemic in most sheep raising areas of the world.
Cysts formed by the tapeworm larvae were found in domestic sheep from
Idaho that were sent to California for slaughter in the late 1960s
and early 1970s.

Cysts were found in a mountain goat in 2006 and in mule deer and elk
in subsequent years in several areas of central Idaho.

Adult tapeworms were found in 39 of 63 (62 percent) wolves collected
from 2006 to 2008 in Idaho. Similar prevalence occurs in Montana.

Coyotes and foxes have not been tested for the tapeworm, and the
prevalence rate is unknown.

All the wolves captured in Canada and relocated in Yellowstone
National Park and central Idaho in 1995 and 1996 were sampled for
disease in blood and feces and for external parasites. They also were
treated twice for lice, roundworms and tapeworms before being released.

This tapeworm requires 2 hosts to complete its life cycle. Tapeworm
larvae form cysts in the body cavities of deer, elk, moose, domestic
sheep and domestic cattle; dogs, wolves, coyotes and foxes pick up
tapeworm larvae when they eat infected ungulates. The tapeworms
mature and live in the small intestines of the canines. Adult
tapeworms produce eggs that are expelled in feces. Ungulates, in
turn, ingest the eggs while grazing. The eggs hatch and develop into
larvae, and the cycle continues.

Human infections with the tapeworm are rare, but have been found
worldwide. In Idaho, at least 3 reports of human infections are
known, with the earliest dating to 1938. Throughout the world, most
human cases occur in indigenous people with close contact with infected dogs.

Humans can be infected by ingesting eggs from feces, usually from a
domestic dog. In humans, cysts usually develop in the liver or lungs.
Symptoms depend on cyst location and size. The disease is treatable
with drugs or surgery.

Where the parasite is found in wolves and wild ungulates, most
wildlife management and public health agencies consider the public
health significance to be low. Normally, the tapeworm is not harmful
to carnivores. But heavy infections may be associated with diarrhea
or poor body condition. In ungulates, the presence of large numbers
of cysts can lead to respiratory difficulty. The presence of cysts in
livestock at slaughter is generally not of concern, and if present,
is trimmed from the edible product.

Tips to Avoid Infection
-----------
The potential for human exposure to the tapeworm eggs in wolf feces
or fecal contaminated hides is relatively low.

Human health and wildlife agencies encourage hunters to use latex or
rubber gloves when handling dog or wolf feces and when skinning and
field dressing wolves, coyotes and foxes.

Idaho Fish and Game encourages all hunters to wear latex or rubber
gloves when field dressing and skinning any wildlife carcass.

All wild game meat should always be cooked thoroughly. Do not feed
uncooked meat or organs of deer, elk, moose or sheep to dogs.

Regular deworming of domestic dogs and good hygienic practices, such
as wearing rubber or latex gloves when handling feces and washing
hands after handling feces by anyone in contact with dogs and dog
feces are the best methods of control and prevention of the tapeworm in humans.

[The main hosts of _Echinococcus granulosis_ are dogs or other
canids; they excrete eggs which may infect humans or other mammals
like sheep, deer, elk and moose. The eggs may stay infectious for a
long time in the environment.

The US is regarded as a low risk area for echinococcosis, with only
sporadic cases, but the data cited in this report indicate that it
may be more widespread than previously thought.
