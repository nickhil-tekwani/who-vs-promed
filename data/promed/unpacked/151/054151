Opening of tick season (epidemic preparedness) -- Russia (Sverdlovsk oblast)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The media service of the regional Rospotrebnadzor [a federal agency
for protection of consumer rights and human welfare] advises that tick
bite activity is expected to start in early April this year. It is
particularly connected with Parent's day, when many people visit
cemeteries. This year it falls on 13 Apr 2010.

Tick density last year was approximately 55 specimens per km. on
average, which was measured by dragging a special piece of white
canvas [a flag] through the grass for 1 km. This year the tick density
is expected to be less, but not in all territories.

There were 36 000 tick bites last year [2009], which led to 222
confirmed cases of tick-borne encephalitis [TBE]; 26 people, including
a child had neurological consequences with disability; 61 cases were
severe and 4 people died from TBE. These alarming statistics are due
to low vaccine coverage.

There were 800 000 immunizations last year which helped to provide 86
percent coverage of the at risk population. However 95 percent
coverage is needed for effective prevention. The vaccine is available
from 2 suppliers, 1 local and 1 foreign. The local vaccine costs 150
rubles [5 USD] and the imported one -- 400 rubles [13 USD]. The
vaccine can be administered to patients aged 12 months or more.
Immunity develops 2 weeks after immunization. To prevent more cases,
land treatment activities are planned; the territory around schools,
preschools, cemeteries and other places will be treated with anti-tick
chemicals.
