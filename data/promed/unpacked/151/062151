THE COMING PLAGUE: TV DOCUMENTARY, BRIEF REVIEWS

All-in-all, the program was excellent.
Shortcomings: overdramatization
of the risks and the exposures of the field investigators. Not to
denigrate this in the least -- it's just TV's way of keeping you on
the channel. Also, there were a rather select group of expert participants.
Also, no mention of the technology (ie. this mailing list) that helps
provide support for emerging diseases.
Strengths: Showing the horrible medical conditions in many (African)
regions. The pitiful facilities, lack of clean water, drugs, and
transportation. Also a very insightful presentation of the cultural
role of sex workers in Africa and India -- and the very difficult
task of changing these cultural norms.
Wished they would have: Shown more detail of the laboratory work
required to support viral identification. Also a more graphic
visualization of the impact of these diseases. Even with the numbers
quoted, it is difficult to visualize in one's mind the severity of
the impacts.
Again: Solid facts, excellent presentation of the brave persons involved,
and no casting of US social standards into the rest of the world.

Classically, the movie is not as good as the book....
The Coming Plague documentary so far has given viewers glossy and
sexy profiles of a few of the most eminent doctors/epidemiologists in the
field and a noble, but ultimately thin, overview of the AIDS pandemic.
Unfortunately, the program lacks the pacing of Laurie Garrett's great
book. Too often it seems to switch gears from disease to disease, time
period to time period, location to location, without building the case of the
sociological, political, historical, environmental, and economic factors in
the emergence and resurgence of infectious diseases which made
Garrett's book much more important than a collection of outbreak
narratives.
[I believe that will be covered in Part 2 - Mod.JW]
It also is very thin on science in terms of explaining what
virus are, how they infect humans, jump species, treatments....
Positively, it is a fascinating program to those who are not entirely
familiar with the impacts and history of infectious diseases (or the book).
The program does do an outstanding job packaging information into
highly understandble concepts for people who know nothing of the
science and epidemiology of infectious diseases. It would make an
excellent introductory education tool and promotes awareness
effectively.
I watched the program with several people who are not
familiar with the subject matter at all and each felt it was an excellent
production and really shed light on issues that they were not remotely
aware of.
I look forward to seeing the next installment.

I thought the first two hours were remarkably error-free (other than for
dating the Kikwit outbreak in 1994), balanced, and objective. Especially
instructive was Joe McCormick's comment about hemorrhagic fever viruses such
as Ebola:
"These hemorrhagic viruses are scary enough without making them into science
fiction. Doctors don't need space suits to treat patients or space capsules
to move them about. Mostly they need compassion and common sense: gloves,
surgical masks, barrier nursing, and proper sanitary procedures. Ebola
withers in the face of proper hospital procedures. It isn't going to sweep
the world killing a billion people. That's just not the way it works."
(Joe McCormick, M.D., former chief of the CDC's Special Pathogens Branch,
now of the Institut Pasteur.)
