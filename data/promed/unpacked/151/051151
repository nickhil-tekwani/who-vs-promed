The tomato mosaic virus disease, which is raging these days in the Negev [southern Israel], is destroying entire tomato greenhouses.

The exceptionally hot weather, in addition to the virus, has hit tomato and cucumber crops. According to the Farmers Association, tomato yields have decreased by 40 per cent due to the heat wave and 10 per cent more because of the virus.

[_Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is an economically important disease of glasshouse and field tomatoes. It can affect a wide range of solanaceous hosts and species in several other families, including many crops. On tomato, symptoms may include leaf mottling and distortion ('fern leaf'), discolouration of flowers, reduced fruit set, and stunting of plants; fruit may show blotches, mottling, internal necrosis, and distortions. Symptom expression is influenced by environmental conditions, age of plants at infection, virus strains, and host cultivars.

The virus is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means (human and insect activities), as well as with contaminated equipment, plant or other materials. Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion, but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting of tools, removal of crop debris) and control of weed reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial.

The closely related type species of the genus, _Tobacco mosaic virus_ (TMV), causes very similar symptoms on tomato.
