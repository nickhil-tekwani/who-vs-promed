In Panama, coffee rust (_Hemileia vastatrix_) was detected for the 1st time in August 2012 in the Chiriqui province and then spread to all coffee-production areas of Panama. It is estimated that 46 per cent of the crops are affected. Phytosanitary measures are being taken to prevent any further spread of the disease (MIDA [Ministerio de Desarrollo Agropecuario], 2013).

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

The emergence in Central America of a new fungal strain adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, is making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. In Guatemala, nearly 40 per cent of the nation's coffee plantings were affected by the new strain in 2011/12 (ProMED-mail post 20120511.1129720). A new more aggressive leaf rust strain is also suspected to be emerging in Colombia (ProMED-mail posts 20100526.1745, 20091008.3490, and 20090225.0773). Information on the strain(s) involved in an outbreak in Jamaica is still needed. The current outbreak in the region is regarded as one of the most severe attacks of the fungus on record (see CLR update at link below).

Given the wide distribution of the pathogen in the region, including Panama's neighbours, it seems surprising that the disease has not been reported in the country before. It is not clear which strain has been detected.
