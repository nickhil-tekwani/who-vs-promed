[Brucellosis is considered to be a Category B bioterrorism agent which
is, in nature, acquired as a zoonotic infection by humans. Its
manifestations are protean, including undulant fever, with positive
blood and/or bone marrow cultures, and it is a cause of localized
disease in many organ systems including skeletal, urinary tract,
central nervous system, liver, cardiac, and lung. The reader is
referred to Young EJ: Human brucellosis. Rev Infect Dis. 1983; 5(5):
821-42; (available at
http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/5/821.full.pdf+html) for a
review of these manifestations. - Mod.LL
