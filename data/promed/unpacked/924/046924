Poliomyelitis in Angola - Update 25 Aug 2005
--------------------
As of 23 August, 7 cases of polio have been reported. 5 provinces have been
affected: Bengo, Benguela, Luanda, Lunda Sul, and Moxico. The most recent
case, in Benguela, had an onset of 12 Jul 2005. This case occurred before
the 1st National Immunization Day (NID) campaign on 29 Jul 2005.
A 2nd NID will be held tomorrow, 26 August. In order to ensure rapid
interruption of the virus transmission in Angola, a 3rd round of NIDs has
been planned for late September 2005. The partners in the Polio Eradication
Initiative in Angola have asked the international community for financial
support to help them carry out this campaign.

[The above update represents an increase in 5 cases since the last
ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak (see ref. below). As a reminder, the
strain of virus identified in this outbreak was from India, not from the
ongoing polio transmission elsewhere in Africa that has been related to
transmission in Nigeria and the Sudan.
Information on the appeal for additional funding for these activities in
Angola can be found at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/PolioSpecialAlertAugust2005.pdf
>. The appeal is for an immediate sum of USD 1.8 million to conduct the
3rd round of polio national immunization days (NIDs) and includes the
following text:
"It would be recalled that Angola witnessed one of the largest polio
epidemic outbreaks in Africa in 1999 with about 1117 children paralyzed and
leaving 113 dead. Technical and financial support provided by the partners
over the years enabled the country to become polio-free since September
2001. The importation of this virus constitutes a major threat not only to
the country but to the entire region in the drive to interrupt poliovirus
transmission by the end of December 2005. If this transmission is not
halted in the next 4 months, Angola would have re-established wild
poliovirus transmission. Failure to halt transmission could also lead to
spread of virus to neighboring countries such as Republic of Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and Zambia or even beyond the confine
of the sub-region or region."
