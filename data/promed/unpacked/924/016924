On 23 Mar [2022], Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System officials reported the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) quarantined a Ponoka County, Alberta, premises after a horse there tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA).

An accredited veterinarian had drawn a test sample from the horse at the owner's request in preparation for export to the United States. The horse did not exhibit any clinical signs when sampling occurred.

The CFIA is investigating and has put movement controls on other contact animals on the premises. Controls will remain in effect until all disease response protocols have been fulfilled, including additional testing and ordering confirmed cases be destroyed.

Officials have recommended improved biosecurity measures to the owners and might perform trace-out activities at additional premises as required by policy.

About EIA
---------
Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test to travel across state lines.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit
- progressive condition loss;
- muscle weakness;
- poor stamina;
- fever;
- depression; and
- anemia.

EIA has no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with the disease dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yd [183 m] away from unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) confirmed a 3-year-old Quarter Horse stallion on a Riverside County, California, premises as positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) 2 May [2022] while being tested for interstate movement to a racetrack. The horse originated from Tulare County.

As a result of the positive test, 27 exposed horses at the Riverside County facility and 34 exposed horses at the Tulare County facility are now under official quarantine. All Riverside County premises horses have tested negative and will remain under quarantine until retesting in 60 days. Test results for the Tulare County horses are pending. CDFA officials are investigating whether any other horses were exposed.

The Equine Disease Communication Center released this information on 5 May 2022.

["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a viral disease affecting only members of the Equidae family (horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys). There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Infection is often in-apparent and results in a lifelong carrier state if the horse survives the acute phase of the infection. EIA is found widely throughout the world. There is no evidence that EIA is a threat to human health. EIA is a reportable animal disease in all states.

"The clinical signs are often nonspecific and of variable severity. Clinical signs in an acute case can range from fever and decreased appetite to severe anemia and sudden death. It is often difficult to differentiate EIA from other diseases. Incubation period is a week to 60 days or longer.

"Additional clinical signs in an acute case can include
- jaundice (yellow discoloration of mucous membranes);
- rapid breathing, rapid heart rate;
- swelling of limbs;
- bleeding from the nose, or red/purple spots on mucous membranes; and
- blood-stained feces.

"Horses surviving the acute phase of the disease become chronic, in-apparent carriers. Some carriers may develop recurrent flare-ups, often following another stress: illness or strenuous work. While donkeys and mules have the ability to contract this virus, most remain non-clinical."

"Natural transmission of EIA is by blood-feeding flies (horse flies and deer flies) and is limited to relatively short distances. This virus is frequently transmitted via unclean or re-used needles and syringes, blood transfusions, and contaminated instruments (IV sets, dental instruments, tattoo equipment). Mares can transmit the virus to foals in utero, and, less likely, transmission can occur via milk or semen.

"There is no treatment for EIA. Because infected animals become lifelong carriers, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined or euthanized."

"Reducing exposure to biting flies through management practices may reduce the spread of infection. To prevent iatrogenic spread, never reuse needles, syringes, or IV sets; use only new, clean needles with injectable medicines and use only licensed and approved blood products. Blood transfusions should be performed only by licensed veterinarians using donor horses tested negative for EIA and other blood-borne infections like equine piroplasmosis.

"Surveillance and testing are the best methods of prevention. Since EIA control efforts began over 40 years ago, the reactor rate has fallen from 4% to 0.004% in 2017 among tested animals. USDA recommends testing every equid annually.

"There is no vaccine approved for use in the US."

It is unfortunate there is no vaccine in the US. Equine owners have pleaded for a vaccine for decades now and wonder why their cries are ignored. Equine groups have often lamented the lack of technology or funding, but there seems to be no answers from those who research, fund, or develop vaccines.

However, there may now be a form of treatment, or certainly some hope on the horizon. Readers are requested to see the following ProMED post: Equine infectious anemia: potential treatment 20211209.8700153. - Mod.TG]
