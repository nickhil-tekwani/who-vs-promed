In 1996, we reported a case of _S. suis_ type 2 meningitis in a 52-
year-old female pig farmer with no past medical history. She
reported that a few months earlier a number of her pigs had been
treated with penicillin for _S. suis_ meningitis; during the week
preceding her illness, she recalled having moved 4 dead pigs
without gloves or any particular hygienic precautions.
She was treated with ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 h for 2 days and
penicillin G 24 MU/day for 3 weeks. The fever fell rapidly but she
developed a mild left neurosensorial hypoacousia of cochlear type,
which improved partially during treatment and resolved completely
after 6 months.
At the time of our report, only 3 other cases of human infection
with _S. suis_ had been identified in North America, and our case
was the first of meningitis described in Quebec.
