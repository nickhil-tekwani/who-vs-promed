Plantain diseases hit Charlotteville
------------------------------------
Farmers in Charlotteville [Tobago] say they are experiencing huge
financial losses due to a fungus that has overtaken their plantain and
banana fields.

A farmer explained that for the past 2 years he has been battling the
fungus and many other farmers are also experiencing the same problem.
He said that the marketing department has refused to pick up over 520
lb [about 240 kg] of bananas and plantains which he harvested in the
past week.

He added that for the past 2 years, he has been trying to get help
from the division of Agriculture to eradicate this fungus, but to date
no one has come to his aid.

[Several fungal diseases are known to affect banana and plantain
(_Musa_ species and hybrids) in the region. Outbreaks of fungal leaf
spots (black and/or yellow sigatoka; _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ and
_M. musicola_, respectively) have been reported recently from the
Caribbean (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below). Black
sigatoka was reported to have arrived in Trinidad & Tobago in 2003
(ProMED-mail post 20040811.2223), and panama disease (also called
fusarium wilt; _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_) is also
re-emerging in the region.

The fungi can be spread by infected planting material, mechanical
means (including people and insect activities), soil, wind, and water.
Disease management usually requires an integrated approach but may
include fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, and
cultural practices.
