[A] hantavirus has been confirmed as the cause of death of a Deschutes
County resident in central Oregon.

KTVZ-TV in Bend reports the Deschutes County Health Department
announced the death on Monday [14 Mar 2011]. No other details were
available. Officials said it was the 16th case of hantavirus
[infection] confirmed in Oregon since 1993 and the 4th in Deschutes
County.

Although rare in the United States, [hantaviruses] can cause lung
problems which can be fatal if not treated.

The disease [virus] is carried primarily by rodents, especially the
deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. The most common human exposure
occurs during cleaning and working in spaces that have been inhabited
by mice, such as garages, sheds, barns, and crawl spaces.

[Although not specified, the hantavirus involved in this fatal case is
most likely Sin Nombre virus. Its rodent host is the deer mouse
_Peromyscus maniculatus_. It would be of interest to know the details
concerning the individual and the circumstances under which the
infection was acquired.
