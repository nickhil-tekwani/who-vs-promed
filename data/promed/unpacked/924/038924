Police said on Thursday that they were investigating the deaths of 4
foreigners believed to have overdosed on traditional palm wine on the
Indonesian resort island of Lombok. [For general information on palm wine,
see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_wine> - CopyEd.PG]
The men -- from Britain, France, Germany, and Ireland -- all died within
the last 6 weeks, the most recent 2 days ago, residents and media reports
said. The official cause of death was not immediately known, said Lt Col
Basri, a police spokesman, but he ruled out foul play. The victims were all
fans of Arak Putih, a potent and inexpensive palm wine popular on eastern
parts of the sprawling archipelago, and appeared to have overdosed, he said.
With so many deaths occurring within such a short period, one foreign bar
owner in Lombok, who asked not to be named, urged authorities to pull the
wine from shelves until it was tested.

[Palm wine is also known as toddy, or palm toddy. It is made from the sap
of certain palm trees, which is fermented into an alcoholic beverage. It is
most common in South India and places in Africa. The amount of alcohol
depends upon the location and the specific species of palm trees. Generally
yeast is added to the fermenting mixture, so it would also be possible to
add a contaminant that would be camouflaged by the acidic flavor of the
finished product. - Mod.TG]
