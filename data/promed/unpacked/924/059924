Affected population: The dog was a feral mongrel, male, young adult, black and tan coat, unvaccinated against rabies, captured on [11 Jun 2022], where it was located following a call from a citizen. It was removed by the local police and transferred to the animal shelter and observation center, where it was admitted dead.

["Spain (peninsular territory and islands) has been free of terrestrial rabies since 1978, with the exception of the case of rabies imported from Morocco declared in June 2013. The vaccination campaigns carried out in dogs gave excellent results, eradicating the disease in the entire national territory. Only in the Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla are there sporadically imported cases of rabies, in dogs and some horses." (https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/ganaderia/temas/sanidad-animal-higiene-ganadera/sanidad-animal/enfermedades/rabia/Rabia.aspx) [in Spanish, trans. Mod.CRD]

Spain has a National Surveillance Program for Rabies in animals. See the full document (in Spanish) at https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/ganaderia/temas/sanidad-animal-higiene-ganadera/programadevigilanciadelarabiaversionfinal_tcm30-561135.pdf.
