Over the past few days, patients with acute gastroenteritis are being admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. Among them, dozens of patients were found infected with Vibrio species (non-cholera). To my knowledge, no comprehensive study (or no published paper) on potential pathogenic Vibrio species other than O1 and O139 _V. cholera_, has been conducted in Nepal.

It would, however, be interesting to know the organism's source of introduction, because Nepal is a landlocked country, and these organisms are more commonly reported after consumption of raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters. The species has not been clarified but our head of laboratory suspects _Vibrio vulnificus_.

[The organism causing the outbreak of gastroenteritis is suspected to be _V. vulnificus_. While it can cause gastroenteritis or mild wound infections in normal individuals, it is most often recognized as a cause of skin and soft tissue infection (including necrotizing fasciitis) (1) either from oral ingestion (in undercooked shellfish) or from direct exposure to seawater in individuals with liver disease, diabetes and renal failure. Unlike _V. parahaemolyticus_ which can cause large outbreaks of gastroenteritis (2), it is difficult to find reports of large outbreaks of gastroenteritis related to _V. vulnificus_. In a Taiwanese report on non-cholera vibrioses (3), only 2 of 76 cases of non-cholera vibriosis causing gastroenteritis were attributed to _V. vulnificus_ and 70 were attributed to _V. parahaemolyticus_ whereas in 33 cases of skin and soft tissue infection 29 were _V. vulnificus_ and 5 _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Regarding the presence of a non-cholera _Vibrio sp._ in Nepal, a landlocked country, it is certainly the case that most of the cases are reported in countries with seashore so that there is easy access to the environment where these halophilic vibrios exist. It is possible that imported seawater or shellfish were responsible for this outbreak. I did find, however, a report from Nepal of non-cholera vibrios being isolated from sewage of the Kathmandu Valley (4). Of the 42 positive samples, 27 were _V. cholerae_ but 11 were _V. vulnificus_, 5 were _V. parahaemolyticus_. Species furnissi, fluvalis and alginolyticus were also isolated. I was only able to read the abstract so I do not know if any speculation of the source of vulnificus and parahaemolyticus was given.

We await any additional information from Dr. Pun or others regarding the species of the outbreak isolate.
