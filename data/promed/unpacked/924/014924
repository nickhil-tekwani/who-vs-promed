Cases of anthrax in Bududa and Manafwa districts are on the rise due to lack of drugs to vaccinate animals, authorities have said. The Bududa health officer, Dr Imelda Tumuhaire, last week said the disease has so far killed one person, infected 13, and killed 18 animals in the district.

The most affected villages are Bumalakala, Bunalakala, Muririnyi and Bumabala Upper in Bunatsami Sub-County.

Anthrax is caused by bacteria (_bacillus anthracis_) in the atmosphere and the animals, mainly herbivores, get it through contaminated grass, soil and water. Humans can acquire it through eating contaminated meat and animal products.

The Bududa chairperson, Mr. Milton Kamoti Wasunguyi, said the government seems reluctant to vaccines. "We appeal to the government to send vaccines to make sure all the animals are vaccinated. Farmers don't have money to buy vaccines," he said.

However, the district production officer, Mr. Felix Odongo, said anthrax is not on the list of the diseases which the government procures drugs for. "We are trying to mobilise the farmers to buy drugs for themselves but most of them claim they don't have money so they are waiting upon the government," Mr. Odongo said.

Mr. Emmy Mitala, the Resident District Commissioner, said they have instituted a temporary quarantine to control the spread of the disease. "We have engaged our neighbours of Manafwa and Namisindwa to enforce the quarantine so that disease is contained,"Mr Mitala said.

He added that they have got intelligence that some people are smuggling meat and milk to Mbale City despite the ban. "Some people are using shortcuts to smuggle the meat to Mbale City but we are going to arrest them," he said. Mr. Mitala, who also heads the district security committee, said they do not have enough manpower to manage the roadblocks.

The district police commander, Mr. Hilary Nuwahereza, said they have changed the model of operations to arrest smugglers. "We carried out an operation in Bushika market and impounded 2 cows and a pig. We have also recovered four jerricans of milk going to Mbale," he said.

Ms. Irene Namono, a farmer in Bududa Town Council, called for strengthening of the surveillance system for early detection and response to disease outbreaks. "We need community sensitisation on the dangers of eating dairy products of sick animals," Ms Namono said.

Manafwa livestock markets closed. According to a [20 May 2022] letter signed by the Manafwa chief administrative officer, Mr. Peter Henry Wotunya, districts have also closed livestock markets to fight anthrax. They banned the movement of animals or animal products into or out of the districts and also the slaughtering of cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs. "Failure to adhere to quarantine restrictions will lead to prosecution in accordance with the Animal Disease Act, cap 2018," the letter reads in part.

Veterinary authorities in Manafwa district have imposed a temporal quarantine following the outbreak of anthrax in Bududa district.

One person has since died and 13 others were hospitalized after eating the meat of dead animals suspected to have died of anthrax. A total of 18 animals have also been confirmed dead in Bumabara village, in Bunatsami sub-county.

Anthrax is a zoonotic disease transmissible from animals to human. Humans can avoid disease by not eating animals that die suddenly. Animals dying from anthrax have blood oozing from all body openings and thus must be buried without opening.

Bududa District Production officer Dr. Felix Odong says that tests carried out by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on [Thu 19 May 2022] confirmed the disease.

Manafwa District Chief Administrative Officer Peter Henry Wotunya has imposed a temporal quarantine on the district following a resolution from the stakeholders meeting from the 3 districts of Namisindwa, Manafwa, and Bududa which border each other.

Bududa District in Elgon region is known for bull fattening farming practices. Which makes them the leading supplier of beef and animals to all neighboring districts of Manafwa, Namusidwa, Mbale, and even Kenya. The CAO has directed that all cattle markets in the district be closed, no movement of animals or animal products in and out of Manafwa district and there will be no slaughtering of cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs during the time of quarantine. "Failure to adhere to quarantine restrictions will lead to prosecution according to the animal disease control Act, cap 38," the letter reads in part.

The Uganda Veterinary Association (UVA) has called upon Government to intervene quickly to minimize the loss of animals and the threat to public health. The UVA secretary, Bonifance Obbo said veterinarians in the entire Elgon sub-region are on high alert and carrying out sensitization of stakeholders and anthrax surveillance. Obbo, who is also Principal Veterinary officer/District veterinary officer Manafwa said "this outbreak causes public health risk to all those districts. Bull fattening of crossbreed bulls which sometimes it is sold up to 4 million shilling per bull." Obbo called for government support through immediate provisions of vaccines for livestock, Provision of PPEs to front line veterinarians responding to the outbreak

Although routine vaccination has been identified as the only viable preventive measure, local governments often rely on donations from other organizations to acquire the vaccines. In [2017], the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries upgraded Anthrax as a priority bacterial animal disease but the government has not started supplying the necessary vaccines to local governments.

This is clearly a learning experience for the Ugandan authorities. Sterne vaccine is extremely cheap, very effective, and available globally.

Bududa District is in the Eastern Region of Uganda and on the border with Kenya: see https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bududa+District+wikipedia&FORM=LFACTRE. Bududa is the chief town of the district.
