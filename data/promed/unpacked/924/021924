To date, 114 known outbreaks of human infection by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have been associated with medical/other invasive procedures. 37 of these (32 percent) have been reported from the United States.

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a diverse group of acid-fast bacilli that are separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html). NTM differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and rapid molecular diagnostics. Rapidly growing NTM mycobacteria (RGM) usually form colonies within 7 days of in vitro incubation as opposed to slow-growing mycobacteria that require longer incubation. _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group are RGM, which also includes _Mycobacterium goodii_, _Mycobacterium mucogenicum_, _Mycobacterium wolinskyi_, Mycobacterium porcinum_, and _Mycobacterium bolletii_/_M. massiliense_ that are mentioned in the listing above.

More slowly growing NTM species that are included in the above listing are _Mycobacterium simiae_, _Mycobacterium haemophilum_ and _Mycobacterium chimaera_. - Mod.ML]
