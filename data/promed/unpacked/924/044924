1st report of _Raffaelea lauricola_ in Myanmar
-------------------------------------------------
_Raffaelea lauricola_ (EPPO Alert List) is reported for the 1st time from Myanmar. During a survey for pests and diseases of avocado (_Persea americana_) conducted in October 2014, a wilt disease was observed in the Tuanggyi on avocado orchards and in Ywangan [both districts in Shan Region] on avocado trees used as shade plants in coffee (_Coffea arabica_) plantations.

In both districts, symptoms were observed on _P. americana_ and not on any other tree species. Affected trees showed sapwood discoloration, leaf necrosis and defoliation, and usually died within a month or two following the onset of symptoms. Laboratory analysis conducted in the USA under quarantine facilities (PCR, pathogenicity tests) confirmed the identity of the fungus. The insect vector, _Xyleborus glabratus_ (Coleoptera: Scolytidae)[EPPO Alert List], is known to occur in Myanmar.

[Laurel wilt (LW) is a vascular disease affecting species in the family _Lauraceae_. It is caused by a fungus, _Raffaelea lauricola_, newly described in 2008. LW is spread by the redbay ambrosia beetle (_Xyleborus glabratus_), which is native to India, Japan, Myanmar and Taiwan. Root-to-root spread of the fungus within tree stands is also suspected. LW symptoms may include wilting and discolouration of twigs and leaves, as well as black streaks in the wood of branches and trunks. Infected trees die. Disease management relies on exclusion of both vector and fungus from new areas but may also include phytosanitation and removal of pathogen and vector reservoirs.

LW is considered a serious threat to avocado cultivation. For example, in the US, it has destroyed tens of thousands of avocado trees already and continues to spread (ProMED-mail post 20160516.4225817). It has been suggested that fungus and beetle were introduced into that country with wooden materials. Sniffer dogs are being trialled to detect pre-symptomatic trees in order to slow down the spread of the fungus.

In their native environment, including Myanmar, fungus and beetle do not devastate native tree species, but are part of a balanced biosystem where hosts and pathogens have evolved together. However, avocado as an alien host species is highly susceptible to the disease there. This report highlights once again the risks of growing crops in new areas.
