The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) welcomes the world
partnership against bird flu as an important step in dealing with a
potential human pandemic, while recalling the importance of controlling the
disease at its animal source.
Returning from his 2 days mission to Russia where he participated in the
OIE Seminar on the "Structure of national Veterinary Services of OIE Member
Countries in Europe", the OIE Director General, Dr Bernard Vallat, said
that such international cooperation is crucial to face the problem of avian
influenza.
"Under the present circumstances with regard to the spread of avian
influenza, I believe that it is of particular significance that the seminar
took place here in Russia." Dr Vallat said. "It is actually the 1st time
that a European Conference with high-level national representatives of
about 50 OIE Member Countries of Europe is entirely dedicated to the
structures of the national Veterinary Services. The public is becoming
increasingly aware of the global benefit of the work done by Veterinary
Services in the field of prevention of zoonoses. The present concern about
the spread of avian influenza is a very good example of how important it is
to make relevant public resources available for efficient national
veterinary services which are crucial not only to agricultural economies,
public health including food safety, but also to the prevention of
potential human pandemics."
"Countries need to step up control efforts and more emphasis must be put on
animal health issues to control avian influenza at the animal source", Dr
Vallat added.
Furthermore, Dr Vallat accepted that an international assessment of the
epidemiological situation of wild birds coordinated by the OIE be urgently
carried out in Siberia prior to their migration to other parts of the world.

[The envisaged international epidemiological assessment of the AI situation
in wild birds in Siberia, to be implemented soonest, is an initiative for
which Russia and the coordinating agency, OIE, should be warmly commended.
We shall appreciate obtaining collected data as soon as they become
available. Additional information and useful links may be obtained from the
overview "Avian Influenza and Wild Birds" available at
<http://www.wetlands.org/news&/NewsItems/AVIAN%20FLU_20050915.htm#_Toc112216738>.
The said overview includes a chapter on the movements of waterbirds in the
Asia-Pacific region, with maps related to the various species. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu virus has been officially confirmed in 49 Russian settlements, and
bird flu is suspected in another 81 settlements, sources from the Russian
Federal Service for Veterinary and Phitosanitary Inspection told Itar-Tass
on Monday [19 Sep 2005].
Quarantine measures have been lifted in 24 Russian settlements, the sources
said.

Russia has been given permission to resume poultry exports to EU countries,
the head of the Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Control Service
(Rosselkhoznadzor) Sergei Dankvert told the Interfax news agency.
The European Commission banned poultry exports from Russia on 17 Aug 2005
due to the bird flu outbreak in the central and eastern parts of the country.
Dankvert said that representatives of EU veterinary services on Tuesday [20
Sep 2005] evening voted in favour of introducing a system in which poultry
exports would not [be] banned from the country as a whole, but just from
the regions where bird flu was registered, the agency reported.
"This is a very important decision since it opens the door not just for
poultry deliveries, but also provides the possibility to export Russian
grain to EU countries," Dankvert said. He said that when bird flu is
registered in an exporting country, an importing country can ban imports of
meat and grain, in particular feed grain, from that country as a safety
measure.

[The decision of the EU to allow resumed imports of poultry from unaffected
regions in Russia is based upon the principle of Zoning (or
regionalisation). According to article 1.3.5 of the International Animal
Health Code, Member Countries may establish and maintain a subpopulation
with a different animal health status within national boundaries, namely
regionalized and separated by natural or artificial geographical barriers.
This may be done for the purpose of disease control and/or international trade.
If the EU sanctioned the imports, this might have been based upon data
confirming that the current avian influenza outbreak remained restricted to
the regions east of the Urals, enabling western regions in Russia to be
considered uninfected. Such data will be helpful to the international
community; Russia's last follow-up report (No 2) on the H5N1 situation was
sent to the OIE on 20 Aug 2005. - Mod.AS]
