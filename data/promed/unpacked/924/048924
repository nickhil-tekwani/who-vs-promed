Chikungunya reported from 29 villages of Nasik (or Nashik)
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of chikungunya (CHIK), a mosquito-transmitted viral fever, has
been reported from 29 villages of Nasik district in Maharashtra, and over
500 people who showed symptoms of the disease have been hospitalized, state
Health Directorate officials said on Monday [3 Apr 2006].
Malegaon was the most affected area, from where 2 cases out of 18 samples
sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune have been declared
positive for the fever, the officials said.
"Several people have been affected by this mosquito-transmitted disease in
Malegaon, and of the 18 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology
(NIV), Pune, 2 cases have been declared positive for the disease," PP Doke,
Director General of the Directorate of Health said.
However, the disease, a milder form of dengue [a mistaken notion, CHIK and
dengue are 2 different viral diseases; the former is caused by an
alphavirus and the latter by flaviviruses. - Mod.RY], "has nothing to do
with bird flu," the officials said.
Last week, state Public Health Minister Vimal Mundada told the Assembly
that during the last 3 months, the health department had detected around 14
000 fever cases in 90 places across Maharashtra.
"At these 90 places, there is an outbreak of fever cases, which includes
cases of dengue and chikungunya. However, no cases of malaria were
detected," the minister said.

Outbreak of guinea fever in Maharashtra
-----------------------------------------------
Maharashtra Directorate of health officials reported an outbreak of
chikungunya, or guinea fever, in Malegaon in Nasik district.
"Several people have been affected by this mosquito-transmitted disease,
and of the 18 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV),
Pune, 2 cases have been declared positive," said Dr. P P Doke, director
general of the Directorate of Health. Doke emphasized that, "the disease
has nothing to do with bird flu or avian influenza."
"It is a viral disease ... The fever causes severe body ache, and thus
makes a person stoop," Dr. Katti, deputy director general of the
Directorate of Health, said. Katti said that even "our neighboring state
Andhra Pradesh had reported an outbreak of the disease recently."
Last month [March 2006], 362 samples from Andhra Pradesh were sent for
testing, of which 139 samples tested positive for chikungunya and 15 for
both [chikungunya] and dengue.
Besides the Indian subcontinent, several parts of the French Indian ocean
rim countries, including Mauritius, also reported outbreaks of chikungunya
fever, he [Katti] said. The disease is a milder form of dengue with almost
similar symptoms and is treatable, he said, adding that the virus is
transmitted by same the mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_.

[A map of the state of Maharashtra, India is available at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:IndiaMaharashtra.png>.
Maharashtra is India's 3rd largest state in terms of area and 2nd largest
in terms of population, after Uttar Pradesh. It is bordered by the states
of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa
and the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The Arabian Sea makes up
the state's western coast. Mumbai (Bombay), India's largest city, is the
capital of Maharashtra (see also:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra>).
An outbreak of 8000 CHIK cases has been recently reported in the
neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh (see also: 20060330.0961 and its map at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Map_AP_dist_all_blank.png>).
This epidemic seems to have set foot across Maharashtra in the west and
Andhra Pradesh in the east of the lower half of India. With the approach of
summer and the rainy season in this part of the Indian Ocean, the concerned
local health authorities should set out timely preventive measures, such as
public awareness campaigns to get rid of mosquito breeding grounds and
having fogging equipment and reagents ready for use. - Mod.RY]
