Health Department probes new cluster of deaths on South Shore
--------------------------------------------------------
Had not 50 dead and dying birds dropped from the sky over Great Kills
on Friday [21 Dec 2007], the sight 3 days later of a smaller cluster
of dead birds in Eltingville might not have alarmed Staten Islanders.
But a motorist who spotted the birds near the corner of Richmond
Avenue and Amboy Road Monday [23 Dec 2007] night alerted authorities,
prompting agents from the city Department of Health to visit the area.
Initially, investigators did not deem it necessary to conduct tests
on the corpses because of the small number on the ground, said a
spokeswoman for the department. But agents returned yesterday to the
site to collect some of the birds, which rested belly-up on the
street and sidewalk, their feet contorted and their heads at awkward
angles to their bodies.
It will take more than a week before the results of the tests being
conducted on the blackbirds that died suddenly Friday along Wiman
Avenue are known. Such large clusters of dead birds are reported only
a few times a year, said Health Department spokeswoman, Jessica L. Scaperotti.
The 7 or so birds that fell 2 miles away from Friday's massive
die-off also will be sent to an upstate lab for extensive pathology.
They have black feathers patterned with light-colored flecks and
appear to be starlings.
"There is nothing to suggest that this is in any way related to the
birds found last week, or that there is any health risk to the Staten
Island community," said Ms. Scaperotti.
Typically, the city picks up birds for further tests only if more
than 10 appear in one location, she said, adding that pesticide is
usually the culprit.
On Saturday [22 Dec 2007], the city Department of Environmental
Protection tested the air at and near Wiman Avenue and pronounced it safe.
"Once we get the results of our testing, we will determine what next
steps might be necessary," said Arturo Garcia-Costas, a spokesman for
the state Department of Conservation, which is analyzing the specimens upstate.
But the mystery of dead birds raining down on the community has
shaken Islanders.
"Birds just don't fall out of the sky," said Colin Dawson of
Rosebank, who said he was driving yesterday near the corner of
Richmond Avenue and Amboy Road when birds hit his truck. "The city
should know this is an emergency; what are they going to wait for,
kids to fall?"
Spotting the birds on the ground as she took a stroll near her
Eltingville home, 16-year-old Lauren Bielella gasped, then evoked the
maxim about the canary in the coal mine.
"It makes me a little worried -- why are the birds dying? They
usually notice things before we do."
But an employee of Animal Kingdom of Staten Island -- a pet store
also located on the corner of Richmond Avenue and Amboy Road -- said
wild birds frequently turn up dead on the block.
"Someone in the area is poisoning them," said the employee, who would
give his name only as Sean.
To dispose of a dead bird, use plastic or latex gloves to place it
carefully in a double plastic bag. Or you may use a doubled plastic
bag as a glove to pick up the bird. Then wrap the bird in the bag,
tie it off and place it in the outdoor trash. Wash your hands with
soap and water when finished.

[This does not appear to represent any type of human health hazard.
It is the time of year where storms, cold weather and lack of
available food cause birds to starve to death, and they may develop
hypothermia. Such conditions often cause birds to "drop out of the
sky" dead. They completely run out of energy and are unable to
sustain flight. - Mod.TG]
[More information on the final results of studies on the affected
birds would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
