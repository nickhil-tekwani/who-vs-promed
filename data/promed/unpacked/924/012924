I have read the information (13 Oct 1998) about meningitis, meningococcal:
surveillance -Australia and I found it very interesting. It showed the
increasing of rates (1997 almost duplicate 1990) and the prevalence of
serogroup B in all States and Territories; it could be [of concern because
[of the lack of serogroup B effective vaccines. Unfortunately the control
measures implemented and their results are not mentioned. Australia is a
very large country and it seems to me that massive interventions might be
difficult.
In Cuba we had an IMD epidemic [that started in the 1970s predominantly to
serogroup C, and nationwide massive vaccination in the high risk groups
(population under 20 years old) in 1979 with a capsular polysaccharide A-C
vaccine (Merieux Laboratories) with a coverage of 80% reduced substantially
meningococcus [serogroup C infections. Despite this intervention, the
incidence rate continued to rise, but [with a change [of the prevailing
serogroup to B (78.4%). The peak of the epidemic occurred in 1983.
Later(1987-1988) and based on encouraging results in the efficacy trials
with VA-MENGOC-BC, another massive vaccination [campaign was carried out
in the same age groups, achieving 95 % coverage (>3 million vaccinated)
with remarkable success in the control of IMD. In 1991 the vaccine was
included in the National Immunization Program (NIP) for all infants (first
dose at 3 + months and the second at 5 + months), and since then the rates
are very low and continue [to decrease.
Studies of anti-meningococcal BC vaccination under epidemic conditions in
other countries (Boslego et al. 1995,Noronha et al. 1995) suggest low
efficacy for VA-MENGOC-BC vaccine in serogroup B IMD, especially in
children under 5 years of age. In contrast our experience reveal a dramatic
decrease of epidemic after vaccination with type specific vaccine. This is
an important difference with regard to other countries which used
vaccination only as a punctual measure in epidemic control. Perhaps these
experiences would be useful for control of IMD in others countries taking
into account the circulating serogroups, serotypes and subtypes.
