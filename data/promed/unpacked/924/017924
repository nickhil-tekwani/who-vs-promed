[The following has been extracted from the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2020, "Lumpy skin disease", Chapter 3.4.12 , available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.12_LSD.pdf.

"Lumpy skin disease (LSD, knopvelsiekte) is a poxvirus disease of cattle characterised by fever, nodules on the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs, emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, edema of the skin, and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides and death due to secondary bacterial infections.

"Lumpy skin disease was 1st seen in Zambia in 1929, spreading into Botswana by 1943, and then into South Africa, where it affected over 8 million cattle causing major economic loss. In 1957 it entered Kenya, associated with an outbreak of sheep pox. In 1970 LSD spread north into the Sudan, by 1974 it had spread west as far as Nigeria, and in 1977 was reported from Mauritania, Mali, Ghana and Liberia. Another epizootic of LSD between 1981 and 1986 affected Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Somalia and the Cameroon, with reported mortality rates in affected cattle of 20%. The occurrence of LSD north of the Sahara Desert and outside the African continent was confirmed for the 1st time in Egypt and Israel between 1988 and 1989, and was reported again in 2006. In the past decade, LSD occurrences have been reported in the Middle Eastern, European and west Asian regions. Lumpy skin disease outbreaks tend to be sporadic, depending upon animal movements, immune status, and wind and rainfall patterns affecting vector populations. The principal method of transmission is thought to be mechanical by arthropod vector." - Mod.CRD
