2 body-wasting pig diseases may have infected up to 40 percent of the
English pig herd since the late 1990s, a veterinary scientist from
Britain's Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) said.
Post-weaning Multi-systematic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS) and Porcine
Dermatitis Nephropathy Syndrome (PDNS) are estimated to have cost the pig
industry some $31 million this year.
Last December it was estimated that 20 percent of farms in England and
Wales were affected. Farmers fear these diseases because they attack
sporadically with mortality rates of up to 30 percent, while productivity
among the surviving animals is reduced.
PMWS occurs clinically in pigs aged 6 to 14 weeks, while PDNS commonly
occurs between 12 and 14 weeks of age. Scientists have estimated the
syndromes increase the costs of pork production -- enough to move some into
debt.
MLC veterinary scientist Derek Armstrong said there is no known treatment
to eradicate them and their causes and methods of transmission are unclear.
"Changing management and improving hygiene can reduce the effect but it
doesn't eliminate the disease," Armstrong said, adding the conditions can
persist in herds for up to 3 years.
A MLC spokesman stressed pigs do not have to be destroyed if they contract
the disease -- unlike the strategy for fighting this year's epidemic of
foot-and-mouth disease.
"While some do die, some recover and are then sent on to market. The
(government's) Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said there are no known
implications for human health," he added.
General veterinary advice to farmers trying to avoid the disease includes
stepping up biosecurity on farms and avoiding mixing animals.
Researchers are looking into the effects of a vaccine on PMWS, which is
spreading far more rapidly than PDNS, and researching into the possible
transfer of immunity from a sow to its piglets, the MLC said.
