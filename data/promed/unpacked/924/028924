Source: 2000/071 EPPO report on selected intercepted consignments

The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the intercepted consignment reports:
1) for 1998 received from Algeria;
2) for 1999 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2000/052) from the
following countries: Algeria, Austria, France, Ireland, Israel,
Netherlands, United Kingdom;
3) and for 2000 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2000/052) from
the following countries: Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Finland, Greece,
Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, United
Kingdom. When a consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin
is unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*). The EPPO Secretariat has
selected interceptions made because of the presence of pests. Other
interceptions due to prohibited commodities, missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the report is
only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent their interception
reports.
Note: The following note should be added to the previous report on
interceptions (EPPO RS 2000/052). It concerned the Dutch interception of
_Citrus paradisi_ fruits from USA infected by _Guignardia citricarpa_:
* In USA, molecular techniques have recently been developed to distinguish
between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of G. citricarpa. Using this
method, the USA authorities have shown that the isolate from this
consignment is a non-pathogenic strain of _G. citricarpa_ (note from the
Dutch NPPO, 2000-02).
[G. citricarpa is the fungal pathogen that causes citrus black spot disease
in citrus. The disease is considered an emerging one; distribution was
limited to Central and South America before this report. Obviously the
presence of non-pathogenic strains represents an unwanted variable in
pathogen identification. - Mod.DH]
