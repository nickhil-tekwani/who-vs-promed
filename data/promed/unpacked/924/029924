1) ProMED [ProMED-mail commented that cats are probably not infective.
This is a premature and potentially dangerous conclusion. Although cats do
usually not harbor as many worms as foxes or dogs and the development of
the worms seems retarded, two recent experimental studies showed that some
cats can have heavy infection intensities (Deplazes et al., 1999, J.
Parasitol. 85, 115-121; Jenkins and Romig, 2000, Int. J. Parasitol. 30,
959-962). If such cats live close to humans they could be of prime
importance as transmitters.
2) Contrary to the ProMED [ProMED-mail comment, there have been several
population screening studies for human alveolar echinococcosis outside of
Japan: in Switzerland (Gottstein et al., 1987, Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.
Hyg. 81, 960-964), in France (Bresson-Hadni et al., 1994, Am. J. Trop. Med.
Hyg. 51, 837-846) and in Germany (Romig et al., 1999, Am. J. Trop. Med.
Hyg. 61, 566-573). In all studies, many more seropositive participants
without verifiable disease were found than actual patients, predictive
values depending largely on the specificity of the antigens used. Diagnosis
of human alveolar echinococcosis therefore needs to be based on the
combination of serology and imaging techniques (ultrasound or CT liver scan).
Still, reactors against specific antigens with negative imaging cannot be
summarily regarded as "false positives", and re-examinations are necessary
in intervals (the problem is discussed exhaustively in Romig et al., 1999,
Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 61,566-573). If serology only is used for screening,
the results must be provided to the "patient", and follow-up imaging
studies are definitely warranted and films should be seen by experts in the
field.
Asymptomatic, seropositive individuals without pathological liver CT scan
should not be treated but observed. Anthelminthic treatment is indicated
for proven cases and is given for extended periods of even years (WHO:
Guidelines for treatment of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis.
Bull.WHO,74,1996, 231-242).

[I agree that _E.multilocularis_ can be found in the cat intestine, but to
my knowledge no one has shown that these worms produce infective eggs.
Thank you very much for pointing to some additional literature. My point in
the comment was that no one knows what to do with positive results in
asymptomatic persons. The comments by Dr Romig and Dr Kern emphasize my
point that repeated testing in asymptomatic persons may stigmatize
otherwise healthy people and lead to repeated testing and perhaps even
treatment even though, as pointed out in the comment, the WHO guidelines
recommend treatment for symptomatic cases only. -Mod. EP
