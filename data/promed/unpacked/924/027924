Maine health officials confirmed 4 recent cases of [legionellosis] in the Bangor area. All 4 individuals were hospitalized. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) is investigating the cases to determine if there is a common exposure among them.

_Legionella_ bacteria are found naturally in freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams. _Legionella_ can become a health concern when it grows and spreads in human-made building water systems such as cooling towers used in air conditioning systems, hot tubs, fountains, and large plumbing systems. Legionnaires' disease, which is a type of pneumonia, may result when individuals breathe in droplets of water that contain the bacteria. Symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches, and headaches.

Most healthy people exposed to _Legionella_ do not get sick. Those at increased risk of getting sick are people aged 50 years and older; current or former smokers; people with a chronic lung disease, weak immune systems, or cancer; and people with underlying illnesses such as diabetes, kidney failure, or liver failure.

Doctors use chest x-rays or physical exams to check for pneumonia and may also order tests on a sample of urine and sputum (phlegm) to determine if a lung infection is caused by _Legionella_. Legionnaires' disease is treated with antibiotics. Most people who get sick need care in a hospital but make a full recovery. However, about one out of 10 people who get legionnaires' disease will die from the infection.

[Legionellosis] cases have been on the rise in the United States since 2000. About 9000 cases were reported in 2019. Maine has averaged 21.4 cases per year since 2016.

[The news report above describes a cluster of 4 recent cases of legionnaires' disease in the Bangor area. At this point, we do not know if we are dealing with a cluster of unrelated cases or a common-source outbreak. The investigation into finding a common source for these 4 people is proceeding, but genotyping the clinical isolates would help establish whether this is a common-source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. We will await further findings from the investigation.

Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of _Legionella_ bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/)

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment.
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/)

Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of amoeba. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249)
