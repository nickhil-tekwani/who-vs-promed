A 10th person has died of cholera in Limpopo, the provincial health
department said on Wednesday [21 Jan 2009]. Spokesperson Phuti Seloba
said another 2650 people were confirmed to have the waterborne
disease since November 2008. He said a total of 102 new cases were
recorded by Wednesday afternoon [21 Jan 2009] with Sekhukhune and
Capricorn accounting for the highest number at 65.

Last week [week of 12 Jan 2009], the Greater Sekhukhune District
Municipality allocated [ZAR] 18 million [approx. USD 1.78 million] to
the fight against the spread of cholera in the region. Municipality
spokesperson Sizwe Yende said on Tuesday [20 Jan 2009] that
Sekhukhune, which has been mostly affected by the cholera outbreak,
planned to intensify efforts to provide clean water and fight the
spread of the disease. He said this was to be done by speedily
repairing all water infrastructures that had broken down in the
affected areas and to continue to supply water tankers to places
without proper infrastructure.

Yende said the municipality would continue conducting health and
hygiene awareness campaigns and double efforts in places that were
not yet affected by cholera. He attributed the breakdown of water
infrastructure in Sekhukhune to theft of parts or the whole machines
that pumped water to the area's reservoirs.

[Most of the new cases are likely to be locally acquired and not
directly from Zimbabwe.

At least 13 people have died of cholera in Mozambique's northwestern
Tete province, bringing to 84 the number of people in the country
bordering Zimbabwe to have succumbed to the disease since October
2008, state radio reported Wednesday [21 Jan 2009]. The deaths were
recorded in the districts of Moatize, Changa, and Tete town, where
over 1000 people in total have been diagnosed with cholera.

Health authorities in Tete attribute the increase in infections to
the heavy rains that are pounding the region and surrounding
countries, namely Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Malawi.
