Russsia: 4 tickborne encephalitis deaths in Perm Region
-------------------------------------------------------
4 people have died of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) in the Perm region of
Russia this year [2005], sources from the local department of the Russian
Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection told Itar-Tass
on Mon 19 Sep 2005. Another 686 people were admitted to hospital with
encephalitis during the season of tick activity, the sources added.
Tickborne encephalitis was confirmed in 136 of these cases.
According to region's epidemiologists, over 24 500 people have applied for
medical assistance this year [2005] as a result of tick bites. This is 5100
more tick bite cases than during the same period last year. "This year,
ticks were more active than in 2004, and the percentage of infected insects
was also higher," specialists said. Last year, over 19 000 people were
bitten by ticks in the Kama River area, the region with a traditionally
high activity of ticks. 3 people died.

[The Perm region is one of the largest industrial centers of the Urals and
Russia. Its total area is 160 600 square km, and it is inhabited by 3
million people. This is the easternmost part of Europe. The region borders
3 republics -- Komi, Bashkortastan, and Udmurtiya -- and is a part of the
Ural Economic region. For its location and description see:
<http://rubin.perm.ru/en/en_perm_region.htm>.
Tickborne encephalitis is caused by 2 closely related flaviviruses. The
eastern subtype of tickborne encephalitis virus causes Russian
spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes
persulcatus_. The western subtype causes Central European encephalitis and
is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. The eastern subtype occurs
across Russia and northern Asia, whereas the western subtype occurs in foci
from Scandinavia in the north to Greece in the south. The eastern subtype
is associated with more severe disease, and, in some outbreaks, mortality
up to 25 per cent has occurred. The majority of infections are a
consequence of tick bites, but, rarely, infection has occurred by
consumption of infected cow's or goat's milk. Inactivated vaccines are
available for protection against both subtypes. - Mod.CP]
