A fatal bat disease continues to spread across Wisconsin. The state Department of Natural Resources says over-winter surveillance shows that white-nose syndrome [WNS] or the fungus that causes it is now present in 14 counties, up from 8 after over-winter surveillance that ended in 2015.

The new counties include Douglas, Iron, Pierce, Manitowoc, Sauk and Green. Surveys showed a 94 percent drop in bat populations at the Grant County mine where the disease was 1st found in Wisconsin in 2014.

More than 6 million bats across 28 states have died since white-nose syndrome was discovered in New York in 2006.

The DNR has imposed decontamination procedures for cave-goers to prevent white-nose syndrome from spreading and added 4 bat species to the state's threatened species list.
