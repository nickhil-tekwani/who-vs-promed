Foot and mouth disease affects 2 Cambodian provinces
---------------------------------------------------
More than 2000 cattle and buffalo have been infected with foot and mouth
disease (FMD) in 2 Cambodian provinces west of the capital, Phnom Penh.
An animal health official in Kampong Chhang province says the disease hit 2
districts in May 2004, infecting about 2000 animals, but has now been
contained.
The official says experts have been deployed to advise farmers on
preventing the spread of the disease.
He says FMD may have spread from Kampong Speu province, which had an
outbreak in February and another one earlier in June 2004, due to heavy rains.
No animal deaths have been reported from the disease, which affects all
species of cloven-hoofed animals and can devastate livestock.

[FMD is endemic in Cambodia, affecting cattle, buffalo, and pigs. During
2003, 20 outbreaks were reported to the OIE. This item is posted since it
might relate to a spread into a possibly previously unaffected area. Data
on the serotype identified will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
