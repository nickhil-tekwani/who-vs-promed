A one-year-old baby is among 14 people hit by a cholera outbreak in 4 Sabah districts due to suspected contamination of water and food, with the reopening of almost all sectors.

Sabah Health Department director Datuk Dr. Christina Rundi said that 10 cases were reported in Kota Kinabalu, 2 in Putatan, 1 each in Tuaran and Semporna between 29 May 2020 and 25 June 2020. Apart from the baby, the oldest person infected by the disease was an 80-year-old, while the rest were between 7 and 18 years old, she said.

Dr. Rundi noted that there was a 75% downward trend of cholera cases during the movement control order (MCO), as compared with the same period in 2019. However, she said that the number of cases has increased, especially with the reopening of almost all sectors, due to food and water contamination. Among the reasons, she said, bacterial infections occurred when eating raw or uncooked food and not cleaning utensils with treated water.

Cholera symptoms include diarrhoea and could be fatal if not treated, particularly among children and babies, due to loss of body fluids.

Urging people to maintain high standards of hygiene, Dr. Rundi said that bacterial infections could spread in areas that do not have a clean water supply, poor toilet facilities and places with poor cleanliness. "We advise the public to always practise preventive measures by drinking boiled water, washing hands before eating or handling food and after going to the toilet," Rundi said, adding that seafood and meat should be properly cooked.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Delta, Bayelsa)

Ijaw leaders of Delta and Bayelsa riverside communities have raised the alarm over outbreak of cholera, which has led to the deaths of no fewer than 5 persons. They traced the deaths to a cholera epidemic that resulted from drinking polluted water and eating fish that apparently died from the pollution after being washed ashore.

The leaders of over 10 communities under the auspices of Committee of Affected Communities of coastal communities, in a meeting with The Nation at the weekend, asked the Federal Government to investigate and sanction the polluters as well as help ameliorate the hardship they suffer.

High Chief Augustine O. Seibi (JP), who led the affected community leaders, said: "It may surprise you to learn that a number of deaths have occurred in several communities as a result of this pollution. In Sokoh community, for example, we lost 3 persons; Ekeremor Federated Communities also lost people.

"They all died of cholera, which resulted from the polluted water that we are drinking after the dead fish and that is why we need a cottage hospital, and government intervention to allay the hunger and hardship our people are facing."

He said the communities have sufficient reasons to accuse oil companies as being responsible, noting: "It is indeed their explorative activities like in most oil spill cases that could contaminate the waters occasioning the wanton death of fishes and other aquatic organisms. These are further driven by the tidal flow to be deposited at the shores of communities and other uninhabited environments."

"We wish to reiterate the fact that all communities are directly and indirectly affected and are rendered impotent, without any means of a resurrection. These communities include Sokoh, Ekeremor Federated Communities, Omiegbene, Majorgbene, Seitoru, Fish Town, Aghoro (I and II) and Ekeremor among others."

While lamenting the incidents have led to hunger, they appealed to government to urgently provide relief materials and basic amenities to alleviate the suffering of the people. Seibi noted the people can no longer farm, fish or hunt just as economic activities have collapsed having been worsened by COVID-19.

[As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (e.g., refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
