CARDIOVIRUSES, HUMAN (02): GLOBAL PRESENCE

[Professor Christian Drosten has drawn attention to 3 recent
publications that essentially support the characterisation by Chiu et
al. of several diverse human cardioviruses in feacal samples (see:
ProMED-mail report, archived as Cardioviruses, human: 1st report
20080910.2824) and add the additional information that these human
cardioviruses are probably globally distributed. - Mod.CP]

Abstract: Cardioviruses cause serious disease, mainly in rodents,
including diabetes, myocarditis, encephalomyelitis, and multiple
sclerosis-like disseminated encephalomyelitis. Recently, a human
virus isolate obtained 25 years ago, termed Saffold virus, was
sequenced and classified as a cardiovirus. We conducted systematic
molecular screening for Saffold-like viruses in 844 fecal samples
from patients with gastroenteritis from Germany and Brazil across all
age groups. Six cardioviruses were identified in patients <6 years of
age. Viral loads were 283 305-5 044 412 175 copies/g of stool.
Co-infections occurred in 4 of 6 children. No evidence for
outbreak-like epidemic patterns was found. Phylogenetic analysis
identified 3 distinct genetic lineages. Viral protein 1 amino acids
were 67.9-77.7 percent identical and had a distance of at least 39.4
percent from known cardioviruses. Because closely related strains
were found on 2 continents, global distribution in humans is
suspected. Saffold-like viruses may be the 1st human cardiovirus
species to be identified.

New Saffold cardioviruses in 3 children, Canada.
---------------------------------------
Abed Y, Boivin G.
Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Quebec City, Canada.

Abstract: In Canada, cardiovirus isolates related to Saffold virus
were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 3 children with
respiratory symptoms. Polyprotein sequence of the Can112051-06
isolate had 91.2 percent amino acid identity with Saffold virus;
however, EF and CD loops of the viral surface varied substantially.

Discovery of a novel human picornavirus in a stool sample from a
pediatric patient presenting with fever of unknown origin.

Abstract: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a serious problem in the
United States. An unidentified agent was cultured from the stool of
an infant who presented with FUO. This virus showed growth in HFDK
cells and suckling mice. Using DNase sequence-independent
single-primer amplification, we identified several nucleotide
sequences with a high homology to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis
virus. Nearly full-length viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis demonstrate that this virus is a member of the _Cardiovirus_
genus of the _Picornaviridae_ family.

[These 3 publications taken together with the paper by Chiu et al. in
the previous ProMED-mail post confirm the presence of a diverse set
of cardioviruses in fecal samples from children. They further
establish that human cardioviruses are globally distributed, having
been detected in North America (Canada and USA), South America
(Brazil) and Europe (Germany). However, no association with a
particular disease condition has been established so far.

The paper by Abed and Boivin, and the paper by Jones et al. were
cited in the PNAS paper by Chiu et al., but not the paper by Drexler
et al., which has appeared contemporaneously. ProMED-mail thanks
Professor Drosten for remedying the deficiency. The heading 1st
report inserted by the moderator in the previous ProMED-mail post was
thus an inaccuracy for which I apologise. - Mod.CP]
