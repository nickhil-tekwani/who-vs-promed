[1] African Meningitis Belt

From 1 Jan 2012 to 11 Mar 2012 (epidemiologic weeks 1-10), outbreaks of meningococcal disease has been reported in 15 districts in Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. These outbreaks have been detected as part of the enhanced surveillance in the African Meningitis Belt conducted in 14 countries where a total of 6685 suspected meningitis cases including 639 deaths have been reported.

The outbreaks are mainly caused by the W135 serogroup of _Neisseria meningitidis_. In Chad, the predominant pathogen is serogroup A, although W135 contributed to an outbreak in 1 district. Type A has always been the leading cause of epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, outbreaks of W135 have already occurred in the region, especially since 2002.

The countries are responding to these outbreaks by enhancing surveillance, reinforcing treatment of patients and implementing mass vaccination campaigns. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has approved the release of 117 500 doses of trivalent polysaccharide ACW vaccine to Cote d'Ivoire, 195 540 doses of quadrivalent polysaccharide ACYW vaccine to Ghana and 359 000 doses of conjugate type A vaccine to Chad, along with injection materials and ceftriaxone (an antimicrobial agent) when necessary. The ICG constitutes of United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and WHO.

Country/Cases/Deaths/CFR (percent)/Predominant type/Districts involved
Benin 381 / 38 / 10 / W135 / 3
Burkina Faso / 1966 / 212 / 10.8 / W135 / 2

An outbreak of meningitis has claimed the lives of a dozen people in the western town of Toulepleu according to a report by Le Nouveau Reveil. The epidemic, the paper said, is spreading quickly throughout the war-torn city despite the timely reaction of the Ivorian government which has delivered drugs to the area and is undertaking measures to curb the disease.

At least 16 people have died in a meningitis epidemic in two districts in northern Uganda over the past 3 weeks, say health officials. Amuru District, where the epidemic is spreading fast, has recorded 33 cases with 14 deaths since 24 Feb 2012, while Oyam District has reported 25 cases with 2 deaths. The districts are just recovering from 2 decades of Lord's Resistance Army insurgency which displaced over 1.8 million people and left thousands dead.

"The deadly disease is spreading. The number could be higher as not all come to health facilities," Charles Okwera, deputy district health officer in Amuru, told IRIN.

[There are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_ based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. All these serogroup polysaccharides except B are immunogenic in humans. Rarely outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been related to other serogroups such as type X which has occurred in Niger in 2006 and Burkina Faso in 2010. - Mod. LL
