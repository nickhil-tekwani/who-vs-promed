The CDC released on 1 April in Hong Kong its findings that the outbreak of
"bird flu" was caused by two different strains of H5N1, as illustrated by
CDC researcher Nancy Cox. Chinese University professor John Tam told a
medical conference that the finding could imply that there is more than one
originating source of the virus, and certainly means that vaccine
production becomes more problematic.
