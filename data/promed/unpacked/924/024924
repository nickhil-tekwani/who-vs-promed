New yellow rust strains have arrived in Switzerland
---------------------------------------------------
In Switzerland, 2 new races of yellow rust have been discovered in
wheat. The 2 races differ markedly from those that are already
present in the country. Besides levels of virulence unlike any
strains found in Switzerland before, these strains are also able to
infect wheat at higher temperatures.

The last stripe rust epidemic in Switzerland occurred in 2002. In
2009, the combination of the emergence of a new pathogen strain and
favourable weather conditions has led to the infection of sensitive
varieties. The occurrence of yellow rust on wheat varieties
previously regarded as resistant concerns scientists at Agroscope
Changins-Waedenswil (ACW), and an assessment of the risk to Swiss
cereal crops was commenced immediately.

Firstly, the virulence of the new strains was compared to other races
found in Europe. Secondly, resistance tests were carried out on
currently used wheat and triticale varieties. The results showed that
the 2 strains have already been reported some time ago in Northern
and Central Europe, and that their presence has led to changes in the
recommended varieties in the affected countries. However, it was
found that the most important varieties used in Switzerland today
show good resistance against the new strains.

However, due to the presence of other yellow rust races in other
European countries, it is important to remain vigilant. For this
purpose ACW, in cooperation with the cantons, has established a
monitoring network so that new virulences can be detected on Swiss
territory immediately. In addition, the participation of ACW in
international networks should permit the prediction of their arrival.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale,
and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several
cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants
may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next crop
cycle. Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties,
fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops. Monitoring
programmes, as mentioned above, are important to recognise emerging
new strains.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported
in recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, and India and
are also suspected to emerge in China. In Europe, and most recently
the UK, outbreaks of stripe rust were reported to be due to at least
one new strain with increased virulence as well as greater survival
fitness, markedly increasing the risk to cereal producers. It is not
clear from the report above whether the strains found in Switzerland
are also the ones causing concern in the UK (see ProMED-mail posts
20090514.1806 and 20091218.4274), and how many new strains are
currently spreading in Europe. Depending on the susceptibility of
preferred cereal varieties grown in different countries, it can be
expected that new rust strains will differ in national or regional
significance.
