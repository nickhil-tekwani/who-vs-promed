[Ref: Fuming Dai et al: First report of _Tomato yellow leaf curl
virus_ infecting cowpea in China. Accepted for Pl Dis 95, 2011; DOI:
10.1094/PDIS-08-10-0608]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV) is a devastating pathogen of
tomato that causes significant yield losses in many tropical and
subtropical regions. In China, this virus was 1st found in 2006 on
tomato in Shanghai.

In October 2008, chlorotic yellow leaves of cowpea (_Vigna sinensis_)
were observed in Qingpu [district of Shanghai municipality] with
15-20 percent incidence in plants in high tunnels. Large populations
of whiteflies were observed in association with the diseased cowpea.
The disease agent was transmitted to cowpea (and tomato) by
whiteflies which resulted in chlorotic yellow leaves on cowpea (and
yellow leaf curl symptoms on tomato) that were identical to those
observed in the field. On the basis of the suspected insect vector,
symptomatology and severe epidemics of tomato yellow leaf curl
disease (TYLCD) in Shanghai in recent years, _Tomato yellow leaf curl
virus_ was suspected as the causal agent.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed specific to TYLCV coat
protein and an amplicon of the expected size was obtained in all 4
samples but not from healthy leaf samples. Sequences were identical
among samples. Full-length viral DNA sequence was determined to be
2781 nucleotides. A comparison of the sequence with those in GenBank
[database] shows that the cowpea isolate has the highest nucleotide
sequence identity (99 percent) with a TYLCV isolate from tomato in
Jiangsu [province].

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of TYLCV infecting cowpea in
China and also the 1st report in the world.

[_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV; genus _Begomovirus_)
originates from the Middle East and is one of the most damaging
viruses of tomato worldwide. It can also affect a number of other
solanaceous and leguminous hosts. Symptoms on tomato include small
chlorotic puckered leaves and stunting of plants. Yield losses of up
to 80 percent have been reported.

The virus is transmitted in a persistent manner by the silverleaf
whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B), which in itself is a serious
pest of tomatoes and other vegetable crops. TYLCV can also be
transmitted by mechanical inoculation (poorly) and by grafting, but
is not transmitted by seed or contact between plants.

Disease management may include use of certified vector and virus free
planting material, cultural practices, and removal of infected crop
residues and possible pathogen and/or vector reservoirs to reduce
inoculum. Control of the vector is most important, but this may cause
problems of chemical residues on the fruit and is extremely difficult
in open field situations due to the widespread presence and wide host
range of the vector.

Field cropping of tomatoes has been abandoned in some areas due to
TYLCV. Tomato cultivars with increased levels of resistance or
tolerance are available. Transgenic tomato plants incorporating TYLCV
capsid protein genes have been found to be resistant to the virus.

Cowpea (_Vigna_ species) is grown throughout the tropics as a grain
crop, a vegetable, or for animal feed. Several viruses are known to
affect the crop (including _Mungbean yellow mosaic virus_, _Cowpea
mild mottle virus_). The report above that cowpea can also be
affected by the widespread TYLCV is worrying information for both
cowpea and vegetable growers.
