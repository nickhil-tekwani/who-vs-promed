Bovine tuberculosis detected at Fresno County dairy
---------------------------------------------------
A herd of cows in Fresno County is sick with bovine tuberculosis (TB),
California agricultural officials said on Friday [1 Feb 2008]. The chronic
disease doesn't threaten the quality or safety of milk and meat produced in
the state because most milk is pasteurized, and raw milk is regularly
tested for TB. Cattle processed for meat are routinely inspected for TB, too.

Officials tested for the rare disease after inspectors saw suspicious
lesions on a cow being examined for slaughter, said California Department
of Food and Agriculture spokesman Steve Lyle. A total of 5 cows have tested
positive since then.

State agricultural authorities are barring the farm from moving cows off
their property indefinitely to prevent further spread of disease, Lyle said.

The dairy farmer is working with state and federal animal health officials
to eradicate the disease from the herd, the department said.

Bovine TB was last found in California in 2003.

[The State of California will be taking are hard look at where the disease
may have come from. They will be busy tracing animals that moved into
(trace-ins) and animals moved out (trace-outs) of the herd and testing
herds where those animals came from. Any others herds found to be positive
could put the "free-state" status for California in jeopardy. - Mod.TG]
