Follow-up report No. 4
Translation of extracts from two e-mails received on 31 Aug and 8 Sep 2000
from Dr Oscar Alejandro Bruni, President of the National Service of
Agrifood Health and Quality (SENASA), Secretariat for Agriculture,
Livestock, Fisheries and Food, Buenos Aires:
End of previous report period: 25 Aug 2000 (see Disease Information, 13
[34, 145, dated 1 Sep 2000).
End of this report period: 31 Aug 2000.
Characteristics of the isolated virus
Comparative studies of the virus isolated from one of the bovines that had
entered the country illegally and the type A Argentinean isolates obtained
between 1981 and 1994 and some South American isolates, show the following:
- the isolate is distant genetically from the Argentinean isolates;
- the isolate differs antigenically from the A Arg./81 and A Arg./87
strains and is more similar to the A24 strain.
The examination of the phylogenetic relationships is incomplete due to lack
of data on isolates in the countries of the region over the past few years.
Follow-up and control measures
As of the date of this report, samples have been taken from 10 100 bovines
from 197 establishments which received shipments of cattle from the
affected province (Formosa) between 1 Jun 2000 and 5 Aug 2000. All the test
results were negative.
In regard to the mass serological survey being carried out throughout the
whole country in order to verify the sanitary situation, 6 082 samples have
been taken from 5 963 bovines, 63 pigs, 42 sheep et 14 goats. In these
cases, too, all the test results were negative.
Resolution No. 1133 has been extended by Resolution No. 1246 and will
remain in effect until 17 Sep 2000. This resolution prohibits the moving of
livestock to winter pasture and suspends all livestock auctions and fairs
throughout the country.
