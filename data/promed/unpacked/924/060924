[ProMED posting 20211112.8699608 of 12 Nov 2021, "Announcements (09): OFFLU Avian Influenza Statement, 20170304.4877946," was accompanied by moderators' commentary that included the following:

"It has been argued that AIV [avian influenza virus] transmission cycle cannot be fully blocked by mass vaccination if the viruses have a wild bird reservoir. This suggestion was supported by experience in China, where mass vaccination appeared to be more effective to minimize infections of AIV subtype H5 clade 7.2, which had no wild bird reservoir, than to minimize infections of clades 2.3.2 and 2.3.4, which did have wild bird reservoirs."

The said comment referred to a linked review paper: Liu S, Zhuang Q, Wang S, et al. Control of avian influenza in China: Strategies and lessons. Transbound Emerg Dis. 2020; 67: 1463-1471; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13515 (article 5.3, Vaccination effectiveness).

Subsequently, ProMED received the following clarification from the Chair of OFFLU steering committee: a much appreciated, authoritative update. - Mods.AS/CRD]

OFFLU would like to provide clarification regarding the moderators' comment about avian influenza vaccination: "It has been argued that AIV transmission cycle cannot be fully blocked by mass vaccination if the viruses have a wild bird reservoir."

Vaccination against high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) has been deployed mainly in places where the virus is endemic in poultry, and where stamping out, movement controls, and biosecurity measures were not, and would never, be sufficient to allow virus elimination, largely because of the nature and structure of the poultry sector. Vaccination in this situation aids in reducing outbreaks and the extent of virus circulation and therefore reduces zoonotic infections in humans (as has been seen from 2005 in Viet Nam against H5N1 HPAI and from late 2017 in China with vaccines against H7N9 viruses). Endemic infection with H5Nx HPAI in these places will likely persist, regardless of whether virus is present in wild birds (although new strains will, on occasion, be introduced). Vaccination is being applied against Goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage H5Nx viruses in this manner, to selected poultry populations in multiple countries, including Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Russia, and Viet Nam. Unsanctioned vaccination has also been used in a number of other countries.

The only place free from infection in poultry that uses vaccination as an additional preventive measure is Hong Kong SAR. Hong Kong SAR has a zero-tolerance approach to infection with HPAI viruses, in line with other places that do not have endemic infection. Vaccination against Goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage H5Nx viruses in Hong Kong SAR was first used in 2002 and was made mandatory for all chicken flocks in 2003 when it became evident that measures based on biosecurity alone were not sufficient to prevent infection in farms and live poultry markets. It has been used continuously since then, with regular updates of vaccine antigens to match strains of virus circulating in the broader region (and addition of a vaccine antigen against H7N9). Despite the presence of virus in wild birds in Hong Kong SAR in most years, there has been only one single farm outbreak in vaccinated poultry in 2008, associated with an antigenic variant strain. Vaccination, once fully deployed, also prevented infections in live bird markets. The vaccination programme is accompanied by a monitoring programme in farms and markets to ensure that so-called "silent" infection is not occurring and that vaccinated birds have developed an appropriate immune response.

Vaccination increases the resistance to infection and reduces the likelihood of transmission in vaccinated flocks. Suitable monitoring systems to detect infection in vaccinated flocks are needed if the goal is to retain freedom from infection in domestic poultry. Under Article 10.4.1.6 in the current OIE Terrestrial Code, vaccination will not affect the high pathogenicity avian influenza status of a free country or zone if (appropriate) surveillance supports the absence of infection.

Given the repeated cycles of wild bird introduction of Goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage H5Nx viruses, vaccination is being considered as an additional preventive measure by a number of countries, especially for higher risk poultry species and production systems. There are no reasons why it cannot be used successfully to prevent infection in poultry, even if present in wild birds, provided suitable vaccines are available, other appropriate biosecurity measures are applied (such as feeding strategies for birds reared outdoors that do not attract wild birds), and an appropriate, cost-effective surveillance system for all vaccinated flocks is in place.

[The moderators' commentary also addressed the need for improved national reporting on HPAI vaccines, indicating the following: "According to OIE's WAHIS database, during 2019, vaccination against HPAI (subtype not specified) was applied in Egypt, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Pakistan. Such information for 2020 has, so far, become available only from Egypt and Pakistan. Reporting should be enhanced, including updated official information from all OIE's member countries."

We are indebted to Dr Brown for helping in efforts to bridge the gap of information concerning recent vaccination policies and performance, while naming some of the countries engaged. Hopefully this will encourage OIE members to upgrade their reporting on AI vaccines/vaccination, allowing improvement of vaccines' efficacy. - Mods.AS/CRD]
