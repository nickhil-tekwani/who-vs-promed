An outbreak of H5N2 bird flu in poultry has been reported in north China's Hebei Province, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) announced on Saturday [21 Dec 2013].

The disease has killed 4000 chickens raised by a farm in Baoding City after they showed symptoms of the suspected avian flu on 17 Dec 2013, according to the MOA.

The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory on Saturday [21 Dec 2013] confirmed the epidemic was H5N2 bird flu after testing samples collected at the farm.

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where a total of 125 700 chickens have been culled and safely disposed of to prevent the disease from spreading.

Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a contagious disease of animal origin caused by viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. It can be fatal to humans.

[The most recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry in China was reported in September 2012, in Guangdong, caused by H5N1. Since then, China's avian influenza main concern has been related to the H7N9 strain, causing human cases in south eastern China, apparently spread by infected but clinically unaffected chickens in live poultry markets. The current outbreak in Hebei province affects the birds seriously; further details are expected in the due official notification.

In the past, both high- and low-pathogenic H5N2 strains were identified in Taiwan. Following the outbreak in March 2012 affecting 5 poultry farms, caused by a HPAI H5N2 strain, serological investigations were applied in human contacts to exclude possible infection. 3 poultry workers (out of 141 tested) reacted positive for H5N2 antibodies; they did not have flu-like symptoms. Subscribers are referred to Mod.CP's commentary and for additional details to ProMED-mail posting 20120423.1111010.
