Austria finds second case of mad cow disease
--------------------------------------------
A case of mad cow disease has been found in Austria, the 2nd in the Alpine
country's history, the health and agriculture ministers said on Tuesday.
The ministers announced the case of the deadly brain-wasting disorder, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). "The reason for this short-notice
press conference today is the confirmation of a case of BSE in an Austrian
cow," health minister Maria Rauch-Kallat told reporters.
Mad cow disease was first identified in Britain in 1986. Scientists say
there is a strong link between humans eating tainted meat and the risk of
catching the disease. More than 100 people have died so far in Europe from
the human form of mad cow disease, mostly in Britain.
The disease was found during a routine test on an 11 year old cow from a
small farm of 7 cattle near the German border in the western province of
Vorarlberg. All 7 animals were slaughtered and cremated. Agriculture
Minister Josef Proell said it was a standard safety procedure in Austria
for cattle older than 24 months that die of unknown causes to be tested for
BSE. As this cow died unexpectedly in late May after showing suspicious
signs including tiredness, it was tested.
How the animal became infected was not clear, said Josef Koefer, divisional
head at Austrian food safety agency AGES. "The normal route is via the
feed. The other variant that I am considering is a spontaneous mutation in
the prions," he said. BSE is caused by abnormal or misfolded prion proteins
in an animal's brain. "We may never know for certain," Koefer added.
Feeding animal meal to farm animals has been banned in Austria since 1991.
The European Union tightened food safety laws after a BSE scare in the
1990s. It has banned the use of animal parts in feed and also removed
high-risk material such as spinal cord, intestines and brain from the food
and feed chain.
Austria's first case of BSE was found in December 2001. Austria's Proell
said this showed Austrian cattle were screened properly. "The system works.
Consumers can be assured that Austrian beef is safe," he told reporters.
"Compared with all other European countries, we are absolutely among the
best," Proell said. "Germany currently has had 356 BSE cases, Switzerland
... has had 456 BSE cases. Austria, with Luxembourg, leads Europe with the
second BSE case," he added [see comment].

[If one carefully reads the Opinion of EU's Scientific Steering Committee
on the GBR (Geographic Risk of BSE) in Austria, adopted on 16 May 2002, the
occurrence of a 2nd case, particularly in a cow born prior to 2001, should
not be overly surprising. According to the opinion, Austria was exposed to
a very high external challenge from 1980-2000 due to import of large
numbers of live cattle (about 190 000) and large amounts of MBM (meat and
bone meat; 45 000 tons according to the country or 95 000 tons according to
Eurostat and other export statistics) from BSE-risk countries. While
significant fractions of these imports most likely did not enter the
Austrian BSE/cattle system it was very likely that the BSE agent was
imported into the country. Taken account of the information available on
the origin and use made of the imported cattle and MBM it was concluded
that the external challenge from cattle imports was high for 1986 to 1995
and very high for the period 1996-2000. On the other hand, MBM imports were
posing a very high external challenge throughout the period 1980 to 2000.
Though feed controls have been implemented since 1990, cross-contamination
still appeared until 2001, there are at present still 2 EU member-countries
with only one recorded BSE case: Greece and Finland. Luxembourg, like
Austria, has had 2 cases; Sweden has not recorded any case, and is the only
EU country of which the GBR rating is II, namely that "It is unlikely that
domestic cattle are (clinically or pre-clinically) infected with the
BSE-agent, but it cannot be excluded". All other EU countries have been
rated as GBR III, namely "BSE has been confirmed, or it is likely but not
confirmed that one or several domestic cattle are (pre-clinically or
clinically) infected with the BSE-agent". - Mod.AS]
