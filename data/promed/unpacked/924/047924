DEBT FORGIVENESS, HEALTH - AFRICA
*********************************
A ProMED-mail post

Date: 23 May 1998

The Lancet (351, May 16 1998, page 1445) carries an editorial regarding the
potential role of debt forgiveness in improving the health and well-being
of people living in seven African countries. The UK is urging finance
ministers of the Group of Eight to assist Rwanda, Somalia, the two Congos,
Burundi, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in recovering from their disastrous
civil wars by forgiving these heavily indebted countries via a World
Bank/International Monetary Fund Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Program.
The editorial states that while sustainable development is Africa's highest
priority, an essential part of that program should be to create healthy
cities. Whereas future epidemics are impossible to predict, conditions
allowing such epidemics, high populations and poverty, are predictable.
46% of the world's population live in cities and urban growth is increasing
at 2.4% per annum. Africa's population is projected to quadruple from 0.7
billion in 1995 to 2.8 billion in 2150. While the population of Europe was
more than twice that of Africa in 1950, by 2150 Europe's population will be
one fifth that of Africa. If the fertility rate in Africa rises above the
predicted rate, its population could be as high as 6.9 billion by 2150.
Oyewale Tomori, WHO's regional virologist in Zimbabwe, speaking at
SUNY/Stony Brook, suggested that "Africa is killing our children through
neglect". Tomori said that, for example, in Zimbabwe, 600,000 children
will have died by 2000 from HIV-related diseases. He pointed to four
causes of this preventable tragedy: the collapse of the health care
systems, poor disease surveillance, inappropriate disease control, and
poverty. "Instead of buying tablets", Tomori said, "Africa is buying
grenades".
Frank Lloyd Wright, the great American architect, intimated that cities
must be sustainable, in terms of space needs, plentiful and safe food
supplies, adequate water and sanitation systems, available shelter, clean
air, and a population free from poverty. In regard to yellow fever, then a
problem in New Orleans, Thomas Jefferson, America's third President, said
"In the middle and northern parts of Europe, where the sun rarely shines,
they may safely build cities in solid blocks without generating disease;
but under the cloudless skies of America, where there is so constant an
accumulation of heat, men cannot be piled one on another with impunity.
Accordingly, we find this disease in the solid-built parts of the towns and
the parts on the water side, where there is the most matter for
putrefaction, but rarely extending into the thin-built parts of the town,
and never into the country. In these latter places it cannot be
communicated. In order to catch it you must go into the local atmosphere
where it prevails. Is not this then a strong indication that we ought not
to contend with the laws of nature, but should decide at once that all our
cities should be thinly built?" The bottom line is that a country must
have economic prosperity; countries in debt do not. Therefore, debt kills.
