A Georgetown University student who was arrested for manufacturing the deadly chemical ricin in his dormitory room in March [2014], was sentenced [Mon 10 Nov 2014] in a US district court to a year and a day in prison.

In issuing her sentence, Judge Ketanji B Jackson said the student perpetrator's intentions for manufacturing the chemical were "ambiguous at best" but that the student put numerous people, including his classmates and dormitory roommate, at great risk. Jackson also ordered [the 20 year old student] to undergo a mental health evaluation, serve 2 years of supervised probation, and perform 400 hours of community service. The convicted student has been in an isolation cell in DC jail since his arrest. Attorneys say the student could be moved to a halfway house in January [2015] because of the 7.5 months of jail time he has served already, which is being credited to his sentence.

The convicted student pleaded guilty in September [2014] to unregistered possession of a biological agent or toxin. Before he was sentenced, the student, dressed in an orange Department of Corrections jumpsuit, apologized as 70 friends and family members, including his parents, looked on. "I never intended to put anyone in any risk of danger. My actions were reckless and unacceptable," he said. The Bethesda native apologized to his family, friends, and the university. "I am sorry I broke the trust you placed in me," he said.

The student's attorneys said he had no plans to harm anyone other than himself when he met with a classmate and student resident adviser on 17 Mar 2014 and, according to court charging documents, pulled out a double-wrapped plastic bag and tossed it on the floor, telling his friend that the bag contained ricin, which he had manufactured in his dorm room while on school break. The adviser alerted authorities.

The student's attorney, Danny Onorato, told the judge his client had planned to use the deadly poison to commit suicide as a result of years of mental and emotional problems that were diagnosed when the student was 10. "He was depressed and suicidal," Onorato said. He added that the student, a science major who had planned to become a medical doctor, did not want to kill himself in a way that would cause emotional distress to his parents and family, such as by hanging. The student, Onorato said, instead researched how to make ricin.

But prosecutors Maia L Miller and Frederick W Yette characterized the student as having had a calculated plan and asked the judge for a 2-year sentence. Miller said the student searched for a "recipe" for ricin on the internet, used protective gloves and eyewear while he was mixing the chemicals in his room, and waited until his roommate was out of town to start working on the deadly poison. Miller said authorities think the student developed the idea to use ricin to kill after watching an episode of the TV crime drama "Breaking Bad".

Miller also said the resident adviser told authorities that the student had denied that he was going to use the toxin on himself in a suicide attempt. But when the adviser asked the student if he was going to use it on someone else, he (the student) "shrugged" his shoulders, Miller said. "This was deliberately thought out and well planned," Miller said. Miller also quoted from a Facebook message the student allegedly emailed to a friend during a dispute in which the student told the friend he was "useless" and that the only use for him would be if he were "chemically disincorporated" and his "parts were sold".

The US Department of Justice says a male UW-Oshkosh student has been charged with possession of ricin in connection with an incident on 31 Oct 2014 that shut down 4 blocks of an Oshkosh neighborhood.

According to court documents, the male student extracted the toxin from castor plants and stored it in a residence he was living at in the 800 block of Frederick Street in Oshkosh. The material was taken to a lab in Virginia where it tested positive for ricin. The criminal complaint against him says the male student (the perpetrator) planned on testing the toxin on mice or insects.

[The student] was arrested on 31 Oct 2014 and held in the Winnebago County jail. He was transferred into federal custody [Mon 10 Nov 2014] and had his initial appearance in federal court. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for [24 Nov 2014] and he will remain in custody until that time.

According to a search warrant filed in Winnebago County and the criminal complaint, the student made inquiries to 2 professors about making toxins from plants. The documents say he asked one professor how to make extractions from seeds. The professor told the student to ask a biology teacher to which the student alleged perpetrator responded "they are all interested in life, and I am interested in, like, ending it", according to the search warrant.

The warrant and criminal complaint say the [alleged perpetrator] then told another professor he spent time extracting "ribosomal-inhibiting proteins" from a source that he would not disclose to the professor.

[The 21 year old] was initially jailed for recklessly endangering safety and held in the Winnebago County Jail. Authorities ruled that there was sufficient probable cause in the case to hold him in custody for a reasonable amount of time without filing charges while they decided how to proceed with the case. The Winnebago County Jail says the male student was picked up by the FBI Monday morning [10 Nov 2014].

[Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5-10 per cent ricin.

Castor oil does not contain ricin.

Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need, hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 deg C (176 deg F).

Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

Inhalation: within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid is building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.

Ingestion: if someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. A chronic low level could explain the woman's condition and made it difficult to get an accurate diagnosis.

Skin and eye exposure: ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes.

Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received.

If in suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of ricin poisoning.

No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin.

Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is to avoid ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible.

Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.
