A case of H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in poultry and wild birds in north Wales, just days after the UK recorded its 1st bird flu outbreak of the season. The chief veterinary officer for Wales confirmed the presence of the H5N1 strain at a premises in Wrexham County on Monday evening (1 Nov 2021).

Temporary disease control zones of 3 km [1.9 mi] and 10 km [6.2 mi] have been imposed around the premises to limit the risk of disease spread. A veterinary investigation is under way; however, dead wild birds found in the area have tested positive for the virus and are believed to be the source of infection.

The Welsh government said the risk to public health from the virus was considered to be very low. This is the 1st confirmation of the disease in Wales since it was discovered in pheasants at a premises on Anglesey in January [2021].

[HPAI H5N1, a pathogen known for its zoonotic characteristics on top of its high pathogenicity in poultry, has been spreading in Eurasia and elsewhere since the start of the current autumn bird migration season; infected wild birds and outbreaks on poultry farms have been reported. This alarming development has led the Food and Agriculture Organzation of the United Nations (FAO) to distribute today (Tue 2 Nov 2021), through its <vph-l@listserv.fao.org> distribution list, an alert titled "H5Nx highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) - increased detection likely along wild bird migratory pathways and risk for introduction (multiple regions)."

The alert's introduction (references omitted) says: "Based on events monitored over the past weeks, FAO expects increased activity of H5Nx subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and potentially Africa during the autumn and winter of 2021-22. Strains of H5 HPAI virus are being detected in migratory birds in Western Europe, with most recent cases reported in Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The risk of disease introduction into other countries along wild bird migratory flyways is regarded as high. The Netherlands has already issued an order to keep poultry indoors following an outbreak of HPAI on a farm, and Italy has reported an outbreak in domestic turkeys. These reports are the latest in a sequence of detections in wild birds and poultry over the past weeks and months, starting with a notification in the south eastern Russian Federation mid-September [2021], followed by observed westwards movement of virus. Farms in countries that are situated along migratory flyways should put in place enhanced measures for prevention, early detection, and diagnosis of H5 HPAI, and for outbreak response. As other strains of avian influenza virus are also present in wild birds and poultry, co-circulation of multiple avian influenza strains provides opportunity for reassortment, potentially creating novel strains that could be more infectious or more virulent. The HA gene of the viruses from these recent outbreaks falls within H5 Clade 2.3.4.4b. Similar viruses have also been introduced into China via wild birds in late 2020. In this context it is noteworthy that a trend of increased human cases infected with clade 2.3.4.4b H5N6 viruses, associated with severe disease, has been reported from China. The zoonotic potential of avian influenza viruses should therefore be considered and appropriate personal protection measures applied when dealing with suspect cases in wild birds or outbreaks in poultry - or unexplained mortality in either."

In its further text, the FAO alert specifies in more detail the countries in which strains of H5Nx HPAI virus have been detected in migratory birds, including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Serbia, Sweden, and the UK, with the most recent cases reported on 16 Oct 2021 in Denmark, affecting a teal (_Anas_ sp.), in Germany, affecting a Eurasian wigeon (_Anas penelope_), and on 26 Oct 2021, at a wild bird rescue centre in the UK.

Notably, a fox has recently been found infected by HPAI H5N1 in the Netherlands, and 2 commercial poultry enterprises were reported as infected by HPAI H5N1 in Israel, along the southward flyway.

The FAO reminds countries about the importance to share full genome sequences and virus isolates with the scientific community early for further analysis and research so that epidemiological links between outbreaks can be established, virus evolution monitored, and zoonotic potential of emerging viruses assessed. This information is also used to match the appropriate vaccines to currently circulating strains, and novel viruses. There is a possibility that antigens in existing inactivated vaccines, used in several countries to protect poultry, may not be well matched to these novel, currently circulating strains. This is under review by FAO/OIE reference laboratories.

It is anticipated that the alert, which includes FAO's advice to countries at risk, will soon be available on the internet. - Mod.AS
