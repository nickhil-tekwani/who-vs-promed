Auckland is facing a hepatitis A outbreak with 19 cases confirmed, including some schoolchildren. Auckland Regional Public Health Service spokesman Dr Shanika Perera says a "large team" is working with the patients and affected schools. "At this time it is unknown how the disease was initially contracted. We are currently working with the cases to determine the source of the disease and prevent further spread." As of 9 am today [2 Mar 2012], 19 people were infected.

Hepatitis A is usually a mild illness in children with complete recovery and no ongoing health effects, but it affects teenagers and adults more seriously.

[Hepatitis A virus] is excreted through faeces and can be spread from person to person or by swallowing food or water that has been contaminated. Symptoms in children usually include fever, an upset stomach, and feeling tired and generally unwell, Perera says. Many children don't show signs of the infection, but very occasionally they will develop jaundice -- a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes.

"If a parent is concerned that their child may have been exposed to hepatitis A infection and they are unwell, we ask that they stay away from school, childcare centres, and social events and contact their doctor. Perera says more information would be made available to affected schools and families. The best way to prevent the spread of the infection is careful hand washing with soap and proper drying, especially after using the toilet and before eating.

"Hepatitis A is an uncommon disease in New Zealand but to keep it that way we need to contain the spread, regular hand washing with soap and warm water then drying thoroughly is the simplest way to prevent spread," Perera said.

[Hepatitis A (formerly known as infectious hepatitis) is an acute infectious disease of the liver caused by hepatitis A virus, usually spread by the fecal-oral route;. It is transmitted person-to-person by ingestion of contaminated food or water or through direct contact with an infectious person. The time between infection and the appearance of the symptoms is between 2 and 6 weeks and the average incubation period is 28 days.

In developing countries, and in regions with poor hygiene standards, the incidence of infection with this virus is high and the illness is usually contracted in early childhood. As incomes rise and access to clean water increases, the incidence of hepatitis A decreases. Consequently outbreaks of hepatitis A virus infection in New Zealand have been rare in recent times, although an outbreak of foodborne transmission via contaminated blueberries was recorded in 2002.

Hepatitis A infection causes no clinical signs and symptoms in over 90 percent of infected children and since the infection confers lifelong immunity, the disease is of no special significance to those infected early in life. In Europe, the United States, and other industrialized countries, on the other hand, the infection is contracted primarily by susceptible young adults.

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea.

Improved sanitation and hepatitis A immunization are the most effective ways to combat the disease. Several hepatitis A vaccines are available internationally. All are similar in terms of how well they protect people from the virus and their side effects. No vaccine is licensed for children younger than one year of age. Nearly 100 percent of people will develop protective levels of antibodies to the virus within one month after a single dose of the vaccine. Even after virus exposure, one dose of the vaccine within 2 weeks of contact with the virus has protective effects. Still, manufacturers recommend 2 vaccine doses to ensure longer-term protection of about 5 to 8 years after vaccination. Millions of people have been immunized with no serious adverse events.
