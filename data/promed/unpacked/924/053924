HPA update on seasonal norovirus activity
-----------------------------------------
Figures from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) show a drop in the number of hospital outbreaks of norovirus from 53 in the 2 weeks to 25 Nov 2012 down to 40 in the 2 weeks to 2 Dec 2012. However, the total number of confirmed laboratory reports of norovirus (both from community and hospital cases) is 2313 for the season, which is 64 per cent higher than the same period in the last season [2011-12] when there were 1412 cases reported. There are no clear indications as to why activity is higher this year.

The laboratory confirmed reports only represent a small proportion of the actual amount of norovirus activity in the community and it is estimated for every confirmed case there are a further 288 unreported cases (Food Standards Agency Report http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/foodborneillness/foodbornediseaseresearch/b14programme/b14projlist/b18021/#.UL8-VJOLJj5). Also as part of the HPA's surveillance of norovirus infection it collects data from NHS Direct [Telephone Advice Service]. Analysis of calls into the service show that the proportion of calls for diarrhoea are stable and within seasonally expected levels. Those relating to vomiting are decreasing but are still higher than the usual levels seen at this time of the year.

Norovirus is highly contagious and can be transmitted by contact with an infected person; by consuming contaminated food or water or by contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. The virus spreads rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals, schools, nursing and residential homes. Its symptoms include a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Some people may have a temperature, headache, and stomach cramps. The illness usually resolves in one or 2 days and there are no long-term effects.

Dr Bob Adak, head of the gastrointestinal diseases department at the HPA said: "The norovirus season is always completely unpredictable as it peaks and falls over several months -- usually October to April. However, one thing we do know is that every year we will see a large amount of norovirus activity because it is highly contagious.

"The figures for the last 2 weeks show that there has been a reduction in the numbers of outbreaks in hospitals although there are clearly a lot of other people becoming unwell as we can see from the number of lab reports. We would like to remind people to avoid visiting friends or relatives in hospital or care homes if they have symptoms consistent with a norovirus infection as it can lead to ward closures and severe disruption.

"Norovirus is a short-lived unpleasant infection but most people will fully recover in a couple of days. It is important to remain hydrated as you will be losing a lot of fluids due to the symptoms. Over-the-counter medicines can also be useful in reducing headaches and other aches and pains."

Advice for the public when managing a bout of norovirus:
- Do not visit your GP surgery or local A&E [Accident and Emergency] Unit. Norovirus infection is a self-limiting illness and you will recover naturally without treatment. It is, however, important to take plenty of drinks to replace lost fluids.
- Use NHS Direct's new diarrhoea and vomiting online health and symptom checker, to get advice on how to manage your symptoms at home or help to access the most appropriate health service visit the NHS Direct website [http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&Page&HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1191942172966].
- Wash hands thoroughly and regularly at all times, but particularly after using the toilet and before eating.
- Do not visit friends or relatives in hospitals or residential care homes as there is a real risk that you would introduce the infection putting vulnerable people at risk.

[Norovirus infection is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) in the UK. The disease was historically known as 'winter vomiting disease' due to its seasonality and typical symptoms. The disease is more prominent during the winter months but infections can occur at any time of the year. Outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis are common in semi-closed environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and cruise ships.

Norovirus outbreaks are not normally reported by ProMED-mail on account of their characteristic sudden onset and rapid resolution. Noroviruses were previously designated Norwalk-like viruses. They are now recognised as a distinct group of non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses belong to the family _Caliciviridae_. Currently, there are 6 recognized norovirus genogroups. 3 of the genogroups (GI, GII, and GIV) affect humans. More than 25 different genotypes have been identified within these 3 genogroups. Since 2002, variants of the GII.4 genotype have been the most common cause of norovirus outbreaks. The genogroup (or genogroups) responsible for the current outbreak in England and Wales has not been revealed. - Mod.CP
