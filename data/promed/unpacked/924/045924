[1] Philippines (Western Visayas)

The incidence of measles in Western Visayas has reached alarming levels with 170 cases and 3 suspected deaths recorded as of 6 Dec 2018 by the Department of Health-Center for Health Development (DOH-CHD) 6.

Dr. Mary Jane Roches Juanico, medical coordinator for the child health program, said that last month [November 2018], they recorded 130 cases, with 29 from the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) in Bacolod.

"The cases are under investigation. We are waiting for the results if indeed they are measles cases," she said in an interview on the sidelines of the DOH regional recognition of partners and stakeholders held at the Eon Centennial Resort in Alta Tierra in Jaro district in this city on Fri 7 Dec 2018.

Juanico said they have used various strategies to address the concern, including the door-to-door campaign.

The DOH-CHD 6 in October 2018 launched the supplemental immunization activity for measles, rubella, and oral polio vaccine (MR-OPV). The 1st phase was rolled out in 25 areas in Western Visayas, covering 339 183 children.

However, at the end of the one-month activity, they only covered 43 percent of their target population.

Records showed that 145 255 children, aged 6-59 months, were vaccinated for measles and rubella, and 147 055 were administered the OPV.

"We are still doing catch up for those children that we have missed until 14 Dec 2018," she said.

She said that during their program implementation review on 6 Dec 2018, they shared that they "really had a challenge in terms of social mobilization and advocacy, campaigning for the high turnout. It is mainly because of the refusal of our parents or caregivers due to the Dengvaxia scare. Our confidence rating in terms of the immunization program is not that good," she said.

The 2nd phase that will be administered during the 1st and 2nd quarter of 2019 will cover 42 areas or those that are considered as bordering areas or with the highest number of missed children. The 2nd phase will cover 258 443 children.

[The problems encountered following administration of the dengue vaccine have had far reaching consequences beyond dengue. People have extrapolated to other well-tested vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. The doctors and schools need to educate parents that MMR is much safer than getting the disease and very effective. - Mod.LK]

A measles epidemic plaguing Israel's haredi community has spread to the Jewish community in northern London, British news outlets have reported.

Haredi communities in New York City and Jerusalem have seen a surge in the number of measles infections since the spring, attributed in part to the relatively large number of people in those communities who have not been vaccinated.

By the end of October 2018, nearly 900 cases of measles had been reported in Israel, with roughly 60% of those infected coming from the haredi sector.

The epidemic has since spread to the Orthodox Jewish community in northern London, with dozens of cases reported over the past 2 months.

Close to 70 members of London's Orthodox Jewish community have been infected since October 2018, The Times reported. The majority of those infected had not been vaccinated, the report noted.

According to a report by the London-based Jewish Chronicle, the epidemic was spread when local haredi Jews visited Jerusalem for the Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot festival season, then returned to Britain in early October 2018, carrying the disease.

One physician in Stamford Hill, a north London neighborhood with a large haredi Jewish population, attributed the outbreak in part to the lower vaccination rates in the Orthodox community.

"Over the last 4-6 weeks, we've known there was a measles outbreak among the Charedi community in Israel. It has now reached our shores," Dr. Joseph Spitzer said in an interview with the Chronicle.

Vaccination rates are, Dr. Spitzer continued, "definitely lower than the general population, and there are lots of reasons for that. Some people will say it is due to the fact that they have large families and, therefore, they cannot keep up with the immunizations. There is also a little bit of what you might call 'haredi urban myth' and a mistrust of the secular authorities."

[Haredi is the Hebrew term for the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. The outbreak in Israel and an ensuing outbreak in the U.S. have hit ultra-Orthodox Jewish enclaves in both countries particularly hard. Dozens have contracted the virus in New York and New Jersey, and more than 1400 people -- the majority of them haredi -- have fallen ill in Israel, half of them in October 2018 alone.

Another case of measles was confirmed in Rockland County on Fri 7 Dec 2018. To date, there are 90 confirmed cases with 7 more suspected. The health department is continuing to investigate the suspected cases.

The entire county should be considered at risk. Even people previously considered immune -- anyone born before 1957 and anyone who has received 2 doses of measles vaccine -- could catch the highly contagious disease.

Health officials have kept tightened restrictions on schools in the geographic area where the outbreak is concentrated. All schools in New Square and any school in Spring Valley or Monsey where the immunization rate is lower than 80 percent, must keep un- or under-vaccinated students at home.

The restrictions, which affect 34 schools, will apply until 21 days after the last measles case is confirmed in the county, and officials acknowledge that that could be months away.

The county also wants children to be vaccinated earlier than usual. Instead of waiting till 12 months, any child 6 months or older or any adult who has not received their 1st MMR vaccine yet should get their 1st MMR vaccine now.

There remain 18 confirmed and 6 suspected cases of measles in the county as of Fri 7 Dec 2018, health officials reported.

The Ocean County Health Department is now reaching out to nearly 90 people who recently attended an invitation-only event who were exposed to the disease. The Department did not offer any other information on that event.

"While it is understandable that many would like to file this outbreak into the history books, we must continue to be vigilant and to take all necessary precautions to avoid an escalation of this measles outbreak," OCHD Coordinator Daniel E. Regenye said. "The unchanged number of confirmed cases demonstrates the effectiveness of public health measures already put into place, and we are grateful for the efforts of community leaders and members of the public who have embraced and amplified the messaging from the Ocean County Health Department.

Our message now is to remain informed on the status of potential measles exposure, insure that one's family is fully vaccinated and protected, and encourage others in the community to do likewise as we work towards the eventual eradication of measles in our county," Regenye said.

This outbreak was 1st reported in late October 2018. Since then, the Department has worked with other entities in the coordination, delivery, and administration of 12 400 MMR vaccinations.

"The present measles outbreak is a true public health crisis, which warrants the full attention of not only the Ocean County Health Department but also all medical providers in the outbreak area," Regenye said.

Chilean health officials have reported the 1st 2 measles cases of 2018. Both are confirmed, imported cases reported in November 2018.

According to the Chile Public Health Institute (ISP): The 1st case is a 42-year-old woman of Colombian nationality who had rash onset on 8 Nov 2018 and has been a resident of Chile for more than 10 years. The probable place of infection might be Ecuador or Colombia, as the case had stayed in both countries in the days prior to symptom onset. No secondary cases have been confirmed. Genotyping results indicated genotype D8, with the lineage results pending.

The 2nd case is a 4-year-old male child of Venezuelan nationality who had rash onset on 23 Nov 2018. The case arrived in Chile on 18 Nov 2018 by land from the city of Maracaibo, Zulia State, Venezuela; he traveled through Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru prior to reaching Chile through the northern part of the country. No secondary cases have been confirmed. Laboratory confirmation was carried out through serological tests and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); genotyping results indicated genotype D8, with the lineage results pending.

The last outbreak associated with imported cases in Chile was in 2015, with 9 confirmed cases reported (viral genotype H1).

In the Americas as of 30 Nov 2018, a total of 16 766 confirmed measles cases, including 86 deaths, have been reported in 12 countries of the region.

[Incidence of measles has increased tremendously in the Americas, largely due to low levels of vaccination and import from countries where measles is more prevalent. Genotyping helps identify origin and movement of the outbreaks. The WHO currently recognizes 8 clades, designated A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Within these clades, there are 23 recognized genotypes, designated A, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, E, F, G1, G2, G3, H1, and H2, and 1 provisional genotype, d11. Virologic surveillance for measles was initiated in response to the global measles resurgence that occurred in the late 1980s (Rota JS et al. Virology, 1992, vol. 188:135). These activities have increased significantly during the past 10 years because of the expansion of LabNet (excerpted from https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/204/suppl_1/S514/2194335). - Mod.LK]
