Philippines: Measles Outbreak EPOA operation update no. MDRPH032
Published on 10 May 2019 [preview]

A. Situation analysis
--------

6 Feb 2019: The DOH declared a measles outbreak in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Region 3 (Central Luzon). The PRC [Professional Regulation Commission] escalated preparations at chapter and national HQ levels and started to mobilize community health volunteers for rapid assessment and disease surveillance.

7 Feb 2019: DOH announced that the measles outbreak had spread to more areas in Luzon and Visayas in Calabarzon, Region 6 (Western Visayas) and Region 7 (Central Visayas).

12 Feb 2019: IFRC launched CHF181 417 from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support PRC plan of action.

6 Mar 2019: IFRC launched an emergency appeal, seeking a total amount of CHF 2 million [USD 1.98 million] for PRC to scale up its emergency response.

3 Apr 2019: IFRC Emergency Plan of Action published.

Description of the outbreak

On 7 Feb 2019, the Philippines Department of Health (DOH) declared the 1st outbreaks of measles in 5 regions (Region NCR, and Central Luzon Regions III, IV-A, VI, VII). Since then till 6 Apr [2019], the number of regions with outbreaks has increased to 17.

From 1 Jan to 27 Apr 2019, there have been 33 559 cases with 466 deaths recorded by DOH. For the same period last year [2018], there were 7618 cases and 65 deaths. In the whole of 2018, there were 21 812 measles cases reported with 199 deaths.

So far for this year [2019] on average, over 4 children are dying every day from the current measles outbreaks.

The map shows the spread of cases and corresponding deaths.

To address the outbreak, the DOH mounted another round of supplemental immunization program targeting 3.8 million children aged 6-59 months. DOH issued guidelines for nationwide measles vaccination accompanied by oral polio vaccine (OPV) and Vitamin A distribution, prioritising unvaccinated children between 6 and 59 months, schoolchildren from kindergarten to grade 6, and adults who voluntarily wish to be vaccinated against measles.

Summary of current response PRC's Operations Centre is collecting and collating all the data on measles cases and PRC's ongoing response and issue regular updates. The PRC Health Service, through their chapters and trained volunteers, continues to scale up the monitoring of cases and the response to affected communities on the ground. PRC is coordinating with the DOH Epidemiology Bureau. For relevant information sharing and support, PRC also continues to engage and coordinate with the NCR Infectious Diseases Cluster.

In support of the DOH, PRC have carried out the following activities:
- Mobilized 6 measles care units (MCUs) to help support hospitals that were being overwhelmed with measles cases. So far 3442 patients have been treated; and
- Mobilized vaccination teams to support the mass vaccinations of children. So far 16 956 children have been vaccinated.

See section C for the latest activities. For PRC activities, the location of MCUs and vaccinations carried out is shown on the following link:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bzws5uiEiEKXDNFJ6Qtpj2SIxOzk7ZwW&usp=s.

According to the joint UNICEF-WHO1 Situation Report up to 3 Apr 2019, 4 758 520 individuals have been vaccinated against measles and rubella: 2 964 843 [children] aged 6-59 months, 825 725 school-going children, and 967 952 children older than 12.

Overview of Red Cross Red Crescent movement: In-country, the PRC is leading the overall response operation. The PRC works with the IFRC, ICRC, and 10 Partner National Societies in the country: American Red Cross, Australian Red Cross, Canadian Red Cross, Finnish Red Cross, German Red Cross, Japanese Red Cross Society, the Netherlands Red Cross, Norwegian Red Cross, Spanish Red Cross, and Qatar Red Crescent Society.

The Netherlands Red Cross supports the appeal through remote data analysis. In the 1st phase of emergency response, focus will be on data analysis on health data collected during the outbreak, identifying trends, risk areas, and visualization of the information. In the 2nd phase of the operation, the support will focus on analysing the field data collected by PRC for the vaccination campaign targeting.

At least 1193 cases of measles were reported in Hanoi since the beginning of 2019, according to Vietnamese authorities. Viet Nam News reported that Hanoi recorded 88 cases of measles last week [week of Mon 6 May 2019]. The number of measles cases decreased slightly compared to previous weeks. However, measles was likely to persist, with about 70-80 cases being projected per week, said the Hanoi Center for Disease Control.

Nguyen Nhat Cam, the director of the center, said authorities in Hanoi have been warning citizens about a potential outbreak of the strain since 2018. He pointed out that the highly contagious disease could infect 100% of unvaccinated individuals when exposed to a carrier.

Apart from Hanoi, other areas in Vietnam have been hit by measles. In February 2019, 43 provinces had recorded the disease.

Hanoi vaccinated more than 500 000 children aged 1-5 by the end of last year [2018] as well as earlier this year [2019]. Nguyen said the rate of vaccinated children suffering from the disease was relatively low, proving the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Statistics from the Hanoi Center for Disease Control indicated that the city had been recording smaller, scattered outbreaks in urban and rural districts. The health department stated that citizens should take the initiative and get vaccinated in order to prevent the spread.

Three workers at a Gucci outlet in Hong Kong have fallen ill with measles in the past week, according to health officials. The outbreak of the highly infectious disease at the luxury fashion shop in the Harbour City shopping centre in Tsim Sha Tsui caused the store to close early on Monday [13 May 2019], while the mall's management deployed cleaners for disinfection.

The growing number of cases recorded in Hong Kong this year [2019] has put local health authorities on high alert.

The 1st Gucci worker affected, a 30-year-old salesman, came down with a fever last Tuesday [7 May 2019] when he flew to Tokyo on HK Express flight UO848. He developed a rash 3 days later. The man returned to the city on the budget airline's flight UO33 on Saturday [11 May 2019] and attended the emergency unit at Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei. The patient was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital in Kwai Chung the following day [Sun 12 May 2019]. His respiratory specimen tested positive for the measles virus. The man, who had previously received the measles vaccine and had a good health record, was listed in stable condition, the Centre for Health Protection said on Monday [13 May 2019] night. An investigation showed he had not been overseas during the incubation period, which lasts from 7-21 days before the onset of symptoms.

The 2nd case involved a 25-year-old saleswoman. She developed a fever and rash on Saturday [11 May 2019]. She also sought treatment at Kwong Wah Hospital before being admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on Monday [13 May 2019]. The woman, who had also been vaccinated, had no travel history during the incubation period but had been to Shenzhen during the communicable period.

The 3rd employee, another 25-year-old saleswoman, developed symptoms from Wednesday [8 May 2019]. She was admitted to Tseung Kwan O Hospital on Saturday [11 May 2019] and her condition was stable. She had been to Macau during the incubation period.

The 3 patients, all locals, brought the number of measles cases in the city this year [2019] to 73, including 29 associated with an outbreak among workers at the city's international airport. The number of cases last year [2018] was 15.

A centre spokesman said the 3 did not have contact with measles patients during the incubation period. Their home contacts remained asymptomatic. None had worked at other Gucci shops.

Health authorities gave a measles "mop-up" vaccination to 96 of the about 190 workers in the shop on Monday [13 May 2019] and would continue the operation on Tuesday [14 May 2019].

A Harbour City spokeswoman said the Gucci store told the mall about the infections on Monday [13 May 2019] evening. The store in the Canton Road mall and Gucci's office in the nearby Ocean Centre had been closed since Monday afternoon. On Monday night, cleaners in surgical masks were seen working inside the closed store. "We are carrying out a thorough disinfection and extra cleaning throughout the mall. The 2 washrooms near the store have also been temporarily suspended for disinfection and cleaning," the spokeswoman added.

A spokeswoman from Gucci Hong Kong said it had immediately closed the store while it worked with the Department of Health's Centre for Health Protection to provide vaccinations for all employees and to sanitise the location to prevent any further transmission of the virus.

She added the store would reopen once these precautionary measures had been taken.

[4] La Reunion

Two doctors who were not vaccinated against measles infected 6 people at the University Hospital Center CHU Bellepierre (Saint-Denis), according to information from the Indian Ocean Regional Health Agency (ARS), which had to carry out an investigation on a case-by-case basis over the weekend in order to understand [the identity of] the health staff were who were not protected from this virus. At the hospital, about hundred people were vaccinated in 2 days.

[The 2 doctors] put the whole hospital in danger. Each case of measles identified has required further investigation to trace the origin of this infection.

[It is] a complicated investigation, according to Dr. François Chieze, director of Health Security at ARS Indian Ocean. "The incubation period for measles can range from 7-18 days, a time that varies from person to person." And [it] especially [creates] a delay that slows down the health investigation at the CHU Bellepierre, since new cases have emerged one after the other.

By the end of 2018, there were only 4 cases of measles in Reunion. Progress was steady, reaching 42 cases about a month ago. While the number of infected people had stabilized, according to the ARS, this infection at the Bellepierre Hospital has made a jump in the statistics.

In one month, the number of cases has thus increased from 42 to 48. In fact, 7 new cases have been declared in all: the 6 related to the contamination of Bellepierre University Hospital, and another, located in a nursery. Yet, paradoxically, François Chieze explains that immunization coverage is improving in Reunion. "We were at 85%, which is not enough since we must reach the 95% to eradicate an illness, and now we are close to 86%, which should increase further."

This improvement in vaccination coverage on the island would be directly linked to the 11 compulsory vaccines since 1 Jan 2018 for early childhood. Measles has been part of this since then. "This increase gives us confidence," says François Chieze, "especially since newborns are part of populations at risk." This is also the case for pregnant women or people showing an immune deficiency.

However, if the measles vaccine has become mandatory for the youngest, it is not so for adults, and, therefore, for doctors either. The online platform that lists the vaccinations for professionals classifies measles as a "recommended" and not a "mandatory" vaccine.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles is in full resurgence: the reported cases were multiplied by 4 at the beginning of the year [2019], compared to the beginning of 2018. The disease returns now under the form of a global epidemic. Africa is the most affected continent, with a 700% increase in cases during the 1st quarter of the year [2019]. In Madagascar, measles killed more than 1140 people between September 2018 and March 2019.

There has been an outbreak of measles in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, with the UK among the worst high-income countries for uptake of the vaccination against the disease.

Through schools, Public Health England is issuing letters warning parents that a number of children have been diagnosed with measles in Herts and Beds since 20 Mar [2019].

A parent of a pupil at Giles Nursery and Infants' School in Stevenage said: "I am actually in disbelief that I've just been sent an email from my children's school to say there is an outbreak of measles in Hertfordshire. There is no excuse for this disease to have made a comeback when it is so easily preventable. If you are able to, get vaccinated."

Two doses of the vaccine are essential to protect children from the disease. However, global coverage of the 1st dose was reported at 85% in 2017 and for the 2nd dose at 67%.

The World Health Organisation recommends a threshold of 95% immunisation coverage to achieve so-called "herd immunity."

In the 1st 3 months of 2019, more than 110 000 measles cases were reported worldwide, up nearly 300% from the same period last year [2018].

UNICEF data show the UK is 3rd on the list of high-income countries with the most children not receiving the 1st dose of the measles vaccine between 2010 and 2017, at 527 000. The United States tops the list at more than 2.5 million and is followed by France with 608 000.

A dramatic drop in vaccinations in the UK followed the publication of fraudulent research linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab to autism by disgraced British doctor Andrew Wakefield in 1998.

"The ground for the global measles outbreaks that we are witnessing today was laid years ago," said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF executive director. "The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children. If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child."

WHO is scaling up its response to the ongoing measles outbreaks in the European region, including by creating an operational platform to accelerate its support to affected countries.

The decision followed an assessment of the measles situation in the region. It was based on the growing number of children and adults affected by and dying from the disease, and the persistence of pockets of non-immunized or under-immunized individuals in many countries fuelling the continuing spread of measles.

Since 1 Jan 2018, 47 of the 53 countries in the region have together reported over 100 000 measles cases and over 90 measles-related deaths. WHO has been supporting them over time to improve their immunization coverage and tackle disease spread. However, as measles continues to circulate across countries, more needs to be done.

"We have observed an unprecedented upsurge in people sick with this preventable disease, and too many have lost their lives to it," says Dr Dorit Nitzan, acting regional emergency director at the WHO Regional Office for Europe. "This is unacceptable, and we need to be bolder and scale up our response to the next level. I am proud to see that different parts and levels of WHO are intensifying their combined efforts to stop these outbreaks."

"WHO has been working closely with countries in the European Region to enhance their capacity to protect children from measles. However, this alarming resurgence is a warning that the region's immunization coverage is not yet sufficient," explains Dr Masoud Dara, acting director of communicable diseases at the WHO Regional Office for Europe. "Escalating our response will enable us to raise political awareness and will help in strengthening European health systems in the longer term to avoid future outbreaks."

https://www.scidev.net/global/health/news/venezuela-struggles-to-halt-measles-epidemic.html


Measles transmission is still active in Venezuela, and public health measures to control the outbreak since it began in 2017 have not been sufficient, health experts say.

With 5667 confirmed cases of measles in 2018, and a further 140 in the 1st quarter of 2019, Venezuela has the highest number of autochthonous cases of the disease in South America, and the 5th highest in the world, according to a report by Venezuelan health experts. The report notes that while a mass vaccination programme has substantially reduced the spread of the disease, it has not been enough to prevent new cases emerging.

The report, published 1 May [2019] by the Venezuelan Society of Public Health and the Defend National Epidemiology Network, found that Venezuela represents 52% of the total reported in South America this year [2019], followed by Colombia with 87 cases (36%) and Brazil with 29 cases (11%). The 3 countries are affected by the same virus genotype and lineage detected in Venezuela at the start of the outbreak. "Now, these 3 countries have lost the status of measles-free territories," the report says.

Measles cases have been registered in 12 Latin American countries in the last 2 years. But the other 9 countries have only reported imported cases, often coming from outside the region and associated with different genotypes.

The latest analysis takes into account the most recent Epidemiological Update Report published by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on 18 Apr [2019] and includes data from a UNICEF report, released 1 Mar [2019].

UNICEF and the WHO warned last month [April 2019] of a "global measles crisis," highlighting a 300% surge in the number of measles cases during the 1st 3 months of this year [2019], compared to the same period last year [2018].

The Venezuelan report states that the country ranked 5th highest for measles cases worldwide in 2018, after Ukraine, the Philippines, Brazil, and Yemen.

However, Venezuela has the highest incidence of the disease in Latin America, with a rate of 196 cases per million inhabitants, 4 times higher than Brazil, with 49 cases per million inhabitants.

It also has the greatest number of deaths linked to the disease, with 136 confirmed in 2018 and 1st quarter of 2019. This was followed by Brazil with 12 deaths in the same period.

The report acknowledged that efforts had been made to control the disease, including a mass vaccination programme, for which the country acquired about 13 million doses of vaccines.

Mass vaccination "has allowed a substantial reduction of cases," but the epidemic continues with new cases "in 14 federal entities in the last quarter of 2018 and 10 federal entities in the 1st quarter of 2019," according to the report.

Huniades Urbina, president of the Venezuelan Society of Paediatrics, said the persistence of new cases signaled that vaccination coverage was insufficient. "We are not reaching all the populations we should be," he told SciDev.Net.

This opinion is echoed in the report by Venezuelan health experts, which calls for better protection for the most vulnerable across the country. "This is still to be achieved, especially in the border territories, with dispersed population and difficult access," the report said.

Marianella Herrera, president of the Venezuelan Health Observatory and researcher at the Center for Development Studies of the Central University of Venezuela, told SciDev.Net that it was difficult to make an accurate assessment of vaccination coverage as the government does not release official figures.

International travel brought the measles virus to Orthodox Jewish communities in New York and New Jersey and to Washington state, according to 2 new reports from officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments published in today's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR).

In addition, officials in Oklahoma have reported the state's 1st case of the year [2019], while Washington and Pennsylvania added to their case totals.

Low vaccination rates in NY, NJ
-----------------------

The 1st MMWR report details outbreaks in religious communities in Rockland County, New York, and Ocean County, New Jersey. In both outbreaks, unvaccinated travelers reported recent travel in Israel, where an outbreak of about 3150 measles cases is ongoing, the authors said.

Since 1 Oct 2018, New York has recorded 242 measles cases, including 206 in Rockland County and 36 in surrounding areas. The median patient age is 5. In the outbreak areas, the measles vaccination coverage in school was 77%. Since the outbreak began, Rockland County has administered more than 19 000 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

In New Jersey, officials said 33 measles cases were confirmed in an Orthodox community from17 Oct-30 Nov 2018. The average age of case-patients in that outbreak was 10. Though that outbreak was declared over in January [2019], Ocean County now has a 2nd outbreak of the virus, which began in January [2019].

"Health departments and clinicians should be aware of multiple ongoing measles outbreaks globally, and travelers should have evidence of measles immunity," the authors said.

Measles' return to Clark County, Washington
------------------
In the 2nd MMWR report, the authors describe a measles outbreak in Clark County, Washington, that began on the last day of 2018.

As of 28 Mar 2019, measles had been confirmed in 71 Clark County residents, with rash onsets from 30 Dec 2018 to 13 Mar 2019. Seventy-three percent of patients were children under the age of 10, and 61 cases (86%) were unvaccinated.

The initial case-patient was a 10-year-old unvaccinated boy who had recently arrived from Ukraine. He presented to an urgent care facility with symptoms of measles on 31 Dec 2018.

Households and churches accounted for most of the transmission sites, the authors said.

"Clark County had not experienced a measles outbreak since 2011, when 3 cases were confirmed. Since 2013, county vaccination rates have remained 10%-14% lower than the statewide average (88%)," the authors concluded.

New cases in Oklahoma, Washington, Pennsylvania
--------------------
Though the outbreaks in New York and New Jersey are some of the most high-profile in the United States, several other states are reporting virus activity this week [week of Mon 13 May 2019].

Officials in Oklahoma confirmed a measles case in Okmulgee County, the 1st in the state since May 2018.

"Measles was identified in a person who returned to Oklahoma after traveling to various domestic and international destinations," the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) said in a statement yesterday [Wed 15 May 2019]. "The virus is still common in many parts of the world, with outbreaks occurring in Europe, Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines. These outbreaks have resulted in travelers who develop illness in the U.S. following their return. In addition to the high number of cases, there are outbreaks ongoing in several states."

Washington state officials said 4 new case-patients recorded this week all spent time at the SeaTac airport during their likely time of exposure or infectiousness. The cases do not appear to be connected to earlier outbreaks in that state. Officials have now confirmed 77 cases in the state.

According to a Facebook post from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania's health department, 2 more measles cases were reported among adult, unvaccinated family members of a family who had previously reported 5 cases. "There have been no additional public exposures because of quarantine orders for the family," officials said.

Finally, today the Associated Press (AP) reported that West Virginia officials planning the Boy Scout's World Scout Jamboree this summer are anticipating that some children may bring measles with them to the event.

West Virginia has not seen a measles case since 2009, but 45 000 scouts and leaders from around the world are expected to attend the jamboree, which runs from 22 Jul-2 Aug [2019].
