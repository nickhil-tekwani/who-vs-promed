The 1st recorded outbreak of yellow fever [YF] in Kenya occurred from
mid-1992 through March 1993. Nearly all confirmed infections were
acquired between 1500-1800 m [4900-5900 ft] in the Tugen Hills
[Baringo district, Rift Valley province], not far from the present
outbreak area.

Transmission appeared to be entirely sylvatic, that is, all confirmed
cases were independent of other human cases and had acquired their
infection by contact with mosquitoes that had been infected by feeding
on viraemic monkeys. Infected mosquitoes (_Aedes africanus_ and _Ae.
keniensis_) were captured close to a cluster of human cases at ca.
1700m [5577 ft].

A team comprised of Kenya Government/KEMRI/WHO/CDC specialists found
that _Ae. aegypti_ was absent in the villages, hard to find in the
small local town of Kabarnet [Baringo district] (population 10 000)
but abundant in Kakamega [Western province] (population 73 000) and
Kisumu [Nyanza province] (current population estimated at 0.5
million), Kenya's 3rd most populous city. There was an excellent road
from the area to Kisumu; the drive took about 4 hours without
speeding.

The population in the outbreak area was small but included the
ancestral village of the then-president, Arap Moi. We were told that
this had enabled many local people to obtain jobs in Nairobi and other
parts of the country.

All this to emphasize the obvious: the region of transmission was
once quite remote but today there is a real and present danger that
such outbreaks could metastasise to urban areas in other parts of the
country and beyond, with potentially catastrophic consequences.
Pro-active vaccination of the local population would greatly reduce
this danger and thereby evade anxieties over adverse impact on
tourism.

Lastly, although there are virtually no records of yellow fever in
other parts of the country, older men in the local community
remembered a large epidemic of fever, haemorrhage, and jaundice that
had occurred in the area during World War II, perhaps in 1941 or
1942.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Reiter for his interesting comments on YF in
Kenya. His concern about potential spread of YF virus to other parts
of Kenya is serious and one hopes that a prompt vaccination campaign
in the affected areas will prevent spread to other areas.
