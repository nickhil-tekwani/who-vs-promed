The following publication illustrates an unusual source of tularemia reported in Switzerland:

Ehrensperger F, Riederer L and Friedl A:Tularemia after attack of one buzzard on a jogger: A "One Health" case report. Schweiz Arch Tierheilkd 2018; 160:185-188, https://doi.org/10.17236/sat00153 [in German, abstract in English]

Summary:
A female jogger was attacked by a common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_) and was scratched lightly at the back of the head. One week later she was taken ill with high fever and headache which was later diagnosed as ulceroglandular tularemia in regional lymph nodes, caused by _Francisella tularensis_. Recovery was only achieved after several weeks of systemic antimicrobial treatment (gentamicin/ciprofloxacin).

Tularemia is a well known zoonotic disease, called "rabbit fever", mainly affecting rabbits and hares, but also small rodents. Human infection occurs often following tick bites or bloodsucking insects, or in hunters or slaughterers handling infected animals. Bites by mice have also been reported as a cause of tularemia.

For the first time we report this case of tularemia as a result of an attack by a bird of prey. We assume that the bird acted as a vector just carrying the _F. tularensis_ on its claws or beak, but we cannot exclude an infection of the bird itself. Several other joggers had also been attacked by a common buzzard in the same area shortly after the above described event and one of these also became infected with _F. tularensis_.
