More people have been added to the patient list in an outbreak of "adverse events" linked to dry cereal, according to the FDA.

The agency is now reporting 555 complaints of what it is describing as "adverse events" after eating un unnamed dry cereal. Although the cereal is not identified in the FDA's outbreak update, a spokesperson has confirmed to Food Safety News that it is investigating complaints about Lucky Charms breakfast cereal. This past week the FDA had collected 529 reports of illnesses that consumers believe to be linked to the cereal. That was up from 446 the previous week and 231 from the week preceding that. So, the stream of complaints appears to be slowing.

Since late 2021, the crowdsourcing website <iwaspoisoned.com> has received more than 7300 reports from people complaining of classic food poisoning symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after eating Lucky Charms cereal. General Mills, the maker of the cereal, has said that it has investigated the situation and there is no apparent link between the reported illnesses and Lucky Charms.

The FDA has begun on-site inspections and sample collection and testing, but it has not reported what business or location is involved.

[ProMED has been aware of this potential foodborne outbreak since the 1st news reports occurred. It still remains unclear if the breakfast cereal is related to these illnesses. While the baking process should inactivate any bacterial pathogens, some toxins are heat stable and can cause nausea and vomiting, or contamination can occur after the baking process. An example of the latter is baked-pastry transmission of hepatitis A related to post-baking contamination of the icing (ProMED post Hepatitis A, 2012 - Germany: (NI) bakery sweet pastries, Archive no. 20141219.3042399). ProMED would appreciate any additional information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.LL
