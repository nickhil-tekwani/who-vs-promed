USA: wild sparrow in Hawaii tests positive for WNV
--------------------------------------------------
A wild sparrow found at Kahului Airport has tested positive for West Nile
virus in preliminary results, state Health Department officials said.
Samples are being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
for more testing. State and county officials say they will spray the
airport and surrounding area for mosquitoes, which spread the virus to
humans, birds and other animals. "We need to respond quickly and forcefully
to control this potential public health threat to the state," said state
epidemiologist Paul Effler.
Most people who are bitten by an infected mosquito will show no symptoms,
the Health Department said. But some can exhibit flu-like symptoms, which
typically last a few days. And in rare cases, the virus has been fatal.
Before the finding [of the sparrow], Hawaii had been free of the virus.
Residents statewide are being asked to eliminate standing water to decrease
the risk of mosquitoes breeding. Also, if residents find a dead bird they
are asked to notify Health Department authorities. A list of collection
sites is available at <http://www.hawaii.gov/health>.

[Up to the present Hawaii and Alaska are the only regions of the United
States to have remained free of West Nile virus infection. David Duffy has
added the following comment. "This was apparently an ELISA test. The
Department of Health (DOH) is to be commended for getting this information
out early. The bird was at the Maui airport, but most people have been
expecting the first positive to be on Oahu at the Honolulu airport. There
are plans for an aggressive effort for widespread aerial spraying, but
these were again focused on Oahu. The ground-based effort will fall on the
HI-DOH vector control folks. If it fails, Hawaii's endemic bird fauna,
already suffering from avian malaria and avian poxvirus, will face the
onslaught of West Nile virus." - Mod.CP]
