[3] Request for clinical information
Date: 10 Sep 2006
From: Belinda Thompson <bt42@cornell.edu>

I would appreciate seeing an actual description of the clinical
course of the disease in cattle, as the North American strains cause
no apparent illness in cattle. I have visited the other websites
referenced in previous ProMED postings regarding the outbreaks in
Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium and found the clinical
descriptions to be summaries, although there are some good photos. If
there are veterinarians who have worked with any of these European
bluetongue cattle outbreaks who could comment, please do.
I am interested in knowing about duration of fever, the severity of
any lameness that was apparent, whether or not spontaneous abortions
were associated with the outbreaks, etc. I also would be interested
in knowing about clinical variability among the outbreaks in France,
Germany and the Netherlands.

[The outbreaks continue to involve new cases at a significant but not
unexpected rate for the 1st occurrence of this exotic serotype in the
region. In Germany, the areas involved were mostly the same except
for the addition of 4 farms in Monchengladbach, Stadt and
Rheinisch-Burnisher Kreis (3). Please see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia>.
In Belgium, all the new outbreaks were in areas previously reported
last week. - Mod. PC]
