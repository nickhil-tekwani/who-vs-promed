In Bavaria, 9 hunters apparently have been infected with the causative agent of rabbit fever. According to information from the district administrative office in Swan village, the men had, on 27 Oct 2018, shot 8 eight rabbits and eviscerated and packed them. Eight of the men have been hospitalized since 4 Nov 2018 at the Amberg hospital, the district office spokesman Hans Prechtl confirmed. The 9th hunter was admitted 5 days later.

Tularemia (rabbit fever) is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. People can become infected through close contact with diseased animals or their tissues, writes the Bavarian state office for health and food safety. It is risky dealing with the carcasses when killed animals are eviscerated and skinned. Rabbit fever is primarily an occupational disease of hunters, but also of chefs, butchers, and veterinarians.

According to the Robert Koch Institute, each year only a few dozen cases are reported. In the year 2017, 52 people in Germany were afflicted, 13 of them in Bavaria. The disease is compulsorily reportable. To protect against the disease, the Bavarian state office recommends only eating wild game dishes that have been well cooked and avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals or carcasses.

In the Bavarian hunters, the pathogen is still not officially proven, said press secretary of the County Office Hans Precht. A 2nd blood sample was currently being examined at the Robert Koch-Institute in Berlin. The diagnosis is "very highly" [sic].

All the men have improved. The 1st of them will probably be discharged this Thu 15 Nov 2018.

[The following information was obtained from The Center for Food Security & Public Health, Iowa State University fact sheet on tularemia, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/tularemia.pdf:

"Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that can affect many mammals. Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ (formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family _Francisellaceae_. A total of 4 subspecies are currently recognized. Although all 4 cause tularemia, they tend to be associated with different animal hosts, and their propensity to cause severe disease varies. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (also known as type A) has been found almost exclusively in North America. It is the most virulent species, particularly in humans. _F. tularensis_ subsp _holarctica_ (type B) is much more widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, but it is less virulent. The 2 remaining species, _F. tularensis_ subsp. _mediasiatica_ and _F. tularensis_ subsp _novicida_, have been recognized in limited geographical regions, are rarely found in people, and seem to cause relatively mild disease when they occur. Additional subspecies have also been proposed. With rare exceptions, tularemia occurs only in the northern hemisphere. This disease has been reported from North America, Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and northern Africa.

"Among the northern hemisphere, _F. tularensis tularensis_ is seen almost exclusively in North America and has very rarely been isolated in Europe. Contrarily, _F. tularensis holarctica_ is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. This species is responsible for nearly all cases of tularemia outside North America. It co-exists with _F. tularensis tularensis_ in North America. _F. tularensis mediasiatica_ occurs in a limited area of Central Asia, and _F. tularensis novicida_ has been reported from North America, Australia and Spain.

"Humans acquire _F. tularensis_ from various sources including lakes and streams, food contaminated by the carcasses of infected animals or their excretions, laboratory cultures or clinical samples, and tissues from infected animals. Hunting or skinning animals, or contact with meat when preparing food, are important routes of exposure. Respiratory infections sometimes occur in farmers who are exposed through activities such as piling hay. Cases have been reported after mowing lawns, possibly from running over an animal carcass. Human infections have also been linked to handling infected animals or being bitten by them. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported."

The manifestations of tularemia in the hunters have not been stated. - Mod.LL
