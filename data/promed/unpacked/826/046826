[Anthrax is sporadic in Campania, as it is now in most of Italy. In 2011 there were 6 outbreaks involving cattle, sheep and goats in 2009 and 2011, and a horse in 2011. There have been few outbreaks during pthe past 9 years. Possibly vaccination has slackened off this year (2020). Goats have short lives, so one must wonder how this singular goat got infected and died. - Mod.MHJ
