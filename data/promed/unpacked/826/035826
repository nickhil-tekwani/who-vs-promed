Two more tested positive for brucellosis in Bulgaria, total number of infected is 13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Two more people from Rila Municipality have been tested positive for brucellosis. Thus the number of infected people rose to 13," Deputy District Governor of Kyustendil, Silvia Velkova, announced on the news for Radio Focus Kyustendil. Blood samples of 2 other people showed results close to the positive levels and they would be tested again.

More [than?] 80 goats out of 219 were tested positive for brucellosis.

[Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection that can be spread not only by direct contact with the animal carrier but also by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese. The infection is also known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with _Brucella melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle) and _B. suis_ (swine).

The infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis.

Localized infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system (1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). Genitourinary [GU] brucellosis may present identically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as depression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5), so-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can, however, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).
