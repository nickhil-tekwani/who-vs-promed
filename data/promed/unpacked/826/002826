Some 193 new cases of cholera were notified, without any fatalities,

Angola's southern province of Cunene.
Speaking to ANGOP on Tuesday [3 Apr 2007], Cunene's health director,
Eduardo Haiumba, noted that the new reported cases were blamed on the
failure of citizens, living on Ondjiva city's outskirts, to use clean
drinking water.
Since the disease outbreak, in September 2006, health officials have
notified 1915 cases of cholera, with 72 deaths in the districts of

Laboratory tests on water samples in various sections of the Vaal
River revealed traces of cholera, the Northern Cape health department
said yesterday, 3 Apr 2007.
The department said the traces were found "specifically at Barkly
West, Spitskop, Schmidtsdrift, the Vaalharts weir in Warrenton and
the Vaalharts canal system". Treated water was safe for all purposes
as tests on samples were negative for cholera, it was revealed.
"Environmental conditions are favorable for cholera and other
waterborne diseases and the public is alerted not to drink any
untreated or raw surface water from any source."

[8] Dysentery, diarrhea, post-disaster - Solomon Islands

The UN said Monday's (2 Apr 2007) earthquake/tsunami disaster killed
at least 34 people, though the Solomons' official toll is 28.
Government officials say they expect more deaths to be confirmed
later.
Susie Chippendale, communications manager for international Red Cross
operations in Gizo, said Fri 6 Apr 2007, that some dysentery cases
have been reported among those displaced by the disaster. "It seems
pretty under control at this stage, and hopefully there won't be a
huge outbreak," she said.
Unhygienic conditions and a lack of clean water have contributed to
diarrhea outbreaks in several of the makeshift camps where at least
2000 survivors are staying near Gizo.
Dr. Gregory Jilini, the senior health official in Western Province,
said work has begun to build pit toilets in the camps to fend off
disease.
Officials fear malaria and cholera could break out in hillside camps,
where thousands of people who fled are afraid to leave, fearing
another wave.
