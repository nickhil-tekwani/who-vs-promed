[In a recent posting (3 Apr 2003) I reported that a suspect case of Plum
pox virus (PPV) had been almost certainly ruled out in tests conducted by
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA). A summary of the investigation carried
out by MAF Biosecurity Authority, MAF - National Plant Pest Reference
Laboratory (NPPRL) and AgriQuality New Zealand (AQNZ) is given below. - Mod.DH]
With reference to the ProMED-Plant post of 3 April 2003, tests conducted by
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) have basically ruled out PPV as the virus
causing the symptoms. A summary of the investigation carried out by MAF
Biosecurity Authority, MAF - National Plant Pest Reference Laboratory
(NPPRL) and AgriQuality New Zealand (AQNZ) is given below.
The MAF - National Plant Pest Reference Laboratory (NPPRL) conducted an
extensive testing programme including ELISA (using antisera to PPV and
potyviruses), RT-PCR (using specific primers for PPV and universal primers
for potyviruses), and immuno-capture RT-PCR (IC-RT-PCR; using PPV antisera
and PPV primers) on symptomatic fruit and leaves. All ELISA, RT-PCR, and
IC-RT-PCR tests were negative for PPV. Leaf samples were sent to the USDA
for validation on 18 Mar 2003, and PPV was not detected.
NPPRL scientists also tested leaf samples for fungal and bacterial
infections. Fruit was found to be infected with _Xanthomonas arboricola_
pv. _pruni_ and a secondary fungal pathogen (_Fusarium lateritium_), both
of which are common in New Zealand. A number of saprophytic fungi were
isolated from the leaves.
HortResearch (a Crown research institute) and NPPRL scientists tested
suspect material for the presence of Apple chlorotic leaf spot trichovirus
(ACLSV) using HortResearch's RT-PCR protocol. The testing confirmed the
presence of ACLSV. Infected leaf sap was mechanically inoculated into
herbaceous host plants and symptoms were observed on _Chenopodium quinoa_
(shoot tip necrosis), suggesting the presence of another virus in the
sample. The second virus was identified as Prunus necrotic ringspot
bromovirus (PNRSV) using ELISA. Both ACLSV and PNRSV are widespread in New
Zealand.
10 sites (both commercial and domestic) growing stonefruit within a 10-km
radius of the suspect property were surveyed by AQNZ. Symptoms of PPV were
not observed and PPV was not detected in any of the samples collected.
MAF-NPPRL scientists have therefore concluded that the PPV-like symptoms
observed on fruit and leaves were not caused by PPV, but by ACLSV,
possibly in combination with PNRSV.
If PPV was detected in New Zealand, MAF would apply initial containment
measures while conducting a delimiting survey to determine the spread of
the disease. A decision on action to eradicate would then be made based on
the results of this survey and consultation with affected parties.
Eradication is a likely scenario where the virus has only a limited
distribution.
