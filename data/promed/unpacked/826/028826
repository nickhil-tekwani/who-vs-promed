Despite warnings about canned chili, hash, and stew possibly contaminated
with botulism, a few area stores -- even a local bait and tackle shop and a
food pantry -- still stocked them on their shelves, local health
departments found.
Since last week, health departments across the state started combing
convenience stores and other locations for the products, potentially
containing the deadly foodborne illness.
New Hanover County Health Department workers finished searching convenience
stores, food pantries, and other sites with canned goods on the morning of
6 Aug 2007. Since Thu 2 Aug 2007, New Hanover health inspectors reported
that 90 cans were removed from shelves or from public consumption at 18
locations, including Roy's Bait & Tackle on US 421. Meanwhile, Brunswick
County health inspectors noted that 36 cans were removed from 12 places in
the same period. Pender County health officials encountered 2 cans in 2
locations.
Castleberry's Food Co issued a recall on 18 Jul 2007 of products such as
its Hot Dog Chili Sauce, Beef Stew, and Chili with and without beans. Most
of the products do not have the Castleberry's name on them. The products
also include 4 different types of dog foods under the brand Natural Balance.
To date, no one in North Carolina (NC) has fallen ill with botulism, said
Larry Michael, head of the dairy and food protection branch of the NC
Division of Environmental Health. The recall involves 25 brand names and
more than 80 products, according to the NC Division of Environmental Health.
"This is a complex recall due to the fact there's so many different brand
names involved and so many types of food products," Michael said. "I've
never seen one quite this complex before."
Last week, the state asked local health departments to check smaller
operations to get the word out. Local recall efforts focused on mom-and-pop
convenience stores, childcare centers, nursing homes, and food pantries.

[There have been a number of reports from the state of North Carolina
regarding the effort to find more of the recalled cans and, as expected,
more have been identified especially in more rural areas and smaller
(retail or not) locations and food banks. Little information has come forth
regarding the results of similar efforts in other states. It is not
entirely clear if the same aggressive effort was made in other states or if
no cans were found in those states.
This recall is especially important because cases of neurotoxin type A
botulism have been caused by some of the cans in the recall. The number of
human cases involved in this North American outbreak is in flux; 4 cases (2
in Indiana and 2 in Texas) are linked but a 3rd case in Indiana, a case in
New Mexico, and (perhaps) cases in Ohio and Hawaii are still being evaluated.
Most recalls regarding botulism are related to problems in production,
which could have allowed germination of _Clostridium botulinum_ spores and
production of the toxin by vegetative bacilli. In the Castleberry's recall,
however, problems in production did allow the production of toxin. That the
number of cases to this point remains small suggests only a small
percentage of cans were truly toxin-containing even if the previously
posted unknown number of "exploding cans" are added. It is not likely that
earlier cases of botulism related to the canned food were missed as the
disease usually occurs in its classic form, often with the need for
prolonged respiratory support.
The counties (New Hanover, Brunswick, and Pender) mentioned in this posting
are located in extreme south coastal North Carolina and can be found on a
