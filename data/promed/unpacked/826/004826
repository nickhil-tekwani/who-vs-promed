Sharp rise in malaria infection in Cambodia
-------------------------------------------
Cambodia has seen a one-third rise in malaria cases over the past year.
Cambodian health authorities say deaths and infections from malaria have
risen sharply with its leading malaria expert saying that 279 people died
from the disease last year (2009) -- an increase of one-third on 2008. Dr
Duong Socheat says the number of people infected with the mosquitoborne
parasite also increased from 58 000 to around 80 000.

He blames the rise on last year's early arrival of rains and the late
distribution of mosquito nets. And, he says, more people are moving to
forested areas -- which increases the risk of contracting malaria.

The numbers mark a reversal of the decline in malaria infections and deaths
seen over the past decade. They also raise doubts about Cambodia's ability
to reach its United Nations-backed Millennium Development Goals to cut
malaria deaths.

[The malaria situation in the Mekong region has recently been reviewed
(Delacollette C et al. Malaria trends and challenges in the Greater Mekong
Subregion. SE Asian J Trop Med Pub Hlth 2009;40:674-91). The paper
highlights the fact that there has been a drastic decline in malaria deaths
and confirmed malaria cases over the past 10 years.

Malaria is concentrated in forested/forest-fringe areas of the region,
which is in accordance with this report indicating that the increase is due
to population movements into forested areas.

The study also points out that the declining efficacy of artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACTs) against falciparum malaria on the
Cambodia-Thailand border, and the prevalence of counterfeit and substandard
antimalarial drugs contribute to persistent transmission. This is enhanced
by the lack of health services in general and malaria services in
particular in remote settings. - Mod.EP
