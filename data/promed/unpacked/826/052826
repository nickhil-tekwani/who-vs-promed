There has been an anthrax outbreak in Chervonoye village, near Kiev. The
disease has spread to the farms of the neighboring village Lozovy Yar.
Medical inspection will probably discover disease centers in other
villages. Already 4 dozen head of cattle have been lost. At the moment, 8
people are hospitalized with the cutaneous form of the disease. According
to "1 + 1" channel, all the infected people are now in the [infectious
disease section of Yagotin district hospital, [and additional funds have
been allotted to cure the disease. The patients' condition is considered to
be satisfactory.
For the time being, doctors cannot say how many other people will require
medical aid. Because the markets alongside Ukraine roads have no veterinary
control, the meat from some diseased animals has been sold there.
This anthrax epidemic is being combated with an experimental vaccine.
Scientists' hopes were seemingly justified recently, when no new victims
were reported at the farm in Chervonoye village.
One theory behind the source of the current epidemic is that anthrax spores
could have come from a 60-year-old [animal burial site.

[The experimental vaccine is probably "55," which was first developed in
the Ukraine. - Mod.MHJ
