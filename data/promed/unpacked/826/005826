Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever in South Sudan - WHO Update 2
------------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 26 May 2004, the health authorities of Yambio County have
reported a total of 20 cases, including 5 deaths, from Ebola haemorrhagic
fever (EHF) in Yambio, Western Equatoria, south Sudan. Ebola virus
(sub-type Sudan) has been confirmed by laboratory tests at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States and the Kenya
Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Nairobi, Kenya.
The team from the WHO South Sudan Early Warning and Response Network
(EWARN) and from WHO headquarters are continuing to work with the Crisis
Committee to control the outbreak. Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF-France) is
supporting the isolation ward and case management in Yambio hospital. CDC,
as part of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN
<http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/>) are providing further
laboratory and infection control experts in the field. Other
nongovernmental organizations and churches are also working to contain the
outbreak.
National authorities in the neighbouring countries of Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) and in Uganda have enhanced surveillance in bordering areas.
In DRC, a national team, supported by the WHO Country Office is alerting
the local population, augmenting surveillance and performing active case
finding. MSF teams in Province Orientale are also on the alert.

Uganda: Ebola Fever Alert Throughout Northern Border Region
---------------------------------------------------
A team of health workers from the [Ugandan] Ministry of Health was
yesterday still monitoring the northern border districts following an Ebola
haemorrhagic fever outbreak in southern Sudan. The Minister of health,
Brig. Jim Muhwezi, yesterday said no victims were reported in any of the
areas which were placed on high alert on Mon 24 May 2004.
"We have dispatched a team of health workers to the region to monitor the
situation. Our team has concluded that there is no trace of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever in Uganda yet," Muhwezi said in an interview. He urged
Ugandans to stay calm, saying it was unlikely that Ebola would extend into
northern Uganda. Muhwezi said the Government would not take chances, adding
that they would do anything possible to protect the people in case of an
outbreak of the disease in the area.
The World Health Organisation on Fri 21 May 2004 confirmed a virus of the
Ebola family [the family _Filoviridae_] in Hai-Cuba, Yambio county in
Western Equatorial Province of the Sudan. 4 people had died and 11 [5 and
20 as of Wed 26 May 2004] contracted the disease while 102, who made
contact with patients, were being monitored.
Muhwezi cautioned the people of northern Uganda against crossing into
Sudan. He told them to be careful while in contact with people from the
Sudan, saying any one in contact with an infected person risked getting the
disease. The area of the disease outbreak is more than 300 km northwest of
Uganda's northwestern border.

Kenya: Border Controls Proposed to Prevent Introduction of Ebola
----------------------------------------------------
Medical experts want strict measures enacted to prevent the spread of the
deadly Ebola into Kenya. The experts made their recommendations on Tue 25
May 2004 following confirmation by the World Health Organisation that Ebola
had killed 5 people in southern Sudan.
The team from the Ministry of Health met under the aegis of the Disease
Outbreak Management Unit. Sources said the team, headed by Deputy Director
of Medical Services Dr F M Kamau, recommends that the government screens
visitors entering Kenya from the Sudan. And the Kenya Medical Association
has also told the government to move swiftly to stop the disease from
spreading into Kenya. The chairman, Dr Stephen Ochiel, asked the government
to act swiftly to ensure all visitors and relief workers are screened
before being allowed into Kenya.
Kenya shares a common border with Sudan, with major cross-border activities
taking place in Lokichoggio town in Turkana District, which is the nerve
centre of relief agencies working in southern Sudan. Several airlines
operate flights to Lokichoggio from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport,
but regular and frequent flights are to and from Wilson Airport.
It has also emerged that Kenyan researchers were among top world experts
working in southern Sudan's Equatorial Province to contain the virus, which
has so far infected 19 people. The Director of the Kenya Medical Research
Institute (Kemri), Dr Davy Koech, confirmed Kenyan experts flew into Sudan
last week after WHO expressed fear of an Ebola outbreak. Blood samples and
fluids from victims were then flown to Kemri's headquarters in Nairobi,
where the Ebola virus was confirmed. Also involved in the tests was the
United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.
WHO confirmed the Ebola infections on Mon 24 May 2004, but it said there is
no need yet to impose quarantine in the affected Yambio County. The head of
WHO's southern Sudan office, Dr Abdullahi Ahmed, told the East African
Standard yesterday that owing to the highly infectious nature of the
disease, all Sudan's neighbours, including Kenya, have been notified. Kenya
suffered a major Ebola scare in 2000, when an outbreak was reported in
Uganda. At that time, the government imposed screening rules for all
visitors entering Kenya from Uganda.
