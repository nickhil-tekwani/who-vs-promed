FDA RESTRICTED DRUGS
====================
Over the New Year weekend the VETPLUS-L net had a most interesting
series of communications concerning the ethical problems involved
in treating dogs damaged in organised dog-fights ... here in the USA
as in many countries, these fights are illegal. [If you are interested
contact VETPLUS-L-owner@u.washington.edu, if you are not already
receiving VETPLUS-L.]
The problems and rationalities were those covered in Ethics 101
with contemporary details. But out of these messages came a clear
fact that US owners involved in dog-fighting were regularly "treating"
their dogs with antibiotics bought from feed-stores and such, and only
submitting them for professional care when the dog either did not
respond or was too badly damaged.
The following communication points this up:

Subject: Dog fighting and FDA restricted drugs
I know you are wondering what dog fighting and FDA restricted drugs have
in common. The same ethical questions. I know for a fact that the "feed
stores" in my area are selling FDA restricted drugs. Some of these drugs
can be lethal if not handled properly, such as Micotil, Protaglandins,
and others. This man even dispensed injectible Bute to a person to give
to their horse so that it would be easier to put shoes on...needless to
say, the horseowner did't get any "route of administration" info from this
person and I got to see the horse when the side of it's neck was rotting.

My point is, I contacted the FDA directly on several occasions and have
cheerfully had my information listened to, with the reply that they will
get back in touch with me when they have had an "investigator" look into
the matter. You guessed it. I've never received a single response. It
makes you feel like "what's the use."

What's this got to do with ProMED-AHEAD?
Coming from a country (UK) where veterinary drug availability was
carefully constrained by law and tradition, and are now even more strictly
controlled by EU regulations, I have found the ready availability in the USA
of veterinary drugs in country feed-stores frankly bizarre. Quite apart
from anything else this freedom greatly adds to the risk of inhanced
zoonotic infections and ineffective vaccinations. Concerned as we are in
ProMED-AHEAD by emerging diseases, I wonder whether any of the AHEAD
participants are in FDA and would care to comment. Similarly, what has been
the experience of those in other countries with greater or less constraints?
