Pet passports let in diseases
-----------------------------
The relaxation of rules designed to protect the UK against rabies has opened
the way to the entry of other animal diseases.
The Pet Travel Scheme (Pets) allows owners of companion animals to take them
in and out of Britain. But animals coming from exotic disease areas abroad
are now bringing new problems with them. Veterinary surgeons say more checks
are needed to see what risk they represent. They report their concerns in
the Veterinary Record, the [weekly] journal of the British Veterinary
Association (BVA).
A team of UK and French vets analysed diagnostic data from imported animals
that were found to be sick between April 2001 and July 2002. They also
reviewed data from animals quarantined during that time (quarantine is
obligatory for animals from countries not included in the Pets scheme). The
team tested samples from 67 dogs and 3 cats, most of which had
entered the UK under Pets: 14 of the dogs and one cat had been in
quarantine.
Blood samples were tested for 3 exotic diseases: babesiosis, leishmaniasis,
and ehrlichiosis. None of the cats showed signs of any of the diseases, but
17 of the 53 dogs that had entered under Pets and 7 of the 14 that entered
the UK through quarantine had one or more of the 3 pathogens.
*Babesiosis is a severe tick-borne disease caused by various types of
babesia, a microscopic parasite that infects red blood cells. In humans it
is rare, but potentially fatal. Babesiosis is a common infection in animals.
Babesiosis was the most commonly diagnosed illness, and 10 dogs were
confirmed with one of 2 strains of the disease. Several dogs showed evidence
of more than one pathogen. 5 had travelled from France under Pets, 2 more
under Pets from Thailand through Germany and from Japan; and 3 had been
quarantined, 2 from Hong Kong and one from South Africa.
*Leishmaniasis is a potentially contagious disease in dogs and cats, though
there must always be a mosquito [sic -- see Moderator's comment below] to
transmit the parasite. It can affect humans, but most people are unlikely to
become ill. Of the dogs with leishmaniasis, 4 had travelled from Spain: the
vets say this probably underestimates the number of infected animals
entering the UK under Pets.
*Ehrlichiosis, another tick-borne disease affecting dogs, can cause anaemia,
decreased resistance to disease, infection, and abnormal bleeding. 5 of the
6 dogs with ehrlichiosis had come from countries not included in the Pets
scheme.
They say their findings "indicate the significance of these infections as a
health and welfare issue for both the animals and their owners. Should
introduction of the appropriate vectors occur, or alternative methods of
transmission evolve, there is risk of extension of disease into dog, cat,
human, or wildlife populations which have not travelled. Larger targeted
surveillance schemes are required to further evaluate and monitor the risk
involved."
The Pets scheme was introduced in February 2000. It allows animals from an
approved list of countries to avoid undergoing 6-month quarantine periods.
It applies at the moment to animals travelling from most of Europe, from
North America, and from a number of long-haul rabies-free countries.

[Leishmaniasis is transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies, not mosquitoes (a
reviewer's error?!). In the absence of a suitable
vector, it does not seem likely that this protozoan disease will continue
its cycle in the UK. It should be recalled, however, that foxhounds in the
USA appear to be transmitting a Mediterranean strain of _Leishmania_ without
benefit of an insect vector -- see first reference below. There are no
records of humans becoming infected by canine strains of _Babesia_, whereas
humans can become infected by the same strains of _Ehrlichia_ that affect
dogs. - Mod.AS, JW]
