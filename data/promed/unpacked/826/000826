Fort Meade officials say 2 cases of infant botulism have been
reported in residents at the Army post since Oct 2006. Fort Meade
spokesman Travis Edwards says one infant, who was diagnosed on 6 Oct
2006, has recovered. He says the 2nd, who was diagnosed late in
December 2006, remains hospitalized at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center. Both infants were under the age of 6 months when they were
diagnosed. Some 6000 people live on the installation.
Lieutenant Colonel Sharon Cole-Wainwright, chief of preventative
medicine at Fort Meade, says infant botulism is caused by ingesting
[spores of the] _Clostridium botulinum_ bacterium found naturally in
soils and in some contaminated food products.
Edwards says officials placed hay on a dirt lot at the base to reduce
the spread of dust, and the installation commander went door-to-door
handing out fact sheet about infant botulism.

[Infant botulism results from the ingestion of spores of the organism
rather than preformed toxin. It is the most common form of botulism
in the USA. A much rarer equivalent to infant botulism, adult
colonization botulism, also may occur. Both can be grouped under the
umbrella term intestinal botulism. This term implies in situ
production of the neurotoxin. The following is the CDC editorial
note with references from the 2003 report of a cluster of cases of
infant botulism in New York City. As noted in the piece, apparent
clusters of infant botulism are quite rare.
"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the
United States (1); about 100 cases are reported among infants in the
United States annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older
children and adults (2-6). Intestinal botulism results from
colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the
colon. Swallowing ambient _C. botulinum_ spores, which exist
worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route
of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores
(4). A common source of exposure generally is not identified;
apparent clusters such as the 4 Staten Island cases are rare and
often remain unexplained after investigations are complete (7). In a
cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the
mid-Atlantic region of the United States, no common source of
exposure was identified (8).
Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged <12
months who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking,
swallowing, or crying; hypotonia; and progressive bulbar and
extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical
ventilation during hospitalization (9). Lumbar puncture and brain
imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate
among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is
suspected, local and state health departments should be notified
promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing.
The primary therapy for infant botulism is intensive care with
mechanically assisted ventilation when necessary. Prompt diagnosis
and treatment of infant botulism with BIG-IV might reduce the length
of time needed for recovery. In a placebo-controlled trial of BIG-IV,
the mean hospital stay of patients with infant botulism was reduced
from 5.6 to 2.6 weeks (4).
Therapy is guided by clinical diagnosis; to avoid delay in treatment,
BIG-IV should be requested and administered without awaiting
laboratory confirmation. BIG-IV can be obtained from the CDHS Infant
Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, telephone 510-540-2646.
Use of BIG-IV under the FDA-approved Treatment Investigational New
Drug open-label protocol requires informed parental consent and
coordination with the hospital's institutional review board (IRB).
The license application for BIG-IV was filed with FDA in 2001; should
it be licensed, IRB approval would no longer be required. Infant
botulism is notifiable at the national level, and physicians should
report all cases promptly to state and local health departments.
