The Escambia County Mosquito Control Division has identified a new species of mosquito within the county called _Aedes japonicus_, or Asian bush mosquito. Mosquito control technician Kimberly Betts identified the new species from a CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] light trap set in Cantonment near International Paper.

The Asian bush mosquito can also be found in Santa Rosa, Walton, Okaloosa, Bay and Leon Counties, and with the migration into Escambia, it brings the known list of mosquito species in Escambia County to 73.

Kimberly Betts realized the mosquito was not an Asian tiger mosquito, one of the local prominent container breeding mosquitoes, because the markings and colors were different: 2 samples of the newly found mosquito were sent to a lab in Vero Beach, Florida and were officially verified as a new species within the county.

The Asian tiger and Asian bush mosquitoes both breed in natural and artificial water containers, including rock pools, bird baths, pet bowls and flower containers. Like the Asian tiger mosquito, the Asian bush mosquito is an aggressive daytime-biting mosquito, capable of transmitting several diseases [pathogens] to animals and people, according to Escambia County.

To help reduce the risk of getting bitten by mosquitoes, Escambia County said residents should follow the "5 D's and an S" of mosquito control:
- Dusk to Dawn - is the time frame when mosquitoes are most active. Reduce or eliminate outdoor activity between dusk and dawn or take precautions to prevent mosquito bites
- Drainage - is key to eliminating breeding sites for mosquitoes. Check around your home to rid the area of standing water. Water found in old tires, flowerpots, clogged rain gutters, leaky pipes and faucets, birdbaths and wading pools is where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.
- Dress - in light colored, long sleeves and pants when you are outside, especially in mosquito infested areas.
- DEET - if you are going to be outside when mosquitoes are most active, make sure you apply insect repellent that contains DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide). Read and follow label instructions. Spray both exposed skin and clothing with repellent when outdoors.
- Screens - make sure window and door screens are in good condition.

Animals, such as dogs, cats and horses may be bitten by mosquitoes as well, though these animals may be protected by using vaccines and other methods as prescribed. Consult your veterinarian for methods to protect animals from mosquitoborne diseases.

[_Ochlerotatus (Aedes) japonicus_ has been found in several eastern USA states and even as far away as British Columbia in western Canada. It is not surprising to find it in new localities in Florida. _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) japonicus_ continues to expand its geographic range in North America. Although Florida temperatures are relatively warm, because this species can tolerate cold temperatures, that expansion is likely to continue. In the United States, West Nile virus has been isolated from pools of _Oc. j. japonicus_ captured in Westchester county, New York state, and New Jersey (see ProMED-mail archive numbers 20000905.1515 and 20020824.5132). This species has been shown to transmit West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, LaCrosse, Eastern equine encephalitis, and St Louis encephalitis viruses experimentally in the laboratory.
