[2] Outbreak summaries
- Thu 14 Nov 2019. WHO: Disease Outbreak News
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/14-november-2019-ebola-drc/en/

WHO Disease update - Ebola virus DR Congo as at November 14

A total of 6 new confirmed cases were reported in the past week (6 to 12 Nov 2019) in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. All 6 cases resulted from local transmission in Beni and in Mabalako Health Zones, and all were known contacts of a confirmed case. While all cases can be linked to earlier transmission chains in Biakato Mines Health Area, Mandima Health Zone, that health area has not reported a case since 4 Nov 2019.

In the past week, Kalunguta Health Zone reported 21 days with no new confirmed EVD cases and Katwa Health Zone cleared 42 days with no new confirmed cases. As the number of cases decreases steadily, other case indicators appear to be encouraging. The proportion of registered contacts among cases prior to symptom onset is increasing over time, reaching 100% (6/6) in the past 7 days. Trends in proportion of community deaths among confirmed cases have also improved. In the past 3 weeks, 12% (3/34) of cases were community deaths, compared to 28% (17/61) in the previous 3-week period (9-29 Oct) and 33% over the course of the entire outbreak. A shorter delay from symptom onset to admission to isolation of alive EVD patients has also been reported. Between 24 Aug and 1 Oct 2019 the delay averaged 4.1 days, compared to 3.2 days between 2 Oct and 12 Nov 2019.

However, concerns remain around the recent shift of cases to Mabalako Health Zone. In the past 21 days (23 Oct to 12 Nov 2019), 40 confirmed cases were reported from 5 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1) with the majority reported in 3 health zones: Mabalako (40%, n= 16), Mandima (33%, n= 13), and Beni (20%, n= 8). Ongoing local transmission in Bingo and Ngoyo Health Areas in Mabalako Health Zone is challenging because security issues have caused access and response difficulties in these areas.

As of 12 Nov 2019, a total of 3291 EVD cases were reported, including 3173 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2193 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1856) were female, 28% (n=930) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.

This week the World Health Organization prequalified an Ebola vaccine for the 1st time. The injectable Ebola vaccine, Ervebo, manufactured by Merck (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) has met WHO standards for quality, safety and efficacy and can now be procured for at-risk countries by United Nations agencies and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. This decision will not have an immediate impact on the availability of the vaccine or how current doses are used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but is a step towards greater availability in the future.

Ebola sickens one more in DRC outbreak, WHO sees positive signs
---------------------------------------------------------------
One more Ebola case was reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak today [Thu 14 Nov 2019], raising the overall total to 3292 cases, which includes 118 listed as probable, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard.

Outbreak responders are still investigating 527 suspected cases. Meanwhile, the number of deaths held steady at 2192.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) in its latest daily update noted locations for 4 cases reported yesterday [Wed 13 Nov 2019]. Two were from Beni and 2 were from Mabalako.

In its weekly snapshot of the outbreak, the WHO today reported some promising developments. For the week ending 12 Nov 2019, all 6 confirmed cases were from Beni and Mabalako and were known contacts of confirmed patients. All of the cases are linked to the Biakato Mines area in Mandima, which has not reported an illness since 4 Nov 2019.

Kalunguta health zone has passed 21 days, one incubation period, with no new cases, and Katwa health zone has passed 2 incubation periods with no new cases.

The proportion of registered contacts is increasing and was 100% for the last 6 confirmed cases. Health officials are concerned, however, about a shift in cases to Mabalako, where ongoing transmission on Bingo and Ngoyo is challenging due to problems with security and access.

- Tue 12 Nov 2019. Democratic Republic of Congo: Ebola virus disease - external situation report 67
[WHO/AFRO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, edited]
http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/1slximg4hsd62s8q096ex

1. Situation update
Over the last 3 months, there has been a steady decrease in confirmed cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the peak of the epidemic in the last week of April 2019, 120 cases were reported. In the week of 4 to 10 Nov 2019 only 12 cases were reported. Teams are building on this progress by enhancing efforts to thoroughly investigate all new cases and improving contact tracing in order to break the remaining transmission chains.

All cases in the past week had linkages to Biakato Mine Health Area in Mandima Health Zone, though only 1 case was reported from this health area. Of the 11 cases reported outside of Biakato Mine Health Area, over half of these cases (n=7) were the result of local transmission after reintroduction of cases from Biakato and the remaining 4 were a result of movement to or from the area. In the past week, 5 (41%) of the cases were linked to nosocomial transmission, with 4 of these linked to a case imported in Beni Health Zone from Biakato Mines Health Area. Of the confirmed cases in the past week, all but one were known contacts prior to being linked to a confirmed case. Follow-up of contacts had temporarily declined in certain areas, particularly in Beni and Mabalako Health Zones. In Beni, registered contacts under surveillance decreased from 98% to 78% between 29 Oct and 6 Nov 2019. This is the result of a sudden increase in the number of contacts listed around newly reported cases. Follow up of contacts has improved in recent days to 86% on 10 Nov 2019 due to scaling up of contact tracing efforts in the health zone.

In the 21 days from 21 Oct to 10 Nov 2019, 15 health areas and 5 health zones have reported cases. During this period, a total of 42 confirmed cases were reported, with Mabalako (38%; n=16 cases), Mandima (36%; n=15 cases), and Beni (14%; n=6 cases) as the principal hot spots.

As of 10 Nov 2019, a total of 3287 EVD cases were reported, including 3169 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2193 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1854) were female, 28% (929) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (163) were healthcare workers.

[3] Rapid response team
Date: Sat 16 Nov 2019
Source: Provinces 26rdc [in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.provinces26rdc.net/rdc-ebola-lunion-africaine-va-installer-une-equipe-dintervention-rapide-pour-une-riposte-efficace-en-plus-de-fonds-qui-seront-collectes/


The African Union, through its technical body for prevention and fight against diseases (AFRICA CDC), will install a large team composed of experienced people in the fight against Ebola, which will have to intervene quickly and efficiently at each appearance of this epidemic in the DRC and in the Central African sub-region.

This team is part of several actions of the African Union in the response to the Ebola virus disease in the DRC.
Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, head of the technical secretariat of the Multisectoral Committee for the Ebola Virus Disease Response (CMRE), 1st welcomed the announcement of an African Union Forum to be held on 2 Dec 2019 to reap the fund to strengthen the fight against Ebola.

He acknowledged the support of CDC Africa since the beginning of the 10th epidemic before announcing the establishment of a rapid response team in the response to Ebola. "CDC Afrique supports 60 people from the INRB who are involved in the response in the field. The director of CDC Africa has come to announce that the African Union wants to organize a money collection forum to further support the fight against Ebola. CDC Africa will install a great strong team that will stay here in the DRC using those who have the Ebola experience to be like a quick response team. In case of another epidemic in the DRC or in another country of the sub-region, they can intervene quickly "said Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe. For his part, Johnson Nkengasong, director of the African Center for Disease Prevention and Control (AFRICA CDC), said that the 2 Dec 2019 Forum is not late because it is a fundraiser that will continue and that will find ways to respond well to each epidemic.

"The Forum does not intervene late. It may be worth noting that during the outbreak in West Africa, the African Union convened a forum to support affected countries. In addition, we are at the 10th Ebola outbreak in the DRC. According to our estimates, there can be an 11th outbreak. So we do not want to be in a situation where we only react when there is an illness. We want to be in the situation of a prepared response. We believe that we have all the elements to make an effective response every time. Since you imagine if we reacted very early to the 10th epidemic, we would not be where we are today. We believe that these efforts to mobilize the fund must continue to support the response," he said.

Mr. Johnson Nkengasong welcomed the modernization of the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) with donations from the Japanese Embassy in the DRC. This will help build the world's largest Ebola center.

[4] Vaccine
- Sat 16 Nov 2019. North Kivu (Goma) Johnson & Johnson vaccine
http://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20191114-drcongo-begins-using-second-ebola-vaccine-msf

A total of 15 people received the 1st of 2 injections on Thu [14 Nov 2019] of the new Ebola vaccine in Goma, the capital of the North Kivu region of the eastern Democratic of Congo, said Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the medical charity who administered the vaccine.

"It's not a replacement for the 1st vaccine, it's being used to complement it, especially in areas where there are no cases of (Ebola) transmission," MSF coordinator Steve Akuha told Agence France Presse news agency.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the 2nd of its kind used in the DRC, will be given in 2 injections, 56 days apart. It is slated to be given to some 50 000 people over the next 4 months.

Ebola, the deadly hemorrhagic virus, has gripped the eastern part of the country since the epidemic was discovered in August 2018 -- the 2nd worst worldwide. The government health authorities report that some 2193 people have died over the past 15 months. The epicenter of the virus, the largely urban Beni-Butembo area, has had cases decrease over the past couple of months, but the virus has now spread to largely rural neighbouring Ituri.

This vaccine was initially rejected by the then-Congolese Health Minister Olly Ilunga who said introducing a 2nd vaccine would be difficult where resistance to the Ebola health response was high. However, he resigned in July 2019 and is under investigation for allegedly embezzling millions of Euros from the Ebola fund.

His departure paved the way for the 2nd vaccine.

Resistance by local communities was high, as health care workers have been attacked 300 times over the past 15 months, and 6 have been killed. But the health response was initially hindered by poor communication, or even miscommunication by officials, many of whom did not understand the complexities of the languages in the area.

Not enough people vaccinated

The original Merck vaccine was already been used in the region, where some quarter of a million people have been immunized against the virus, many of them Ebola health workers.

MSF came out in September 2019 to denounce the World Health Organisation (WHO) for opaquely managing the 1st vaccination supplies. "The pace of vaccination activities is too slow and only a fraction of the eligible population is benefiting from this critical tool," said MSF, and called for an independent committee to manage the vaccination programs.

- Fri 15 Nov 2019. North Kivu (Goma) Vaccinator teams
[US AID; in French, machine trans., edited]
http://koma-ebola.info/goma-le-chef-du-quartier-de-kahembe-appelle-sa-population-a-recevoir-le-nouveau-vaccin-contre-ebola
[Byline: by Jeremie Soupou]

In an interview with Koma Ebola, Celestin Tulinavo called on the population to receive the vaccinator teams.

This Fri 15 Nov 2019, the 2nd day of the vaccination, several residents of Kahembe district came forward to be vaccinated. Confiding in KomaEbola, the head of this district, Celestin Tulinavo, who was the 1st to be vaccinated welcomed the involvement of the population.

"My family and I are vaccinated. The whole population of my neighborhood has appropriated the activity, prevention is better than cure. It is very important that everyone is vaccinated. I encourage everyone to be vaccinated. Even children a year or older must come for the vaccine. I have sensitized all my people for a long time. There is no resistance, "he said.

The vaccine is planning to vaccinate 50 000 people at Goma and could expand the activity to other parts of the province. According to the coordinator of the Ebola Virus Disease Response in the DRC, Professor Steve Ahuka, no one should be forced to receive the vaccine; only those who want it receive it by consent.

As a reminder, the 2nd Ebola-coined vaccine named Johnson & Johnson was introduced on Thu 14 Nov in the DRC from 2 health areas in the town of Goma.
