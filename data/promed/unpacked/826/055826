A slew of diseases is on the prowl in the district. Nipah was followed by jaundice, and now Japanese encephalitis (JE) has reared its head in Kozhikode too, and a Chemmarathur native (68) has succumbed to it. She died at Kozhikode Medical College Hospital (KMCH), and the sample result from Manipal has confirmed JE.

According to the Health Inspector of Maniyur gram panchayat, the presence of the breeding spot of _Culex_ mosquitoes, which spread JE [virus], has been identified at Chemmarathur. The health wing has streamlined activities in the region, and combined efforts to destroy mosquito breeding sources are going on.

[A 5 Jun 2018 ProMED-mail post (Japanese encephalitis & other - India (05): (KL) 20180605.5840545) indicated that there have been 3 recent Japanese encephalitis cases, one of whom, perhaps the case above, died. The JE virus transmission season has begun in India. Although a vaccine is available, there is no indication that the 3 patients had been vaccinated or whether a vaccination campaign is planned. Because vector control is difficult and expensive, vaccination is a more effective preventive measure.

Frequently, in reports of JE cases in India, acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of undefined etiology is often mentioned with JE cases, a minority of those hospitalized. In the above case, AES is not mentioned.

[2] Japanese encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome comment

Since 2008, data regarding Japanese encephalitis in India have distinguished between Japanese encephalitis [JE] and acute encephalitis syndrome [AES]. Cases of the latter have been variously ascribed to Chandipura, enteroviral infection, scrub typhus, and lychee fruit intoxication [1,2]. In 1963, 22 percent of individuals in Assam (Lakhimpur and Darrang districts) were seropositive toward JE virus. Surveys conducted during 2006 to 2014 found that Japanese encephalitis was responsible for 30 percent to 78 percent of acute encephalitis cases in Assam. A study published in 2007 found that 19.3 percent of patients with Japanese encephalitis in Assam state have concurrent neurocysticercosis (primary references available from author). In the following chart, I've compared reported incidence for these 2 conditions [3] https://www.gideononline.com/2018/06/20/japanese-encephalitis-in-assam-state/.

[Dr. Berger's comments underscore the point that incidence of acute encephalitis syndrome of unknown confirmed etiology often occurs concomitantly when confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis are diagnosed in the same populations in northeastern India. This has been frequently mentioned in comments of other ProMED-mail posts, and it is nice to have the corresponding information from Dr. Berger. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, and lychee fruit consumption. Scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_) has recently been implicated in many AES cases. A retrospective study by Murhekar M et al (https://academic.oup.com/jme/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jme/tjy042/4955586) indicates that scrub typhus may be responsible for the majority of AES cases.

One hopes that the prospective studies with collaboration of Assam state medical investigators and the USA CDC, as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children progresses, will provide additional information about the etiology of AES.

The JE and AES season is now underway in northeastern India, and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018). - Mod.TY
