Seoul Shik Poom, Inc. of Hillside, NJ, is recalling the following
products because they have the potential to be contaminated with
_Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium, which can cause
life-threatening illness or death:
Item number / Description / Weight (pounds)
BG1103 / Bupsungpo Fz. Salted Yellow Croaker (bag) / 2.2 lbs
BG1121B / Polar Fz. Dried Yellow Croaker (bag) / 4.5 lbs
BG1121 / Polar Fz. Dried Yellow Croaker (bag) / 2.2 lbs
BG1122B / Polar Fz. Dried Yellow Croaker (bag) / 4.5 lbs
BG1124 / Choripdong Fz. Yellow Croaker (bulk box) / 29.73 lbs
BG1124A / Choripdong Fz. Yellow Croaker (bulk box) / 31.6 lbs
BG1123 / Choripdong Fz. Yellow Croaker (bulk box) / 30.83 lbs
Consumers are warned not to use these products even if they do not
look or smell spoiled.
Frozen Salted/Dried Yellow Croaker was distributed in New York, New
Jersey and Maryland area. It reached consumers through retail stores.
This product comes in a clear plastic bag and is individually tied with rope.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to defective
preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result
in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_.
The following is abstracted from the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Regulations Section 540.650: Uneviscerated Fish Products that
are Salt-cured, Dried, or Smoked (CPG 7108.17)
<http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgfod/cpg540-650.htm>:
Uneviscerated, salt-cured, whole fish products have caused several
outbreaks of botulism and death. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous
in fishery products and the marine environment. The spores represent
a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative
cell growth and toxin production.
A total of 3 outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11
illnesses, resulted from "kapchunka" in the USA between 1981 and
1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is
also known as "rybetz", "ribeyza," or "rostov." Kapchunka is an
uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may
not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as cooking.
The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a
minimum of 25 days and then air dried at ambient temperature for 3 to
7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly
stored under refrigeration.
In 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, "faseikh" was
implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh
is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh
mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which
may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. In another, an
ethnic fish product called "moloha" caused a botulism outbreak
involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated,
salt-cured fish product similar to "faseikh." The preparation steps
in the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of
the "moloha" could not be found.
Other salt-cured products, such as "bloaters," can also pose a public
health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated
whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be
transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In
addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried,
pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The
referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a
well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated
with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.
The problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in
attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an
uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_.
Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried,
smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin
may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs
of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the consumer.
Control of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery
products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned
foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as control of
water activity, pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The
control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the
product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.
Control of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked
products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally
3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are
prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish
under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to
ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of
salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the
attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.
The FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or
smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In
addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from
uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the
original product. Therefore, with the exception of small,
uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers
uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as
well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning
of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in
that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary
conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.
These products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature,
refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or
modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]
