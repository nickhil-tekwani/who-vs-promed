Epidemiology:
This epidemic apparently started in Guongdong Province in Southern
China. Several cases have occurred in travelers to this area. An
"impressive" cluster has been linked to one hotel in Hong Kong. A physician
from Guongdong visited Hong Kong for a wedding on 21 Feb 2003, and stayed
one night at this hotel. 12 other cases have been linked to this hotel; 9
of the 12 stayed on the same floor. These cases were then responsible for
secondary clusters in Toronto, Hanoi, Singapore, and further cases at 3
Hong Kong hospitals. It is my understanding that this floor is a "smoking
floor" of the hotel, which may be of interest with regard to transmission.
At least 200 cases have occurred in Hong Kong, and transmission has been
documented from patients to healthcare workers to healthcare worker's
families, and most recently into the schools in that area. WHO is
currently investigating 456 cases, including 17 deaths in 16 countries.
This total does not include any from China. In the United States, CDC is
currently investigating 40 cases that meet the case definition in 18
states. The age range is 7 years to 78 years. 16 of these cases were
hospitalized, and one patient was placed on mechanical ventilation but has
since recovered. There have been no deaths attributed to SARS in the United
States to date. At least 10 of the cases had documented pneumonia by chest
x-ray. 2 of the cases occurred in health care workers and 4 have been in
family contacts.
Clinical Syndrome:
Illness begins with a prodrome of fever, chills, headache, myalgias, and
malaise followed later by a respiratory phase characterized by a dry,
nonproductive cough and dyspnea. Laboratory abnormalities include
lymphopenia, leukopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevations in serum CK
and/or transaminase concentrations. Among the 7 cases investigated by CDC
to date, all demonstrated lymphopenia (defined as less than 1500
lymphocytes/mm3). For further details on the clinical findings, including
chest x-ray, pathology, etc., please consult the MMWR dispatch
[<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/m2d321.htm>, covered in
ProMED-mail SARS - Worldwide (09): clinical features - Mod.MPP].
Etiology
On Monday evening [24 Mar 2003], CDC has detected evidence for a
coronavirus-like agent in 5 patients. Samples from a patient from Thailand,
although initially negative by PCR, produced a cytopathic effect in Vero
cell culture. Supernatants from cell cultures were then tested by PCR,
including a broadly reactive primer set against the polymerase region, and
detected the presence of a virus from the coronavirus family. A more
specific primer set is now being used to test other specimens. Initially,
this 400 base-pair amplicon suggests through a virus dendrogram analysis,
[a virus] outside the 3 existing groups of coronaviruses known to infect
humans. cDNA cloning is in progress. CDC has developed an IFA in-house and
has used this to test supernatants from cell culture as well as paired
sera from additional patients. Please note that these "paired" sera were
not obtained more than 2 weeks apart and in fact, are often separated by
only several days. Nevertheless, IFA was initially negative in acute
samples and positive in a second sample from 3 patients from widely varied
geographic areas. Furthermore, CPE was detected in Vero cell culture from
autopsy materials from the Hong Kong index patient. Again, PCR was
positive. The sequence of this amplicon is pending, but it will
be interesting to note whether it is the same as from the Thai patient
noted above. In addition, BAL-cell pellets from the autopsy materials from
this Hong Kong index case also revealed coronavirus-like particles on
thin-section electron microscopy. CDC has stressed that all specimens that
they have tested are negative for human metapneumovirus; nevertheless,
these agents have been detected in material in Canada and Hong Kong by
PCR, and according to Donald Low, a human metapneumovirus was grown from
lung tissue yesterday in Frank Plummer's laboratory in Toronto. A great
deal of discussion followed this information and the potential for a
coronavirus to "jump" from animals to humans. This has been detected rarely
in the past, but there is some precedent. At least in my view, it is
premature to assume that a coronavirus is the etiologic agent. CDC is
consulting numerous experts and has shared PCR reagents with groups in
Toronto and Hong Kong.
Treatment
Very little information is available on treatment regimens and/or
outcomes. Physicians in Hong Kong have reported "success" with ribavirin,
with or without the addition of corticosteroids. As there are no controls,
these reports must be considered anecdotal at present. CDC has not yet
made recommendations on the potential use of ribavirin, the route of
administration (oral, intravenous, and/or aerosol), nor on the need for
adjunctive corticosteroids. It is worth noting that ribavirin is active
against mouse hepatitis, which is a coronavirus. Lacking other information
on pathogenesis, there is no known role for interferon, leukotriene
inhibitors, etc.

[This is an excellent overview of the situation as of the time of writing
of this letter, covering the epidemiology, clinical features, treatment,
and the status of the investigations on the etiologic agent of SARS. Of
additional note is the mention that ribavirin has been shown to be active
against mouse hepatitis, a coronavirus, suggesting that if the etiologic
agent is confirmed to be a member of the coronavirus family, this may be a
viable treatment modality. Again, it is very premature to draw
conclusions, and in turn to draw conclusions about clinical management
other than supportive measures, which have been shown to assist in
presumptive mortality reduction. - Mod.MPP]
[This is the first coherent account of experimentation designed to
establish the identity of the etiologic agent of SARS. The experimental
data described appear to be consistent with the presence of a novel
coronavirus in clinical material from a small number of SARS patients. The
molecular data are preliminary but sufficiently broad-based to be
convincing, and as a consequence the coronavirus hypothesis is more
credible than any of the competing claims. Robust data on seroconversion
are lacking, however, which are necessary to establish that the virus
propagated in cultured cells is the pathogen and not a fortuitous passenger
in the respiratory tract of SARS patients. If this agent isolated by the
CDC group proves to be a novel coronavirus, the hypothesis that SARS
occurs as a result of coinfection by two or more unrelated viruses becomes
less probable.
Nonetheless the detection of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) by PCR in
laboratories in Hong Kong and Canada, and the isolation of HMPV in cultured
cells in Canada cannot be discounted at this stage. The discovery of HMPV
in the Netherlands in 2001, a ubiquitous human virus that had escaped
detection earlier, was partially dependent on the use of a particular cell
substrate. It is possible that the Vero cell cultures employed by the CDC
group might not have picked up HMPV. The pace of research is certainly
accelerating and it is likely that very soon these matters will be resolved.
Coronaviruses infect birds and many mammals; in humans coronaviruses are
the second most frequent cause of common colds. Infection of humans and
animals by coronaviruses is common and unrestricted by geography. No
biological vectors are known. The respiratory tract, gastrointestinal
organs and neurological tissues are the most common targets of
coronaviruses. Coronavirus replication also occurs in macrophages.
Respiratory, fecal-oral and mechanical routes of transmission are common.
In general coronaviruses have restricted host ranges, but instances of
cross-species transmission have been described. The genus
_Coronavirus_ comprises three groups of viruses. Goup 1 includes canine,
feline, porcine and human viruses, Group 2 includes bovine, human, murine,
porcine and rodent viruses, and group 3 includes avian viruses. The
coronaviruses take their name from the prominent "crown" of envelope spikes
clearly visible by electron microscopy. - Mod.CP] .
