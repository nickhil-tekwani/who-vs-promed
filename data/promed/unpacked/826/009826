The 3rd case of anthrax in 2005 in the Rostov region has been discovered
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A representative of the regional veterinary laboratory, Vladimir Rudenko, has
reported that _Bacillus anthracis_ has been identified in the carcass of a pig
following analysis at the Zavetninskiy district [Rostov region] veterinary
laboratory. This result has been confirmed by the regional laboratory in
Rostov-on-Don. However, officially the disease can be confirmed only after
carrying out a 3rd analysis.
The infected animal belonged to a resident of the village of Zavetnoye. It was
found that the pig had not been vaccinated against anthrax.
The regional representative for animal disease control, Leonid Kudlaenko, has
gone to the village. The carcass of the infected pig was burnt. Quarantine
measures have been applied on the affected homestead (pasture of cattle and
export of agricultural products forbidden, animals vaccinated). All cattle in
the adjacent farm were also vaccinated.
Health surveillance of the village inhabitants was established. Quarantine
will be in place for the next 2 weeks.

[This is already the 3rd case of anthrax in the Rostov region in 2005 and the
2nd in the Zavetninskiy district -- see map at
<http://marriage.albion.su/i/rostov-on-don_map.gif>. The 1st case (also in a
pig) was discovered in the Dubovskiy district of the Rostov region in May
2005 -- see ref. below. In the Zavetninskiy district anthrax was found in
sheep. It is remarkable that these 2 districts are adjacent.
The Rostov Region is in the south of Russia at the mouth of the river Don. Its
area is 100 800 sq km; the population of the region is 2 977 500 inhabitants
(as of 2003). The capital of the region is Rostov-on-Don (pop. 1 068 300). -

[Pigs are rarely vaccinated unless they are at risk from contaminated feed or
from an ongoing outbreak, as they are relatively resistant. In poor rural
areas, pigs become infected from access to dead animals or their viscera. Some
30 years ago in the UK, there was a prolonged outbreak among sheep and pigs on
a farm because, as the sheep died, the pigs got to the carcasses before the
farmer could remove them. Pigs dying of anthrax is a marker event for a more
widespread problem. How this pig was found to be sick and submitted for
analysis is not reported. These Russian animal cases are unfortunately too
often [discovered as] the result of human cases. One can optimistically hope
that this event was in the proper order, livestock without human cases. -
