Simon Shane, an avian pathologist at Louisiana State University was out at
the emu farm in Vermilion yesterday (30 June, 1999). It is a mess. The
mortality has been 70% in young birds & yearlings but only 1/16 among the
adult breeding stock. None had been vaccinated by the owner, but the
breeders were bought as yearlings 5 years ago and might have been
vaccinated by their breeder as vaccination was common then.
Secondly, the birds take shelter from the day time heat, say from 9am to
4pm, in open sided sheds where they become densely packed together, their
heads only inches apart, with the possibility of every form of spread.
Thirdly, these sheds make excellent mosquito roosting sites after they have
fed. There is an open ditch with water circling the farm and emptying into
a broader piece of water, readily available for those species utilizing
such environments for egg laying.

_Culiseta melanure_ is not a "strict" avian vector and certainly not a
reservoir [of EEE. It is the vector of transmission of EEEV (Eastern
Equine Encephalitis Virus) between wading and song birds. This cycle
likely is the one that is in effect only along the eastern seaboard and
somewhat inland from there. _Aedes sollicitans_ is the vector from birds
to mammals and between mammals. EEE (Eastern Equine Encephalitis) in humans
occurs when there is so much virus in the mosquito population and so many
mosquitoes that spillover is inevitable. The first horse [and maybe emu
cases are usually an indication of things to come with humans, although
horses and humans are dead-end hosts, i.e., insufficient viremia to serve
as viremic sources for arthropod vectors.

[Any source of standing water makes for an excellent breeding site for a
number of different species of mosquitoes. No doubt the water around the
emus pens has contributed as a breeding site for mosquitoes.
The principle means of transmission and amplification EEE is a
mosquito-vertebrate-mosquito cycle. EEE has been isolated from 27 different
mosquitoes in the USA. The primary mosquito vector for the enzootic or
sylvatic cycle of EEE is _Culiseta melanura_. Population densities of _C.
melanura_ are highest deep in the interior of swamp habitats, were most of
the enzootic transmission of EEE occurs. During the late summer and early
fall [except 1999, mosquitoes leave the swamp breeding sites and move to
drier, upland forested habitats. Epizootics in equids, epornitics in
pheasant and quail, and human cases occur when virus infection rates are
high in birds. _Aedes vexans_ and _A. canadensis mosquitoes (which breed
in containers) are believed to be responsible for bird to mammal
transmission. The identification of vectors in epidemics is difficult
because no single species is consistently associated with the transmission
of the virus to horses and people.
Seasonal changes in _C. melanura_ biology and their relationship to EEE
virus transmission vary with geographic location and its associated
climate. The Merck Veterinary Manual 8th Ed. - Mod.TG
