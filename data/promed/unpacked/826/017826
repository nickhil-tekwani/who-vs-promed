Canker blasts cherry trees
--------------------------
[Michigan's] sour cherry crop was basically wiped out by unusual spring weather. But perhaps worse than that, freezing weather injured sweet cherry trees so badly that a bacterial disease has taken a strong hold. And it will continue to do damage for years to come.

Bacterial canker usually gets into fruit trees where there's been a wound to the bark. But this [2012] spring numerous hard freezes killed buds and caused tiny injuries. And that allowed the bacteria to take hold like never before.

"I believe this year [2012] is significantly worse than anything I've seen," says a grower. What was unusual was that trees were stuck for weeks in their bloom phase. And that gave the canker plenty of time to kill parts of the tree that produce buds for next year. "And with the amount of bacterial canker infection today [trees are] never going to produce as well as they should for the rest of the life of that orchard," he says. He expects to see trees weakened and dying from this infection for several more years.

"There's some really beautiful orchards taken out by this disease," Nikki Rothwell, Horticultural Research Center, Northwest Michigan, says. She is documenting how much damage bacterial canker is doing. And she's trying out some sprays of nutrients that may bolster tree health and help to minimize the most severe effects.

Fruit trees are a 30 year investment. For 2012, the supply of Michigan sweet cherries will be way down and the price way up.

[Bacterial canker of stone fruit is caused by 2 closely related species, _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _morsprunorum_, and _P. syringae_ pv. _syringae_. It is a serious disease of _Prunus_ crops, including sweet (_P. avium_) and sour cherry (_P. cerasus_). The disease affects stems and leaves. Symptoms may include sunken, dead areas of bark (cankers), which may girdle and kill off branches, gummy ooze, leaf necrosis, and brown spots on leaves and fruit.

Other pathovars (strains) in the _P. syringae_ group can affect a wide variety of plants, including crops such as kiwifruit, tomato, bean, maize, mango, soybean, and citrus. New diseases are emerging frequently and symptoms may include leaf specks, blights, and cankers.

The pathogens are spread by water, wind, mechanical means (including animal and human activities), and infected planting material. Disease management usually includes cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread (for example, disinfection of pruning tools), and use of clean planting material. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) may be effective, but resistant strains have emerged for some pathovars. Varieties with different levels of resistance are available for some crops, including cherries.
