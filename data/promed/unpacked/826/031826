http://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2022/september/22/animal-health-order-issued-in-saskatchewan-after-confirmed-avian-influenza-in-poultry


The Ministry of Agriculture's chief veterinary officer has issued an animal health order on 21 Sep 2022 limiting the transport and comingling of poultry after several cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza were confirmed in Saskatchewan.

The health order will be in place until 21 Oct 2022 at which time it will be reviewed. The order prohibits birds' movement to and participation in shows, auctions, and agricultural fairs, as well as any other events where birds would be brought together from multiple locations.

The goal of this animal health order is to limit the spread of this virus to new flocks. Producers are reminded to remain vigilant and contact the proper authorities should they have any concerns regarding the health of their flocks. Saskatchewan will continue to work with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the poultry industry to support a coordinated and effective response.

Avian influenza (AI) is a federally reportable disease under the Health of Animals Act. This virus, commonly known as "bird flu," affects food-producing birds including chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and quails as well as pet and wild birds. The CFIA is leading the disease response in Saskatchewan and in other provinces experiencing outbreaks in poultry.

Proactive measures, including preventing contact between poultry and wild birds, limiting visitors to barns, using barn-specific clothing and footwear, and regularly monitoring birds for signs of illness, are key to preventing avian influenza on poultry farms. Producers are also reminded that anyone keeping livestock or poultry in Saskatchewan is required to register for a premises identification (PID) number. The ability to implement rapid and efficient disease response actions is greatly increased when producers have a PID number.

All detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Canada are reported on the CFIA website (https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/avian-influenza/hpai-in-canada/status-of-ongoing-avian-influenza-response/eng/1640207916497/1640207916934). Further information on the animal health order and avian influenza in poultry is also available on the Ministry of Agriculture website (https://www.saskatchewan.ca/business/agriculture-natural-resources-and-industry/agribusiness-farmers-and-ranchers/livestock/animal-health-and-welfare/avian-influenza-in-poultry).

Although rare, AI can infect humans. Affected people tend to be those who have close contact with infected birds. While birds suspected of having AI should not be used for food to avoid potentially spreading the virus, there are no concerns with eating meat that has been properly cooked.

Two new cases [of avian influenza] have been reported in Canada, affecting commercial flocks in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

The Alberta case was confirmed on 23 Sep [2022] in the municipal district of Willow Creek, reported the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). One day later, the presence HPAI was confirmed in another commercial flock in the rural municipality of Britannia, Saskatchewan. CFIA did not disclose details about the flock types or sizes.

So far in September [2022], Alberta has had 11 commercial poultry flocks affected by HPAI, while Saskatchewan has had 4 confirmed cases.

[3] Texas (Dallas County): backyard flock
Date: Mon 26 Sep 2022

https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/2022/2022-09-26_HPAI_Dallas.pdf


The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) and the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a noncommercial mixed species backyard flock (nonpoultry) in Dallas County, Texas.

Following the observation of sick birds and bird deaths in the flock, samples were tested at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, on 24 Sep [2022]. The USDA has designated this backyard flock as nonpoultry because the birds are from a single household that does not have direct or indirect contact with poultry or poultry facilities.

The TAHC is working closely with federal animal health officials on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of disease. The plan for the control of avian influenza includes coordination of resources and response, and protocols for quarantine, testing, disposal, cleaning, disinfection, and monitoring.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the public health risk associated with these avian influenza detections in birds remains low. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [73.9 deg C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

"Protecting animal health is our top priority," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC executive director and state veterinarian. "The TAHC and USDA are committed to moving quickly and vigilantly to prevent the further spread of this virus."

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and the TAHC and USDA are working to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.

"While Texas has only seen HPAI in 2 domestic flocks, over 46 million birds across 40 states have been affected throughout this 2022 HPAI outbreak," said Dr. Schwartz. "With migratory birds traveling across Texas, it is important that poultry owners stay diligent and practice strong biosecurity to protect their flocks from avian influenza."

Anyone involved with poultry production, from the small backyard to the large commercial producer, should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Owners of commercial and backyard poultry flocks are encouraged to do the following:
- Closely observe and report a sudden increase in the number of sick birds or bird deaths to the TAHC at 1-800-550 8242 and/or USDA at 1-866-536-7593
- Practice good biosecurity with their poultry flock
- Create barriers to prevent contact with wild birds
- Consider bringing birds indoors, when possible, to prevent exposures
- Avoid visits to other premises that also have birds
- Find additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks at https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_AI-BiosecurityPoultry.pdf

Additional background:
Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin, or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

The North American outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) continues as new cases have emerged in South Dakota, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.

The presence of HPAI was confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in McPherson County, South Dakota, on 22 Sep [2022], reported the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). There were 15 000 turkeys in that flock.

The McPherson County case was confirmed 2 days after APHIS reported the presence of the virus in 2 other South Dakota turkey flocks, both of which were in Clark County.

This is McPherson County's 5th case of HPAI in commercial poultry, all of which involved turkeys. As a whole, South Dakota has had 39 cases of HPAI in commercial poultry.

[It is autumn migration of birds, from the north back to the south. Be alert for any signs of illness in your flocks.

Although the articles included in this report do not acknowledge the avian flu virus as HPAI H5N1, it is the current strain in circulation.

Biosecurity is the utmost of importance. Autumn migration southward is occurring, and just as the spring migration brought this disease in the spring, it is continuing to spread on the trip south for the migratory birds. Be sure your biosecurity is functioning at a very high level. - Mod.TG]
