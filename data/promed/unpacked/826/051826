Influenza update - 329 [based on data up to 11 Nov 2018]
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity started to increase although overall influenza activity remained low. Increased influenza detections were reported in some countries of South-East Asia and Central America. In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity returned to inter-seasonal levels. Worldwide, seasonal influenza subtype A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 114 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 29 Oct 2018 to 11 Nov 2018 (data as of 23 No 2018 04:11:01 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 116 728 specimens during that time period. 5534 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 4894 (88.4 percent) were typed as influenza A and 640 (11.6 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 2695 (85 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 475 (15 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 53 (43.1 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 70 (56.9 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2019 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on 24-26 Sep 2018 in Atlanta, USA. It was recommended that trivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Switzerland/8060/2017 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage). It was also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage).

[Influenza activity is overall low in most countries in northern hemisphere and at inter-seasonal levels in southern hemispheres. Some countries in South-East Asia and Central America have reported increased influenza detection rates. in the reporting period, influenza A predominated, and the majority of the reported subtypes were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. No novel influenza viruses were reported. - Mod.UBA]
