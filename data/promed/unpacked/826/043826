The Russian veterinary authorities have reported a further outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] in Smolenskaya oblast, affecting wild boars. According to follow-up report no. 11 sent to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on 20 May 2014, carcasses of wild boars (mummified remains) were found on the territory of the tract "Lutnoye" near the village "Znamenka" on 15 May 2014.

Laboratory studies confirmed that the wild boars were infected with ASF virus. The carcasses were incinerated. A total of 4 animals were reportedly found dead as a result of the ASF virus. The source of the outbreaks remains inconclusive.

The new outbreak is the 11th within an epizootic which reportedly started on 14 Jan 2014, initially in the Kaluzhskaya oblast. The accumulated total number of affected animals in the 11 outbreaks included in this epizootic is as follows:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 58 706 / 1165 / 970 / 57 736 / 0
Wild boar / 38 / 23 / 15 / 0

For an interactive map, showing the 11 locations, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14684.

ASF has been spreading in Russia since December 2007, when it was introduced into Chechnya from Georgia. Since then, it has become established throughout the European parts of the Russian federation from south to north, affecting wild boars and domestic swine and threatening neighbouring countries. In fact, it has been an ongoing, continuing, wide-scale epizootic since 2007 to the present day.
