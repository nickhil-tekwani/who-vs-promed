The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) is reporting (computer translated) an increase in cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) year to date in Germany.

Through 7 Sep [2020], 535 cases have been reported; which is an increase of 14 percent over the same period in 2018, a record year for TBE in Germany.

Of the cases, 89 percent (477) have been reported from Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria states in southern Germany.

Health officials suggest the increase may be due to the recommended measures to contain COVID-19, where people may spend increased amounts of their leisure time outdoors and thus have an increased risk of exposure.

In 2020, high numbers of ticks were also be observed in places that are regularly sampled. In particular, the number of adult tick stages is unusually high this year. This tick stage has a higher virus prevalence rate than the nymph stage. It can be assumed that this tick season in the known TBE risk areas also increases the probability of being bitten by an infected tick.

[TBE virus transmission remains very active in this part of southern Germany this year (2020). As noted in the 7 Sep 2020 ProMED-mail post (Tick-borne encephalitis - Germany (02): (BW, BY) 20200907.7755195), in late June this year (2020), Drs Gerhard Dobler and Lidia Chitimia-Dobler reported that according to several results of tick sampling studies from different places in Southern Germany, numbers of ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_) are again at a record level this year (2020), with a 3-fold increase of adult ticks in comparison to last year [2019]. In some TBE natural foci, even higher absolute numbers of adult ticks than nymphal ticks were found. It is not surprising that there is a subsequent increase in human TBE cases there.

The report above is a good illustration of the effects of climate change on tick populations and their acquisition of TBE virus from abundant rodents. The occurrence of human TBE virus infection this year (2020) has been increased by more frequent recreational use of natural areas by people whose activities are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading them to be active in areas where TBE-infected ticks occur.

Tick-borne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. A vaccine is available and is recommended for individuals who visit or work in forested areas where the ticks are abundant. - Mod.TY
