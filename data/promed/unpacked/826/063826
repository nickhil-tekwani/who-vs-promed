State health officials confirmed another two cases of a rare fungal
infection in Mountain Iron this week, bringing the total number of local
residents diagnosed with blastomycosis to 12. About another dozen possible
cases remain unconfirmed three weeks after state and county officials began
investigating the blastomycosis outbreak that sent seven people to the
hospital with severe pneumonia. Those seven people, who live in the town's
South Grove neighborhood, have been treated and released.
People became infected after inhaling spores from a fungus -- _Blastomyces
dermititidis_ -- commonly found in wood and soil. Mid-July construction is
suspected to have unearthed the fungus. An average blastomycosis infection
requires 45 days to develop.
A team of epidemiologists and public health employees recently combed
through the Iron Range town, testing construction sites and river beds and
drawing blood samples from residents, hoping to pinpoint the source of the
infection. Results from soil and blood tests are not expected for 30 to 60
days.
Outbreaks of the fungal infection are rare. Bigfork, Minn., was home to the
state's last similarly sized outbreak in 1972. Humans and animals can
become ill after breathing in the spores, but the infection is not
contagious. It cannot be passed from one human to another, nor from a pet
to its owner.
