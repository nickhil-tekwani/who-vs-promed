Toronto: hepatitis prompts warning at Scarborough Hospital
----------------------------------------------------------
Toronto public health authorities have warned 400 Scarborough Hospital
dialysis patients that they may be at risk of hepatitis infection and urged
them not to share their toothbrushes or razors with family members and to
use condoms during sex. The rare warning, which is upsetting many immigrant
families already dealing with severe health problems, follows the discovery
of a strange, small cluster of hepatitis-positive dialysis patients
identified this month [May 2006].
"There are 8 patients we are investigating with new infections," said Dr
Michael Finkelstein, an associate medical officer with Toronto Public
Health. "Certainly, I would classify that as a significant number. In other
hemodialysis units, you can see, occasionally, a patient becoming positive,
but even then they are not that common." It's not clear how dialysis
patients who use the facilities run by Scarborough Hospital would have
become infected with the hepatitis B or C [virus infection] that's showed
up in recent routine tests. "We don't know how this happened," said Sherian
Mondesir, a spokeswoman for Scarborough Hospital. She added that "we can't
say it's necessarily linked to our practices."
Like other dialysis centers, Scarborough Hospital uses clean, modern
equipment. No source of possible contamination has been identified, but
officials are now taking many precautions, such as testing staff members
and testing and retesting all of the dialysis patients. While hepatitis
often lies dormant or is treatable, it can also lead to disabling liver
failure, and even death. That's why the public health department has
circulated letters in English, Chinese, Tamil and Tagalog (or Filipino)
warning patients they should guard against any further spread of hepatitis,
which may have been disseminated during dialysis treatments.
Experts say it's unlikely that the cluster will grow far beyond the 8
cases, but the news has caused panic in some families. Infection is a
constant worry for all hemodialysis patients, who spend up to 5 hours a
day, 3 times a week, having their blood pumped through plastic tubes and
cleaning machines, in rooms full of other people with kidney disease
getting the same treatment.
The hepatitis virus [hepatitis B and C viruses] is carried in the blood,
but can survive outside the body for days. It can pass between hosts
through sex, intravenous needles, and contaminated hospitals. That's why
great care is taken to make sure all facilities and equipment are kept free
of even small traces of blood. Yet traces can always remain, and it's
difficult to pinpoint causes of infection. Ms Mondesir said the hospital
continues "to follow our infection control and safety measures," but staff
are now being more vigilant. She said she is confident that Scarborough
Hospital's dialysis equipment is clean, and this view is supported by Dr
Finkelstein. "There is no evidence that the equipment itself is an issue,"
he said, but he added there could be any number of possible other sources
of infection. "There is blood in the environment," he said, adding that
small amounts of blood can linger on machines, people's hands, medical
instruments, tubing, and clamps.
Because it is uncommon to see this cluster of new infections, Dr
Finkelstein drafted the letter that was circulated to dialysis patients
this week. He said the initial case came to the attention of public health
authorities on "the very last working day of April [2006]," and that
authorities worked as quickly as possible to investigate further and warn
affected patients.
After officials determined the 1st individual was a dialysis patient at
Scarborough Hospital, they probed more deeply. The hospital had just
gathered its annual blood samples, so public health authorities were poised
to take a closer look, and when they did, they discovered the cluster. No
one yet knows when or how the infections occurred, or when new infections
might show up. "It can take up to 6 months for some of these infections to
be detectable in a lab sample," Dr Finkelstein said.

Hepatitis outbreak in Scarborough Hospital
------------------------------------------
Eight confirmed cases of hepatitis B and C in a Scarborough hospital have
officials trying to piece together how the virus was spread. Those 8 are
among 400 people that receive dialysis treatments at the Scarborough Hospital.
Hospital officials say the outbreak may have started from a staff member.
All employees are being tested, as are the other 392 dialysis patients.
Hepatitis B and C are viral diseases of the liver that spread through
contact with blood or body fluids.

Hepatitis outbreak at Scarborough Hospital
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis at the Scarborough Hospital has officials trying
to find out how the virus is being spread. Eight confirmed cases of
hepatitis have been found among almost 400 patients who receive dialysis
treatments at the Scarborough Hospital and a satellite clinic on Corporate
Drive.
A letter from Toronto Public Health says officials are "investigating a
small number of patients in the hemodialysis program who have been
diagnosed with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C." The letter continues to say
that the hospital detected the infections and that they "occurred in the
past year."
According to Dr Gordon Nagai, who works in the Scarborough Regional
Dialysis Program, the results are startling. "I think it's important to
know this is the 1st time we've ever found anything in 10 years," Nagai
said. "But clearly, it's a very unusual circumstance, so we're quite
concerned why something has changed." Nagai told CTV's Monica Matys that
they are searching for the source of the infection. A staff member could be
the source, and the entire staff is being tested. However, the infection
could be coming from another place. "It's definitely not a problem with the
machines; that's been identified," Nagai said. Every dialysis patient is
being tested for both hepatitis B and C. As a further precaution, they are
also testing for HIV during regular dialysis sessions.
"All the measures seem to indicate that we're looking after the problem
quite adequately," Nagai said. "This has been reviewed by internal people
and been reviewed by public health. So at the moment, we're quite confident
that everything is being done to contain the problem." Hepatitis B and C
are viral diseases of the liver spread through contact with blood or body
fluids. The disease can cause permanent liver damage.

[Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are bloodborne infections caused by unrelated
viruses. Co-infections are not uncommon. However, the presence and apparent
transmission of both viruses within a hospital blood dialysis unit is a
rare occurrence and represents either a breakdown in cross-infection
control or transmission from a common source or a hepatitis B and C carrier
(or carriers) within the unit. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
