African horse sickness at high altitude
---------------------------------------
We have an interesting outbreak of serotype 2 African horse sickness in a
province where the weather favours the vectors and they report cases each
year. The present outbreak is in the Drakensberg mountains at an altitude
of above 1500 metres. Many owners do not vaccinate and the disease has not
been reported there for over 50 years. They have lost more than 50 animals
on 10 farms and preliminary entomological data indicate that _Culicoides
bolitinos_, a cattle dung breeder, is involved -- not the more usual
_C.imicola_. Farmers are reportedly dragging the carcasses up into the
mountains and leaving them to the vultures.

[African horse sickness (AHS) -- a List A disease -- is a viral disease,
caused by a viscerotropic virus, family Reoviridae, genus Orbivirus. Nine
different serotypes of the virus have been described. The disease is not
directly contagious, usually transmitted by a biological vector, namely
_Culicoides spp_, mostly by _C.imicola_, a midge found throughout the
eastern hemisphere, between latitudes 40 north and south. It is the
commonest species in South Africa, but in general prefers warmer, lower
altitudes. This species breeds in saturated or wet soils containing a high
level of organic material. _C.imicola_ is also the main vector of another
List A, orbivirus disease - bluetongue (BT) of ruminants (predominantly sheep).
_C. bolitinos_ is a member of the Imicola complex of seven species in South
Africa. In 1998 it was implicated in an outbreak of AHS in the eastern Free
State, South Africa, and also, in the laboratory, was shown to be
susceptible to infection with AHS and BT viruses. This species is also
widespread in the Afro-tropical regions and, like _C. imicola_, is known to
feed on both cattle and horses. However, the breeding habitat of _C.
bolitinos_ is cattle, buffalo and wildebeest dung which provides a stable
and constant breeding microclimate for larval development. Hence, _C.
bolitinos_ is more abundant than _C. imicola_ in areas with lower average
temperatures, including cooler, mountainous regions. Experimentally, _C.
bolitinos_ was found to be a potential vector of AHS virus serotypes 3, 5,
and 8. [See GJ Venter, SD Graham, C Hamblin. In: Medical & Veterinary
Entomology, Vol 14, 3 , 245 - Sep 2000: African horse sickness
epidemiology: vector competence of South African Culicoides species for
virus serotypes 3, 5 and 8.
<http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2915.2000.00245.x/full/>].
The authors conclude: "Previously, _C. imicola_ was considered to be the
only field vector of AHSV in Africa. Identifying _C. bolitinos_ as a
potential vector for AHSV is an important finding, which if proven will
have a significant impact on our understanding of the epidemiology of AHS".
The current observations, for which we are very grateful to Dr Gerdes, are
indeed significant in respect of AHS epidemiology. It is probable that _C.
bolitino_ is also involved in the transmission of a third orbovirus, namely
equine encephalosis (see ref 19990428.0708). - Mod. AS].
