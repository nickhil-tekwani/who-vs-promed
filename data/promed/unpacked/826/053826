The death of a 6-month-old child from Sawai Madhopur and 4 other
persons found suffering from diphtheria in the city's JK Lone Hospital
last fortnight [2 weeks] has raised serious questions on the efficacy
of immunisation programmes in the state.

A combination vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough)
and tetanus is given to every child under various immunisation
programmes. "Few children, who were in post-diphtheria stage, were
admitted in the JK Lone Hospital but no case has been reported as
diphtheria is reported by eye and throat unit at SMS Hospital. At JK
Lone Hospital, few children came in post-diphtheria stage," said Dr SD
Gupta, superintendent, JK Lone Hospital.

Authorities now say they will fix the responsibility on the health
workers in the areas from where such cases and patients have been
reported. "We will inquire into who is responsible for these cases,"
said Dr ML Jain, assistant director, reproductive and child health.

The health department data regarding immunisation programmes in the
state shows the lethargy in dealing with the disease. In the 1st 2
months of year 2011-12, only 10 per cent target of immunisation has
been achieved which is around 5 per cent lower than last year. In
2010-11, the health department could achieve only 83.18 per cent of
its annual target, which shows a glaring gap between the need and
action taken. Districts that are falling behind in achieving targets
under immunisation programmes are Jaipur zone II (7.13 per cent),
Jodhpur (8.03 per cent), Sriganganagar (8.75 per cent), Nagaur (8.87
per cent), Hanumangarh (9.725 per cent), Sikar (9.89 per cent) and
Jaipur zone.

In India, under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), vaccines
for 6 vaccine-preventable diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria,
pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, poliomyelitis, and measles) are
available for free of cost to all. UIP was launched in 1985 to attain
the target to immunize all eligible children by 1990. However, the UIP
has chronically failed to meet its goals
(http://www.isical.ac.in/~wemp/Papers/PaperNilanjanPatra.pdf).

High absenteeism rates among health care providers and unreliable
supplies of vaccines contribute to low vaccination rates
(http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/improving-immunization-rates-through-regular-camps-and-incentives-india).
A lack of understanding of the benefits of vaccination and even a
suspicion of government health services are thought to be contributing
factors.

Sawai Madhopur is a city in the Sawai Madhopur District in the Indian
state of Rajasthan; As of the 2001 India census, Sawai Madhopur had a
population of 97 491
