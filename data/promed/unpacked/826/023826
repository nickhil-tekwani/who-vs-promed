A 35-year-old woman of Bharatpur Sub-Metropolitan City-22 in Chitwan district died of scrub typhus during treatment at the Narayani Community Hospital in Chitwan district during the last week of the Nepali month Kartik. [Kartik is the 7th month in Nepalese calendar, corresponding to 18 Oct-16 Nov.] With this, the death toll due to this bacterial disease in Kartik has reached 4.

Chitwan district alone has witnessed 401 cases of scrub typhus in the last 7 months. A total of 15 persons have been reported dead due to the infection that is spread through the bite of infected mites, as well as fleas and mice, said Information Officer Narahari Sharma. [Scrub typhus is transmitted to humans and rodents by the bite of chiggers, i.e., the larval stage of trombiculid mites.]
