Cryptosporidia found in drinking water
--------------------------------------
100 more are ill in North Battleford, Sask., after the parasite
[_Cryptosporidium parvum_] was found in a water-treatment plant. A
contaminated water supply may be responsible for the deaths of 3 people and
the illness of more than 100 others in the west-central Saskatchewan town
of North Battleford.
2 of the suspicious deaths, one in early April [2001] and one in early May
[2001], were discovered during the continuing epidemiological review of
admissions and deaths at Battlefords Union Hospital," the health authority
said in a statement. "In the most recent case, cryptosporidia was found in
the patient's stool sample."
All 3 patients had weakened immune systems. The microscopic parasite, which
is common in lakes, rivers and streams, is believed to have entered the
water supply through a faulty filtration system at municipal
water-treatment plant.
Dr. Gerhard Benade, medical officer of health for the Battlefords Health
District, said 26 cases of cryptosporidiosis have been confirmed through
lab testing, and more than 100 cases of suspicious symptoms of
gastroenteritis have been reported.

[Cryptosporidia, which are ubiquitous in nature, are a common problem in
drinking water. The source is either insufficiently treated surface water
or contamination of drinking water with surface water. In this report, the
problem seems to have been caused by a faulty filtration system. - Mod.EP]
