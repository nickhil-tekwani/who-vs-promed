The 31 August posting (cited above) about eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)
virus infections in horses and emus requires some comments.
I do not know the standards by which the state of Texas is making
"confirmed" diagnoses but if they are based on a single serum sample, they
should be considered "presumptive" and certainly not "confirmed". Putting
"presumptive" cases in a category of "confirmed" makes circumstances look
worse (or better) than they are.
The "confirmed" horse case from Harris County needs review. The fact that
the animal had been vaccinated every year for the past 14, but not this
year, doesn't mean much at all. Although an annual booster is required,
there is considerable chance that the horse had antibody without this
year's booster dose.
If this horse had been vaccinated at a very young age, it might not have
produced an antibody response, might subsequently have been susceptible to
the wild type virus, and may therefore have been a real case of EEE. I
doubt the horse was monitored yearly for response to the vaccinations. This
stuff is not as straight-forward as it might seem. See: Wilson, J.H.,
E.P.J. Gibbs, C.H. Calisher, C.D. Buergelt, and C. Schneider. Investigation
of vaccine-induced tolerance to eastern equine encephalitis virus in foals.
Amer. Assoc. Eq. Practitioners. 41:178-180, 1995.
I have no qualms about accepting the attending veterinarian's diagnosis of
EEE but a clinical impression is not the same as a confirmed diagnosis.
That a single serum sample showed titers (probably
hemagglutination-inhibition) of 320 to EEE virus and 640 to western equine
encephalitis (WEE) virus sounds to me more like a response to a bivalent
vaccine than to infection with EEE virus. EEE and WEE viruses are related
but distantly so and titers might or might not be similar to the two
viruses after infection with one of them. There is also the matter of
Highlands J virus, which is in the same antigenic complex as WEE virus and
cross-reacts with that virus; it occurs in east Texas.
To count this horse as "a confirmed EEE case" of EEE virus infection would
be a mistake.
Finally, the report indicated that USDA stands ready to help Texas
veterinarians in these circumstances. USDA does what it can but it is not
often that they obtain paired (acute- and convalescent-phase) serum samples
from sick horses. Under such circumstances, these single samples can yield
only presumptive diagnoses, no matter how they are reported. Virus
isolation or positive PCR, on the other hand, answers the question.
Given all the erroneous comments and revisionist misdiagnoses being made
with regard to equid encephalitis infections, it seems time for USDA and
state veterinarians to reestablish the ground rules that had been set and
accepted for decades. I'd be more than happy to teach the course, which
would not take more than about 30 minutes.
