[1] Cholera - Tanzania
Date: Tue 8 Dec 2015

Tanzania's cholera outbreak, which began in late August 2015, has progressively spread to more than half of the country's regions, affecting thousands of people. Months into the response, local capacities and resources are overstretched; prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to classify the outbreak an organization-wide priority, enabling it to deploy additional resources to contain the disease's spread.

As of 8 Dec 2015, 10 412 cases and 159 deaths have been reported in 21 of the country's 30 regions. Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital with a population of 4.4 million, accounts for 44 percent of all people who have contracted cholera. The cumulative number of people with cholera has doubled between the end of October 2015 and end of November 2015. Zanzibar has reported 572 cases and 6 deaths.

"The current outbreak is unusual because of its vast geographical spread within a short period of time," says WHO Representative to Tanzania, Dr Rufaro Chatora. "The beginning of the rainy season may make it harder to contain the outbreak. We are very concerned about the health and well-being of the people affected, especially women and girls, as they are more exposed due to household chores involving water collection, handling and storage practices at home."

The worsening cholera threat is worrisome, with forecasts for the El Nino weather pattern becoming the strongest on record. El Nino is usually associated with extreme weather events such as floods and drought. In 1997 similar meteorological El Nino conditions were associated with the biggest cholera epidemic, with more than 40 000 people contracting the disease.

Ending the outbreak and preventing its spread beyond Tanzania's borders is a high priority for WHO. To do this, a National Cholera Task Force (CTF) has been established comprising the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW), United Nations partners and health partners. The CTF has been established to plan, coordinate and help national authorities implement the response.

[2] Cholera - Tanzania (Mwanza Region)
Date: Mon 7 Dec 2015

19 patients out of 613 who were suffering from cholera in Mwanza region and who were admitted have died of the epidemic that has engulfed the region in the last 3 months, the region administration has said. Speaking during the weekend in Mwanza City, Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC) Mr Magesa Mulongo said the deaths are a blow to the region. He directed all city workers, ward executive officers and health officers to keep the city environment in a sanitary condition in order to contain the epidemic.

"So far the number of people suffering from cholera is 613, of which 263 are from Ukerewe, 180 from Ilemela, Sengerema (135), Nyamagana (29) and Magu (6)," he said.

"The level of how we lost our brothers and sisters has shocked us. The 19 people who died of the disease are simply too many. Let us put more efforts in the fight against cholera because we had the president's instructions which required us to improve sanitation in our region when commemorating Uhuru day in order to control the disease."

[3] Cholera - Uganda (Kampala)
Date: Sun 6 Dec 2015

http://allafrica.com/stories/201512071388.html

6 people have died of cholera, while 21 others are being treated at the isolation ward set-up at Mulago hospital. According to Ministry of health permanent secretary Dr Asuman Lukwago, since November 2015, when the isolation unit was set up, 6 deaths have so far been recorded.

The infectious disease caused by consumption of contaminated food or water has spread to 5 other districts across the country, with over 50 cases diagnosed since the 1st outbreak was reported in October 2015 in Busia. The health ministry recently announced that it had contained the outbreak in Busia, but it seems the El Nino rains have hindered their progress, causing flooding and worsening the hygiene situation.

The reported cases are from Kampala slums of Katanga, Kyebando while others were referrals from other districts. Lukwago says more cases have been confirmed in Hoima, Kasese, Busia and Wakiso.

[4] Cholera - Uganda (Mbale District)

Mbale District leaders have ordered the closure of all eating places that do not meet minimum health standards following a cholera outbreak that has left 12 people admitted to treatment centres. The outbreak comes at a time when the district is experiencing heavy El Nino rain, coupled with poor drainage.

The acting district health officer, Dr Jonathan Wangisi, told Daily Monitor on 8 Dec 2015 that about 12 people have been admitted and the district health technical team has already issued warnings to people to stop buying food and drinks sold on the streets in Mbale suburbs, in order to curb further spread of the disease.

The cholera epidemic victims have been admitted to Namanyonyi Health Centre 111 and Namatala Health Centre 1V in critical condition.

"It's true there has been an outbreak of cholera in the district. 12 suspected cases have been detected in Namanyonyi Sub-county and Industrial Division in Mbale Municipality. Of the 6 samples that were taken, 1 has been confirmed positive," Dr Wangisi said.

[5] Cholera - Uganda (Wakiso District)

http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/676636-seven-killed-as-cholera-breaks-out-in-wakiso.html

7 people have been confirmed dead and 20 others hospitalized as cholera breaks out in Wakiso district. Dr. Robert Kagwire, the district acting health officer, said the epidemic struck parts of Kitufu and Zinga Islands in Bussi Sub county, Masulita town and Nabweru in Nansana Municipality.

He said the dead included a 1-year-old boy and his mother. Kagwire said they died 2 weeks ago and that the 1st person to die was in Masulita Sub-county and others were on the Islands.

During a tour, Kagwire said they also heard that 67 people had reported to different health centres in the areas with signs and symptoms associated with cholera. "2 weeks ago we got complaints from Nabweru where a child was rushed to the Nabweru health centre IV. She was treated and she is okay. So we have managed to treat a number of them although 20 are still admitted at different health centres on the Islands," he said.

He said they were monitoring the situation closely to prevent the disease from spreading.

[7] Cholera - Myanmar (Shan State)
Date: Wed 25 Nov 2015
Source: Myanmar Times [edited]
http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/17810-more-suspected-cholera-outbreaks-reported.html

Local politicians and relief workers in central Shan State have reported 2 suspected outbreaks of cholera among villagers displaced by the fighting that is focused on 2 townships, Kye-thi and Mine Shu/Mong Shu. Shan Youth Group activist Ko Sai Oo said he was trying to organise medical tests with the help of the United Nations to verify whether the disease was cholera.

Pierre Peron, spokesperson in Myanmar for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said the UN had received reports of a number of cases of diarrhea at 1 of the temporary sites hosting displaced civilians. "At this stage, the available information does not indicate that these are cholera cases. However, the Ministry of Health has been informed of the situation and is currently investigating to verify the information," he said.

He said the UN and its humanitarian partners were working with relevant authorities and local organisations to assist with efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance, including health and sanitation. So far UN agencies and international NGOs had already provided 484 hygiene kits, 5000 water purification tablets, 471 family kits, and 493 shelter kits though local partners, the OCHA spokesperson said. "The UN is ready to offer further support once security conditions allow," he added.

[The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of approximate volume and fluid losses in those with diarrhea can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia [a decreased volume of circulating blood] should initially be rehydrated intravenously with normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
