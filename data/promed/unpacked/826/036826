Multistate Outbreak of Multidrug-Resistant Campylobacter Infections Linked to Contact with Pet Store Puppies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter_ infections. Campylobacter bacteria isolated from clinical samples from people sickened in this outbreak are resistant to commonly recommended, 1st-line antimicrobials. This means it may be difficult to treat these infections with the antibiotics usually prescribed for campylobacteriosis.

Since the last update on 30 Oct 2017, 30 more ill people have been reported from 11 states. The most recent illness began on 23 Oct 2017.

As of 12 Dec 2017, 97 people with laboratory-confirmed infections or symptoms consistent with campylobacteriosis have been linked to this outbreak. Illnesses have been reported from 17 states.

Total / 97

Up to 22 (24 percent) of 91 ill people with available information have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 17 Jun 2016 to 23 Oct 2017.

Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that contact with puppies sold through Petland stores is a likely source of this outbreak.

Of 89 people interviewed, 87 (98 percent) reported contact with a puppy in the week before illness started. Of 88 people interviewed, 79 (90 percent) reported they had contact with a puppy from a Petland store, or had contact with a person who became sick after contact with a puppy from a Petland store. Up to 21 ill people worked at a Petland store.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the Campylobacter isolates from sick people in this outbreak and isolates from pet store puppies were closely related genetically, providing additional evidence that people got sick from contact with pet store puppies. Antimicrobial resistance may be associated with increased risk of hospitalization, development of a bloodstream infection, or treatment failure in patients.

Using WGS, we identified multiple antimicrobial resistance genes and mutations in most isolates from 35 ill people and 9 puppies in this outbreak. This finding matches results from standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods used by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System laboratory on isolates from 5 ill people and 7 puppies in this outbreak.

The 12 isolates tested by standard methods were resistant to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, telithromycin, and tetracycline. In addition, 10 were resistant to gentamicin, and 2 were resistant to florfenicol.

Follow these steps to prevent illness when handling puppies or dogs:
- Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching puppies or picking up their poop.
- Work with your veterinarian to keep your animals healthy and prevent diseases.

This investigation is ongoing and we will provide updates as more information becomes available.

[I apologize for not picking up last month's CDC update of this interesting outbreak sooner. These isolates are multidrug resistant but fortunately campylobacteriosis is usually a self-limited infection.

Pet-associated campylobacteriosis is underappreciated in human _Campylobacter_ infection. The following is a recent review of the topic:

Campagnolo ER, Philipp LM, Long JM, and Hanshaw NL: Pet-associated campylobacteriosis: A persisting public health concern. Zoonoses Public Health. 2017 Aug 21. doi: 10.1111/zph.12389. [Epub ahead of print]

Abstract
--------
Campylobacter is regarded as a leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis in the USA. We report on a case of laboratory-confirmed _Campylobacter jejuni_ infection in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania among members of a household living with a laboratory-confirmed but non-speciated _Campylobacter_-infected puppy. We describe an outbreak of likely dog-associated campylobacteriosis, the risk factors, potential routes of exposure, and the clinical features in the exposed family members, which began shortly after exposure to the recently purchased dog. We also provide public health recommendations to prevent _Campylobacter_ infections in veterinary care providers, pet owners, and those planning to adopt pets in the future. Finally, this report underscores the importance of the One Health approach when public health responders, human and animal healthcare providers and clinical diagnostic laboratories are tasked with developing effective strategies when investigating, detecting, and responding to zoonoses (diseases shared between animals and humans).

[Pets may also be affected by _Camplybacter spp_.There are many causes of enteritis. However, camplyobacteriosis, a common problem for human being will also affect our pets. In pets it is most commonly found in kennels, crowded, stressful conditions or unsanitary situations.

The most common presentation of campylobacteriosis is enteritis, which means an inflammation of the small intestine, and usually results in diarrhea. Along with diarrhea, your pet may experience abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, black tarry feces (melena - blood in stool), and weight loss.

Pets with enteritis, regardless of the cause, are frequently dehydrated and may need to be given intravenous fluid therapy. Depending on the severity, your pet may be hospitalized in order to control the diarrhea, weakness and dehydration, all of which may be quite debilitating to your pet. If the pet is not displaying sever signs, it may be possible to care for your pet at home under the veterinarians guidance. It is very important that you carefully follow the treatment instructions from your veterinarian so that the chances of the diarrhea recurring are slim to none.

If your pet develops diarrhea, it is best to contact your veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
