Ohio and national health officials are investigating a potential outbreak
of [infections caused by _E. coli_ bacteria that have infected at least 20
people in Hamilton, Butler and Clermont counties. A team from the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to arrive in the
area today to help local officials trace the source of the bacteria, which
the Ohio Department of Health has identified as _E. coli_ O157:H7.
Investigators have not yet pinpointed any source of the _E. coli_. The
state health department is running sophisticated lab tests to determine if
the cases are related and come from a single source, [according to Ms.
Beathard of the Ohio State Health Department.
"The CDC team will assist with the food survey of the victims, to find out
everything they've eaten and where they ate it," Ms. Beathard said. "They
will try to determine a common link."
Hamilton County health officials have not found anything in common among
the eight cases reported there, said nursing director Mary Sacco. The
number is not unusually high, she said - the county had eight cases last year.
Six people in Clermont County have been reported infected with _E. coli_.
The six Butler Countians stricken since mid-June range in age from 4 to 82
and live in several townships, said county health department director
Patricia Burg.
