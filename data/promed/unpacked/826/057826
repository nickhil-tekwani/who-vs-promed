I have prepared some responses to the questions posed [by Moderator CHC
after the last posting of mine on rabbit haemorrhagic disease.
Percent of rabbits killed by the virus? There is no Australia wide figure
on this. Suffice it to say that the disease was very effective in
Australia's semi-arid areas at times when the necessary risk factors for
outbreaks were present. Over 95% of rabbits died over extensive areas of
the continent. This was population density independent.
However, in the wetter areas the mortality rate has varied from 0-95%. In
some outbreak areas, natural increase in rabbit numbers has outstripped the
decline due to RHD mortality. At many release sites nothing noticeable
happened for many months, followed by a substantial RHD outbreak when
sufficient risk factors were present.
Is disease still spreading? I am not aware of any evidence that suggests
that RHD has not already spread to all areas with wild rabbits. Given that
the virus was spread by flying insects and by hundreds of deliberate
releases there is little likelihood of any substantial uninfected
populations remaining. Parts of Tasmania may be an exception as
establishing outbreaks there was particularly difficult. Recurrences of
outbreaks in areas are commonplace.
Is resistance to the virus increasing? There are no reports, from field or
laboratory, in Europe or Australia to suggest any change in virulence or
host resistance.
Human infections? There is no scientific evidence to suggest that humans
suffer any adverse consequences resulting from viral exposure.

[We are extremely grateful to Dr. Lugton for his efforts at bringing us
up-to-date with respect to these details and this situation. We also
received messages from others. One provided a web site
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol4no1/smith.htm>
for an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases (CDC) entitled "Calicivirus
Emergence from Ocean Reservoirs: Zoonotic and Interspecies Movements" by
AW Smith, DE Skilling, N Cherry, JH Mead, and DO Matson. In spite of
unfounded predictions to the contrary, there is no evidence that RHD virus
causes human illness.
I would hate to be the one moderating "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease -
Australia: Conclusions (21)" so, although the final curtain has not nearly
come down on this story, at least for now, this string is cut. - Mod.CHC
