Source: Emergence of Parvovirus in Dogs: A Question of Origin
by Ashleigh Oulton - Registered Dog Breeder [edited

Parvovirus produces lethargy, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain and bloody
diarrhoea. The animal suffers severe dehydration and shock. Dogs who survive
by early veterinary intervention have life-long immunity. Young puppies and
immuno - compromised adults are most at risk from this disease. Maternal
antibodies do protect pups for a period of time.
There are two distinct forms of this virus. One involves the myocardium
(heart muscle) with no previous signs other than occasional diarrhoea a few
weeks previous; the second and more prevalent form is the intestinal
involvement which produces the clinical symptoms described above. Before the
emergence of Parvovirus, dogs in Australia were vaccinated against Canine
Distemper and Canine Hepatitis only.
The first reports of this new disease came from metropolitan Brisbane. W.R.
Kelly from the University of Queensland published his letter in the
Australian Veterinary Journal, Vol. 54, December 1978. A number have been
young animals (up to 6 weeks of age) sold by an animal refuge after a short
stay in the refuge during which time the animals received treatment for
round worms and vaccination against distemper. Affected pups were returned
by the new owners within a week because of persistent diarrhoea and
illthrift. Many have had to be destroyed; others have been saved with
supportive therapy.
The next article to be published in Australia was from Townsville by R.H.
Johnson, Dept. of Tropical Veterinary Science, James Cook University and
P.B. Spradbrow of the University of Queensland dated 13th of December 1978,
in the Australian Veterinary Journal, Vol. 55, March 1979. They state, We
wish to report the isolation of parvoviruses (CPV) from these dogs and the
demonstrations that the parvovirus is serologically indistinguishable from
the parvovirus causing feline panleucopaenia (FPV).
Amazingly, this new disease materialised world-wide almost simultaneously
between October 1978 and March 1979: the United States of America (Appel et
al 1978), Canada (Thompson and Gagnon, 1978), United Kingdom (Jefferies and
Blakemore 1979), Scotland (Dr. H. Thompson et al 1979) and New Zealand
(Gumbrell 1979).
Theories regarding the possible origin of this new disease quickly became of
major concern among veterinary scientists as this disease could not have
spread naturally in only 5 months. For two distinct, frequently fatal, new
pandemic disease syndromes to emerge in dogs  in any species for the matter
 suddenly and seemingly in multiple foci around the world is a remarkable
phenomenon. Some may wish to argue that both diseases have existed
unrecognised prior to 1978. Most opinion, including our own, holds that both
are truly new diseases. .... If new, what are the possible origins of the
virus? Administration of live, attenuated FPV vaccine to dogs in error or
contamination of canine viral vaccines with FPV, especially if the
particular vaccine was marketed internationally, are possibilities. (C.
Lenghaus, M.J. Studdert, Aust. Veterinary Journal, Vol. 56, 1980).
A possible source might be a veterinary biological product, especially one
produced in cell culture in which a contamination parvovirus might pass
unnoticed and in which biologically modified mutants might be selected.
(R.H. Johnson, Aust. Veterinary Journal, Vol. 55, 1979).
As FPV disease in cats has been known for so long while CPT disease is
apparently a new entity in dogs, it seems only remotely possible that CPV
has arisen by spontaneous mutation of wild-type FPV in the field. The
possibility of mutation of a vaccine strain of FPV should be seriously
considered. It is suggested that this may have occurred in the laboratory,
with subsequent incorporation of such mutants into biological products,
especially live virus vaccines, or mutation may have occurred following
accidental or deliberate vaccination of dogs with live FPV. In either case,
very few primary foci of CPV infection would have been required to account
for the subsequent rapid spread world-wide. (C. Leghaus, Aust. Veterinary
Journal, Vol. 56, 1980). Due to the widespread concern that this new disease
may involve live virus vaccines, debate regarding future vaccines for this
disease ensued, particularly on the subjects of safety and necessity.
If CPV has originated by mutation from FPV, then there is nothing to
suggest that FPV would not mutate further and expand its host range to
include other domestic animals and even man. Clearly the use of live FPV
vaccines is in need of review. The general use of an inactivated CPV
vaccine has been questioned; any development of a live CPV vaccine should be
viewed with some concern as this could provide even more selection pressures
for still further mutation of this virus. (C. Lenghaus, Australian
Veterinary Journal, Vol. 56, 1980) [Authors note; A live virus Parvo
vaccine is now in routine use world-wide, including Australia.
Later findings, (G.E. Gooding and W.F. Robinson, 1982) suggested that
reproductive efficiency is affected by parvovirus infection. This finding
must bring into question what possible effects on our bitches the live
vaccine may be having today. Many breeders bitches have experienced
widespread inability to conceive and reduced litter numbers in recent years.
An example of this ability of live vacine to produce the same effects as the
disease is the measles vaccine and the condition SSPE. (Paediatrics, Vo. 59,
No. 4, April 1977)
Also well documented are the possible reasons why parvovirus is so
age-specific, occurring only in dogs under 24 months of age and most severe
in pups under 3 months of age. A study undertaken in Queensland concluded
that environmental causes, such as low grade bowel damage associated with
hookworms, giardia, weaning or even vaccination is associated with
susceptibility to infection and the severity of damage. (J.R. Smith, T.S.
Farmer, R.H. Johnson, 1980)
