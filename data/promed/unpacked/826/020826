Due to the salmonella outbreak, more recalls of peanut products are
expected this week, USA Today reported. There have already been more
than 800 recalls; this is one of the largest recalls ever. Last week
[26-30 Jan 2009], American health officials discovered that Peanut
Corp. of America, the likely source of the salmonella tainted peanut
products, went ahead and shipped peanut butter products despite
getting test results showing salmonella was present, Bloomberg News
reported last week.

The company's actions "can only be described as reprehensible and
criminal," Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who oversees Food and Drug
Administration funding, told USA Today. "Not only did this company
knowingly sell tainted products, it shopped for a laboratory that
would provide the acceptable results they were seeking. This behavior
represents the worst of our current food safety regulatory system."

Upon receivng the test results showing evidence of salmonella, Peanut
Corp. contacted other labs to conduct new tests, Michael Rogers,
director of the division of field investigations of the FDA, told
Bloomberg News. Rogers said "there were no steps taken" by the
company to reduce the presence of salmonella.

The salmonella outbreak has caused numerous product recalls including
recalls of products containing peanut butter from companies like
Kellogg, Little Debbie, Starbucks and others. USA Today reported that
Robert Brackett, senior vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers
Association, said he fears that the recall will affect demand in a
big way as consumers get sick of checking recall lists and simply
stop buying peanuts.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is expanding its recall of
products affected by the salmonella outbreak in a peanut factory in
the USA. At least 81 products sold in Canada contain ingredients from
that plant, and 39 of the products are made in Canada.

No illnesses have been reported in this country, but more than 500
people in the USA have fallen ill and 8 deaths are thought to be
linked to the salmonella outbreak.

Products recalled in Canada include various snack bars, mixed nuts
and cookies, bridge mix, kettle corn from a variety of companies
including Atkins, Arico, Clif Bar & Company and Nature's Path, with a
variety of UPC codes and best-before dates.

Popcorn using the same peanut butter that caused a salmonella
outbreak in the USA was distributed in Japan in 2008, it has been
learned. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said on Saturday
[31 Jan 2009] that it has ordered Suzusho, the importer of the
popcorn in Tokyo's Shinjuku-ku, to suspend sales of the product and
to conduct a voluntary recall. It's not known if the product contains
bacteria, but no health damage has been reported so far.

According to the ministry, Suzusho imported a total of 437 cases
(about 545 kilograms) of the popcorn in July and August 2008. The
company recalled only 25 cases (31 kilograms), which were kept in
storage, and the rest had already been distributed to retailers via
wholesalers based mainly in the Kanto region. The ministry is also
ordering the distributors to investigate the matter, and is calling
for consumers to return the product.
