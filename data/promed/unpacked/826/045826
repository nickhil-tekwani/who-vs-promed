Northern Virginia health districts, which include Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, and others, are reporting an investigation into a significant increase in the number of reported cyclosporiasis cases since mid-June 2019.

To date there are 15 cyclosporiasis cases reported in the northern region of Virginia, up from 8 at this time last year [2018]. Additionally, more than 40 people from 2 large businesses in the area have reported gastrointestinal illness and are under investigation for suspected cyclosporiasis. A food or water source of this outbreak has not yet been identified, and the investigation is ongoing.

In the United States, past foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce, such as raspberries, basil, arugula, snow peas, mesclun lettuce, and cilantro.

Health officials advise following safe fruit and vegetable handling recommendations as the best way to prevent cyclosporiasis:
- Wash: Wash hands with soap and warm water before and after handling or preparing fruits and vegetables.
- Prepare: Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly under running water before eating, cutting, or cooking.
Fruits and vegetables that are labeled "prewashed" do not need to be washed again at home. Scrub firm fruits and vegetables, such as melons and cucumbers, with a clean produce brush. Cut away any damaged or bruised areas on fruits and vegetables before preparing and eating.
- Store: Refrigerate cut, peeled, or cooked fruits and vegetables as soon as possible, or within 2 hours.

[This looks like at multi-state outbreak, and even though the source is not yet known, previous outbreaks have been linked to a single manufacturer distributing goods to outlets in several states. Thus more cases and, most likely, the involvement of more states can be expected. - Mod.EP
