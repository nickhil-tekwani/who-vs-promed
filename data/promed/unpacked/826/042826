The loss of a large number of cattle and sheep may be blamed on the acute
shortage of fodder this year. But the farmers here say that's just half the
story. The main reason is a mysterious disease, they claim.
Farmers across the villages of Jodhpur and Jaisalmer say the fodder crisis
has been compounded by this disease which is spreading all over.
"In the past few years, no doctor has visited our village," says Nijam
Khan, who has lost about 100 sheep in a couple of months. He says though
fodder depots have been set up at various places, they may not be of much
help in keeping the animals alive.
"Look at this poor creature. He can't even drink water, not to speak of
chewing the rough and dry wheat husk being supplied at the fodder depots,"
he says, picking up an ailing lamb. He says what is needed the most is
medicines and vaccinations along with fodder if the animals are to be kept
alive.
Not many know what exactly the disease is. "It looks like sewra (in
sheep)...what you know as small pox," says a resident of Gonga village. But
even he is not sure of it as the symptoms are not exactly the same. A local
vet also pleaded ignorance.
Jaisalmer district collector Rajat Mishra says there's nothing "mysterious"
about the disease. He said a viral disease called "Ori" strikes sheep and
cattle every summer. "This time they are finding it different as they have
actually never seen it before," he says.
He says this year there has been large scale migration of sheep from the
neighbouring Barmer area where drought situation prevailed even last year.
"These sheep were sold at low rates by Barmer farmers in large numbers to
the people here," he says. And this lot is the one which is under the grip
of the disease.
"They have not been able to adapt to the environment here and have died in
large numbers, in the process infecting the local lot," says Mishra.
According to him, in at least 12 cattle camps in the district, around 52
000 sheep and goats have been treated so far and several such camps are
likely to begin in the next few days.
The problem may worsen as a large number of cattle-owners from Jodhpur,
Jaisalmer, Pali, Jalore and Sirohi are migrating to Bhiwani, Rewari,
Mahendragarh, Sirsa, Sonepat and Panipat in Haryana. "It may lead to the
spread of the disease even in those areas," says a veterinarian.
