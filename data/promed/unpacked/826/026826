The Seoul city government said Wed [21 Jan 2015] that it would take preventive measures against foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] amid escalating concerns over its spread.

As of [Wed 21 Jan 2015], more than 63 000 livestock at 63 farms nationwide had been culled, mostly in Gyeonggi Province and North Chungcheong Province, since the 1st reported outbreak on [5 Dec 2014].

The capital will conduct antibody tests on all livestock in national parks in the city and vaccinate all animals that have not yet been immunized, officials said. The city will also strengthen monitoring of the animals, they added.

The city has run a quarantine task force since late last year [2014] to better cope with potential cases. It also launched emergency situation rooms at 7 sites to enhance its quarantine response.

Earlier this week, dozens of pigs at 2 farms in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province [Chungcheongbuk-do], tested positive, quarantine authorities said. The animals were suddenly unable to stand, a common symptom of FMD, they added.

Another 2 cases were confirmed in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, 40 km [about 25 mi] south of Seoul, the Agriculture Ministry said.

The outbreak is suspected to have started in unvaccinated pigs at a farm, it added.

South Korea has been hit 5 times by FMD since 2000, with 3 occurrences in 2010.

More than 3.4 million animals were slaughtered in the largest outbreak, in late 2010, resulting in losses of more than 2.7 trillion won (USD 2.5 billion).

[Since 5 Dec 2014 and as of 18 Dec 2014, South Korea has reported to the OIE a total of 3 FMD outbreaks, affecting swine. The total OIE statistics of the 3 reported outbreaks, until 18 Dec 2014, were as follows:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 21 546 / 487 / 0 / 103 / 0

The immediate notification of 5 Dec 2014 and the follow-up report dated 18 Dec 2014 are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16695. Later events, including an outbreak in cattle recorded, according to media, by the Ministry of Agriculture (see ProMED-mail post 20150107.3077425) and the 4 outbreaks in swine reported above, are expected to be covered in Korea's due follow-up report.

According to South Korea's page on the website of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (Pirbright), all FMD virus samples received from South Korea in 2011 and (July) 2014 were serotyped O, topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98. A batch of 10 new samples, received at Pirbright on 22 Dec 2014 for genotyping ("batch WRLFMD/2014/00040") , is reportedly "pending" (see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/skr.htm). The genotyping report of these recent samples, including details of their most closely related vaccine strains, is anticipated. - Mod.AS
