A deadly deer disease is hitting the population of wildlife in eastern Kentucky. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, also known as EHD is spreading in multiple counties. Reports of dead deer are being called in to fish and wildlife officials across the state.

The virus is insectborne and can fatally affect red deer and sheep. It is not contagious but can become widespread due to insect activity, specifically the midge fly.

The counties hardest hit have been Magoffin, Floyd and Knott counties.

When neighbors DN and KN began seeing dead deer near where they live last week [week of 24 Jul 2017], it was reminiscent of a disease that impacted local deer 2 other times in the past 10 years. "Here we go again," DN said. In 2007 and 2012, dead deer in the Hookstown, Georgetown, and Greene Township areas [Beaver county] tested positive for epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD], according to the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The disease is spread by midge flies that are native to the southern United States, and the flies die out after the 1st frost.

Up to 2 deer suspected to have died from the disease this month [July 2017] are being tested.

DN, of Greene Township, who leases over 460 acres [186 ha] of property for farming and hunting, is worried about what could happen to the local deer population if nothing is done, and whether cattle and horses she owns could become infected: "And it's a very important source of meat for a lot of families."

Matt Kramer, a wildlife conservation officer with the Pennsylvania Game Commission, said it's unusual for the disease to turn up in the same area again and again, especially since EHD typically doesn't occur in Pennsylvania. "The midge fly bites an infected animal, gets in the blood, transmits it to another unaffected animal who then contracts the disease, and then it goes to these areas to die," he said. "So it's cyclical, because if the midge fly bites the deer and then bites multiple deer and infects them, it creates a situation where you're just infecting more and more deer in a particular area."

They haven't been able to pinpoint an exact reason for it, but he said it could be environmental. "There's no proof of anything. It just seems to be that's where they're showing up. Now is it because people keep looking for them there 1st? We don't know," he said. "Having gone through that in the past 10 years, the residents in those particular areas know what they're looking for, so they call us and say, you know, we have these suspected dying deer."

When the disease 1st occurred 10 years ago, he estimated that hundreds of deer in the area died from it. A smaller population was infected in 2012. The midge flies that spread the disease typically live near water. Other dead deer have been found in the area, but those animals couldn't be tested for the disease because a viable sample has to be dead for less than 10 hours, Kramer said.

While humans cannot contract the disease, other animals can get it, such as other hooved creatures like cattle. EHD in livestock or any animals besides deer has not been reported. "It's primarily in the southern states," Kramer said. "The deer in that particular area usually build up antibodies. Some of them are resistant do it. We just don't have it frequently enough here for the deer to build up a resistance. So when we get it, the deer get hit hard."

As for DN and KN, they've begun to grow frustrated that nothing has been done over the years. DN would like for someone to spray the area to kill the midge flies, but Kramer said the area is too large to be sprayed and the disease will "have to run its course."

"You can't get anybody to help us. That's the problem. That's what we're upset about," DN said. "Nobody will help us. They just let it go. And they wait for the frost, and the frost kills it off."

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD] is a viral disease which is often fatal to many wild ruminants, especially cervids. The acute, infectious disease is usually characterized by extensive hemorrhages. EHD is NOT the same as bluetongue disease. Although presentation may be similar, these diseases are antigenically very different.

The article from Pennsylvania seems a sad commentary on where we put funds. We seem to take no consideration to the people who watch these animals. It seems to come down to a case of no or little research being invested in this disease, or perhaps many diseases of wild deer and perhaps farmed cervids as well. Research is expensive but some of our resource may depend upon finding cures.

If you have ever been bitten by one of the midge fly, it can be painful. - Mod.TG
