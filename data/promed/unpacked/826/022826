As mentioned below, climatic factors have contributed to the increase in
tuberculosis in Indonesia. While most of the attention given to El Nino
Southern Oscillation is its eastern Pacific impact on South, Central, and
North America, let it be known that the "flip side" of ENSO is drought in
the western Pacific. We should not overlook the concurrent impacts of this
major influencing environmental force.

I wonder about the reporting on locations and numbers. The Lake Sentani,
Tanah Merah,
Merauke, and Mamberamo areas are all quite distant from one another;
Sentani is right next door to the provincial capital of Jayapura.

[Adding to the comments of Mr. Stuart Kirsch about tuberculosis in Irian
Jaya, I
have worked in Irian Jaya (in the Wamena Region, central highlands) during
1991-1993. I have seen that tuberculosis is now widely spread in the
shorelines, or all the regions on the shore.
I can't see how we would know where tuberculosis started in Irian Jaya
because before the Dutch occupation, I am sure that people in the northern
shore had been trading with other Islands of the Indonesian Archipelago.
In the central highlands which is isolated from surface access,
tuberculosis is not [seen as much. In the Capital of the central
highlands, Wamena, we [see a few [cases, but in the sub district
[surrounding area ? I found very few [cases of
tuberculosis (1-2 cases per /12,000 inhabitants). [The cases that I have
observed are mostly newcomers from the shore or [those who have close
contact to people from
shore.
A tuberculosis program has been running for more than 7 years now, which
[provides free medication for patients with positive sputum [smears for
acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Despite this, compliance of patients are poor.
The main issue is how to spread the program, how to detect [infected
persons, and do
[epidemiological surveillance. We have enough medicine [to expand the
program, but we don't have enough training and people to do surveillance
and lab work.

[Thanks to all who have contributed to the discussion of this situation,
and especially to Dr. Alisjahbana for offering the perspective of the
practicing physician in Indonesia. It would appear that there is ample
work to be done here for those who wish to contribute to the advancement of
health care delivery in the developing world. I will cut this thread with
this posting unless significant new information is forthcoming. - Mod.ES
