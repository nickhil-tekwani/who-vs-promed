Occupational exposure
---------------------
August 2017: Occupational Exposures to Ebola Virus in Ebola Treatment Center, Conakry, Guinea
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/8/16-1804_article

[Citation. Savini H, Janvier L, Karkowski L, et al. (Aug 2017) Occupational Exposures to Ebola Virus in Ebola Treatment Center, Conakry, Guinea. Emerg Infect Dis 23(8) DOI: 10.3201/eid2308.161804

Abstract: We report 77 cases of occupational exposures for 57 healthcare workers at the Ebola Treatment Center in Conakry, Guinea, during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014-2015. Despite the high incidence of 3.5 occupational exposures/healthcare worker/year, only 18 percent of workers were at high risk for transmission, and no infections occurred.

Occupational infections during the West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in 2014-2105 were a major concern because this outbreak caused 109 deaths among the healthcare workers in Guinea (1). There was also international concern when secondary cases occurred in Spain and the United States (2, 3).

The Healthcare Workers Treatment Center in Conakry, Guinea, sought to diagnose and treat healthcare workers with suspected or proven EVD by offering extensive medical care (e.g., blood or plasma transfusions, central venous catheterization, biologic monitoring). This center had 5 persons with suspected EVD and 9 persons with confirmed EVD.

The 1st objective of this study was to describe the occupational exposures occurring in the Healthcare Workers Treatment Center. The 2nd objective was to analyze factors associated with the frequency of high-risk exposures]...

Liberia: museum
---------------
13 Jul 2017 Liberia: First Ebola Museum Opens
http://allafrica.com/stories/201707140689.html

[A new exhibit at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] museum takes a powerful look at what it was like at ground zero of the worst outbreak of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] in history. The CDC's David J. Sencer Museum, believed to be the 1st U.S. museum to offer an overview of the devastating viral outbreak that killed more than 11 000 people in West Africa, is titled "EBOLA: People + Public Health + Political Will."

The exhibition offers a glimpse of public health workers' experiences during the outbreak. In addition, the CDC was there working 24/7 to stop the rapidly spreading epidemic even as the death toll mounted in crowded cities and rural villages alike.

Stunning photographs vividly illustrate the severity of the outbreak and the difficult work undertaken by public health workers to bring it under control. Artifacts on display include crosses made to mark the graves of victims, Bibles marked with passages that were interpreted to support [EVD] prevention and T-shirts and posters designed to raise awareness about how it's transmitted.

The exhibit also includes hand-washing stations and special, sophisticated fluid-resistant head covers worn by health care workers to prevent any exposure to the Ebola virus. There are also stories about people who survived Ebola.]

[A museum is an excellent idea to assist in keeping this devastating outbreak and the courageous response of health care workers in the memory of the community. - Mod.LK]

Liberia: surveillance

10 Jul 2017. Liberia: Enhancing Ebola Virus Disease Surveillance And Prevention In Counties Without Confirmed Cases In Rural Liberia: Experiences From Sinoe County During The Flare-Up In Monrovia, April To June, 2016
http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/09/139154

[Citation. Darling Weah V., Wiah S.Q., Nyem, et al. Enhancing Ebola Virus Disease Surveillance And Prevention In Counties Without Confirmed Cases In Rural Liberia: Experiences From Sinoe County During The Flare-Up In Monrovia, April To June, 2016. bioRxIV doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/139154

Abstract
-Introduction. During the flare-ups of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Liberia, Sinoe County reactivated the multi-sectorial EVD control strategy in order to be ready to respond to the eventual reintroduction of cases. This paper describes the impacts of the interventions implemented in Sinoe County during the last flare-up in Monrovia, from 1 Apr to 9 Jun 2016, using the resources provided during the original outbreak that ended one year back.

-Discussion. The small attrition of the trained staff and the availability of most of the supplies, equipment, and infrastructure made the reactivation of the multi-sectorial EVD control strategy fast and affordable. The improvement of the EVD surveillance was possibly affected by the community engagement activities, awareness and mentoring of the health workers, and improved availability of clinicians in the facilities during the flare-up. The community engagement may contribute to the report of community-based events, specifically community deaths. The mentoring of the staff during the supportive supervisions also contributed to improve the IPC indicators.]

DRC containment
---------------
13 Jul 2017 How an Outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo Was Contained [EXTERNAL]
http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/07/13/how_an_outbreak_of_ebola_in_the_drc_was_contained.html

[The World Health Organisation recently declared the end of the most recent outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). By the time the outbreak was contained, 8 people had been infected; 4 survived. The first patient diagnosed in the outbreak (the index case)--a middle aged man who died on his way to hospital--got ill in April [2017]. It's not clear how he became infected. But those who helped transport him to the hospital also became sick.

This outbreak had the 2nd lowest number of patients among all the 8 Ebola outbreaks in DRC since 1976. The last one in 2014 lasted for 3 months and 3/4 of the 66 people diagnosed with the disease died. The outbreak was traced back to a pregnant woman who had slaughtered a monkey brought home by her husband. The disease spread when she underwent a traditional surgical operation after becoming ill.

The most recent outbreak was controlled more efficiently than the 2014 outbreak and sets an example for other countries. A combination of factors meant that it was possible to stop the disease from spreading. These included a prompt response, immediate diagnosis and treatment, a coordinated approach, and the involvement of the community in identifying the case and minimising the spread of the outbreak. ...-more]

[3] Vaccine
Russian vaccine to Guinea
-------------------------
12 Jul 2017. First batch of Russian Ebola vaccine sent to Guinea - 1000 doses [EXTERNAL]
http://tass.com/society/955903

[According to the health minister, the Russian vaccine has proved its effectiveness and has practically no side effects. The 1st batch of 1000 Ebola vaccine doses developed at the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology was sent to the Republic of Guinea on Wed [12 Jul 2017], a TASS correspondent reported. "The first batch of the vaccine is 1000 doses, which means that 1000 people will be vaccinated," said Alexander Semikhin, head of the Biotechnological Products Department at the Gamaleya Institute. According to Semikhin, after the vaccination, revaccination is needed in 21 days' time.

According to the Russian Health Ministry, Russia's Gam Evac Combi is the world's first officially registered vaccine approved for clinical use for the prevention of hemorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola virus.

The presentation of the Russian vaccines (named Gam Evac and Gam Evac Combi) to the World Health Organization (WHO) took place in Geneva on 15 Feb. At a meeting between the Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova and WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, the 2 sides emphasized the importance of the Russian Ebola vaccine for the international community.

According to Skvortsova, the Russian vaccine has proved its effectiveness and has practically no side effects. "One hundred percent of vaccinated people have a high antibody titer to the causative agent. We have been monitoring the vaccinated individuals for 5 months now, and this titer has remained high for 5 months. The blood serum of those vaccinated completely kills and neutralizes the virus in laboratory conditions," the minister explained.]

[This vaccine is a live attenuated heterologous VSV- and Ad5-vectored Ebola vaccine. Phase I/II trials were conducted in Russia and reported in Hum Vaccin Immunother (Dolzhikova IV et al. Safety and immunogenicity of GamEvac-Combi, a heterologous VSV- and Ad5-vectored Ebola vaccine: An open phase I/II trial in healthy adults in Russia. Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017 Mar 4;13(3):613-620.
doi: 10.1080/21645515.2016.1238535. Epub 2017 Feb 2). The researchers concluded that the vaccine was very safe and highly immunogenic in up to 100 percent of healthy adult volunteers, with the possibility of eliciting long lasting protection. - Mod.LK]

10 Jul 2017: Sierra Leone Business: World Bank announce 28 year loan
http://awoko.org/2017/07/10/sierra-leone-business-world-bank-announce-28year-loan/

[The World Bank has announced a USD 22 million loan and USD 8 million grant in a USD 30 million package meant to service 6 key sectors of the economy. The USD 22 million loan is expected to be paid back during a long term of 28 years although the Bank is skeptical on whether all of it will eventually be paid.

Along with the USD 8 million grant the credit package is expected to reverse a 3 percent increase in poverty experienced during the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] period in 2015. The package targets private-sector driven agricultural production, with seed production and increased crop yield through the use of high quality fertilizers, and further implementing the new land policy to increase the available agricultural land. ...-more]
