Quarantine measures have been set up in the village of Makanchi in
[Urdzharsky] district of East Kazakhstan where 19 people were exposed
to possible anthrax and are under health watch. This was reported by
the press service of the Department of Emergency SAI, reports KazTAG.
At this time 18 of them are local folk from Makanchi, and one in
Semey. All are being tested every day and are under the supervision of
physicians.

Strict movement controls of livestock and meat are in place. The
source of infection has not yet been identified. In the meanwhile the
house and yard of the affected patient have been cleaned and
disinfected.

As previously reported, on 22 Sep 2011 a 45-year-old man from Makanchi
was hospitalised in the district hospital with suspected anthrax. As
of 26 Sep 2011 the diagnosis has been laboratory confirmed.

In eastern Kazakhstan, there are about 200 historic anthrax foci.
Recent cases were reported in 2008 in Ulan Ayagoz in the Eastern
region.

[It is of interest that the source of the index patient's infection is
still officially in doubt. That 19 people have been identified as
being at risk would indicate to this moderator that more is known than
is being shared. Fair enough. Logically a sick cow was slaughtered and
butchered outside of veterinary supervision. - Mod.MHJ]
