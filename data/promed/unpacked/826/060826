Meningococcal disease in Chad
-----------------------------
From 1 Jan to 6 Mar 2011, the Ministry of Health of Chad reported 923
suspected cases of meningococcal disease including 57 deaths (case
fatality rate: 6.2 per cent). So far, 5 districts primarily in the
region of Logone Occidental are experiencing an epidemic (Benoye,
Kello, Laokassy, Melfi, and Moundou) while 2 others are on alert
(Boussou and Sarh).

The predominance of _Neisseria meningitidis_ A in epidemic districts
has been laboratory-confirmed by latex agglutination test, with no
other _N. meningitidis_ serogroup being identified in these areas.

The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for
Epidemic Meningitis Control has provided 752 000 doses of bivalent
polysaccharide AC vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign in affected
areas of Benoye, Kello, Laokassy, Melfi, and Moundou. Vaccines are
being provided with the support of the Global Alliance for Vaccines
and Immunization (GAVI) and Medecins sans Frontieres.

WHO, UNICEF, Medecins sans Frontieres, and the International
Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) are working with the Ministry of
Health, Chad, to implement the vaccination campaigns as well as other
emergency control measures, including case management and enhanced
surveillance in neighbouring districts.

[Chad is a poor, landlocked country in central Africa, which is
bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African
Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the south west, and
Niger to the west. It is largely desert and as of 2008, Chad hosted
over 280 000 refugees from the Sudan's Darfur region, over 55 000 from
the Central African Republic, as well as over 170 000 internally
displaced people (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad>). N'Djamena is
the national capital of Chad. The 22 regions of Chad are divided into
53 departments, which in turn are subdivided into sub prefectures
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad>).

For an administrative map of Chad, see
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/chad.pdf>. Logone
Occidental, which is a region in southwestern Chad, includes the sub
prefectures of Benoye, Laokassy, Moundou, and Sarh
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logone_Occidental_Region>). Melfi is a
town in the Guera Region of southern-central Chad
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guera_Region>), and Kelo is in the
southwestern Tandjile Region
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandjile_Region>).

Sub-Saharan Africa is been plagued yearly by large epidemics of
meningococcal meningitis that occur in the dry season (December to
June). Chad is in the middle of this "meningitis belt", which
stretches from the east to the west coast of Africa, taking in Burkina
Faso, Benin, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana,
Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Togo, and Uganda.
Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from
100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have
reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization:
Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet;
<http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf>).
Epidemic thresholds are used to confirm the emergence of an epidemic
in order to step up control measures, that is, mass vaccination and
appropriate case management. For definitions of epidemic thresholds,
see <http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/6618.doc>.

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the
appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an
attempt to induce herd immunity (whereby transmission is blocked when
a critical percentage of the population have been vaccinated (see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>).

In 2010, ProMED-mail posted a report of an outbreak of meningitis of
unspecified etiology in Chad in 2010 (Meningitis - Chad: (LR, MA) RFI
20100223.0600) and in 2009 ProMED-mail posted a report of an outbreak
of meningitis in Chad due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups A and
W135, with an 11.7-per cent mortality rate (Meningitis, meningococcal
- Chad (02) 20090424.1544).

The current outbreak reported in the news release above is said to be
due to _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A, with mortality rate of 6.2 per
cent. The WHO defines successful epidemic control as keeping the
mortality rate below 10 per cent.

meningitis belt can be found at
