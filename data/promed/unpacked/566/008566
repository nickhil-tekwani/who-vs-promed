Researchers have provided more insight into what is thought to be the 1st _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to frozen pre-cooked crayfish in dill brine. In late September 2019, the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhälsomyndigheten) identified a cluster of 9 patients with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport infections. By the end of October 2019, there were 25 cases with onset of disease from mid-August 2019 to mid-October 2019. At the start of the investigation, several patients said they had eaten crayfish. This was, however, not unexpected since crayfish feasts are a traditional celebration in Sweden in August and September. They are typically served cold, and frozen pre-cooked crayfish are ready to eat after thawing, without reheating.

A case-case study was done based on notified salmonellosis cases and a _Salmonella_ trawling questionnaire, comparing 20 outbreak and 139 control cases. Outbreak patients were more likely to have consumed crayfish, according to the study published in the journal Eurosurveillance [see citation below]. Based on additional work and the open-ended questions in the trawling questionnaire, a single brand of frozen, pre-cooked whole crayfish in dill brine imported from China was identified as the source.

Results of the epidemiological investigation were communicated to ICA, the retail company selling the specific brand of crayfish in dill brine, on 8 Nov 2019. The retailer recalled all remaining packs. From these, with production dates from 30 Nov 2018 to 4 Dec 2018, they analyzed 84 samples from different batches. _Salmonella_ Newport was detected in 6 samples from batches with best-before dates 1 and 2 Dec 2021, respectively. It was also found in the same brand of crayfish in dill brine in follow-up sampling at a border-control post with a best-before date of 12 Dec 2021. Isolates from food samples clustered with the human outbreak strain by WGS.

It is not known how the product was contaminated. _Salmonella_ has been detected in wild crayfish and it is possible that they were undercooked. However, since _Salmonella_ was found in 2 batches, indicating a persistent contamination, it is more likely that product was contaminated after cooking, by adding contaminated dill or by environmental contamination during preparation, according to the study.

In total, 33 cases were confirmed, with onset of symptoms between 31 Jul 2019 and 2 Nov 2019. They were distributed among 12 of the 21 counties in Sweden, with between one and 8 cases in each region. Sick people ranged in age from one to 82 years old, and 20 were female. Two other sick people with the outbreak strain were identified in 2020 and 2021. The case in 2020 had eaten crayfish from one of the recalled batches in 2019, but the ill person in 2021 claimed not to have eaten crayfish before disease onset.

"This demonstrates the difficulty of completely removing the risk associated with contaminated foods with long best-before dates, as the chance of connecting a food in the freezer with a recall, or news of an outbreak, decreases over time," said researchers. No other European countries reported an increase in _Salmonella_ Newport.

"Abstract
---------
In autumn 2019 the Public Health Agency of Sweden identified a cluster of _Salmonella_ Newport cases by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Cases' distribution in place and time indicated a nationwide ongoing outbreak. An investigation was initiated to identify the source and prevent further cases. We conducted a case-case study based on notified salmonellosis cases and a _Salmonella_ trawling questionnaire comparing 20 outbreak cases and 139 control cases. Food exposures were compared by adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using logistic regression. Implicated foods were sampled. Outbreak cases were more likely to have consumed crayfish (aOR = 26; 95% CI: 6.3-105). One specific brand of imported frozen pre-cooked whole crayfish in dill brine was identified as the source. _Salmonella_ Newport was later detected in different batches from retail and in one sample from border control. Isolates from food samples clustered with the human outbreak strain by WGS. Although the retailer made a complete recall, 2 more cases were identified long afterward. This investigation demonstrated the successful use of a case-case study and targeted microbiological testing to identify the source. The immediate action taken by the retailer was important to confirm the source and stop the outbreak."

Other than shellfish such as oysters and clams that filter seawater and can retain human pathogens, most seafood-related salmonellosis is likely due to contamination during processing. Salmonellosis has been linked to tuna with, among others, serotypes Newport, Bareilly, and Paratyphi B. - Mod.LL
