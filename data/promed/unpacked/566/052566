Subject: Schmallenberg virus
-----------------------------

Mr President,

Since 1 Dec 2011 we find in the Netherlands a new disease that leads
to the birth of deformed
lambs. On 15 Dec 2011, a new virus was found in those lambs; the same
virus was
found earlier this year to be the cause of "cow diarrhea", observed in
cattle in the
Netherlands and in Germany.

With this letter I herewith inform you about the background and
current developments.

Cows Diarrhea
-------------
During the period August/September 2011, over 80 Dutch cattle farms
reported to the
Animal Health Service (GD) about the appearance of diarrhea, fever and
a drop in the milk
yield. The animals recovered and cause remained unclear. These
phenomena were found,
during the same period, also in German cattle farms. The German
Friedrich LÃ¶ffler Institute
(FLI) has demonstrated, on 18 Nov 2011, a new virus in blood samples
from the affected
cows; the virus is currently named the "Schmallenberg virus".

Immediately after the detection of this virus, the developed test was
transferred by FLI to
the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) [Lelystad, Holland] in order to
test also samples from
Dutch farms affected by diarrhea. The CVI investigated 50 sampled from
8 diarrhea farms
and 115 control-samples from farms without problems. On 8 December it
became apparent
that 18 of the 50 diarrhea-samples were positive for the
"Schmallenberg virus". All control
samples were negative.

Therefore it may be assumed that the Schmallenbergvirus was the cause
of the diarrhea
problems. Infection trials, to be performed in Germany, are expected
to provide a definitive
result.

Malformed lambs
-----------------
Since Dec 2011, the Animal Health Service (GD) received reports about
the appearance
of deformed lamb born with defects such as crooked neck, hydrocephalus
and stiff joints.
Most deformed lambs were born dead, and those born alive were not
viable. So far, these
symptoms have been reported from 20 farms, spread throughout the
entire country.
Several affected lambs have been were offered for dissection/PM to the
GD. On 8 Dec
2011, 8 lambs from 2 farms were examined by the CVI; in 2 lambs from
the same farm the
Schmallenberg virus was found.
Earlier, other pathogens which may cause similar disease-picture, were
excluded.
Though the number of samples analyzed is still limited, also in this
case [lambs] a causal
link between the disease and the presence of Schmallenberg virus is
likely.

In the meantime, the GD has been reported about 2 deformed calves from
one farm.
No results from these calves is yet available.

Impact
------
As the lambing period has only just begun, a further increase of the
number of lambs with
the said pathological changes is very likely.

Furthermore, the possibility that congenital malformations will
shortly be seen also in calves
and kids is not excluded. There is no (EU) declaration and / or
control requirement for this
virus. However, given the potential impact for the involved plants /
sectors, I follow the
developments closely. In accordance with our recent agreements
regarding the tackling of
new (virus) infections, I have updated my colleague of the Ministry of
Health (VWS) and the
RIVM [National Institute for Public Health and the Environment],
involving them in the continued
investigation. According to an initial risk assessment, performed by
RIVM, the risk to human
health is regarded to be low.

Application of preventive or control measures is, at present, not
possible because the virus
has not been isolated yet and there are, so far, no data onroute of
infection and spread.

Moreover, the phenomena we currently observe are the result of an
infection that probably
took place already several months ago.

Because of the unfamiliarity with the disease and its causative agent
agent and I have released a
budget to support further research into this virus. The CVI has
already begun to further develop
the diagnostic methods, to start epidemiological investigations and to
initiate preparations
for potential vaccine development. These activities are to cooperated,
as far as possible, with
the AHS, the RIVM and the German FLI.

Since the first isolation of the Schmallenberg virus in Germany, the
services involved have
kept in touch with my department and the European Commission on the
situation. Information is
being exchanged with the CVO of Germany and surrounding Member States
and all latest
findings are forwarded also to to the European Commission. I shall
also update your House
regarding all further developments.

[According to experience gathered in countries known as affected by
Akabane and related orthobunyaviruses (eg Japan, Australia and
Israel), the appearance of malformed newborn lambs may be indicative
of an infection which had affected them as fetuses during their second
and third months of pregnancy (the duration of pregnancy in sheep and
goats is approximately 150 days). It will be interesting to note when
the appearance of malformed lambs (and, likely, kids) peaks in the
Netherlands. Since plausibly the virus was transmitted by culicoides,
animals conceived in late autumn are less likely to produce affected
offspring.

In cattle, a more distinct presentation of the 2 main phenomena,
namely arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly, was observed in the said
countries. Bovine foeti, infected during their 1st semester of
pregnancy, are likely to develop hydranencephaly while those infected
during the 2nd semester are likely to demonstrate arthrogryposis
(combined, in many cases, with the need for veterinary intervention
due to difficulties during parturition of the deformed calves).
CNS-affected calves (expected to be born later in the season) may be
born alive and remain alive for surprisingly extended periods --
succumbing when rumination starts.

Since, so far, the Schmallenberg virus was demonstrated by genetic
techniques but has not (yet) been isolated, serological testing may be
performed with other available relevant viruses (eg Akabane). Testing
precolostral affected offspring, born alive, is of particular
significance; such animals will be positive if infected when already
immuno-competent, confirming the role of a virus.

In order to try isolate the virus, the researchers may opt to test
bathes of culicoides midges trapped during the late summer
months/early autumn of 2011 in the affected areas. Otherwise, effort
should be invested, next year, to detect viraemic (subclinical?)
animals during the vector season.

Additional information on the investigations in Germany and the
Netherlands, and on the possible route(s) of introduction, is
anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS.]
