Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Europe: a survey among national experts from 39 countries, February 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
C Glasner C, Albiger B, Buist G, et al, and the European Survey on Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (EuSCAPE) working group

The spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is a threat to healthcare delivery, although its extent differs substantially from country to country. In February 2013, national experts from 39 European countries were invited to self-assess the current epidemiological situation of CPE in their country. Information about national management of CPE was also reported. The results highlight the urgent need for a coordinated European effort on early diagnosis, active surveillance, and guidance on infection control measures.

The present report summarises the results from 39 European countries of a self-assessment of the epidemiological stage and the management of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) at national level.

Background
----------
CPE are an emerging threat to healthcare and are frequently resistant to many other antibiotics than carbapenems [1,2] leaving few treatment options. The extent to which healthcare systems have already been affected, however, differs substantially from country to country. Following a previous initiative, a group of European experts is implementing the European Survey on CPE (EuSCAPE) in an effort to update assessments of the nature and scale of CPE spread in Europe [3]. The current programme receives financial support from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The aim of this study is to obtain a more accurate and timely estimate of CPE prevalence in European countries and to support reference laboratory-capacity building to prevent and control the spread of CPE in Europe.

Results
-------
All national experts (NEs) completed the online questionnaire. A total of 37 NEs declared that they were aware of the current epidemiology of CPE in their country and all rated the occurrence and spread of CPE in their country using the previously established epidemiological staging system (Figure and Table 1). Nevertheless, only 26 NEs could self-assess their current situation with certainty.

A total of 3 countries (Iceland, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) reported no cases of CPE in their country. Sporadic cases, single or sporadic hospital outbreaks were reported by NEs from 22 countries. For 11 countries, regional or national spread was reported, whereas for 3 countries (Greece, Italy and Malta) NEs reported that CPE are regularly isolated from patients in most hospitals, corresponding to the endemic stage (Table 1).

Among the 31 countries that participated in both the 2010 and 2013 assessments, 17 reported a higher stage by 2013; likewise, by 2013, the number of countries with regional or inter-regional spread or an endemic situation increased from 7 to 13 (Table 1). Some countries expressed concerns that underdetection or underreporting, or both, could affect the certainty of the stage of their countries (Figure).

A total of 33 of the NEs indicated that _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ was the most frequent Enterobacteriaceae species to produce carbapenemases in their country. Overall, _K. pneumoniae_ carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (KPC) have attained the widest distribution, whereas strains with New Delhi metallobeta-lactamase (NDM) -- although responsible for occasional hospital outbreaks in few countries -- have not reached such a wide distribution in European countries (Figure).

Of 39 countries, 30 and 28 reported having a dedicated surveillance system for CPE and a dedicated reference laboratory for CPE, respectively; 23 reported having a system to notify CPE cases to health authorities, mostly on a mandatory basis. Only 21 countries reported having national recommendations or guidelines on infection control measures to prevent the spread of CPE; one country reported having such recommendation or guideline in preparation.

Countries that were uncertain about their epidemiological stages had on average 1.9 national management documents regulating surveillance and response structures. In contrast, those who were more certain about their epidemiological stages had on average 4.7 (p-value less than 0.001; Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test).

Discussion
----------
The results of this online survey, performed in February 2013, show that, based on the knowledge and judgment of NEs, CPE are continuing to spread in Europe. Although most countries reported only single hospital outbreaks, the epidemiological situation has deteriorated over the past 3 years. Among the 31 countries that participated in both 2010 and 2013 assessments, 17 countries were upgraded to a higher epidemiological stage (Table 1). Now 3 countries that reported sporadic occurrence or single hospital outbreaks of CPE in 2010 are witnessing regional or inter-regional spread, or even an endemic situation. Malta moved from having sporadic cases to an endemic situation, although by nature of its small size, the intermediate epidemiological stages have little relevance. The influx of injured refugees from Libya in 2011, is believed to have contributed to an increase in carbapenem-hydrolysing oxacillinase (OXA)-48-positive Enterobacteriaceae (M. Borg, personal communication, April 2013). In Italy, a sporadic occurrence of Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM)-producing Enterobacteriaceae from 2008, accentuated by a single hospital outbreak, has been overtaken by the wide dissemination of KPC-positive _K. pneumoniae_ strains to many healthcare institutions. [4-9]. The situation in Hungary has evolved in the opposite direction: in 2010, concern centred upon a single clone of KPC-2-positive _K. pneumoniae_ that had attained regional distribution, whereas VIM-4-positive strains were only reported sporadically, but have now spread nationwide [3,10]. Overall, KPC-positive Enterobacteriaceae still have the widest distribution among CPE in Europe, but rising numbers of OXA-48-positive isolates are reported, making OXA-48 the most frequently detected carbapenemase in Belgium, France and Malta. Despite the attention that NDM has received when associated with introductions from the Indian subcontinent, the current numbers of reports by European countries are still relatively modest compared to the other carbapenemases [11]. The United Kingdom, however, continues to report more NDM-positive isolates than most other European countries [3,12].

The NEs completed the questionnaire to the best of their knowledge, but these were subjective assessments that may have underestimated the true extent of the spread of CPE. Underdetection and underreporting were pointed out by respondents in several countries, leading to uncertainty about the true epidemiological stage (Figure). In particular, this applied to countries from which introductions into other countries have been described but where NEs could not independently assess the extent of CPE spread. Underdetection and underreporting of CPE also coincided with weaker reference laboratory infrastructures and the absence of national recommendations for submission to national reference laboratories and for reporting to health authorities, thus suggesting that the true extent of CPE occurrence in Europe is still underestimated. At the same time, countries with strict screening policies and good surveillance are more likely to report advanced epidemiological stages also affecting the comparability of the assessment.

The keys to success in preventing the establishment of CPE are, firstly, early detection through good diagnostic practices, and secondly, containment of spread through patient and contact screening as well as infection control measures. An increasing number of countries have reacted and implemented measures as indicated by the increasing availability of a recommendation or guideline on infection control measures to prevent the spread of CPE [12]. Still 18 countries surveyed lacked such guidance and the same number of countries lacked relevant guidance for submission of isolates to national reference laboratories [12]. The results of the present report underscore the urgent need for an upgrading of laboratory standards to enable active surveillance and preventive action. To this purpose, the EuSCAPE programme aims to build a laboratory-based network for CPE detection in Europe.

[The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Enterobacteriaceae, drug resistant - USA (02): (CA) CRE 20130410.1636420:

"The Enterobacteriaceae is a large family of Gram-negative bacteria that includes _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _Yersinia pestis_, _Klebsiella_, _Proteus_, _Enterobacter_, _Serratia_, and _Citrobacter_, some of which live in the intestines of humans and other animals.

"Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

"Resistance to carbapenems commonly [is the result of an organism acquiring] the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that destroy the carbapenems. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases); NDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases). KPCs are the most common carbapenemases in the US, but have also been reported worldwide.

"Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, pieces of DNA that can easily spread from one organism to another of the same or even different bacterial species. KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) were first found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence the name) and were subsequently found in _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. The plasmids frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic and otherwise suboptimal antibiotics.

"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) can colonize the gastrointestinal systems of humans for prolonged periods and once introduced can spread through contamination of water sources, hands of health care personnel, and environmental surfaces (for example bed rails, IV poles, computer touchpads, and equipment used to monitor vital signs such as stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, etc.) within health care facilities (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6124a3.htm?s_cid=mm6124a3_e).

"CRE are easy to transfer from patient to patient. Hand hygiene is key to prevent the spread of these organisms and any other multidrug resistant microorganism. Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multi-drug resistant isolates include their rapid recognition by the microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance cultures of high-risk patients and their environment (CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings, 2006. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee; 2007. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf). Active case detection may be followed by cohorting staff and CRE patients (i.e., segregating CRE-colonized or CRE-infected patients and the health-care personnel who care for them from those without CRE and the health-care personnel who care for them) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0305a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0305a1_w)."
