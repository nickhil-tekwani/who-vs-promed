Outbreak of chick pea disease [edited]
There has been another major outbreak of ascochyta blight of chickpea
across 60 000 hectares from Dubbo, NSW to Goondiwindi, QLD.
All chickpea crops in the region, except two, have tested positive for the
disease that decimated crops last year and has dramatically reduced
plantings this season.
The program leader for pulses with New South Wales Agriculture at Dubbo,
John Sykes, says unfortunately the circumstances surrounding the outbreak
are largely unknown.
He said that the disease occurs in all crops regardless of the source of he
seeds for planting or how well the seeds have been treated with fungicide.

[Ascochyta blight, caused by Ascochyta rabei, is the most damaging disease
of chickpea around the world. It is particularly severe during cool, wet
winters. The disease was previously reported in South Australia in 1995,
and has probably been in Australia for several years.
The pathogen survives in crop residues and spreads to new areas in infected
seed. Resistant cultivars are available and breeding for resistance is one
strategy for disease management, but the priority for breeding will depend
on the economic significance of the disease for Australia. - Mod.DH]
