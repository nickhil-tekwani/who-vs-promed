In a case that made headlines across Britain last March [1999 a
22-year-old man admitted to a hospital in Nottingham for
pneumonia ended up dying with a malaria infection.
Dr. Tim Boswell of the Nottingham Public Health Laboratory said 3
patients infected with malaria after a trip to southern Africa infected
3 other patients in the hospital.
One of the patients was a 91-year-old woman who had come in
with diarrhoea, and became ill with malaria just as she was to be
discharged.
Boswell's team eventually traced the infection to a saline bottle that
was reused several times to flush out various tubes stuck into the
patients.
