The preliminary diagnosis of "anthrax" has been confirmed for 2 inhabitants of Usharal village, Aktogay district, Karaganda region.

"There are 3 patients with assumed "anthrax" staying in hospital today: 2 in the regional center and one in Balkhash. The preliminary lab tests show positive results for 2 people. But it means nothing, because now the process of thorough lab examination -- bacteriological and biological is under way," said Bolat Kalmagambetov, deputy chief of regional department for protection of consumers' rights. He said the patients are in satisfactory condition.

A total of 107 yards have been expected [perhaps "inspected". - Mod.SH] in the rural area to identify the contacted people. More than 400 people are under control. The medical service jointly with our stuff conduct repeated check every day," he said. 43 contacted people have been identified.

"The presumable source is meat which was butchered by the sick in his yard. The meat is being researched in the lab," he said.

The Kazakh authorities announced on [Mon 29 Aug 2016] that at least 3 more people the central Karaganda region's city of Balkhash have contracted anthrax.

In June [2016], 9 people were hospitalized in the Karaganda region with suspect anthrax, 2 of them died shortly afterwards. Amid the sudden anthrax outbreak, the authorities initiated an epidemiological investigation, which presumed that cattle grazing near unshielded cattle burial grounds and ineffective vaccination might cause anthrax in animals, the meat of which was later consumed by people.

Following the outbreak, new separate anthrax cases were reported in various parts of the country. "Currently, all 3 residents of the Karaganda region are under the supervision [of doctors]. Preliminary tests, undertaken by express method [presumably stained blood smears. - Mod.MHJ], show positive results. The condition of patients is satisfactory, without complications of gravity," deputy head of the local Department of Consumer Protection Bulat Kalmaganbetov said, as quoted by the Novosti-Kazakhstan news agency.

He added that about 400 people were being monitored, 43 individuals were in close contact with the infected. Moreover, 68 kilograms [about 150 lb] was meat withdrawn from sale from a local store in Balkhash. Kazakhstan has been globally famous for extensive cattle breeding, which can be explained via the historically nomadic nature of the Kazakh. The republic has vast grazing land, which amounts to more than 180 million hectares [about 445 million acres].

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease, which commonly affects animals. The bacterium behind anthrax, _Bacillus anthracis_, forms spores if out of a living organism, which makes it highly resistant to both low and high temperatures, drying, and disinfectants. The spore can persist for years at a pasture where the infected animals once grazed. Although it is not widespread, people may get infected if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

Anthrax cannot be spread directly from person to person, but an individual's clothing and skin may be contaminated with the spores of the disease.

[Maps of Kazakhstan can be seen at http://www.kazakhstan.orexca.com/img/kazakhstan_map.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4454995,41593. Karaganda (or Qaraghandy) is the oblast immediately south of Astana, and Balkhash is on the north shore of Lake Balkhash in the south east corner of the province (see http://images.slideplayer.es/3/1107122/slides/slide_2.jpg).

Latterly there has been a stream of unconfirmed human cases of anthrax, so I held off from posting. These 3 suspects appear to have been the result of some 68 kg [about 150 lb] of contaminated meat sold in Balkash. Logically not all the contaminated meat from one or more sick animals made their way to store, but would have been sold in street markets hither and yon. And if one person got away with selling meat from a sick cow, others will be doing it also with unfortunate results. But now two village cases have been confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]
