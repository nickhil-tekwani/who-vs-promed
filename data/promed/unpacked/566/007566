Canada bird flu not seen as high-pathogen - CFIA
WINNIPEG, Manitoba, June 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian Food Inspection Agency
said on Friday there is no current evidence that a detected case of H5
avian flu is the high-pathogen strain that has been found in Asia and other
countries.
"That virus is marked by high mortality in birds. There has been no high
mortality, it has not been observed in this situation," a CFIA spokesperson
said.
A gosling in a small backyard poultry flock in the eastern province of
Prince Edward Island has contracted the disease.
