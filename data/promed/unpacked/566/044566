Zimbabwe Launches Mass Anthrax Vaccination Campaign
----------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Zimbabwean health officials have launched a mass anthrax campaign
after at least 15 people contracted the disease in central Zimbabwe,
apparently after butchering infected cows, the official Zimbabwe
Broadcasting Corporation reported on Saturday. On Friday, the official
Herald newspaper said the latest outbreak was first noticed in cattle
in early October, with the first human case reported on 20 Oct 2001.
Of the 15 people suffering in the latest outbreak, 2 are in serious
condition and are receiving treatment at a hospital in the central
town of Kwekwe. In December 2000, an anthrax outbreak killed 9 people
in similar circumstances in villages about 100 km west of Harare [the
capital.

[Actually the 2000 series of outbreaks -- see refs above -- killed 11
people, but there were 960 clinical cases. These paralleled some 188
livestock cases in Manicaland, Mashonaland, Masvingo, and
Matabeleland. The reverse ratio in Zimbabwe reflects the significant
rural poverty and resultant lack of meat -- villagers will take the
risk of disease and death when skinning and butchering anthrax
carcasses. With the continuing political and economic problems in the
country the situation will not be reversed quickly nor easily. -

Zim Anthrax Outbreak Spreads South
-----------------------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak in Zimbabwe's central district of Kwekwe is
spreading south towards the South African border.
The Midlands provincial health medical director, Christopher Zishiri,
confirmed that 5 cattle died last week &15 people had contracted the
disease after eating infected meat. He said there were indications
that the disease was spreading southwards, towards the South
Africa/Matabeleland border. "[It is spreading and needs urgent
attention," Zishiri said.
Director for the department of veterinary services Dr Stuart
Hargreaves confirmed the outbreak. "We have been quick to arrive at
the scene as soon as we get reports but the disease is so vicious that
the cattle die in a matter of hours," Dr Hargreaves said. He said
anthrax outbreaks were prevalent in the tropics, but government
officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the
outbreak is natural or the work of a
group.

[In the current confrontational situation in Zimbabwe claims of
agricultural terrorism are to be expected, though the outbreak is
almost certainly a result of natural events and the progressive
slackening off of control programmes. - Mod.MHJ
