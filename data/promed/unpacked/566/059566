Anthrax team runs broke
-----------------------
While a fresh outbreak of anthrax is sweeping through parts of the Queen
Elizabeth National Park, the team of experts set up last year [2004] to
control it has run out of funds. Dr Nicholas Kauta, the commissioner in
charge of livestock, said yesterday [19 Feb 2005] that the death toll had
reached 37 since the year began.
Kauta said they needed about UGX 200 million [USD 117 000] to bury the
carcasses, vaccinate the livestock in the vicinity of the park, and
increase public awareness. "We are in a mess, because the funds that were
released were far less than what the team needed to fight the disease," he
said, adding that the government only released UGX 60 million [USD 35 000].
About 200 hippos perished last year [2004] in an attack that was mainly
concentrated around the Kazinga Channel.

[A quick calculation puts their additional funding needs at about USD 80
000. About 10 years ago, the Canadians discovered in the MacKenzie Bison
Sanctuary that one could prevent carcass scavenging long enough for
decomposition to change the pH -- and thereby kill the vegetative organisms
-- by spraying carcasses with 5 per cent formaldehyde. This acid pH change
takes only a few days (3 to 5 days), after which a carcass can be left to
rot and nature with minimal environmental contamination. If the fresh
carcass is not opened, minimal or no sporulation occurs. - Mod.MHJ]
