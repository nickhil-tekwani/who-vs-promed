No fewer than 65 persons have been reported dead from the outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) in Jigawa State. Daily Trust reports that the majority of the victims are children below 11 years of age.

Some of the villages [that are] said to record a high rate of cases in the state include Mele, Dungundun, Kanya Arewa and Dantanoma villages in Babura; Gumel, Maigatari and Suletankarkar local government areas (LGAs) in Jigawa North West.

According to Malam Alkasim Yakubu, the village head of Dungundun, at least 19 children have died from the disease. He said, "We lost 19 people in this village, the majority were children." He said the problem started around April [2022] and has since worsened with the increase in the rate of infections and death.

Yakubu further stated, "19 died, 2 people lost their sense of hearing and it was shocking to us as we have never experienced such disaster. We took the patients to Danladin Gumel health post where some died there, while some of the other victims died at home before being taken to hospital. Some of them were also referred to Gumel General Hospital."

Also speaking, the village head of Mele village in Gumel LGA, Malam Yusuf Ahmad said, "21 people died and over 30 cases recovered."

While the village head of Kanya Arewa in Babura LGA, Alhaji Akilu Dawaki stated that the disease had led to the death of 19 people in his domain where over 70 cases had been recorded. According to him, "What helps us in controlling the disease was that we locally established an isolation centre and [moved] the patients."

The outbreak of the disease in Jigawa began last month and the case worsened in Nigeria/Niger republic border LGAs in the state. The state epidemiologist, in the Ministry of Health, Malam Samaila Mahmud confirmed the outbreak. He said, "The record available in the ministry indicated that 65 people have so far died, 257 cases recorded in 18 out of 27 local government areas of the state."

[Jigawa is one of the 36 states of Nigeria, located in the north-central region of the Nigeria, on the border with Nigeria's northern neighbor, Niger (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigawa_State). Cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) is said to be occurring in 18 of Jigawa's 27 local government areas, but we are not told the microbial cause of CSM in these cases. Nevertheless, it is likely _Neisseria meningitidis_.

Northern Nigeria lies within the African meningitis belt, the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season between December and June. A map of the African meningitis belt can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-meningitis-belt-of-Africa-Map-highlights-26-countries-that-make-up-the-meningitis_fig1_321627150. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A had been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/weekly-epidemiological-record-14-2020-95-133-144).

However, in 2010, WHO began vaccinating all those aged one to 29 years old in African meningitis belt countries with a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine. Northern Nigeria fell within the zone that were vaccinated between 2010 and 2013 (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254901/WER9213.pdf). As of November 2017, more than 280 million people had been vaccinated (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/), and as of April 2021, 24 of the 26 countries in the meningitis belt had conducted mass preventive campaigns nationwide or in high-risk areas, and half of them had introduced this vaccine into their national routine immunization schedules (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis).

After the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt, WHO noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the prior 10 years (https://www.afro.who.int/node/6595). Among vaccinated populations, incidence of serogroup A meningitis has declined by more than 99% -- no serogroup A case has been confirmed since 2017 (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis). Serogroup A has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups, notably serogroup C and W. Serogroup X outbreaks have also been reported in this region (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html). The WHO notes that "the roll out of multivalent meningococcal conjugate [ACWY] vaccines is a public health priority to eliminate bacterial meningitis epidemics in the African Meningitis Belt" (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis).

We are not told in the news report above if meningococcal vaccination has been introduced into the routine immunization program in the Jigawa region of Nigeria, the meningococcal vaccination status of the affected children, or the meningococcal serogroup involved in this outbreak, if indeed _N. meningitidis_ is the pathogen involved. We are also not told if there is antibiotic therapy available to treat cases of bacterial meningitis in this region, or if antibiotics are available to promptly give to close contacts of those with meningitis to decrease the risk of transmission. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
