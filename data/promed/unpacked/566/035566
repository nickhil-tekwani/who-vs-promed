The [Hong Kong] Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [16 Nov 2015] investigating 3 outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) at 2 secondary schools in Wan Chai District and Central and Western District, and a kindergarten on Lamma Island, and hence appealed to the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene.

The 1st case involved a secondary school in Wan Chai District affecting 19 male students and a staff member. The affected students, aged from 11 to 17, have developed fever, rash, and vesicles on their hands or feet, as well as oral ulcers, since [23 Oct 2015]. All of them sought medical attention while 1 student required hospitalisation and has been discharged. The nasopharyngeal swab of the hospitalised student tested positive for enterovirus (EV) by the hospital.

The 2nd case involved a secondary school in Central and Western District affecting 25 male students. The affected students, aged from 14 to 17, have developed similar symptoms since [31 Oct 2015]. All of them sought medical attention but did not require hospitalisation.

The 3rd case involved a kindergarten on Lamma Island affecting 23 pupils. The affected pupils, 10 boys and 13 girls aged from 3 to 5, have developed similar symptoms since [4 Nov 2015]. All of them sought medical attention but did not require hospitalisation.

All of the affected persons are now in a stable condition.

Officers of the CHP have conducted site visits and advised the staff of the schools on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The schools have been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.

"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs such as coxsackievirus and EV-71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet," a spokesman for the CHP said.

To prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures: maintain good air circulation; wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials; keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing; cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly; clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding one part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water; children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted; avoid going to overcrowded places; and parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.

The public may visit the CHP's page on HFMD and EV-71 infection (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/16354.html) for more information.
