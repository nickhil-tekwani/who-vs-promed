NEW DELHI (July 12) XINHUA - A 10-year-old girl died of cholera in a New
Delhi hospital Friday night, triggering fears of an outbreak of the malady
in the Indian capital, the Hindustan Times daily said Sunday. Four other
children of the same family in west Delhi, who were being treated at the
hospital, were in a critical condition, the newspaper said.
Cholera cases have also been reported from the eastern and western parts of
the city and patients were admitted to an infectious diseases hospital. A
municipal health officer asked doctors concerned to immediately inform the
civic authorities of such cases, but he said the situation was under
control. He advised the residents to boil water for at least 15 minutes and
use chlorine tablets to purify it, and wash hands properly before and after
a meal.
Some angry residents said cholera had spread due to contaminated water
being supplied by the tankers. A resident in a west colony said though the
colony was set up two years ago, it was still not getting normal tap water.
He complained that the water from tankers was highly contaminated and
generally yellow in color, adding that even these tankers did not come
regularly.
