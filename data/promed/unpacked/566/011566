Biotechnology company, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, announced recently that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved EbangaTM for the treatment of Ebola.

Ebanga is now approved for treatment of infection caused by _Zaire ebolavirus_ in adult and pediatric patients (including neonates born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for _Zaire ebolavirus_ infection).

Ebanga is the only FDA approved, single injection Ebola treatment which is available in a lyophilized form.

Ebanga (ansuvimab-zykl, formerly referred to as mAb114) is a monoclonal antibody isolated from a human survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, a city in the DRC.

Wendy Holman, CEO and co-founder of Ridgeback, said: "I speak on behalf of the entire Ridgeback Bio team when I say thank you to all of the dedicated and thoughtful groups who helped contribute to this historic and important product approval. Ridgeback is grateful to NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) Institut National pour la Recherche Biomedicale (INRB). Specifically, the brilliance of 3 individuals needs to be acknowledged -- Dr. Nancy Sullivan (VRC), Dr. John Mascola (VRC) and Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum (INRB).

"It was their mission to create a lyophilized single-use Ebola treatment, and in partnership with the team at Ridgeback, that vision became a reality. We would also like to thank FDA leadership and the Ebanga review team at FDA's Division of Antivirals (DAV) for their focused and thorough review of this product. Finally, the true heroes are the patients and their families who allowed themselves to be carried away from their homes - not knowing if they would ever return - in order to enroll in a randomized controlled trial at the Ebola treatment centers during the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in the DRC. Your trust and belief in science, innovation and the people caring for you has transformed Ebola forever. Thanks to you, Ebola is now a treatable disease."

[Availability of an effective antiviral in addition to the recently approved vaccine is a truly significant event in the history of Ebola. It is particularly notable that Ebanga (mAb114) can be used to treat not only adults but also children and even neonates born to infected mothers. The research team, doctors, health care workers and everyone involved are to be commended.

"MAb114 [Ebanga] was derived from memory B cells from a survivor of the Kikwit EVD epidemic that were obtained 11 years after clinical infection (5,6). MAb114 binds to a region of conserved amino acids on the receptor-binding domain of the _Z. ebolavirus_ glycoprotein and remains bound both in physiologic pH and in low intracellular pH environments, and it averts the glycoprotein from engaging the host cell receptor protein (Niemann-Pick intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 protein [NPC1]) in late endosomes. Targeting of the receptor-binding domain reduces the risk of escape mutants (because the mutants would be less fit), and the neutralizing activity of the monoclonal antibody is high.

"In a trial [PALM (Pamoja Tulinde Maisha)], Mab114 was compared with REGN-EB3. The 3 monoclonal antibodies that REGN-EB3 contains (REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479) were obtained by immunizing VelocImmune mice (mice that encode human antibody variable gene segments that generate fully human antibodies) (3,4). The 3 antibodies in REGN-EB3 bind to distinct nonoverlapping epitopes on the glycoprotein, which potentially increases efficacy and minimizes the occurrence of escape mutants (4).

"The efficacy of these 2 agents in reducing the case fatality rate was greater among patients who sought treatment early after symptom onset, who had low viral loads, and who had lower baseline creatinine or alanine aminotransferase levels -- that is, these products were more effective in patients who were less severely ill and who were ill for shorter durations. Social engagement with the community can encourage patients to seek care early. But early care of patients also requires the availability of rapid diagnostics and ease of travel to treatment centers (7). These issues must be addressed in future Ebola outbreaks to enhance the therapeutic effect of the monoclonal antibody products"...more
