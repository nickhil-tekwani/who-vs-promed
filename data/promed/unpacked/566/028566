Mystery fever claims a life
---------------------------
[Gujarat] State health authorities have called a team from the
National Institute of Virology (NIV) to investigate the mystery fever
that has claimed one life and left 2 people critical in different
city hospitals. Doctors have not been able to pin-point the origin or
the spread of the fever which is reported to begin with fever,
stomach pain and vomiting, and rapidly deteriorate later.

The 1st case of the mystery fever was reported with the death of a
30-year-old woman from Sanand, who was admitted to Shalby Hospital
[in Ahmedabad] on 29 Dec 2010 with high fever, abdominal pain, and
severe vomiting. Despite all the medication administered, her
condition continued to worsen, her blood count crashed with platelets
dipping to alarming levels. She eventually suffered internal
hemorrhaging and succumbed to systemic organ failure. The woman did
not test positive for dengue fever, the severe form of which [dengue
haemorrhagic fever] has similar symptoms.

While the death of a young woman to fever caused concern, what set
the alarm bells ringing was 2 people who had come in [contact] with
the deceased also falling ill with similar symptoms. A young nurse at
Shalby Hospital, who attended to the 1st patient in the Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) is currently critical with the same symptoms. The
deceased woman's husband has also been admitted to Sterling Hospital.

"The nurse is critical and may have to be put on a ventilator,"
doctors said. They said that 2 people who were in close contact with
the deceased woman getting the fever shows that it is contagious.
Since test reports have not been positive for bacterial infection,
dengue, or other known infections [?], it is important to know
exactly what we are dealing with and also its spread, whether it is
through air, by mosquito, or other means.

Taking note that fever rapidly deteriorates the health of the
patient, NIV teams will collect samples and conduct other inquiries
to ascertain the kind of fever, its spread, and precautions needed to
prevent its spread and protocol needed for better management.

[The signs and symptoms of the deceased patient's illness are
compatible with those of a haemorrhgic fever. The results of
diagnostic tests are not disclosed, other than that dengue fever has
been excluded. Of other haemorrhagic fevers, Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a possibility (although there have been
no previous reports in ProMED-mail of CCHF in India). When patients
with CCHF are admitted to hospital, there is a risk of nosocomial
spread of infection (as has occurred in this case) and in the past,
serious outbreaks have occurred in this way. According to the WHO
fact sheet
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html>)
patients with fatal disease do not usually develop a measurable
antibody response and in these individuals, as well as in patients in
the 1st few days of illness, diagnosis is achieved by virus detection
in blood or tissue samples. This may explain the difficulty in making
a positive diagnosis in this case. However, although CCHF is a
contagious disease, it is primarily a zoonosis transmitted by
_Hyalomma_ species ticks . Humans who become infected with CCHF
usually acquire the virus from direct contact with blood or other
infected tissues from livestock during this time, or rarely they may
become infected from a tick bite. The majority of cases have occurred
in those involved with the livestock industry, such as agricultural
workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. The circumstances
and occupation of the diseased woman would be a relevant factor in
the diagnosis.

The outcome of the investigation being undertaken by the Indian
National Institute of Virology is awaited with interest.
