Another person has died after contracting _Clostridium difficile_ at
a Quebec hospital where an outbreak of the bacterium was spread in
part by a "significant breach" in basic hygiene, the province's
health minister said Tue, 7 Nov 2006. That brings the death toll to
11 since the outbreak took hold at the Honore-Mercier Hospital in
Saint-Hyacinthe in July 2006.
The bacterium, which thrives in the human gut, overwhelmed more than
a dozen elderly patients, many of whom were on antibiotics. Hospital
officials insist the latest victim to die from the outbreak was
infected before the institution implemented measures to decontaminate
its wards and equipment.
Radio-Canada reported Mon, 6 Nov 2006, night that, according to an
internal report prepared for administrators at Honore-Mercier
Hospital, substandard hygiene practices were in place at the hospital
during the outbreak, including:
- bed sharing: 3 patients who died from the infection used the same
room and the same bed [Not at the same time -- it implies inadequate
decontamination after use. - Mod.LL];
- washroom disinfection: 5 washrooms used by patients and emergency
room visitors were cleaned once a day, despite provincial standards
that require disinfection every hour when _C. difficile_ is detected
in a hospital; and
- sharing supplies: Some medical supplies were shared among infected
patients without disinfection between uses.
The hospital says the outbreak is under control, but a team from the
regional health authority will continue to work on site until the
province is satisfied that proper hygiene standards have been restored.
Despite the outbreak, _C. difficile_ has been contained and
controlled across Quebec, with infection rates declining by 40 per
cent since 2004.
Quebec Health Minister Philippe Couillard admitted there were major
breaches in basic hygiene practices at the hospital before 19 Oct
2006, when administrators launched their massive disinfection campaign.

[The environmental form of _C. difficile_ is a spore which is highly
stable. Aggressive control of _C. difficile_ requires not only
environmental controls like those above -- as well as aggressive
hand-washing between patient contacts by staff -- but also rational
use of antimicrobials.
ProMED thanks Pablo Nart for this posting. Brent Barrett also
contributed a similar story. - Mod.LL]
