The literature does not support the low risk of human infection with VSV.
Reif et al. documented the seroconversion of 17 of 133 people with
occupational exposure to VSV-infected animals during the 1982 epidemic in
the Western US (1) and Patterson et al. documented seroconversion in 26 of
37 people during a 2 week period in which they worked with VSV-infected
animals in confinement housing (2). The Patterson study is particularly
compelling because the victims were "protected" with rubber clothing except
for their faces. Patterson et al. also made the point that virtually all
laboratory workers and animal handlers exposed to VSV became infected (2),
although this was prior to the use of modern biological safety procedures
and equipment. It is not clear that VSV infection in man is always
symptomatic, but the description in the literature (3) suggests it often
provides a three day reminder of why we study viruses.
