China (Hong Kong SAR): School Children Contract Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease
--------------------------------------------------
At least 3 students at a Hong Kong secondary school have contracted hand,
foot and mouth disease, a health department spokesman said on Friday 14 Nov
2003. A Department of Health spokesman said the pupils at the Saint Louis
Secondary School had become infected last week and were now recovering at
home. All 3 were in stable condition.
He added the disease, a viral infection of the skin, which causes small
ulcers on the hands, feet and mouth, was relatively common in Hong Kong,
particularly among young children. A particularly virulent [form] of the
disease hit Taiwan in 1988 leading to the deaths of 64 children.
