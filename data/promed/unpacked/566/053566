Residents in Magwe division's Pokokku are taking [?] random
medication to prevent meningitis after a young local died 2 weeks ago
from the disease. A monk in Pakokku, in central Burma [Myanmar], told
DVB that local residents are growing increasingly nervous following
the man's death. "People are now taking these pills which they
thought could prevent the meningitis," said the monk. "They said you
can't have the condition after taking the medicine once and have been
giving each other advice to take it."

A doctor in central Burma [Myanmar] said meningitis was a common
medical condition in the region during the hot summer season when the
dust level in the air becomes dense. He said the condition is caused
by infection in respiratory system, which can lead to inflammation of
the protective membranes covering the brain, possibly leading to
death. "The best thing to [do] when it starts showing symptoms is to
rush to a nearest hospital," said the doctor. "At times like this,
people should avoid hanging around in crowded places and also should
take care of their personal hygiene."

[Although not specified in the news report, the cause of the outbreak
of meningitis in central Myanmar is presumably _N. meningitidis_.
ProMED-mail has recently reported on an outbreak of meningococcal
meningitis in Northeastern India and Bangladesh, an area that borders
western Myanmar. Serogroup A has been identified as the cause of
meningococcal disease in Northeastern India (see ProMED-mail post
Meningitis, meningococcal - India (05): (NE, DL) 20090217.0667).
Perhaps the outbreak in Myanmar is an extension of the outbreak of
meningococcal disease in India and Bangladesh.

Magwe (or Magway) Division, the largest of Myanmar's 7 divisions, is
located in central Myanmar. The capital is the city of Magwe. Pokokku
is one of the other major towns.
