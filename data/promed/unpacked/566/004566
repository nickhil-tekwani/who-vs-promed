_Salmonella_ Typhi have emerged with high-level resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime but remain sensitive to carbapenems and azithromycin. They have now spread beyond Hyderabad due to population exchange.

This outbreak may well be caused by _S._ Typhi, H58, defined based on single nucleotide polymorphisms frequently referred to as SNPs (pronounced "snips"), which has been accounting for a significant amount of morbidity and mortality, which may be based on its increasingly antimicrobial resistance. ProMED would appreciate more information regarding the outbreak strain and its antimicrobial sensitivity pattern(s).

The following is abstracted from the introduction of the article, Wong VK, Baker S, Pickard DJ, et al: Phylogeographical analysis of the dominant multidrug-resistant H58 clade of _Salmonella_ Typhi identifies inter - and intracontinental transmission events. Nature Genetics. 2015;47:632-639 with the citations removed:

"_S._ Typhi, the primary global cause of human typhoid (enteric fever), is a monophyletic serovar of _S. enterica_. Unlike many Salmonella, _S. Typhi_ are highly restricted to infection of humans and are associated with systemic infection, prolonged fever and an asymptomatic carrier state. Typhoid is still a common disease in many regions of the world with poor infrastructure and limited economic development and is also a risk for travelers who visit such regions. It is estimated that 20-30 million cases of typhoid occur annually, although deaths are less frequently reported than before the availability of effective antimicrobials.

In addition to improvements in access to clean water and sanitation, typhoid can potentially be controlled by other interventions such as vaccination and antimicrobial therapy. Chloramphenicol, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were traditional 1st-line drugs commonly used to treat acute typhoid, and these agents continue to be used in areas of the world where _S._ Typhi are deemed susceptible. However, since the 1970s, _S._ Typhi have emerged that display multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to the above antimicrobials, compromising treatment. Since the 1990s, alternative treatment options have included fluoroquinolones, 3rd-generation cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone) and the azalide azithromycin. The early emergence of MDR _S._ Typhi was driven in large part by the acquisition of IncHI1 plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes and, more recently, by chromosomal mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones, and MDR strains have been reported across Asia and Africa.

Phylogenetic analysis, initially based on subgenomic DNA sequences but later on whole-genome DNA sequences, showed that the global _S._ Typhi population is highly clonal and likely originated from a common ancestor that moved into the human population several thousand years ago. It also indicated that the population is relatively small and that recombination between _S._ Typhi and other salmonellae is rare. Simple SNP-based typing schemes have been developed that stratify the _S._ Typhi population into haplotypes, and these schemes are now used to unequivocally map new isolates to the phylogeny. Notably, this approach identified a single emerging, highly clonal MDR haplotype of _S._ Typhi, H58, which is being reported with increasing frequency from many countries in Africa and Asia. Within the H58 lineage, IncHI1 MDR plasmids of the restricted subtype PST6 and chromosomal point mutations conferring quinolone resistance are common."
