Wolverine Packing Company, a Detroit, Michigan establishment, is recalling about 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today [19 May 2014]. The ground beef products were produced between 31 Mar and 18 Apr 2014. For a full list of products that were recalled, please see the attached document.

The products subject to recall bear the establishment number "EST. 2574B" and will have a production date code in the format "Packing Nos: MM DD 14" between "03 31 14" and "04 18 14." These products were shipped to distributors for restaurant use in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio. There was no distribution of the products to the Department of Defense, the National School Lunch Program, or catalog/internet sales.

Factors that can contribute to the size of the recall include potential contamination of additional products due to a lack of microbiological independence between lot production as well as a deficiency in supportive record-keeping by distributors.

FSIS was notified of _E. coli_ O157:H7 illnesses on 12 May 2014. Working in conjunction with public health partners from the CDC, FSIS determined that there is a link between the ground beef products from Wolverine Packing Company and this illness cluster. Based on epidemiological and traceback investigations, 11 case-patients have been identified in 4 states with illness onset dates ranging from 22 Apr 2014 to 2 May 2014. FSIS continues to work with our state and federal public health partners on this investigation and provide updated information as it becomes available.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list will be posted on the FSIS website at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 F [71 C]. The only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

[The source of the hamburger-related cases in Michigan and Ohio appears to be this product, but those in Kansas also reported may not be. Four states are mentioned in the distribution, the others being Missouri and Massachusetts. It is not yet clear whether the outbreak strain has been isolated from the ground beef. As noted in the posting, adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen (restaurant) hygiene can prevent such cases even with contaminated meat. - Mod.LL
