A total of 11 people fell seriously ill in south east Brazil after eating a deadly puffer fish for lunch, reports say. The group of neighbors, including 4 children, were hospitalized after they made a mistake while preparing the fish -- one of the deadliest in the world. Within minutes all had become violently sick, according to Brazil's RJ TV news. Five have since left the hospital.

Puffer fish are highly venomous and contain a toxin which can trigger severe paralysis.

The neighbors met for lunch on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014] in Duque de Caxias [Rio de Janeiro state], a city on the south east coast of Brazil. Quoting a hospital doctor, RJ TV news reported that the group were eating at one of their homes and had known they were being served a puffer fish.

The creature, which contains a toxin more lethal than cyanide, must be expertly prepared to avoid poisoning. The doctor said one of the neighbors claimed to know how to cook it, but made a mistake in the preparation.

Those affected included 5 members of 2 separate families. One family had 3 children among those poisoned. Six others were hospitalized, including a child of unreported age.

Five of the neighbors were discharged from hospital on Friday [24 Oct 2014], according to the news channel. Three are in intensive care and one of the children remains in a serious condition. Another adult and one of the children are reportedly in a stable condition.

Puffer fish facts:
- There are 120 species of puffer fish worldwide
- Almost all puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin, a substance 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide
- In Japan, the flesh of some puffer fish is considered a delicacy and can only be served by licensed chefs
- It is believed that poisonous puffer fish synthesise their toxin from bacteria they eat
- Some predators, such as sea snakes and tiger sharks, are unaffected by puffer fish poison
- Scientists believe the puffer fish's unwieldy swimming style led to it evolving its signature "inflatability"

[Tetrodotoxin, a very potent toxin, selectively blocks the voltage-sensitive sodium channels of excitable tissues and neuronal transmission in skeletal muscles. In humans, paresthesias begin 10-45 minutes after ingestion, usually as tingling of the tongue and inner surface of the mouth. Other common symptoms include vomiting, lightheadedness, dizziness, feelings of doom, and weakness. Paralysis spreads, and death can occur within 6-24 hours, often due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration. Other signs include salivation, muscle twitching, diaphoresis [excessive sweating], pleuritic chest pain, dysphagia [difficulty in swallowing], aphonia [loss of the voice], and convulsions. Severe poisoning is indicated by hypotension, bradycardia [slow heartbeat], depressed corneal reflexes, and fixed dilated pupils. There is no specific antidote, and treatment is often supportive.

The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually occurs within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours.

There are a number of different species of puffer fish or blowfish, each of which produces a different concentration of the toxin.

Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order Tetraodontiformes is one of the most violent intoxications from marine species. The gonads, liver, intestines, and skin of puffer fish can contain levels of tetrodotoxin sufficient to produce rapid and violent death. But the flesh of many puffer fish may not usually be dangerously toxic.

Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the genus _Atelopus_, the blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and xanthid crabs. The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent reports of the production of tetrodotoxin and anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including strains of the family _Vibrionaceae_, _Pseudomonas_ sp., and _Photobacterium phosphoreum_, point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins. These are relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with marine animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some significance in toxicoses that have been more directly related to these bacterial species.
