Hundreds in E. Nusa Tenggara treated for rabies
-----------------------------------------------
At least 242 residents of Sikka, East Nusa Tenggara, are undergoing
intensive care in health centers after becoming infected with the
rabies virus, local authorities say. The residents were bitten by
rabid animals between January and February [2011], Sikka Health Agency
chief Delly Pasande said Friday [4 Mar 2011], as quoted by
.

"The number of people bitten by rabid dogs is in the hundreds," he
said. Delly said the large number of rabies patients was a result of
insufficient preventive measures on the part of the local Husbandry
Agency. "The problem lies in husbandry. The health [field] is only the
after effect. The most important thing is for preventive measures to
be taken by the husbandry agency," he said.

The region is also lacking rabies vaccines. Currently there are 169
ampules of vaccine, but this could only last the region until
mid-March. The chosen strategy would be selective extermination and
vaccination of rabid dogs. "Vaccines for humans are very expensive,
while the ones for dogs are much cheaper," Delly said.

[The nature of the intensive care offered the 242 rabies victims is
not stated. Hopefully this includes post-exposure vaccination
otherwise the prospects for the patients are grim. There appears to be
an unfortunate lack of coordination between the medical and the
veterinary authorities in the province.

East Nusa Tenggara is a province of Indonesia, located in the eastern
portion of the Lesser Sunda Islands, including West Timor. The
provincial capital is Kupang, located on West Timor. The province
consists of about 550 islands, but is dominated by the 3 main islands
of Flores, Sumba, and West Timor, the western half of the island of
Timor. A map of the Indonesia island of East Nusa Tenggara can be
