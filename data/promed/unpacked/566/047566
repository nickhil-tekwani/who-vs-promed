Despite almost 3 years spent by Dutch scientists to eradicate brown rot
disease, 7 cases have been found -- 3 in seed and 4 in potato crops. The
disease was found in the Netherlands for the first time in 1995, when there
were 94 cases. Last year there were 9 cases. It was hoped that there
would be none this year, the third year of screening 1400 samples of
potatoes daily. Until there are no cases found, the screening must
continue to make sure that no diseased seed potatoes find their way into
either domestic or international trade.
Scottish Crop Institute scientists Toth, Wood and Duncan said that the
disease "has produced crop losses of up to 50% in Burundi and 75% in the
USA (Florida).
