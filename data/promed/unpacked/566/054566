[Dr Robert Perry contacted Dr Abraham Oumar,
Public Health specialist, Tropical and Infectious
Diseases specialist, chief of the Epidemiological
Surveillance Division (MSPHP/DPM), Ministry of
Public Health, Dakar-Fann, Senegal
<docteur.ioba@yahoo.fr>, who kindly replied (in
French) with the following message in response to
the ProMED-mail post of 3 Oct 2009 (archive no.
20091005.3462), requesting further information. - Mod.TY]

There are no new cases of dengue or chikungunya
in Kedougou. The medical region held a
coordination meeting and invited journalists. The
spokesperson of the Institute Pasteur talked
about cases in 2008. This was happening there one
year ago and had a multidisciplinary
investigation, even with participation from the
Presidency of the Republic of Senegal. The
reports written about that period are available in the archives.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr Perry for making
the contact and providing the critical
information from Dr Oumar that chikungunya virus
was being transmitted in Senegal in 2008, but not now.
