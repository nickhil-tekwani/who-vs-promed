Cases of respiratory syncytial virus have increased by 900 percent so far this winter season [2017-18] in Mexico. According to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER), they have treated 100 people to date this season, whereas during the entire year last year [2016] they reported only 10 cases. The respiratory syncytial virus is the causative factor of diseases such as pneumonia

The INER indicated that they do not have accurate and precise statistics at the national level, but they have noted that this virus and _Pneumococcus_ [bacteria] are the most frequent causes of respiratory diseases during the winter season.

Among the symptoms seen are those similar to those of a common cold, such as fever, joint and muscle pain, as well as cough, difficulty breathing, and whistling when breathing [wheezing]. These symptoms can occur both in children and adults, so the absence of treatment can trigger serious problems, such as bronchitis or more severe respiratory symptoms that can even lead to death. The respiratory syncytial virus can be easily transmitted from one person to another, by direct contact [including shaking hands] or by touching infected objects [such as door-knobs, etc.]

Hence, one should avoid crowds, being near smokers or smoking. If you are suffering any disease, you should cover your mouth. In the case of young children, they can contract it through contact with toys or surfaces that have been infected with the virus. The INER recommends washing hands frequently and not sharing eating utensils, so the spread of the virus can be prevented.

During the current winter season no deaths have been reported. At the moment there is no vaccine against this virus; there is only one treatment available that relies on passive immunization, through administration of a monoclonal antibody. During the winter season there is a 20 percent increase in the number of patients seen by INER for respiratory issues. Hence, the Institute is calling for the population, especially children less than 5 years of age to be protected.

[The report above does not specify the age groups that are effected; RSV associated illness is generally self limiting, but the virus is associated with serious outcomes, especially in infants and older adults. In fact, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. It is also a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html).

Despite the recognized importance of RSV as a cause of respiratory illness, the information regarding the epidemiology of this virus in Latin America, particularly among adults, is limited.

In a cohort study at 5 hospitals in Mexico City and one in San Luis Potos√≠ from 2010-14, conducted by the Mexican Emerging Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network (La Red), out of final sample size of 5629 subjects there were 570 (10.7 percent) cases with RSV infection.

The study also reported a distinct seasonality with increased number of cases in fall and winter months (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5155644/). The study also reported nearly 5 percent cases with RSV infections were adults, highlighting the importance of this pathogen in adult respiratory illness.

It is important to understand that there is a considerable overlap in the influenza and RSV seasons, and the interest in RSV etiology for pneumonias, particularly in adults, is fairly recent. Further studies can help evaluate the individual and cumulative impact of these 2 pathogens and guide appropriate planning and vaccination policies once an RSV vaccine also becomes available. - Mod.UBA
