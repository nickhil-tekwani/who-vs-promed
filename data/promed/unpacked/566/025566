At the request of the moderator, I take this opportunity to place in context
the recently cited reference to ensuing mandatory identification in Canadian
cattle.
>From the 1950's through the early 1980's, up to 95% of Canadian cattle
retained nationally traceable, unique identification applied in the course
of federal brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaigns. The
identification was mandatory, as an inherent part of these obligatory
programs. With the eradication of bovine brucellosis in 1985 and the
near-eradication of bovine tuberculosis, the contributing farm to farm
testing decreased considerably.
Animal identification worldwide is driven by need. The Canadian cattle
industry of the 1980's, seeing no need to identify nationally a population
virtually cleared of these two historic disease threats, reverted to
identification methods that satisfied the husbandry requirements of
individual producers.
In the 1990's, the advent of BSE and a new world trading order have
reawakened producers to the advantages inherent in nationally orchestrated
identification. During the last few years, in collaboration with the federal
veterinary service, several sectors have independently researched, funded
and promoted renewed universal identification on their own terms.
On Friday, May 1 in a meeting with the federal veterinary service, they
agreed to work collaboratively on a singular national identification
initiative whose minimal, phased standards will reflect a consensus
negotiated among the members. The federal veterinary service will audit and
accredit the organization created. The national initiative qualifies for
nominal developmental assistance from the federal government on a
cost-sharing basis.
Although the federal veterinary service is empowered, pursuant to the Health
of Animals Act, to impose a mandatory identification program, it awaits the
achievement of consensus among these cattle industry sectors before
proceeding. The previous posting's reference to the timing of mandatory
provisions reflects this developmental process.
To date, industry has examined and rejected electronic identification on the
basis of cost and lack of reliability. Experience to date suggests that the
national tag, in a choice of metal or plastic, will bear visually readable
characters for field use accompanied by bar coding for automated
applications in abattoirs or other points of assembly that are brought into
the system.
In a phased approach, an electronic database will initially register tag
distribution to facilitate epidemiological investigation in the face of
disease or food safety investigations. It will incorporate the facility to
capture individual animal movements if future market conditions and disease
control applications demand.
While sundry applications related to production, genetics and marketing may
flow from industry's initiative, the re identification of the national cattle
herd is predicated on animal health and food safety.
