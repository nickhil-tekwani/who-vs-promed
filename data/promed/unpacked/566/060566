The United States Agriculture Department (USDA) said Wednesday it was
banning pork imports from Britain's East Anglia due to an outbreak of
classical swine fever (CSF) discovered in the region last month.
"The importation of swine from East Anglia will be prohibited," said Albert
Torres, deputy administrator for USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Services(APHIS). The USDA had placed a temporary ban on all pig imports
from England in August after the highly contagious disease was discovered
in Norfolk in eastern England.
"CSF is a dangerous and destructive communicable disease of swine,"
Torres said in a printed statement. "The mission of our agency is to
protect American agriculture, and that is what we are doing." British
authorities appeared to have the outbreak "well controlled," he added.
Although not harmful to humans, CSF can spread rapidly through a region
destroying vulnerable pig farms.
Some 25 000 British pigs have been destroyed since the first 5 cases were
discovered between 8 Aug and 12 Aug 2000.
The outbreak is a blow to Britain's livestock industry, which is still
recovering from a devastating outbreak of mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy) several years ago.
Because Britain is not a major pork exporter to the American market, the US
ban will not have a big impact on supplies, US officials said. Pork from
Britain accounted for less than 1 percent of last year's total US pork
imports and was valued at about $11.4 million, the USDA said.
