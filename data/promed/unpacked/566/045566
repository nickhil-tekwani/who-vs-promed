_Plasmodium falciparum_ cases from the Gambia imported to Europe
----------------------------------------------------------------
TropNetEurop, the European Network on Imported Infectious Diseases
Surveillance (<http://www.tropnet.eu>), reports clusters of
falciparum malaria imported from the Gambia in Denmark and in Finland.

Denmark
-------
Within the last couple of weeks we have seen at least 7 cases of
falciparum malaria from the Gambia imported to Denmark: 2 cases
admitted at Hvidovre Hospital (Copenhagen), 3 cases at Rigshospitalet
(Copenhagen), and 2 cases at Aarhus University hospital, Skejby.

The latest case is a 50-year-old woman, traveling with a friend, who
was admitted on [21 Nov 2008]. They had been in Gambia in the period
[30 Oct-8 Nov 2008], but [she] did not seek travel advice, has not
been taking any malaria prophylaxis, and was not vaccinated against
yellow fever or hepatitis A.

Onset of symptoms was on [13 Nov 2008]. She had 2.2 percent
parasitemia and cerebral symptoms when she arrived. Unfortunately,
the woman she was traveling with was found dead in the home the same
day [13 Nov 2008]. We are awaiting the result of the autopsy. Some
common features of these cases are that they bought a cheap travel
[package] shortly before departure and did not seek pre-travel advice.

Finland
-------
We have had an initial cluster of 8 cases of falciparum malaria from
Gambia imported to Finland within 2 weeks since [3 Nov 2008].
Patients are from different parts of Finland, most of them did not
take any malaria prophylaxis, and 3 of them were prescribed
chloroquine.

At least 2 of them have needed treatment in intensive care but they
are all recovering. A week ago the National Public Health Institute
issued a press release about the outbreak and there was nationwide
media coverage, which seems to have reached the public well.

There is only one travel agency making trips to Gambia and they
stopped immediately selling last-minute trips. The National Public
Health institute has interviewed all the patients but we do not have
the analysis of the cases yet.

On [25 Nov 2008], we had 3 additional falciparum malaria cases from
Gambia in Finland, which makes the total of cases 11 since [3 Nov
2008].

The National Public Health Institute has interviewed all the cases.
They are all Finnish travelers from different parts of the country on
a package tour by the same travel agency since [16 Oct 2008], which
was the 1st trip of the season (trips of 1-2 weeks). 5 of them had
a fast departure within 5 days from purchasing the trip; 8 of them
said that they had received information about malaria risk; 8 of them
did not use any malaria prophylaxis; one was prescribed prophylaxis
but did not take it because was afraid of possible side effects; one
was prescribed chloroquine; and 2 chose to use chloroquine they had
stored from a previous trip against professional advice.

Reports on further patients in Europe are pending.

[_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria is endemic in the Gambia, but the
peak transmission season is usually from early May to late September.
However, malaria prophylaxis is recommended throughout the year for
visitors. The attack rate seems unusually high even though most of the
travelers did not take chemoprophylaxis. Any information on malaria in
the indigenous population, especially children, would be welcome.

Most of the travelers had not received firm and clear pre-travel
advice on malaria prophylaxis, malaria risk, or the need to contact a
physician after return if not feeling well. Neither were most of the
patients immunized against yellow fever, also endemic there -- see
ProMED archive Yellow fever, imported - Belgium ex Gambia (03)
20011115.2814.

The cluster of imported cases shows that the travel industry must take
responsibility for providing sound and thorough information to
travelers to areas with high risk of malaria and other diseases not
found in their country of origin, or at least emphasizing the need for
qualified pre-travel advice for such destinations. - Mod.EP/JW]
