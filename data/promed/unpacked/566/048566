Total / 640

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Jun 2020, to 23 Jul 2020. Ill people range in age from less than 1-102 years, with a median age of 39. 54 percent of ill people are female. Of 343 ill people with information available, 85 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of 48 isolates from ill people did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is underway.

Whole genome sequencing analysis shows that an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport infections in Canada is related genetically to this outbreak in the USA. This means that people in both of these outbreaks are likely to share a common source of infection.

On 10 Jul 2020, CDC's PulseNet identified an outbreak of 13 _Salmonella_ Newport infections in 3 states. Since being identified, the outbreak has rapidly grown to a total of 640 infections in 43 states.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before their illness started.

Many ill people were identified as part of illness clusters. An illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store in the week before becoming ill. Investigating illness clusters can provide critical clues about the source of an outbreak. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there.

25 illness clusters have been identified in 9 states. Information from these clusters shows that many ill people ate red onions. The traceback information collected from these illness clusters identified Thomson International, Inc., of Bakersfield, California as a likely source of red onions. Due to the way onions are grown and harvested, other onion types, such as, white, yellow, or sweet yellow, may also be contaminated. Additional traceback is ongoing to determine whether other onions are linked to the outbreak.

Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is investigating an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport infections in Canada that is related by whole genome sequencing to the U.S. outbreak. On 30 Jul 2020, PHAC's outbreak investigation identified U.S. red onions as a likely source of its outbreak.

On 1 Aug 2020, Thomson International, Inc., voluntarily recalled red, yellow, white, and sweet yellow onions because they may be contaminated with _Salmonella_. On 1 Aug 2020, Giant Eagle recalled onions and foods made with recalled onions sold in stores across Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, and Maryland. On 1 Aug 2020, Publix recalled onions sold in bulk at stores in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.

On 5 Aug 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) issued a public health alert for products made with recalled onions.

On 6 Aug 2020, Taylor Farms issued a recall of foods that were made from recalled onions.

Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, serve, or sell recalled onions from Thomson International, Inc., of Bakersfield, California or other foods made with recalled onions.

CDC will provide updates when more information is available.
