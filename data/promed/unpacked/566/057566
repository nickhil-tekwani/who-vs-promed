"An outbreak of dengue fever in Mandera, northeastern Kenya, is
spreading fast, with at least 5000 people infected within weeks, due
to limited health facilities, a shortage of medical personnel and poor
sanitation, officials told IRIN [UN Integrated Regional Information
Networks]." The news service writes, "A statement by the Ministry of
Public Health and Sanitation on 26 Sep [2011] said 4 deaths from the
disease had been confirmed but, according to Mandera residents, at
least 10 people have died since early September when the outbreak
started."

"With only one public hospital and a few private clinics, medical
officials in the town -- which borders Ethiopia and Somalia -- said
the facilities were congested with dengue fever patients and they were
unable to cope," IRIN notes. Mohamed Sheikh, the provincial public
health and medical officer, told IRIN, "In the absence of a specific
treatment for dengue fever ... health facilities were providing
supportive treatment to the infected," including Paracetamol for
fever, fluids for dehydration and antibiotics for infections.
According to the UN News Centre, the WHO has provided essential drugs
to help treat the outbreak.

[ProMED-mail receives few reports of dengue outbreaks in Africa,
making this one of particular interest. This situation is a concern
because of the influx of refugees into this general area due to an
acute drought. There is a significant possibility that the outbreak
will become still worse without prompt reduction of _Aedes aegypti_
breeding sites in the area. This may prove to be very difficult.

- El Salvador (San Miguel department). 30 Sep 2011. Although the
reported cases this year [2011] are 50 percent less than last year, 2
things are unusual for dengue disease: it is more severe and the cases
of DHF have increased. DHF has caused 5 deaths, all females between
the ages of zero [less than one year] and 7 years. The weekly number
of new cases has remained 200, but most recently the statistics
surpassed this and for this week there are 366 new cases. The
seriousness of the cases is due to the circulation of the 4 dengue
[virus] serotypes (1, 2, 3, and 4), and especially [virus] serotype 2,
which causes DHF and has flared up most in the country.
