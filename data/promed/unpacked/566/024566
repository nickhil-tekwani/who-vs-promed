Japan: Hepatitis B Virus Contamination in 37 Units of Donated Blood
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Among 6400 units of blood for transfusion the government ordered the Japan
Red Cross Society to test, 37 were found to be contaminated with hepatitis
B virus (HBV), sources said on Sat 13 Sep 2003. According to the sources,
the 37 blood units probably have been used. The Health, Labor and Welfare
Ministry told the society to immediately test for HBV those who received
the contaminated blood. The Ministry said blood products made from the
HBV-tainted blood went through a virus inactivation process, and there was
"a very small chance of infection" among those who received the products.
The ministry will decide whether to recall the products after experts
evaluate the risks.
The ministry has ordered the Society to investigate about 6400 units of
blood that may have been contaminated with hepatitis or other viruses and
as shipped for use in transfusions during the past 13 months. In response,
he society has so far tested 293 units of blood for HBV. Further cases of
contamination may yet be found in future tests, the Ministry said.
According to the Ministry, there have been no reports of people becoming
infected with HBV after receiving the contaminated blood. No blood has
been reported to be contaminated with hepatitis C virus or human
immunodeficiency virus.

Japan: Patient Contracted Hepatitis B Virus from Blood Donation in 2001
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A man in his 50s became infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) after he
received tainted blood that had cleared a screening test, it was learned on
Sat 13 Sep 2003. The Ministry ordered the Red Cross Society and Nihon
Pharmaceutical Co. to recall 56 000 units of blood products made from blood
of the donor concerned. According to the Society, the infected man
received the red blood cells of four donors in February 2001 after
bleeding due to an alimentary disease. He tested positive for HBV in June.
The Society was informed of the infection in August [2001]. It checked the
reserved blood samples of the four donors and found one of them contained
HBV. The virus was not detected in earlier tests. The society and Nihon
Pharmaceutical had used the contaminated blood to manufacture blood products.
The Society reported the case to the ministry on Fri [12 Sep 2003?}. The
ministry ordered the society to recall sold products, suspend shipments and
test those who received the products for HBV. Up to 56 000 products must be
recalled as the products are mass-produced from a number of donors' blood .
These products are in addition to the 6400 blood units the Society is
testing in its ongoing investigation. In July, the society said 6419 blood
units that may have been contaminated with viruses were supplied to medical
institutions nationwide in the 13 months from June last year. At that time,
the society said only 13 of the products could be recalled as the rest
already had been used. Of those 13, 11 were contaminated with HBV and two
were contaminated with HCV. The Society added that the contaminated units
may have slipped through the screening process as conventional technology
cannot ascertain contamination if the donor has only recently become infected.

[The efficiency of screening and the complete elimination of infectious HBV
from blood donations in areas of high prevalence HBV infection remain a
serious problem. This has been discussed in some detail in earlier posts
relating to the incident in 20000 (see references below). - Mod.CP]
