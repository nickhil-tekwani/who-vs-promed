A recent study [see reference below] from Japan has shown that coffee leaf rust (CLR) is widespread in the main coffee-growing regions of Viet Nam. However, there have been recent reports of CLR outbreaks in coffee-growing regions where rust-resistant varieties are planted.

To control the disease, it is necessary to understand rust population diversity and identify genetic variations that may lead to potential future pathogen strains. Sequencing data were used to estimate the geographic region where CLR first established itself, as well as its direction of migration between Viet Nam's main coffee-producing areas. The CLR populations shared a close genetic relationship with several Central and South American populations.

The data further showed a spread from north to south. This suggests that agents other than wind and monsoon were responsible for moving spores. Rather, human activities are likely to be involved in spreading CLR and may thus accelerate the genetic diversification of rust fungi. The findings will help to predict the spread of CLR in the future.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), CLR affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance. No coffee cultivars resistant to all races are currently available.

New fungal strains are emerging. For example in Central America, strains adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances are being recorded (see previous ProMED posts in the archives), making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult.

Fungal spores that are wind borne or can easily be carried on plant and other materials (including seedlings, farm machinery, travellers' clothes), as is the case for CLR, pose a very high quarantine risk. The findings above highlight once more the vital importance of biosecurity measures for protection of crops and environments.
