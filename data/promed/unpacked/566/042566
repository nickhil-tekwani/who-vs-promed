[1] Case report repeated

A case of suspected mad cow disease has been found in Romanian beef, officials said Wednesday [2 Jul 2014].

Romania's animal health and safety authority said a preliminary test on 1 May 2014 indicated that a cow slaughtered at an authorized abattoir was infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.

It said the carcass has been sent to a British laboratory for further tests, and it could be an "atypical form of BSE which appears naturally and spontaneously in cattle."

The officials only revealed the case after Russia decided to ban imports of Romanian beef, citing fears of BSE. It wasn't clear how the Russians learned about it [see comment].

They said Romania has not had a case of BSE since 1995 when testing began, and there was no risk to public health from the current "isolated case."

BSE is fatal to cows and can cause a fatal brain disease in people who eat tainted beef. It 1st broke out in the late 1980s in Britain, where hundreds of people fell ill and many died after eating contaminated meat. Over the years, 4.5 million cattle were slaughtered to contain the spread.

Outbreaks followed in Japan in 2001 and Canada in May 2003.

Romania exports up to one million cattle a year, mainly to the Netherlands, Italy, and Croatia.

[This might be a belated report of a long published case. If otherwise, clarification is expected. In fact, Romania reported to the OIE its 1st case of BSE on 20 Jun 2014 (see posting 20140621.2556417). Russia's ban was published by ITAR-TASS on Tuesday, 1 Jul 2014, as follows:

"The federal veterinary and phytosanitary control authority, or Rosselkhoznadzor, has banned imports of bovine cattle, beef and by-products from Romania over an outbreak of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease. According to a Rosselkhoznadzor release circulated on Tuesday [1 Jul 2014], the ban is also applicable to processed animal proteins, animal feedstuff made of such proteins, meat-meal and bone tankage. An outbreak of mad cow disease in Romania was registered by the International Epizootic Bureau. Russia's last BSE-related ban on imports of live cattle was in force for almost 30 years in respect of Great Britain. Rosselkhoznadzor lifted that ban in September 2013" (see http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/738584).

Temporary Restrictions Imposed on Live Animals and Animal Products Exported from Romania
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A BSE outbreak was registered in the territory of Cluj county of Romania, as the OIE reported. In this connection the Rosselkhoznadzor decided to impose temporary restrictions on live cattle, meat meal, meat-and-bone meal, blood meal, bone-in beef, offals, processed animal proteins intended for use in productive animal feed, except for the feeds produced from rendered fish and the ones which contain processed animal protein, excluding milk protein. The Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance also requested the National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA) to provide information on the measures taken by the Veterinary Service to prevent the spread of the disease.

[Romania's immediate notification to the OIE, including an interactive map, submitted on 20 Jun 2014, reported that the causal agent was "Prion (atypical BSE L-type)". See Mod.CRD's comprehensive commentary in posting 20140621.2556417, which includes explanation about atypical BSE.

In February 2014, OIE's Scientific Commission agreed to recommend adding Romania and another 10 Member Countries for adoption as having a "negligible" risk for BSE by the World Assembly at the 82nd General Session. This was in accordance with Chapter 11.5. of the Terrestrial Code. The newly added countries were: Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Korea. The recommendation was adopted by the General Session in Resolution No. 18 (May 2014); see at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/2014_A_RESO-18_BSE.pdf.

Further details on the animal involved (age and history), and explanation/background for Russia's decision to impose a trade ban, though the case is said to be "atypical" and solitary, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
