The Department of Health issued a forewarning of Japanese encephalitis
again. Twelve cases of Japanese encephalitis [JE have been confirmed to
date this year. These are more than twice the number for the same period
last year. There have been two fatal cases.
The two fatal cases were living separately in Kaohsiung and Miaoreet.
Districts there are wet paddy or pig-rearing farms within one kilometer
radius of their homes [the homes of the case-patients. The Acting Head of
the Department of Health's Disease Control Bureau. K.S. Hsu informed that
pigs are the intermediary hosts of JE, the water within paddy fields is
also breeding grounds for mosquitoes. It can be deduced that the two
provided the main [environmental causative factors for the disease.
Hsu also said that most infants and young children in Taiwan have been
vaccinated against JE, conferring them with antibodies and ensuring a low
infection rate. On the other hand, the effectiveness of vaccination on
adults had worn off, thus increasing their chance of infection. This was
reflected in the recent deaths from the disease falling on two adults aged
41 and 28 years. Despite of this, the Department of Health is not
advocating the vaccination of adults against JE because the side effects of
vaccination are greater among adults (i.e., shock and other more serious
complications). The basic preventive measures will have to be elimination
of mosquitoes and avoidance of mosquito bites.
