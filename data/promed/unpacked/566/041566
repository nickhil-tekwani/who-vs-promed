Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (atypical case) in Japan
-------------------------------------------------
Information received on 7 Oct 2003 from Dr Masako Kurimoto, Director of
Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
Tokyo:
Report date: 7 Oct 2003.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 6 Oct 2003.
Description of affected population: a Holstein bullock aged 23 months
slaughtered at the abattoir on 29 Sep 2003.
Diagnosis:
- The brain sample from the bullock tested positive to the ELISA-based
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) screening test, and was sent to the
National Institute of Infectious Disease for confirmation and was subjected
to western blot analysis, histopathological examination and
immunohistochemical examination. Based on these results, this case was
concluded as an atypical BSE on 6 Oct 2003.
- Result of western blot analysis: PrPsc (scrapie-associated prion
protein) was detected, the pattern of glycoform and relative protease
resistance of PrPsc were different from what is known for BSE. Results of
histopathological examination and immunohistochemical examination were
negative.
- Moreover, in order to confirm biological characteristic such as
transmissibility, the inoculation to laboratory animals will be carried out.
Location: Ibaraki Prefecture.
Number of outbreaks: 1
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
- susceptible: ...
- case: 1
- deaths: 0.
- slaughtered: 1

[Japan had 3 reported BSE cases in 2001, 2 of which were picked up by
abattoir surveillance, 2 cases in 2002, and now 3 cases in 2003. Since this
is the official report, we are posting it, although much of this has been
reported in previous postings. Additional relevant details can be obtained
from Jun-ichi Ohnishi's comments in BSE - Japan (04) -- see reference below.
Independent confirmation of such unusual diagnostic findings will be most
helpful. - Mod.PC]
