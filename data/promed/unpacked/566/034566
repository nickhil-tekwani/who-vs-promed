Quebec: West Nile virus-infected Crow Found Near Montreal
---------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus appears to have landed closer to home for
Montrealers. An infected North American crow was found dead in the
borough of Roxboro this week, but authorities aren't jumping to any
conclusions. John Carsley, head of the infectious diseases unit of
the Montreal regional public health department, said it's impossible
to draw any conclusions from one contaminated bird.
He noted the crow could have come from elsewhere in the Montreal
region. Another dead crow carrying the potentially fatal virus was
located in Huntingdon, southwest of Montreal, at the end of May 2003.
It was the first confirmed case in Quebec this year.
Carsley said the convergence of such factors as the presence of some
contaminated birds and pools of contaminated mosquitoes in the same
sector could lead to intervention through corrective measures, such
as mosquito larvicide treatments.
There were 16 cases of humans infected with West Nile across the
province last year, 2 of which resulted in deaths.

[Previously there have been reports from Ontario of 2 dead West Nile
virus-infected crows.
(1) York Region Health Services has stated that a bird reported as
"presumed positive" on 25 Apr 2003 was "confirmed positive" for West
Nile Virus infection on 29 Apr 2003. The dead crow was found in the
town of Newmarket, close to the intersection of Leslie Street and
Mulock Drive. This bird is the first positive bird reported in York
Region and in Canada in 2003 (see:
<http://www.region.york.on.ca/Publications/News/April+29%2c+2003+Update%3a+York+Region+bird+confirmed+positive+for+West+Nile+Virus.htm>).
(2) A dead crow from Oxford County has been confirmed positive for
West Nile virus. The bird was found in Woodstock on 23 May 2003.
"Last year West Nile virus was identified in 7 crows and 18 mosquito
traps set up by public health staff in various parts of the County,"
said Dr. Jeff Nichols, Acting Medical Officer of Health for the
Oxford County Department of Public Health and Emergency Services. "I
encourage everyone to take measures to reduce the risk of mosquito
bites. We will be keeping our residents informed as more information
becomes available." (see:
