Viet Nam minister downplays seriousness of disease outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------
Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Viet Nam is still under
control, Health Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Tien said at a press
conference on Tuesday (25 Oct 2011), despite the rising number of new
HFMD cases. The disease has killed 137 people, mostly children, out of
77 895 infections in the 63 cities and provinces across the country
[i.e., the whole of Viet Nam - Mod.CP] this year.

A report by the Viet Nam Administration of Preventive Medicine showed
2900 new HFMD cases were recorded last week [16-22 Oct 2011], up 400
cases from the previous week. Nguyen Van Binh, chief of the
administration, said the number of HFMD fatalities and infections
would continue to rise.

Local media have repeatedly asked why the Health Ministry has not
declared the HFMD an epidemic so that more money and effort can be
poured into prevention of the disease. Minister Tien reiterated a
regulation on Tuesday [25 Oct 2011] that the ministry can announce a
national epidemic only after at least 2 provinces do so locally. "In
fact, HFMD is occurring in South Korea, Japan and China but none of
those countries have declared a national epidemic either," she said.
"No announcement made does not mean we are neglecting of the lives of
the children. We are trying our best to prevent the disease from
spreading with the help of World Health Organization [WHO] experts in
Viet Nam."

Infection is typically mild and causes mouth sores and blisters on
hands and feet. No vaccine or specific treatment exists, but most
children typically recover quickly without problems.

According to WHO updates on 11 Oct 2011, Viet Nam ranked 3rd in the
number of HFMD infections among 7 countries and territories in the
Western Pacific region, after China and Japan. WHO said China, Japan,
Macao (China) and South Korea were seeing a declining trend in the
number of reported HFMD cases while Singapore continued to see
low-level activity. In comparison, China reported 1 217 768 HFMD
cases, including 399 deaths, between January and September this year.
In Japan, 306 944 cases have been reported as of 2 Oct 2011, and In
Singapore, 14 146 cases have been reported as of 1 Oct 2011.

Big cities are facing the danger of HFMD outbreaks as more and more
HFMD cases from other provinces rush to hospitals in big cities. In Ho
Chi Minh City [HCM], although the number of HFMD infections has not
increased since peak months (May-August), the number of child patients
at Children's Hospital 1 has seen no decrease. The hospital's
Infectious Diseases Department is always overloaded, with an average
150 child patients a day, mostly from other provinces. Dr. Truong Huu
Khanh, chief of the Infectious Diseases Department, said there were
days when more than 80 percent of child patients admitted to the
hospital were from other provinces. "The provinces with the most
patients include Ben Tre, Tien Giang, Long An, Tay Ninh, Binh Phuoc,
Binh Duong and Ba Ria-Vung Tau," he said.

At HCMC Children's Hospital 2, an estimated 110-130 HFMD cases are
being reported a day, with 50-60 percent of patients coming from other
provinces.

"The workload for doctors in big cities is so big that they can make
mistakes, which are sometimes paid for with the patients' lives," said
a doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to doctors,
HFMD patients rush to big cities because provincial hospitals do not
have enough medical staff and equipment to treat serious cases.
Provincial hospitals also don't cover drug fees for HFMD patients
under age 6, while HCMC does. According to Khanh, 10 percent of HFMD
child patients at the Children's Hospital 1 must be treated with
gammaglobulin.

Dr. Nguyen Dac Tho, deputy director of the HCMC Center for Preventive
Medicine, warned that the rising number of HFMD patients from other
provinces rushing to city-based hospitals could help spread the
disease. Dr. Tran Phu Manh Sieu, the center's director, said the risk
of the disease spreading to new communities was very high. "HFMD child
patients may spread the virus to other patients, and adults and
children who share the hospitals' canteens and toilets may contract
the virus. Families of child patients from other provinces who rush to
HCMC may spread the viruses to their relatives too."

[Since the previous report dated Mon 17 Oct 2011 there have been 6425
new cases and 7 more deaths. The continuing refusal of the of the
Vietnamese authorities to acknowledge the epidemic status of the HFMD
outbreak, now affecting all provinces of Viet Nam, seems unwise other
than for reasons of financial expediency.

At some future date it would be instructive to have some information
regarding the enteric viruses circulating in this epidemic in relation
to the situation in neighboring countries experiencing the same
problem.
