New bird flu case detected in north Malaysia
--------------------------------------------
A new case of H5 type avian influenza has been detected at Teluk Baru
village, near Kota Baharu, capital of the northern state of Kelantan, a
senior veterinary official said Sunday [19 Sep 2004].
Veterinary Services director-general Hawari Hussein told reporters that the
new case involved the detection of the avian flu virus in 3 chickens in
Jalan Bayam Guchil, just 6 kilometres from Pasir Pekan Village, where the
1st case was detected in Kelantan. The culling of chickens, ducks and birds
within a 1 km radius had started immediately, he said.
Hawari said surveillance and tests conducted in other parts of the country
would continue, and no signs of the highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) virus had been detected. "It means other areas are not affected and
[are] free from the HPAI virus. As such, chickens, ducks and eggs are safe
for consumption," he said.
He said that since the virus was detected in the state, a total of 5119
chickens, ducks, and birds had been culled in Kelantan. The department also
urged people in the affected areas to hand over their fowls to expedite the
culling process, he said. Hawari also urged the public, especially those
living along the Thailand-Malaysia border, to refrain from bringing in any
type of poultry products.
HPAI virus was first detected in Kelantan on 17 Aug 2004, believed to have
been spread by a fighting cock brought in from Thailand.It has since spread
to 9 villages in 4 districts of the state -- Tumpat, Kota Baharu, Pasir Mas
and Bachok. Meanwhile, the enforcement authorities Sunday [19 Sep 2004]
launched an integrated operation to curb the smuggling of poultry,
poultry-based products and birds from Thailand to contain the spread of the
bird flu virus in Kelantan [see 2nd item below].

Thailand, Malaysia to tighten bird flu border checks
----------------------------------------------------
Thailand and Malaysia agreed on Tuesday [21 Sep 2004] to tighten border
controls to prevent fowl crossing the border in an attempt to contain an
outbreak of bird flu that has killed 29 Asians in 2004 so far.
"The 1st thing we do is to try to control the movement of birds between the
2 countries," said Malaysia's Abi Musa Asa'ri Mohamed Nor, after a day of
talks prompted by the appearance of the H5N1 virus in Kelantan state near
the Thai border during August 2004.
Chawarnwuth Chainuwat of Thailand, where the virus has killed 9 people,
said that meant setting up a joint cooperation team.
The 2 nations agreed to set up an early warning system to alert each other
of further outbreaks, the agriculture ministry officials told a news
conference.
Malaysia has banned imports of poultry products from Thailand since the
H5N1 virus hit Thailand in January 2004, but Abi acknowledged that it would
be hard to stop traffic across the highly porous border. "We must admit
that the people at the border do not recognise the border. They move from
Thailand to Malaysia and from Malaysia to Thailand bringing fighting
cocks," he said.
Migratory birds were blamed for the outbreaks of bird flu in many Asian
countries early in 2004, but the fighting cock culture -- prized birds of
great value being taken far and wide to take part in bloody contests --
helped spread it in Thailand.
Malaysia has sent more than 400 troops to its border with Thailand to check
smuggling of chickens into Kelantan, which is under quarantine for the
virus, which has also killed 20 people in Vietnam.
Malaysia has yet to have a human case of bird flu. It has culled thousands
of chickens, duck and birds and has contained its outbreak to Kelantan so
far and kept it out of commercial poultry farms.
"The virus is all over Asia now. We can only pray and hope that we can
reduce and contain the disease only to that particular area," Abi said.

[The described bi-national cooperation is highly commendable, exemplary for
other countries in the region. Eight Asian countries have informed the
Office International des Epizooties (OIE) during 2004 of the absence of
HPAI infection from their territories. For their official reports, see
