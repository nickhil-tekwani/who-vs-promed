Without clinical history for the human or the dogs, it is hard to make even
a good differential diagnosis. However, according the Department of
Veterinary Pathology here at the Institute, there are some strains of rabies
with a prolonged incubation at the bite site.

From: anmlpepl@whidbey.com (Merritt Clifton, editor, ANIMAL PEOPLE)

I've been collecting reports of rabies outbreaks for many years, and find
that a period of uncertainty surrounding Third World outbreaks is not
uncommon, especially in nations which have large homeless dog populations.
Dog bites are common, deaths from various untreated infections are common,
and consequently, even when rabies is at large, clinics will receive dog bite
victims who exhibit some rabies symptoms but from wholly separate causes.
When some of these victims die, confusion can be intense. When others
recover, the confusion grows.
One consequence is that many people in Southeast Asia, particularly, will
insist that they have a form of rabies from which victims do recover; also,
that this form is endemic in their dog populations. I believe we've had
previous discussion of this on ProMED-mail. So far, the reports we've received
from Indonesia, including those on ProMED-mail, are consistent with what we've
seen in association with other rabies outbreaks.
However, what I would look out for in that part of the world right now would
be the possibility of some little-known bite-transmitted disease coming into
the human population via stray dogs or pigs, via wildlife displaced by the
ongoing jungle fires.
Wildlife rescuers in several different parts of Indonesia over the past nine
months have received, seen, and received reports of all sorts of rarely seen
creatures, some of them believed to have been extinct or extirpated, others
never scientifically described, ranging from matchbook-sized bats to
subspecies of tiger. Nobody knows just what zoonotic diseases any of them
may have or carry.
In short, I would consider the possibility that if some reliable hospital
lab reports finding indications of something weird, there may indeed be
something weird at large.

some hard information from Nusa Tengarra. - Mod.MHJ
