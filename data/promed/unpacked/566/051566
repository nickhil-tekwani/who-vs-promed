As of 12:00 noon today, 21 May 2015, there have been a total of:
1002 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
434 deaths,
558 recoveries and
10 currently active cases (includes 1 under home isolation)

http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2015-05-21-001.aspx
In the past 2 days there was one newly reported case, today (21 May 2015) a 48 year old non-healthcare worker Saudi male from Hufoof who is currently in critical condition in the ICU. This individual has a history of contact with a known or suspected case either in the healthcare environment or in the community [or possibly a household contact of the extended family with 5 other laboratory-confirmed cases reported earlier - Mod.MPP].

[One wonders if this newly confirmed case is part of the extended family cluster in Hufoof that has been reported earlier (see MERS-CoV (43): Saudi Arabia, new cases 20150511.3355644) or if this was related to contact in the healthcare environment. More information on the likely transmission mode would be greatly appreciated.

[2] South Korea, 2 new contact cases - media report, RFI

South Korean health officials confirmed the country's 3rd case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) on Thursday [21 May 2015], with the 2 latest cases found in people who had been in contact with the 1st patient after he returned from the Middle East.

Authorities have isolated as a precaution another 64 people who are family members or medical workers treating those 3 patients, said Yang Byung-guk, director of the health ministry's Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.

Test results came back positive for a 63 year old woman, the wife of the 1st proven case, as well as for a 76 year old man who shared a hospital room with him, the ministry said.

The 1st man was diagnosed with the disease on Wednesday [20 May 2015] after a trip to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates [the original report posted yesterday stated the individual was in Bahrain and transferred flights in Qatar - Mod.MPP], where the disease broke out, Yang told a briefing.

Shin Hyoung-shik, an infectious disease specialist in charge of treating the patients, said the latest 2 confirmed cases had fevers but no sign of breathing difficulties. "The 1st patient has been recovering, with less difficulty in breathing," Shin said.

The ministry said on Wednesday [20 May 2015] it saw no chance of the disease spreading into the wider population because those who had been in contact with the 1st patient had been isolated.

The disease's fatality rate is 30-40 per cent and its incubation period is 2 to 14 days, experts say. "The 40 per cent death rate is quite high," Choi Jun-yong, an associate professor at the infectious diseases division of Severance Hospital, told Reuters by telephone. "If infected, patients in many cases need to have artificial respiration treatments for respiratory failures."

First identified in humans in 2012, MERS is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family as the one that caused a deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in China in 2003. There is no cure or vaccine.

South Korea's health ministry said 23 countries had a combined 1142 cases of MERS and 465 deaths had been reported, as of [16 May 2015]. Of the total, 1117 cases, or 97.8 per cent, were in the Middle East. [These numbers come from the ECDC Communicable Disease Threat's report of 16 May 2015, available at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-16-may-2015.pdf. - Mod.MPP]

There is usually a surge of cases in the northern spring and most cases have come from hospital transmission."

[3] South Korea, new contact cases, media report

South Korea on Thursday [21 May 2015] confirmed a 3rd case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which was found in an elderly man who shared a hospital room with the country's 1st patient.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Wednesday [20 May 2015] that a 68 year old man who had traveled to Bahrain for about 3 weeks and returned to Korea earlier this month [May 2015] was found to have been infected with MERS and subsequently transmitted it to his 63 year old wife. In a subsequent report on Thursday [21 May 2015], CDC added that a 76 year old patient who spent 5 hours in the same room with the 1st MERS patient had contracted the disease while being treated on Saturday [16 May 2015] at a general hospital in Seoul. However, none of the 3 victims is in a critical condition, according to the authority.

MERS was 1st reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and is most prevalent in the Middle East. The disease has a latent period of up to 2 weeks and presents flu-like symptoms. According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, a total of 1142 people had been diagnosed with the disease as of [16 May 2015], and so far it has resulted in 465 deaths, showing a 40.7 per cent fatality rate. No vaccines or cures have been developed yet.

The new infections have since raised questions over the quarantine authority's detection system. The 1st patient reportedly traveled to Bahrain on [18 Apr 2015], and on to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, before coming back to Korea on [4 May 2015] via Incheon International Airport. The man passed through a heat sensor, though at the time, the quarantine authority did not detect anything out of the ordinary.

Despite the fact that the patient had visited Saudi Arabia, where 428 people have died of MERS, airport officials at the National Quarantine Station (NQS) have been criticized for lax safety procedures, only measuring the 68-year-old's body temperature. Officials at the NQS, a subdivision of CDC, are supposed to ask incoming passengers about any obvious symptoms -- especially if travelers have visited any countries with a high risk for contagious diseases -- and report any abnormalities later on. "We are going to make every single passenger on flights from the Middle East [4 times a day] write declaration forms and conduct individual interviews when they pass through Immigration," said an official at the NQS at the Incheon International Airport.

The 1st patient reportedly began to show symptoms on [11 May 2015], a week after his return, and when the man visited a local clinic, he was prescribed cold medicine. After his symptoms worsened, he was admitted to a general hospital, where the 3rd patient was infected as the 2 men shared a hospital room.

"The spray from a sneeze or a cough can travel up to 2 meters [6.6 feet], and it's possible that a person staying in the same room can be infected," said Kim Woo-joo, a professor at Korea University. "There have also been secondary infection cases reported between patients and medical staff in foreign countries like Saudi Arabia."

As the 1st patient's condition gradually deteriorated, he was transferred on Sunday [17 May 2015] to a larger general hospital in Seoul. But because the hospital was full, he stayed the night in an adjacent clinic and was finally admitted to the general hospital on Monday [18 May 2015].

A doctor at the hospital reported the case to CDC, though the man was only isolated since Wednesday [20 May 2015] after the results of a blood test came back positive. CDC is currently monitoring 64 people, including medical staff and the family members who came in contact with the 3 patients.

[This now makes 2 locally transmitted contact cases reported from South Korea associated with the 1st imported case. In the original media report there was mention of travel to Bahrain for farm related work and return to Korea via Qatar. This current report adds travel to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both locations with recent evidence of MERS-CoV circulation (see MERS-CoV (44): S Korea ex Middle East, Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO, RFI 20150520.3374579 for more details.). Clarification of potential risk exposures while in the Middle East and locations of exposures of the 1st case would be greatly appreciated. As for the nosocomial transmission, perhaps the time has come for universal respiratory precautions when a patient is admitted to a hospital for a febrile respiratory illness ... clearly we see nosocomial enhancement of transmission of disease.

The media report above suggests that the infections were confirmed through serologic testing as there is no mention of PCR results. Will this testing be accepted as confirmation of infection?
