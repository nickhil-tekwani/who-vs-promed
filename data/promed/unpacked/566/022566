DESTROYED, SLAUGHTERED - OIE DEFINITIONS
****************************************
Date: Wednesday, July 23, 1997 11:35:59 MDT
From: Andre Dore <adore@em.agr.ca>
In a recent posting [Viral hemorrhagic disease, rabbits - Cuba (03)
970722164913] you asked about the difference between "destroyed" and
"slaughtered". The following definitions are taken from the Instructions to
complete the Status Reports (S.R.) to the OIE:
Slaughtered means deliberate killing of animals with salvage for human
consumption. Destroyed means deliberate killing of animals without salvage
for human consumption.
