There are fears of a possible legionnaires' [disease] outbreak as health authorities warn of 2 people hospitalized with the disease. Both people infected with the disease reported a gym in Frankston and used its spa facilities in the lead up to their diagnosis, sparking warnings for people in the area to be on high alert.

The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed [it] has shut down the spa at Core24 gym which is now under investigation. Health experts have warned anyone who may have used the spa to be on the lookout for possible symptoms.

"People who have been exposed to the potential source could still develop symptoms over the next 10 days," said Victoria's Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr
Brett Sutton. Core24 Health Clubs Director Joe Russo said he was confident the spa water was not responsible for the outbreak. "We have a state of the art spa sanitisation system which is monitored 24 hours days, 7 days a week by a computerised system," he said. "Our records show our spa water has been maintained at the highest quality possible. We have referred this issue to our pool and spa water quality consultants and we are confident that our water will be declared safe."

Legionnaires' disease causes flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, chills, muscle aches and pains, followed by respiratory problems and pneumonia often
developing over 3 or 4 days. Onset can be up to 10 days after initial contact.

[ProMED-mail thanks Denis Green for his submission.

A spa pool (a.k.a hot tub or whirlpool spa) can be a source for legionellosis. ProMED-mail has posted several outbreaks of legionnaires' disease traced back to a hot tub (see also's below).

Culture for _Legionella_ of sputum and suspected environmental sources and genotyping the isolates will help delineate transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source and genotyping environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can point to the possible source for those patients if the genotypes match.

Frankston is an outer-suburb of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, and is located 41 km [25.47 miles] south-east of the Melbourne city centre, at the northernmost point of the Mornington Peninsula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston,_Victoria). Melbourne, with a population of about 4.6 million residents, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria, and the 2nd-most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne).
