There are now 22 confirmed cases of whooping cough in the greater Fredericton area, including 19 school-aged children from several schools, says the regional medical officer of health. That's nearly double the number of cases from last month [April 2019], when Dr Na-Koshie Lamptey declared a whooping cough outbreak for the capital region.

Public health will be offering immunization clinics over the next week for those most at risk of the bacterial respiratory infection easily spread through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing, Lamptey said on Tuesday [21 May 2019]. That includes people who have been in close contact with any of the confirmed cases and do not have a primary care provider who can immunize them, she said.

No details about the affected individuals have been released, but the affected schools include: Garden Creek Elementary, Park Street Elementary, Gibson-Neill Memorial Elementary, Nashwaaksis Middle School, Fredericton Christian Academy, and George Street Middle School.

The clinics will also be for infants without a primary care provider, as well as preschoolers and adults who don't have the recommended booster dose or a primary care provider. Health officials did not provide any information about the locations or times of the clinics.

In New Brunswick, children should have doses of the pertussis vaccine when they are 2, 4, 6, and 18 months old and again at age 4, followed by a booster dose in grade 7, said Lamptey. Adults should receive one dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine, because immunity from the vaccine decreases over time.

Dr Na-Koshie Lamptey, regional medical officer of health, said parents who seek medical attention should tell their primary care provider that they and their children may have had contact with a confirmed case of whooping cough. Last month [April 2019], Lamptey said 10 children and 2 adults in the Fredericton health region had been diagnosed since January [2019]. Normally, the region, which encompasses the Upper St John River Valley, sees no more than one case a year, while the entire province sees about 27 confirmed cases. A whooping cough outbreak was also declared at Moncton High School in March [2019] after 5 cases were confirmed.

Vaccination is free.

Montana health officials have recorded 265 people sick with whooping cough so far this year [2019] with a new wave of cases in Gallatin County over the last week. "For a little perspective, this time last year [2018] we were at 21 cases," said Stacey Anderson, a state preventable disease epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health and Human Services. "This is a vaccine-preventable disease," Anderson said. "If a person is not up-to-date on their pertussis vaccine, it's a good time to do so."

The state's tally of cases as of 16 May [2019] lapped last year's [2018] total of 143. That has health workers behind the scenes trying to stop its spread.

Matt Kelley, public health officer with the Gallatin City-County Health Department, said 34 county residents were diagnosed with pertussis since January [2019], a jump of 7 cases in less than a week. That includes a new Belgrade illness the department began investigating Tuesday [21 May 2019]. "We're seeing it community-wide," Kelley said. "We have cases at MSU [Montana State University], within the Bozeman School District, and we have cases that don't seem to be related to any of the above." That stands out from previous years where outbreaks were centralized.

Kelley said after the department learns of a new case, it finds people who could be exposed and, in some cases, advises they get antibiotics to avoid the illness. He said people with symptoms should reach out to their doctor and get tested. "We're hoping for the best but planning for additional cases because I'm sure we'll see them," Kelley said. "We're trying to build a wall of protection around the people who are most vulnerable." The situation isn't the same statewide. Anderson said 16 counties reported pertussis cases since January [2019] with Missoula County leading the pack. But there's concern that number will increase.

The infection typically has a spike in cases every 3-5 years. Kids in school have their last required pertussis vaccine in 7th grade. Anderson said it seems to have a weaning protection after roughly 3-4 years. She said so far this year [2019], most Montanans with the infection have been between 16 and 18 years old. Montana's last pertussis peak happened in 2013 with 663 cases. Anderson said the illness resurfacing every few years is likely a perfect storm of its natural cycle and people who may be due for a vaccination. "There's some concern we're kind of falling into that cycle," she said.

The number of whooping cough cases in Lake County has now grown to 19, and health officials said on Wednesday [22 May 2019] that 4 of the cases are infants.

The following post is from the Lake County Public Health Facebook page:

Lake County/Flathead Reservation has bumped up to 19 confirmed pertussis cases. The outbreak is now considered to be community-wide.

Ages: [less than] 1 year = 4 [cases] (3 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 7 months); 1-4 years = 5 [cases]; 5-10 years = 6 [cases]; and [greater than] 10 years = 4 [cases].

Vaccination status: unvaccinated = 13 [cases].

Officials at the Missoula City County Health Department are breathing a sigh of relief, as the numbers of confirmed cases of pertussis are slowing dramatically. Director Ellen Leahy drew the comparison from a week ago to Fri 24 May [2019]. "In this last few days, the number of new cases has dropped from about 6 per day to just one per day for the last several days," said Leahy. "We're encouraged by that, of course, but we're still doing a lot of follow-up work on the known cases."

Leahy contrasted the number of double-digit confirmed cases from previous weeks to the past few days. "We have 134 cases total as of Thursday night [23 May 2019], and going into the week, we had 125, so the number of new cases is slowing down," she said. "This is a very encouraging sign, but there is a bit of a caveat, and that is that we changed our protocol again going into the week. Our follow-up is still very assertive, but our case-finding is less so, so that may affect it a little bit. But when you look at the current epidemic from the beginning, you see kind of a peak area for a couple of weeks, and now you're starting to see it go down."

There were concerns that the pertussis vaccine's effectiveness was beginning to wane; however, with patient numbers dropping, healthcare officials are more optimistic that the outbreak may soon be over. At one point, the Health Department had brought in 10 extra nurses to assist with the pertussis outbreak.

Portland schools confirmed 3 [4?] cases of whooping cough in the district on Wednesday [29 May 2019], but there are likely more.

Tess Nacelewicz, Communications Coordinator for Portland Public Schools, issued a statement on 29 May [2019], saying there has been one confirmed case of pertussis at Longfellow Elementary School, 2 confirmed cases at Lincoln Middle School, and one confirmed case at Deering High School. There is also a 2nd "presumed" case at Longfellow and a 3rd case "being tested" at Lincoln.

The student with pertussis from Deering has been treated with antibiotics and has since returned to school. Students in the same classes as the affected individual have not shown signs of any symptoms, and Nacelewicz says faculty is not aware of any other suspected cases at the high school.

Portland Public Schools has reported the incidents to the Maine Center for Disease Control, according to Nacelewicz. The CDC has spoken with school nursing staff, and a letter was sent to parents and staff (including custodial staff) at each school. Nacelewicz says there are no recommendations for keeping students out of schools, and though immunized students can and do contract pertussis, these infections are usually less serious.

Hauora Tairawhiti has confirmed there have been 5 confirmed cases of whooping cough in the past month [May 2019?]. This is much higher than usual, and the district health board is warning there are likely to be other cases in the community. The 5 cases include two 2 year olds and a baby.

Tairawhiti medical officer of health Margot McLean says immunisation rates in the district are not high enough to prevent outbreaks of [this] serious disease. "Parents sometimes get scared by negative information about vaccines on social media. They may not realise that the vaccines are made to prevent very serious illnesses. These illnesses are making a comeback because of our low rates of immunisation. Childhood vaccinations are all free, and if children have missed vaccinations, they can go to their health centre and catch up."

[Hauora Tairawhiti covers the same area as the Gisborne District (also known as Gisborne Region), with a population of 49 100 residents, 45% of whom are Maori; 75% of the population lives in the city of Gisborne (https://www.hauoratairawhiti.org.nz/about-us/who/tairawhiti/). Tairawhiti is said to have the highest level of economic deprivation and poorer health than any other district, contributed in part by low immunization rates (https://www.hauoratairawhiti.org.nz/about-us/who/tairawhiti/).
