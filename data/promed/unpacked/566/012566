Authorities of the San Isidro de Tocoa General Hospital, Colón, confirmed 6 cases of leptospirosis in that community.

The authorities of health region number 6 of Colón, called on the population to stay alert to this new threat to health. The hospital spokesman said that 3 of those affected are employees of the health center and underwent surgery. "After having suspicions in these cases, it was confirmed by tests that patients suffered from leptospirosis." The spokesman said.

Leptospirosis is an infection caused by contact with the bacteria _Leptospira_, which is found in fresh water that has been contaminated by the urine of [infected] animals. According to studies at the National Library of Medicine in the United States, leptospirosis does not spread from one person to another, except in very rare cases. Occasionally it is transmitted through sexual contact, breast milk, or from a mother to her fetus. The most likely people to contract it are farmers, farmers, people who live where there is animal husbandry, people who work in sewers. In the case of infections in the home, it is more common among people who have pets such as dogs, domestic livestock, or the presence of infected rodents.

Epidemiologists claim that the center and north of the country present the greatest risk of presenting an outbreak. Areas that are easily flooded or where there is sugarcane production are vulnerable.

[Leptospirosis is spread mainly by contact with fresh, unchlorinated water, or soil that has been contaminated by the urine of infected animals or plants contaminated with infected animal urine. Inhalation of aerosols of contaminated fluids, such as may occur in abattoirs. or ingestion of foods contaminated with urine of infected animals are also occasional modes of transmission. Human-to-human transmission is very rare, but has been documented through sexual intercourse, breastfeeding, and mother to fetus (https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/pdf/fs-leptospirosis-clinicians-eng-508.pdf).

Because humans excrete viable _Leptospira_ in the urine for only a few weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms, and _Leptospira_ are found in blood or CSF for only the first 7-10 days of symptoms, nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers is possible, but unusual; the CDC lists this disease as requiring "standard" type of hospital infection control precautions, although at this site CDC says that leptospirosis is "not transmitted from person to person" (https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/appendix/type-duration-precautions.html).

We are not told if the 3 hospital employees with leptospirosis in the news report above had patient or clinical laboratory contact that would put them at risk of nosocomial leptospirosis.

Tocoa, with a population of 94 120 in 2015, is a city in the northern Honduran department of Colón slightly inland on the right bank of the Aguán River (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocoa,_Colón). - Mod.ML
