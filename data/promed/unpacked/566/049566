[A dog] died last month in a gush of bloody horror after the 8-year-old boxer's owners believe she ate toxin-laced detritus from the C-51 canal -- marking her as possibly the 1st reported canine death in Palm Beach County from blue-green algae poisoning.

Vomit from the 78-pound dog, whose owners live along the C-51 north of Summit Boulevard, had ample enough microcystin toxins in it to kill her, according to tests by Palatka-based Green Water Laboratories.

The cyanobacteria microcystis, also known as blue-green algae, has plagued Palm Beach County waterways this spring [2021], thriving on nutrients from the watershed and Lake Okeechobee, and benefiting from a delayed rainy season, stagnating water, and persistent May sunshine.

The family's dog died after being exposed to toxic blue-green algae on the C-51 canal in West Palm Beach.

An increase in state testing has shown it popping up with varying levels of microcystin toxins at the popular Spillway Park between Lake Worth Beach and West Palm Beach, and in water samples taken closer to the home of [the dog's owners].

One test taken [20 May 2021] in the C-51 upstream from their house returned a toxin level of 23 parts-per-billion (ppb) -- nearly 3 times higher than what is considered harmful to humans. 5 days later, the dog was dead.

"Bottom line, this sample is screaming high in microcystins," said Amanda Foss, a Green Water chemist and forensic toxicologist in an email explaining the lab results from [the dog's] vomit.

"Once the liver gets hit by such a high dose of toxin, you have an entire system shut down," Foss said about how dogs react to microcystin. "Blood will diffuse into the stomach and make its way out anyway it can."

[The dog's owner] sent a vomit sample to Green Water after posting a message about the dog's death, 25 May 2021, on a neighborhood app that was noticed by Everglades Trust Executive Director Kimberly Mitchell.

The signs were similar to dogs who fell sick in 2018 after ingesting blue-green algae-infected water from the St Lucie River. One dog, a 9-year-old standard poodle, died that year with a necropsy showing it had cyanobacteria toxins in its blood, urine, and liver.

A necropsy is being scheduled, but Green Water Laboratories President Mark Aubel said he has little doubt a lethal dose of toxin is what killed the dog.

Northwest winds this month [June 2021] helped blue-green algae tainted water pile up in the Pahokee Marina with a poisonous outcome.

"It was an enormous amount of microcystin," Aubel said about what was found in [the dog's] vomit. "That represents something, but not everything, that was ingested or that she probably got into her system."

[The family] were boating on the C-51 on [23 May 2021] and believe the dog ate something having been washed off the boat as they cleaned it.

"That day, the water was horrid, and you make sure your dogs don't go in it," [the owner] said.

The couple first noticed something was wrong when the dog vomited in her crate. Later, she wouldn't eat, and then lay down and wouldn't get up. The dog was taken to an emergency vet where she threw up twice. X-rays showed something small in her stomach. The veterinarian asked if the dog may have eaten a towel. "She's 8-years-old, she doesn't go and eat things like that but we do live on a canal and we do have blue-green algae," she told the vet. "I didn't know it was toxic, although I suspected it."

The owner took the dog home, but the next morning she was in convulsions in her crate and she was rushed back to the veterinarian. She was given plasma and treated for anaphylaxis. When her front leg was shaved for the IV, it started bleeding.

Later, she was throwing up blood and went into cardiac arrest.

"She had a tube down her throat and she was on a tray with a towel under her and there was blood everywhere," the woman said. "I said 'please let her go, we have to let her go.' And I hugged her and kissed her and told her goodbye."

The weekend the dog got sick, West Palm Beach was facing its own toxic algae emergency. Water samples taken of the city's drinking water showed another cyanobacteria, cylindrospermopsis, had turned toxic at levels harmful to vulnerable populations -- young children, the elderly, nursing mothers, pregnant women, and anyone with liver or kidney problems.

It was also advised pets not drink the tap water.

City officials had shut down a feed of Lake Okeechobee water to Grassy Waters Preserve -- its main water supply -- in late April [2021] after signs microcystin was in the water. Grassy Waters feeds Clear Lake before going into the city's water treatment plant. Clear Lake's level began dropping -- creating an ideal environment for cylindrospermopsin with warmer temperatures, sunlight reaching deeper, and no mixing from outside water sources.

Possible signs a dog has ingested toxic algae
---------------------------------------------
Foss, the chemist with Green Water Laboratories, said the 1st sign a dog has ingested toxic algae is typically an upset stomach and vomiting. The microcystin then heads to the liver followed by kidney failure, shock, and internal bleeding.

"It can be a pretty gruesome death," she said.

Because veterinarians so rarely deal with cyanobacteria toxins, it's probably not a top suspect when a sick animal comes in, said El Cid Animal Clinic Medical Director Xavier Garcia. But even if blue-green algae was suspected, the treatment would probably be just to alleviate the signs.

"We don't have an antidote, the body has to get rid of it so if they are having seizures, we would try to stop the seizures," Garcia said. "You have to support the body so the body can get rid of the toxin."

The water in the canal behind this couple's house has since cleared up, but she fears there will be more algae blooms on the C-51 this summer. "On the weekends, we have kids wakeboarding behind the house and people just aren't aware," she said.

[Some algal blooms can be very toxic. Do not swim in the lake or let your pets play in the water. Pets as well as livestock are very susceptible to the toxins. Humans are also susceptible to blooms, which can cause illnesses. Hopefully, warning notices will be posted along these waterways. Pets and people are subject to adverse effects from waters with algal blooms.

The toxin may be present even if the algae are not, and likewise, the algae may be present but not the toxin. However, safety for humans and animals means avoiding bodies of water with any blue-green algae. Remember, it may be very prominent or not readily noticeable.

"There are a number of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria many people refer to as 'pond scum.' Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.

"When environmental conditions are just right, blue-green algae can grow very quickly. Most species are buoyant and will float to the surface, where they form scum layers or floating mats. When this happens, we call this a 'blue-green algae bloom.' Blue-green algae blooms generally occur between mid-June and late September, although in rare instances, blooms have been observed in winter, even under the ice. Also in warmer years, blooms may be found in the northern hemisphere as early as April.

Many different species of blue-green algae occur, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp, _Aphanizomenon_ sp, _Microcystis_ sp, and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species can change over the course of the season.

"Blue-green algal toxins are naturally produced chemical compounds sometimes produced inside the cells of certain species of blue-green algae. These chemicals are not produced all of the time, and there is no easy way to tell when blue-green algae are producing them and when they are not. When the cells are broken open, the toxins may be released. Sometimes this occurs when the cells die off naturally and they break open as they sink and decay in a lake or pond. Cells may also be broken open when the water is treated with chemicals meant to kill algae, and when cells are swallowed and mixed with digestive acids in the stomachs of people or animals.

"Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appears clear, if a 'bloom' is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.

"One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue-green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. Microcystis can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin microcystin. When microcystis die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

"People swimming in dense microcystis blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US; however, Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

"Microcystis blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. The blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). Microcystis also requires sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in blooms.

"The commonest route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water, followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, microcystis blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people who consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people who frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports microcystis blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of microcystis cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water containing microcystis or through ingesting algal mats."

"Toxins produced by blue-green algae
------------------------------------
"Toxins are compounds that have a harmful effect on other cells, tissues, and organisms. In the natural environment, these toxins are generally contained within the blue-green algal cell but they are released into the water when the cell is damaged or dies.

"Blue-green algal toxins can be divided into the following groups:
1. Hepatotoxins
- Hepatotoxins cause blood to collect in the liver causing circulatory shock and can lead to death by internal hemorrhaging.
- Hepatotoxins can cause weakness, vomiting, and diarrhea.
- Nodularin and microcystin are 2 types of hepatotoxins.
- Nodularin is produced by the algal species _Nodularia spumigena_.
- Microcystins can bioaccumulate in aquatic invertebrates such as mussels so aquatic animals caught from water where there is an algal bloom should not be eaten.
2. Neurotoxins
- Neurotoxins interfere with the functioning of the nervous system and can cause death of humans and animals within minutes by causing paralysis of the respiratory muscles.
- Marine dinoflagellates (red tides) produce saxitoxins (also known as paralytic shellfish poisons) which concentrate in shellfish and have been known to cause death in humans.
3. Non-specific toxins
- Cylindrospermopsin is a non-specific toxin produced by the blue-green algae _Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii_ and _Aphanizomenon ovalisporum_.
- This toxin is a relatively slow-acting toxin that damages most organs in the body including the liver.
4. Dermatoxic lipopolysaccharides
- When non-toxic species of blue-green algae are present at concentrations above 10 cubic mm per liter, the water may still pose a risk to recreational and domestic users as all blue-green algae have lipopolysaccharides in their cell walls.
- Lipopolysaccharides are less toxic than hepatotoxins or neurotoxins but are significant in terms of water supply for drinking, showering, and recreation.
- Lipopolysaccharides have been associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis, skin and eye irritations, and hay fever, in humans who have come into contact with algal blooms. Humans who contact lipopolysaccharides in the aerosol form (fine spray such as from a sprinkler) may suffer asthma, eczema, and blisters in the lining of the nose and mouth."
