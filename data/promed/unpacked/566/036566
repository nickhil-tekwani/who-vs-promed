Malaria reported from the Limpopo province, South Africa
-------------------------------------------------------
A pair of siblings died from malaria in Mopane at the weekend [1-2
Jan 2011], the Limpopo health department said on Monday [3 Jan 2011].

The pair were believed to be between 9-years-old and 13-years-old,
said spokesman Cecil Motsepe. "They were admitted into Malamulele
hospital over the weekend, diagnosed with malaria and treated... but
they sadly died." The gender of the siblings was not yet known. The
entire family was tested and found to be negative.

"We will be thoroughly investigating how they contracted the virus,"
said Motsepe. The department said it had seen a slight increase in
malaria cases in the province over the past week but could not
release any figures. It had been carrying out a provincial programme
to help prevent such diseases.

"We are carrying out a spray programme and have targeted 960 000
households to be sprayed," Motsepe said. So far, 40 000 homes had
been sprayed. "We are dispatching a team immediately to the area
where the siblings came from so that all the homes there can be
sprayed," said Motsepe.

"Malaria is treatable but 90 percent of the time people treat it too
late. So people must check for symptoms." Malaria is a mosquito-borne
disease which is transmitted through the bites of certain types of
mosquitoes. Flu-like symptoms, body aches and pains, nausea, vomiting
and diarrhoea are all symptoms of the disease.

Each year, more than 250 million cases of malaria are reported
worldwide, killing between one and 3 million people, the majority of
whom are young children. 90 percent of malaria-related deaths, which
is commonly associated with poverty, take place in sub-Saharan
Africa. In 2010, 9 people died of malaria out of 450 cases reported in Gauteng.

[ProMED reported on malaria in Limpopo province in January 2010
(Malaria - South Africa: (LP) 20100106.0060). A map of malaria in
Limpopo and neighboring province Mpumalanga can be found on page 40
at the following link:
<http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/factsheets/guidelines/malaria/prevention.pdf>.
It will be seen that the risk is high in the areas bordering Zimbabwe
and Mozambique. The latest official data on malaria in South Africa
according to the province is from 2007, where 499 cases were reported
with 3 deaths
(<http://www.doh.gov.za/issues/malaria/annauldata.pdf>) compared to
2004 where 4899 cases with 50 deaths were reported from Limpopo
province. - Mod.EP]
