Public health professionals and students are encouraged to submit abstracts for the 2014 Wildlife Disease Association (WDA) Conference.

The WDA is seeking abstract submissions for both oral presentations and posters from professionals and students from within the field of public health and epidemiology.

Health of wildlife, domestic animals, humans, and their environments (One Health), has been a focus of the WDA for more than 50 years. For the 1st time, this year's [2014] conference is being co-sponsored by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians and will feature unique opportunities for inter-disciplinary interaction and dialogue.

The conference theme is "One Health: Transitioning from Theory to Practice"

The 2014 International Conference of the Wildlife Disease Association will be held at the Tamaya Resort at Santa Ana Pueblo, near Bernalillo, New Mexico, USA from 27 Jul-1 Aug 2014.

Anticipated focus sessions will include One Health in practice, zoonotic diseases of the American Southwest, and the impact of human development on wildlife health and environmental health. We encourage submission of contributed papers and posters on these topics as well as new findings in other areas of One Health, wildlife disease, public health, and environmental health.
