West Nile Virus Found in More Crows in North Florida
----------------------------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE: Health officials say they have discovered signs of the
potentially deadly West Nile virus in 3 more crow carcasses found in
North Florida. After a crow tested positive for the encephalitis-causing
virus last week, the first known case ever in Florida, the state Health
Department asked Floridians to notify health officials of any dead birds
they found.

West Nile Virus in Florida Crows Raises Concern
-----------------------------------------------
MIAMI (Sat 14 Jul 2001): West Nile virus, which first appeared in North
America when it struck New York 2 years ago, has now reached as far south as
Florida. The virus was discovered this month in a dead crow in the Florida
Panhandle in what health officials saw as a troubling development in the
migratory pattern of the virus. Its appearance in Florida does not fit the
state-by-state migration pattern of the virus, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. On Friday, the State
Department of Health said preliminary tests of 3 additional crows found in
northern Florida showed evidence of West Nile virus. So experts at CDC say
the virus, carried in birds and mosquitoes, has spread south faster than
expected or has reached Florida by another route.
"The finding in Florida is the first time we have identified the virus in a
non-contiguous area," said Dr. David Ostroff, the coordinator for West Nile
virus surveillance at CDC, "and the first time its spread has been
identified during a time of year that is not the tail-end of when birds are
migrating. In June and July in northern Florida there is not much bird
migration going on. " In total 5 other states that previously reported
positive tests for West Nile virus have discovered new cases this year; they
are New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland and Rhode Island. With the
addition of Florida, a total of 12 states and the nation's capital have now
confirmed cases of the virus since it was first discovered in this country
in New York in 1999. The other states are New Hampshire, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Virginia. Last year, the virus
spread virtually county-by-county from one state to the next, down the East
Coast, Dr. Ostroff said.
Experts say it is too early in the mosquito season to estimate how far the
virus will spread this year or how many people are likely to become
infected. But as more states have reported West Nile virus, health and
agriculture agencies have been able to sketch a map of where it would very
likely spread down the Eastern Seaboard. Dr. Ostroff stated that: "We had
positive findings not only throughout the State of New York in all but one
county but as far to the northeast as New Hampshire and as far south as
South Carolina, and we had positive findings in all those contiguous states.
When you look to see what happened in 2000, the virus expanded its
geographic range considerably from the year before."
Florida health officials say they have been bracing for the arrival of the
virus, given its southern movement, and have now stepped up efforts to
control its spread and to tell people about its potential dangers. "We fully
expected the virus to spread from the New York epicenter outward," said Dr.
Steven Wiersma, an epidemiologist with the Florida State Department of
Health. Dr. Wiersma said that officials had particularly tried to reduce the
potential impact of the virus on the state's elderly residents, the group
most vulnerable to becoming ill if infected with the virus. The virus mostly
infects birds and mosquitoes but can also be contracted by animals and
people through mosquito bites. Most people who get it do not become ill or
experience only mild flu-like symptoms. But it can cause encephalitis and it
can be fatal, particularly for the elderly and people with weak immune
systems. In New York, the virus has killed 9 people and made 83 others ill.
Florida and many other states began developing preventive plans soon after
the virus spread beyond New York.
Most of the states have been aggressively testing mosquitoes and dead birds
and alerting health professionals to keep an eye out for patients who might
have symptoms of the virus. Some states have used aerial insecticide
spraying. Health officials urge people to use insect repellent, wear socks
and long sleeves and pants during periods of mosquito infestation, in July
and August, and eliminate sources of standing water near their homes, which
are insect breeding grounds. "We're optimistic that the strategies we've
employed over the last 2 years may be having some good results," said
Kristine Smith, spokeswoman for the New York Department of Health. In New
York this year, there have been no reports of people getting the virus and
only 2 reports of infected birds. But Ms. Smith said that while the numbers
are lower than those reported by this time last year, they did not indicate
that the virus had been contained. "We don't see illness until late July or
August," she said. From the late- summer mosquito season last year and the
end of 2000, the number of infected birds in New York rose to 1263 from 8,
with 14 people infected in that time.
