Pet fish released into the wild are thought to be the cause of a
virus outbreak that has killed nearly half the carp population at a
popular fishery.

Burghfield Match Lake, off Cottage Lane, has been completely fenced
off after the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture
(CEFAS) found koi herpes virus (KHV) had affected the venue's carp [Map at

Owner CEMEX Angling has put up a fence around the 3 acre lake, which
costs BP 10 [USD 21.8] a day to fish, and says the fishery will be
closed for the foreseeable future. The lake closed a week ago.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has
also placed a foot-and-mouth-style no-movement zone on neighbouring
lakes, banning the transfer of fish from lake to lake.

Mick Barnes, CEMEX Angling's general manager, said: "It will be
closed for as long as we need it closed to make sure the disease does
not get out and to make sure there's no possibility of reinfection.
It looks like 45 per cent of the carp could have gone."

Since it was 1st identified in 1998, outbreaks of KHV, which rot a
carp's gills and fins, have decimated fish stocks in lakes across the country.

In a statement, CEMEX Angling said: "CEFAS has confirmed that as no
stocking has taken place at the site for the past 3 years, the likely
source of the infection is an illegal introduction of pet fish from a
member of the public."

The statement continues: "It is important to make people aware of the
risks associated with transferring pet fish into the wild. Anglers
need to realise just how easily disease can be transferred and wipe
out important fisheries, and it is important they now take the
necessary precautions to help minimise the risk of further
contamination by air drying their nets thoroughly after each fishing
session and before entering new water."

Other lakes in the no-movement zone include CEMEX's Blue Pool,
Burghfield Main Lake, Burghfield Pit Two and Reading and District
Angling Association's (RDAA) Cottage Lane, Farnham Flint, Englefied
Lagoon and Pingewood Lagoon.

Piers Kernoghan of RDAA said: "Anyone who is fishing the lakes within
that area, please, please, please do not think that moving a fish
from one lake to another, if it looks in good healthy condition or
not, may save its life. You may well be doing more harm than good. If
you see any signs of distressed fish, report it to the controlling
club, to the EA or CEFAS."

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a herpesvirus infection capable of
inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp.

KHV was 1st isolated in the UK in 2000 during a disease outbreak in
northern England. Outbreaks of clinical disease with signs similar to
KHV disease had been reported in 1998 and 1999. More KHV outbreaks
were confirmed in each of the years 2001-2003 using PCR and cell
culture-based assays. Later, KHV DNA was detected in tissue samples
taken in 1996 during an unexplained mass-mortality of koi and common
carp in the UK.
