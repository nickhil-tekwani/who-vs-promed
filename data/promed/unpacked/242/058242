West Nile virus activity: United States, 14--20 Nov 2001
--------------------------------------------------------
The following report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data
reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through
ArboNET and verified by states and other jurisdictions as of Tue 20 Nov 2001.
During the week of 14 to 20 Nov 2001, 3 human cases of WNV encephalitis or
meningitis were reported -- from Massachusetts (2) and New Jersey (1).
During the same period, WNV infections were reported in 87 crows, 23 other
birds, and 13 horses. A total of 3 WNV positive mosquito pools were
reported from 2 states (Georgia and Ohio).
In 2001, a total of 48 human cases of WNV encephalitis or meningitis have
been reported in New York (12), Florida (10), New Jersey (7), Connecticut
(6), Maryland (6), Pennsylvania (3), Massachusetts (2), Georgia (1), and
Louisiana (1). Among these 48 cases, 27 (56 per cent) were males (median
age 70 years; range: 36 to 90); dates of illness onset ranged from 13 Jul
to 15 Oct 2001; and 5 patients (10 per cent) died.
In 2001, a total of 4604 crows and 1497 other birds with WNV infection were
reported from 27 states and the District of Columbia.
In 2001, 189 WNV infections in other animals (all horses) have been
reported from 15 states (Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia).
In 2001, 756 WNV positive mosquito pools were reported from 15 states
(Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia) and the District of Columbia.
Additional information about WNV activity is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and

The WNV season is ending, so this is the last week of publication of weekly
