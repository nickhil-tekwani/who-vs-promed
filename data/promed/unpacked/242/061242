- New protocol for microcephaly related to Zika virus infection. 8 Dec 2015. The Secretariat for Health Surveillance of the Ministry of Health issued the following protocol [to document cases of microcephaly possibly related to Zika virus infection]:
1. Pregnant woman with possible Zika virus infection during gestation.
2. Fetus with changes in head circumference possibly related to the infection.
3. Spontaneous abortion due to possible association with Zika virus infection during gestation.
4. Neonatal death due to possible association with Zika virus infection during gestation.
5. Recently born alive with microcephaly possibly associated with Zika virus infection during gestation.

The full protocol is available at

Although the state does not require notification of microcephaly cases, 5 municipalities have reported 18 suspected cases: Campinas 10 cases, Sao Paulo 4 cases, Santo Andre 2 cases, Guarulhos 1 case, Olimpia 1 case. There is no confirmation of Zika virus infection, but samples have been sent to the Instituto Adolfo Lutz, the state reference laboratory for testing.

[Another 9 Dec 2015 report quotes the Sao Paulo state Secretary of Health as stating that there are 54 cases of microcephaly in the state, a number that is within the mean annual number of cases within the past 5 years. None of the current cases of microcephaly are confirmed as associated with Zika virus infections (http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2015/12/secretario-diz-que-casos-em-sp-de-microcefalia-estao-dentro-da-media.html in Portuguese).

[There is just one additional case of Zika virus infection reported over the past 3 weeks, so it does not appear that the infection is spreading very rapidly here.

The ministry has sent samples to the USA CDC for confirmation.

[It is a bit difficult to reconcile the difference in case counts, but it may be due to different reporting dates, with a delay in reporting from the Ministry.

[It will be interesting to see if microcephaly cases occur that are associated with Zika virus infections of women in their 1st trimester of pregnancy not only in Brazil, but where other cases of Zika virus infections are occurring. - Mod.TY]
