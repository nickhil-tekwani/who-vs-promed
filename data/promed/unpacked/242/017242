A medical review committee chaired by an external senior hepatologist has found that a hepatitis C infection could not be ruled out as a contributing factor to the death of a 5th patient following a viral outbreak of hepatitis C at the Singapore General Hospital, local media reported on Monday, 19 Oct 2015.

The hospital had revealed the viral outbreak in its renal wards earlier in October 2015, saying that 4 of the 8 deaths out of the 22 affected patients had been linked to the viral infection. A 5th death had been under investigation then, and may now also be linked to the hepatitis C infection.

"The committee concluded that the patient passed away from end-stage renal disease and pneumonia. While the death was not caused directly by hepatitis C virus, the committee could not rule out the possibility that hepatitis C virus infection could have been a contributing factor," TODAYonline reported SGH Medical Board chairman Professor Fong Kok Yong saying.

Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said on Saturday, 17 Oct 2015, that international experts will be invited to advise the Independent Review Committee investigating the outbreak, so as to ensure that the review is thoroughly done.

"The Committee will also look at the processes in both SGH and the Ministry of Health to identify whether there are any gaps and areas that we can improve upon so that we can strengthen our system," Mr Gan told The Straits Times.

The hospital had previously contacted almost 1000 people for hepatitis C screenings. 484 patients and 294 hospital employees have tested negative. The test results for 88 other cases are still pending. More tests will be done as the hospital schedules appointments for more patients, as well as for hospital staff currently on overseas leave.

[Hepatitis C is spread primarily by blood, either by transfusion or through contaminated needles from illicit drug use or tattooing. Outbreaks of hepatitis B in the nosocomial setting have occurred from contaminated multidose vials and from logistical issues, e.g., glucosometers. Not enough information is given about the possible mode of transmission of the cluster that has been recognized in the hemodialysis patients, and we do not know whether the HCV infections have been shown to be genetically linked. Perhaps a multidose heparin or other medication vial could be postulated to cause the cluster in the dialysis patients, but it is not clear at all why so many patients and hospital employees have been screened.

Additionally, death directly related to hepatitis C infection is almost never associated with acute HCV infection; indeed most cases of acute infection are not recognized, as they are subclinical or anicteric [unaccompanied by jaundice - CopyEd.PG]. Mortality is usually attributable to HCV only decades later, when cirrhosis of the liver and/or hepatocellular carcinoma occur.

More information is clearly needed to sort out this cluster. - Mod.LL
