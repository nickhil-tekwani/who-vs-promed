BASE: A New Form of Mad Cow Disease Discovered in 2 Italian Cows
----------------------------------------------------------------
Italian scientists have found a 2nd form of mad cow disease that more
closely resembles the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) than the usual
cow form of the illness. The brain-wasting diseases bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE)-- also known as mad cow disease -- and human CJD are
caused by different forms of mutant proteins called prions. A number of
people, mainly in the United Kingdom, have also suffered from what is
called variant CJD [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail],
a brain disease believed to be acquired by eating meat from infected cows.
Now a team of Italian researchers reports a study of 8 cows with mad cow
disease that found 2 of them had brain damage resembling the human victims
of CJD. They said the cows were infected with prions that resembled those
involved in the standard form of the human disease, called sporadic CJD,
not the variant caused by eating infected meat. Salvatore Monaco, lead
author of the new study, said the findings may indicate that cattle can
also develop a sporadic form of the disease, but it might also be a new
foodborne form of the illness.
Dr. Paul Brown of the National Institutes of Health said the finding does
not indicate an increased threat to humans. If a new form of the disease
were affecting humans, there would be an increase in the incidence of CJD,
said Brown, who was not part of the research team. However, scientists in
Europe have studied all cases of sporadic CJD for the last decade, and the
incidence has not changed, said Brown, an expert in the disease, who works
at the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke.
Both the human and cattle diseases cause holes to form in the brain. The
Italian researchers found that, in addition to the holes, 2 cows had an
accumulation of amyloid plaque in their brains. Amyloid plaques are an
indication of Alzheimer's disease in humans. They have also been found in
people with sporadic CJD but had not been found in cattle, the researchers
said. the Italian research workers named the new form with amyloid plaques
as bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE). "Although observed
in only 2 cattle, the BASE phenotype could be more common than expected,"
they reported. Monaco said that he believes that the incidence could be as
high as 5 percent among cattle with mad cow symptoms.
But while human CJD and BASE share several characteristics, the Italian
researchers cautioned against assuming a link between them. The findings
of the team led by Monaco, of the Department of Neurological and Visual
Science, Policlinico G.B. Rossi, in Verona, Italy, are reported in this
week's online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.

Dr. Paul Brown said there have also been some unpublished reports from
Japan of cows with a different form of mad cow disease.
The 1st case of mad cow disease in the United States was reported in
December 2003 in Washington state, involving a cow imported from Canada. An
investigation seeking other cattle from the same herd ended last week with
Agriculture officials saying they had located all but 11 suspect animals
and concluding the rest could not be found.

Abstract: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion
diseases, are mammalian neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a
post-translational conversion and brain accumulation of an insoluble,
protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc) of the host-encoded cellular prion
protein (PrP/C). Human and animal TSE agents exist as different phenotypes
that can be biochemically differentiated on the basis of the molecular mass
of the protease-resistant PrP/Sc fragments and the degree of glycosylation.
Epidemiological, molecular, and transmission studies strongly suggest that
the single strain of agent responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) has infected humans, causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The
unprecedented biological properties of the BSE agent, which circumvents the
so-called "species barrier" between cattle and humans and adapts to
different mammalian species, has raised considerable concern for human
health. To date, it is unknown whether more than one strain might be
responsible for cattle TSE or whether the BSE agent undergoes phenotypic
variation after natural transmission. Here we provide evidence of a second
cattle TSE. The disorder was pathologically characterized by the presence
of PrP-immunopositive amyloid plaques, as opposed to the lack of amyloid
deposition in typical BSE cases, and by a different pattern of regional
distribution and topology of brain PrPSc accumulation. In addition, Western
blot analysis showed a PrP/Sc type with predominance of the low molecular
mass glycoform and a protease-resistant fragment of lower molecular mass
than BSE-PrP/Sc. Strikingly, the molecular signature of this previously
undescribed bovine PrP/Sc was similar to that encountered in a distinct
subtype of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
It should be emphasized that both Italian cows, one 15 years old and one
11, appeared healthy. Their unusual strain was discovered only because
Italy tests all cattle over 30 months old slaughtered for human food. By
August 2003, it had tested 1.6 million and found 103 that tested positive
for prions. - Mod.CP]
