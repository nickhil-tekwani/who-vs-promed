Increased Number of CJD Deaths in Switzerland in 2001
-----------------------------------------------------
The Neue Zurcher Zeitung reported on Mon 24 Dec 2001 that the number of
deaths from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has increased in Switzerland in
2001. It is thought, however, that there is little link between this
increase and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). On average, there have
been 8 to 10 deaths from CJD per year over the past 10 years, but in 2001
the number of deaths rose to 19.

[Additional information from the Swiss Press (German and French)
(<http://www.nzz.ch/2001/12/24/il/page-article7VEO6.html>, and
<http://www.edicom.ch/news/suisse/011223131057.su.shtml>) mentioned that
there are an additional 5 suspect cases for the year awaiting confirmation.
These articles mentioned that all of the cases reported during 2001 were
over 60 years of age, further supporting the interpretation that these
cases do not represent an outbreak of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail, linked to the
occurrence ofBSE in Switzerland. The doubling in reported cases mentioned
in the Neue Zurcher Zeitung article is still of concern as classical CJD
(non-BSE associated) transmission has been linked to biologics (human
growth hormone) and other medical procedures including such procedures as
corneal transplantation. - Mod. MPP]
