["_Bonamia exitiosa_ is a Haplosporidia protozoan parasite infecting haemocytes of several oyster species and inducing physiological disorders and eventually death of the animal." http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bonamia_exitiosa.htm.

In 2013, infection with _B. exitiosa_ was reported for the 1st time in USA; 2 events were notified, the 1st one was located in North Carolina (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=12246) and the 2nd in Massachusetts (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=14070).

A 2013 publication by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William and Mary, and the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, Rutgers University, available at http://www.vims.edu/people/carnegie_rb/pubs/BexitiosaAdvisory_VIMS.HSRL_11Sept2013_FINAL1.pdf noted that:

"While _B. exitiosa_ does not appear to be a serious pathogen of _C. virginica_, its emergence in _C. virginica_ warrants attention from pathologists, resource managers, and the aquaculture community.

"We recommend that screening for _B. exitiosa_ (preferably by PCR) be conducted in _C. virginica_ seed and broodstock destined for interstate transfer, particularly when originating from the Southeast or New England, and that oysters positive for _B. exitiosa_ not be transferred to areas free of the parasite. Determination of the distribution of _B. exitiosa_ in wild and cultured _C. virginica_ populations in the eastern USA should be a priority." - Mod.CRD
