Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Korea (Rep. of)
---------------------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 6 Oct 2008 from Dr Chang-Seob
Kim, CVO & Director, Animal Health Team, Ministry of Food,
Agriculture, Forestry (MIFAFF), Gwacheon-city, Korea (Rep. of)

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Start date: 3 Oct 2008
Date of first confirmation of the event: 4 Oct 2008
Report date: 6 Oct 2008
Date submitted to OIE: 6 Oct 2008
Date event resolved: 4 Oct 2008
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 23 Nov 2007
Causal agent: low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Outbreak 1 YeSan-gun, Oga-myun, Ch'ungch'Ong-Namdo [Southern Chungcheong]
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Oct 2008
Outbreak status: resolved (4 Oct 2008)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: birds
Susceptible: 5000
Cases: --
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 5000
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: a parent stock duck farm

Outbreak statistics
Species: birds
Apparent morbidity rate: **
Apparent mortality rate: 0 percent
Apparent case fatality rate: **
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 100 percent

* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: as part of the on-going control measures
for avian influenza in the Republic of Korea, surveillance has been
conducted since September [2008] in all parent stock duck farms. On 3
[Oct 2008], faecal samples from a parent stock duck farm proved
positive to avian influenza antigen. But antibody test results of
samples from blood and eggs were negative. The virus was identified
as low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] virus subtype H5N2 by
haemagglutination test (HA), neuraminidase gene typing, and gene
sequencing of cleavage site of the HA gene on 4 Oct 2008. As a
preventive measure, ducks in the farm were stamped out and the farm
was disinfected.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Research Quarantine
Service (NVRQS) (national laboratory)
Species: birds
Test: gene sequencing
Test date: 4 Oct 2008
Result: positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[We are very happy to have official confirmation of the cause of this
event and it turns out to NOT be highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) H5N1. Low pathogenicity H5 and H7 strains of the influenza
virus must be reported to the OIE, hence this very useful piece of information.

As noted by Mod.AS in an earlier posting, South Korea recently
declared itself free of H5N1, in August 2008. There will likely be a
great deal of concern from poultry farmers that the avian influenza
virus has found its way right back into the population. In this case
though, the occurrence of low pathogenicity H5N2, when eliminated
from the avian population, is not necessarily a cause for grave
concern. It is however, the requirement of OIE that all H5s and H7s
are reported in order to track the HPAI risk situation on a global basis.
