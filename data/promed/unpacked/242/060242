DENGUE -ECUADOR
===============

From: Abramo Ottolenghi <ottolenghi.1@osu.edu>
According to the March 15 internet edition of El Comercio [newspaper] in
Quito, Ecuador, during this rainy season there have been 288 cases of dengue
diagnosed in the country. 179 of them in the province of Manabi, 77 in Los
Rios, 26 in El Oro and 6 in Guayas. It is also reported that since 1988
there have been two million cases of clasical dengue diagnosed. The
information was obtained from the System for the Eradication of Malaria and
other Vectors. (Note: 2 million cases over 10 years in a country of ca. 12
million inhabitants? Hard to believe).

[I do not know whether the numbers are correct but they are not difficult for
me to believe. Given that there are four distinct dengue viruses (dengue-1,
dengue-2, dengue-3, and dengue-4, and that cross-protection against the
others is not conferred by infection with any one, multiple
infections can and do occur. This is the principle problem with regard to
dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, i.e., sequential infections
leading to unique and increasing pathogenicity. For example, using the
numbers above, again which I do not know to be correct, 2 million cases/10
years = 200,000/year but if there are four types circulating (very doubtful
or we might have heard), that would make for 50,000 cases/12 million
inhabitants, 5 cases/1200 residents. Possible, but very unlikely. Does
anyone have data other than from a newspaper? Both CDC and Cuban
investigators were involved in studies of dengue in Ecuador a few years
ago. Thanks to the sharp eyes of Abramo for finding this. -- Mod CHC]
