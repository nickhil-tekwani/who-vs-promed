Suspected viral hemorrhagic fever: Zimbabwean soldier returned from Congo DR
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A member of the Zimbabwe National Army who had just arrived from the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) died at Parirenyatwa Hospital on Sun 17
Mar 2002 from a suspected viral hemorrhagic fever. Confirming the death of
the patient yesterday, the deputy minister of health and child wealth, Dr
David Parirenyatwa, said that results of diagnostic tests would [not be
available before Thu 21 Mar 2002. A sample taken from the patient was sent
to South Africa yesterday for laboratory analysis.
Viral hemorrhagic fevers include the highly infectious and deadly Ebola
fever, Marburg fever, and Rift Valley fever. Ebola is spread through
contact with bodily fluids including saliva. Initial symptoms are flu-like
and progress to include headaches and bleeding (for example, rectal). More
than 50 people have died of Ebola fever in Central Africa, including the
DRC, a key partner of Zimbabwe. Recent outbreaks of Ebola fever have also
been reported in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo.
Dr Parirenyatwa said all health staff that came into contact with the
patient were now under observation. "We have taken all necessary
precautions to protect those that came into contact with the patient. Those
who were working in the ward were given the necessary protective clothing,"
said Dr Parirenyatwa.
He said the Government has designated Harare City Council's Wilkins
Hospital for such cases because most of the health institutions have no
isolation facilities to handle them. The patient was admitted
to Parirenyatwa Hospital on Friday last week after exhibiting symptoms
identified with [viral hemorrhagic fever. Dr Parirenyatwa warned members
of the public, especially those who will have travelled to the Great Lakes
region, to look out for such symptoms.

[One assumes that the soldier was deployed in the Great Lakes Region, which
is on the opposite side of the DRC from where the current outbreak of Ebola
fever in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo is occurring. There was (and
may continue to be) an unexplained outbreak of Marburg fever in the Great
Lakes Region in the DRC 1999/2000 that should be on the suspected list of
etiologies, as well as the usual hemorrhagic suspects, including malaria
and yellow fever. During the first outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in
the DRC, suspected cases among returning soldiers in both Zimbabwe and
Namibia were reported, but none was found to be positive for the disease.
Information about the results of the testing would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP
[This report must be considered with caution until a diagnosis is confirmed
by laboratory tests. There is no information other than the military
occupation of the deceased to favour a diagnosis of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever. The outbreak of Ebola fever in Uganda in 2000 was similarly
attributed in the beginning to troops returning from service in the DRC,
and subsequently shown to be incorrect. The current Ebola fever outbreak in
the border region between Gabon and the Republic of the Congo is in a
thinly populated region with difficult access and remote from military
activity. - Mod.CP
