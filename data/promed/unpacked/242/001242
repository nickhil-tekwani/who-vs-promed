Foot and mouth disease [FMD] has spread across nearly half of Vietnam,
affecting farmers already hit hard by the bird flu outbreaks of recent
years, local and international veterinary officials said. The virus has
spread to 30 of Vietnam's 64 provinces and cities in recent weeks, the
agriculture ministry said in an online report.
Almost 27 000 pigs, buffalos, and cows have been infected across the
country, and more than 10 000 have been culled so far this year, the
ministry said.
The Asia-1 strain is also present in China and Mongolia, affecting draft
animals such as buffalo and reducing meat and milk yields of cattle, said
UN Food and Agriculture Organisation livestock specialist Jeffrey Gilbert.
"This strain hasn't been around for a while, so there is no herd immunity,"
he said. "Therefore it'll spread faster and hit harder."
The disease is highly contagious and can be transmitted through the air and
on car tires, making it difficult to contain.
"It comes at a bad time when people are already struggling and much of the
focus has been on avian influenza," said Gilbert. "Poultry flocks have been
decimated and now you see an outbreak affecting cattle, pigs and buffalos.
It's another blow to the agricultural sector. The wave will pass, but it'll
leave a certain destruction in its wake."
FMD affects cattle, pigs, sheep, and other cloven-hoofed livestock. It is
not usually fatal but causes losses in the production of meat and milk.
Vietnam's president, Tran Duc Luong, last week told state agencies to fight
the disease through better monitoring, culling sick animals, and
vaccinating healthy ones, and stopping the trade and transport of infected
animals.
Agriculture minister Cao Duc Phat admitted the government had been
"passive" in fighting the outbreak but vowed tough measures to contain it,
the Ho Chi Minh City newspaper Phap Luat (Law) reported. "If we cannot
control the situation, I will take responsibility before the government and
the people," Phat was quoted as saying.

[To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mention of the identity of
the FMD virus serotype currently involved in the Vietnamese major epizootic.
According to article 1.1.2.3 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code,
member states are required to notify in case there is "evidence of change
in the epidemiology of a listed disease (including host range,
pathogenicity, strain)", as well as "a sudden and unexpected increase in
the distribution, incidence, morbidity or mortality of a listed disease
prevalent within a country or zone/compartment". If FMD virus, serotype
Asia-1 has indeed been identified, both conditions apply in the current
Vietnamese FMD situation -- prescribing an immediate official notification,
which is expected to include data on the causative agent.
In the absence of official information, the diseases remains "suspected" by
default. - Mod.AS]
