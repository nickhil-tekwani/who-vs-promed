Flu outbreak could force total slaughter
----------------------------------------
Federal officials are contemplating destroying all the poultry inside a
Fraser Valley "high-risk zone" after avian flu was confirmed at a 4th farm
Tuesday and suspected at a 5th.
The 5 farms affected by avian flu so far are among 21 in the hot zone
bounded by the Fraser River, Sumas Mountain, Highway 11, and Clayburn Road,
an area that is about 8 by 10 kms.
An official with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency -- the federal agency
in charge of eliminating the disease -- admitted Tuesday that a contingency
plan to wipe out all poultry in the zone has been considered.
Cornelius Kiley, a veterinarian with the agency, said any "prudent group"
attempting to control the spread of such an infectious disease would
consider such a possibility.
However, Kiley would not say whether the contingency plan is about to be
implemented, as some poultry farmers in the area fear. The plan would mean
killing approximately 110 000 more birds, in addition to the approximately
90 000 killed already or slated to be killed.
Calvin Breukelman, president of the B.C. Broiler Hatching Egg Producers
Association, said the CFIA has told him a mass kill-off is a possibility at
this point.
"We know it's on the table," he said, but added: "You could take action and
be pro-active but there's no guarantee it (the flu) may not spread outside
(the zone).
Breukelman, who has a 16 000-chicken broiler farm in the high-risk zone,
said all the broiler farmers in the region are concerned about the further
spread of avian flu and the possibility their chickens will be killed as a
precaution.
The 17 poultry farms within the hot zone that so far are free of the
disease contain about 110 000 birds. They include an important
turkey-breeder farm with 12 000 birds that supplies eggs to 70 percent of
B.C.'s turkey growers and a Leghorn chicken farm with 17 000 birds that
supplies the majority of eggs used by producers in that sector.
A total of 30 000 chickens will be killed on the 2 latest farms confirmed
Tuesday to have avian flu or suspected of it. One farm will lose 22 000
birds; the other 8000. The destruction of birds from these 2 farms will
bring the total number of birds killed to 90 000 since the disease first
broke out a month ago [during February 2004].
Around the perimeter of the high-risk region, concrete barriers block road
access and residents and visitors are directed to go through 1 of 3
decontamination stations equipped with disinfecting facilities.
The stations are staffed by CFIA inspectors and people leaving the zone are
asked whether they have visited a poultry farm. Those entering the zone are
waved through with no questions asked.
