Red squirrels face new threat of fatal pox
------------------------------------------
The native red squirrel population of Northern Ireland is facing a
fresh threat in the shape of a fatal disease. Squirrel pox, which is
carried by the non-native grey squirrel, has been confirmed as the
cause of death for a native red squirrel in Tollymore Forest Park,
County Down. The disease is carried and spread by grey squirrels which
are immune to its effects. It has destroyed native red squirrel
populations in other parts of the UK.

Senior Wildlife Inspector Dr Declan Looney from the NI Environmental
Agency said: "This is the 1st recorded instance of a red squirrel
dying from this disease on the island of Ireland and it is a very
worrying development. Our native red squirrel population is under
extreme pressure at the moment as a result of the population explosion
of the grey."

The grey squirrel is immune to the disease.

"The diseased red squirrel was 1st spotted by members of the
Tollymore Red Squirrel Group. We would ask the public across Northern
Ireland to be vigilant and immediately report any red squirrels
showing signs of the disease to the NIEA wildlife team or to a member
of the NI Squirrel forum."

The decline of red squirrels in the UK is blamed primarily on the
effects of squirrel pox as well as the loss of habitat and competition
from grey squirrels.

A spokesperson for the Forest Service, which is a member of the NI
Squirrel Forum said: "We are hoping that the early detection of the
disease by the Tollymore Red Squirrel Group will help to limit the
impact of this outbreak. We are continuing to work with NIEA and the
Tollymore Red Squirrel Group on the implementation of control
measures."

[Squirrel pox is a viral disease affecting red squirrels, killing
them within 15 days of infection. It is carried by grey squirrels,
which show no symptoms of disease, so that they continue to thrive and
breed while carrying the virus. It is thought to have been brought
into Britain with grey squirrels introduced into southern England from
America in the early 20th century. Several pox-like disease outbreaks
in red squirrels were recorded over the decades, but the virus was 1st
confirmed during a disease outbreak in East Anglia in the 1980s and it
has since worked its way steadily northwards.
