Anthrax has been confirmed in dozens of cattle found dead in a nature park southeast of the Croatian capital of Zagreb, authorities said Saturday [16 Jul 2022].

Authorities conducted tests on the animal carcasses after reports that the cattle had developed neurological symptoms, the Ministry of Agriculture said. It said all measures were being taken to contain the outbreak in Lonjsko Polje, a flood plain by the Sava River known for its unique environment.

The state HRT television reported that 4 people also have been hospitalized with skin infections. The report said 107 cattle have died in the past 2 weeks.

"We can say that the case is under complete control and there is no room for panic," said local public health official Inoslav Brkić.

Spores of anthrax can lie dormant in the ground until they are ingested by animals or activated when the soil is disturbed by heavy rain, flooding, or drought. Outbreaks can kill a large number of animals in a short time. Infected livestock often are found dead with no illness detected.

Anthrax rarely spreads to humans and almost never is transmitted from person to person. About 95% of all human cases of anthrax result from skin contact with infected animals. It can be treated with antibiotics but can be fatal if left untreated.

After the PU of Sisak-Moslavina [Sisacko-Moslavacka] stated in its press release that 58 cows died while grazing freely in the area of the Lonjsko Polje Nature Park, we spoke with a farmer from Donji Selo near the settlement of Osekovo in the wider area of Popovača.

"One of my 35 cows died 10 days ago. They were grazing freely in Lonjsko Polje on an area of 1500 hectares. Then my brother and I, who also have 35 cows, thought that the cause was clover," 35-year-old [NR] told us. "After that, 2 or 3 days later, 2 cows died, but they did not suspect any infection, but attributed that death to clover. The alarm was raised when cows started dying en masse during the night for the last 3 days.

"Every night, between 10 and 12 cows died in the field, because many farmers besides my brother and I keep cows there. From our village alone, apart from the 2 of us, 15 other owners keep them in Lonjsko Polje. Interestingly, not a single calf or horse that was grazing there died," [NR] tells us, whose 5 cows died and Agroproteinka employees took them away. "In addition to the 5 dead, one cow disappeared, while 3 cows owned by my brother's OPG also died, and 2 were missing." After that, the brothers removed all the cattle from the pasture and divided them into 2 groups that are in isolation where they are for the 5th day until it is determined whether the infection has spread.

While we were talking, the brother, 27, who had blisters on his hands called from the hospital where they confirmed that he was infected with typhoid fever or anthrax.

"My brother and I, when the inspectors came, caught one cow that was suspicious, and now it is obvious that the anthrax has spread to it as well. All of us who were in contact with the cows had to go for an examination to determine if we were also infected by any chance. Unfortunately, he got infected and stayed in the hospital, and luckily, I don't have any symptoms for now," [NR] told us, adding that it is obvious that the brothers came in contact with the saliva of the cow they caught. He said that in addition to saliva, anthrax can be transmitted from person to person through droplets.

The police conducted an investigation in cooperation with the veterinary inspection of the State Inspectorate.

The number of dead cattle in the Lonjsko Polje Nature Park is increasing, and according to unofficial information, 107 cattle have died since the beginning of July [2022]. In the meantime, the Ministry of Agriculture announced that the dead cattle from Lonjsko Polje had anthrax.

"The Public Health Institute took samples from the sick patient; today [16 Jul 2022] they are taking samples from these 3 more patients. As of this morning, we have confirmation of anthrax in one cow. This is the confirmation of the analysis carried out by the Croatian Veterinary Institute. We can say that the case is under complete control, there is no room for panic. The Ministry of Agriculture will take all necessary actions related to the sale of livestock and animal products," Inoslav Brkić, head of the Institute of Public Health of the Sisak-Moslavina County, told HRT. All the patients had cutaneous anthrax.

The Ministry of Agriculture announced that in the cattle that died in the area of the Lonjsko Polje Nature Park, smallpox or anthrax was confirmed. The Ministry reported that, considering that a large number of animals died in the area of the Lonjsko polje Pasnjaka Osekovo Nature Park, and the deaths were preceded by the appearance of neurological clinical signs, it ordered the exhumation of the carcasses of the 2 dead animals and the taking of a sample for laboratory diagnostics in order to rule out femur and taking brain samples to rule out rabies and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

The dissection of the carcasses of dead animals and the laboratory analysis of samples from dead animals were carried out by the Croatian Veterinary Institute in Zagreb. Today [16 Jul 2022], the Ministry received the results of the necropsy, as well as the results of the laboratory tests, which confirmed the death of cattle.

In the joint coordination of the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Inspectorate, further activities and measures are being implemented in the area of the Osekovo pastures, Lonjsko Polje Nature Park, with the aim of preventing the spread and suppression of the infectious disease, according to the press release.

["Lonjsko Polje (English: Lonja Field) is the largest protected wetland in both Croatia and the entire Danube basin. It covers an area of 505.6 square kilometres (195.2 sq mi), extending along the river Sava from the areas east of Sisak, the lower course of the river Lonja for which it is named, to the areas west of Nova Gradiška, along the course of the river Veliki Strug. The area of Lonjsko Polje is designated a nature park (park prirode), a kind of protected area in Croatia. The institution was established in 1998, and it is based in the village of Jasenovac. According to the criteria of the Birds Directive of the European Union, the park is an important habitat for birds (important birds area: IBA)."
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonjsko_Polje)

So far we have a confirmation of anthrax in livestock in the park and of a limited number of human cutaneous cases. As to what initiated this severe outbreak we have yet to learn. Based on personal experience, and especially in the Northwest Territory of Canada, I suspect that they have had a long-term experience with anthrax in the area, and that this incident has been exacerbated by a plenitude of blood-feeding Tabanid flies, taking the infection from animal to animal. Anthrax deaths in wildlife can be easily missed, but when private livestock are affected, it gets reported. The latter should have been subjected to routine annual vaccination and the carcasses burnt, if possible, and otherwise buried.

One last word of advice: if you suspect anthrax, do NOT necropsy the carcass. It puts you at severe risk and grossly contaminates a wider area of soil which should be chemically sterilised. Take blood samples or swabs for laboratory confirmation. Swabbing the nasal turbinates is a sound alternative. We have had positive turbinates from skulls out in the sun for 3-4+ years. - Mod.MHJ
