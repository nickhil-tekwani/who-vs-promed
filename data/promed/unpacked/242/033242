Yellow rust population changes
------------------------------
The yellow rust picture is complex this year [2016] with experts unclear as to whether new strains have emerged. Infection levels have been exceptionally high [see also ProMED-mail post 20160621.4299957], with varieties having high scores for resistance succumbing and some supposedly susceptible varieties doing better than expected.

NIAB's [National Institute of Agricultural Botany] Dr Sarah Holdgate said, "There has almost certainly been a change in the population of yellow rust. Is this because of some new variants we saw towards the end of last year [2015] or something we've not seen before? There's almost certainly been a change in race. Initial testing of [variety] Reflection has shown multiple races on the same leaf; we need to tease out the different races. With such a disease population anything is possible."

James Gaines of Agronomy Supplies said he has seen untreated trials where 80 per cent of varieties were affected. "I've never seen it in as many different varieties. A mutation must have occurred fairly recently leading to more varieties becoming susceptible. You can throw the Recommended List rating out of the window. It bears no relation to what's happening on farm. However, it is relatively easy to control if spray windows keep to a 3-week interval. Put a seed dressing on to eliminate winter carry over."

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

In the UK a stripe rust alert was issued earlier in 2016 (ProMED-mail post 20160621.4299957) and the non-European Kranich strain was reported for the 1st time in the country (ProMED-mail post 20160219.4033809). Recently, the European population of stripe rust has been changing due to invasion of predominantly Asian strains. However, in the report above, local mutations of already present strains are also being considered. Although currently the new host resistance breaking variants can apparently be controlled with frequent fungicide sprays, such a situation, in turn, increases the risk of fungicide resistant mutants arising in the pathogen population.

The emergence of new stripe rust strains is currently also suspected in the USA (ProMED-mail post 20160610.4277039).
