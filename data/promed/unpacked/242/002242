A school-aged child was sent to the hospital after swimming in a lake with toxic algae. It is the only case like it in Minnesota in recent memory, and it has experts offering a warning as the July Fourth holiday weekend approaches.

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency [MPCA] and the Minnesota Department of Health said the incident happened in early June [2015]. The child had been swimming in Lake Henry in Alexandria and later showed symptoms of contact with toxic algae. The child had to be admitted to the hospital, but has since been treated and released.

At this time of year, Lake Henry is a daily destination for [a woman] and her 2-year-old grandson. "I come down here every day," she said. "I like how peaceful it is. I like how there's other little kids, normally, to play with."

And while warning signs are posted, they're also easy to miss. [The woman] had no idea another child had been sickened by toxic algae on the lake just last month [June 2015].

Also in June [2015], at least 1 dog died at another nearby lake. The culprit in both cases is believed to be that murky muck known as blue-green algae.

The summer heat and sun mean its peak season for such algae blooms, and the toxic growth can pop up in warm, shallow waters across central and southern Minnesota.

"It can be blue, it can be green -- sometimes it's red or gray. There's all sorts of colors. The name is misleading. But if you see a lot of it, stay out of the way," said Pam Anderson, a supervisor in the Water Quality Monitoring Unit at the MPCA.

Anderson said judging such blooms by sight alone is nearly impossible.

"We have no way to predict when they're toxic or if they're toxic by looking at them. So it might be a pretty nasty bloom that's OK, or it might be a not-so-bad bloom that actually is toxic," Anderson said.

The mantra from experts is simply, "If in doubt, stay out."

[The child's grandmother] said she plans to simply keep her eyes peeled. "Maybe I'll go to a different lake -- I don't know. I like this lake though," she said.

While a human case being linked to blue-green algae is rare in Minnesota, experts said the symptoms are so similar to other illnesses that many other cases may very well go unreported. Common symptoms of algae bloom sickness include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, eye irritation, a cough, sore throat, and headache.

If you're exposed to blue-green algae toxins, or get any of these symptoms, it's recommended that you contact your doctor.

Young children and dogs are most at-risk of illness from toxic algae.

Blue-green algae, also known as Cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as "pond scum." Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.

When environmental conditions are just right, blue-green algae can grow very quickly in number. Most species are buoyant and will float to the surface, where they form scum layers or floating mats. When this happens, we call this a "blue-green algae bloom." Blue-green algae blooms generally occur between mid-June and late September, although in rare instances, blooms have been observed in winter, even under the ice.

Many different species of blue-green algae occur in Minnesota waters, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp, _Aphanizomenon_ sp, _Microcystis_ sp, and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species present can change over the course of the season.

Blue-green algal toxins are naturally produced chemical compounds that sometimes are produced inside the cells of certain species of blue-green algae. These chemicals are not produced all of the time and there is no easy way to tell when blue-green algae are producing them and when they are not. When the cells are broken open, the toxins may be released. Sometimes this occurs when the cells die off naturally and they break open as they sink and decay in a lake or pond. Cells may also be broken open when the water is treated with chemicals meant to kill algae, and when cells are swallowed and mixed with digestive acids in the stomachs of people or animals.

Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appeared clear, if a "bloom" is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface, and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.

One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. _Microcystis_ can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin, microcystin. When _Microcystis_ die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

People swimming in dense _Microcystis_ blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US, however Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

_Microcystis_ blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. The blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). _Microcystis_ also require sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in blooms.

The most common route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, _Microcystis_ blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people that consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people that frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports _Microcystis_ blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of _Microcystis_ cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water and containing _Microcystis_ or ingesting algal mats.
