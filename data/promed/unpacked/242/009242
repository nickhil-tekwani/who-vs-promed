The spread of the equine herpes-like virus appeared to be stabilizing at
the Sha Tin training complex yesterday. Hong Kong Jockey Club director of
racing Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges confirmed there were 15 or 16 new cases
of inappetance but because some of those previously affected were now back
in work, the numbers affected were the same - in the mid 60s.
Engelbrecht-Bresges said: "We don't really see a change in the overall
numbers. We're monitoring the situation closely but we're not really
worried. For instance, declarations for Saturday are quite normal."
Engelbrecht-Bresges added they were only speculating at this stage that the
problem was an equine herpes virus.
"The symptoms are inappetance and some are getting a bit of fever. We are
speculating it is a herpes virus and our full vaccination program has kept
it contained so only some horses showing only mild symptoms."
Trainer Lawrie Fownes' stable was mentioned by Jockey Club officials during
racing on Wednesday night as one of the main sufferers, along with Alex
Wong Yu-on's yard. But Fownes was straight on the phone from his buying
mission at the Sydney Easter Yearling Sales to categorically deny this was
the case. Fownes said: "I was absolutely shocked when I heard that it had
been on television and in the papers that we were one of the main
sufferers. "It isn't the case at all. All we've had is a few horses not
eating who are now OK."
