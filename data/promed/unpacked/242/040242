The following is an excerpt from the United nations Integrated Regional
Information Networks (IRIN):
Officials told United Nations IRIN on Friday that 10 people have been
infected with anthrax following a fresh outbreak of the disease in eastern
Ethiopia. The sick are receiving treatment from the local health authority
after coming into contact with the bacteria. It is believed that this is
the largest number of people to be infected by anthrax in recent years. It
is also extremely rare for humans to become infected, the officials said.
The disease, which has also killed 15 cattle, first broke out in the
Fentale district of Oromiya Region, some 200 km from the capital Addis
Ababa, about 2 months ago. The area has also been hit by a serious drought.
Local agriculture officials thought they had brought the disease under
control through a major vaccination programme called ring treatment. But,
they told IRIN, there had now been a second outbreak and a renewed
vaccination campaign was due to start on Friday. "We have registered 15
cattle dead and 10 people are infected by anthrax, but there are no deaths
among the human beings," said Biruk Wolkeba, the district head at the
ministry of agriculture.
He added that people were undergoing a "mass treatment" in the Benti area
where the outbreak occurred. The International Livestock Research Institute
(ILRI) in Addis Ababa said it was extremely rare for people to become
infected from cattle. "It is is a deadly disease that is transmittable to
human beings but it is very rare for human beings to contract this
infection," the institute's Dr Yilma Jobre told IRIN. "It is a very
sporadic disease and does not affect the entire herd. It usually just
affects one or two animals."

[I wish human anthrax were truly as rare as Dr Jobre wants IRIN to believe
and as rare as I would like it to be. In Zambia and associated countries we
get 10 human cases per affected cow. In Central Russia, where the livestock
disease is sporadic and infrequent, we seem to get reports of exposed
humans under medical supervision in the range of 5-30+ per incident. In
Ethiopia the reports indicate parity at this time, but it was only a few
years ago in Afar when there were extensive human cases. This report
indicates that the present series of cases may be outside the original
vaccination zone, unless they are revaccinating their stock. - Mod.MHJ]
