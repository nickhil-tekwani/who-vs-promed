An outbreak of chikungunya has been reported in some parts of
Rameswaram [Tamil Nadu state]. A team of entomologists, who visited
the island a few days ago and collected blood samples from affected
persons, has also confirmed the outbreak. V Uma Maheswarai, deputy
director, Health, Ramanathapuram, told 'The Hindu' on Tuesday [4 Aug
2009] that as many as 55 patients were screened to find out the cause
and types of fever. Most of them tested positive for chikungunya
[virus infection]. One patient tested positive for dengue fever. One
was affected with malaria.

Enormous breeding of mosquitoes in and around Natarajapuram area was
said to be the main cause for the outbreak of chikungunya and other
diseases. Based on the directive of the collector TN Hariharan,
fogging and spraying were done with the support of the Rameswaram Municipality.

A team of doctors and health officials had been asked to closely
monitor the affected areas and patients. The diseases had been
brought under control. There were reports that patients were
improving, officials said. Fogging would be undertaken in nearby
localities, including Verkodu and other fishermen hamlets also, in
order to prevent the spread of diseases. Health officials had been
directed to take preventive steps in all vulnerable areas.

The deputy director said that the mosquitoes, which were causing
[transmitting] chikungunya disease [virus], multiplied in pure water
kept in the open for several days. Those storing water for many days
should properly close the vessels and should not provide any
opportunity for breeding of mosquitoes.

[Outbreaks of chikungunya virus disease are popping up in disparate
parts of India this year (2009). Eliminating breeding sites in water
catchments in and immediately around buildings will be more effective
for halting chikungunya virus transmission over the long term than
insecticide fogging.
