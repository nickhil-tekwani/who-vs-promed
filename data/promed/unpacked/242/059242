A growing concern for many Kittitians over the past 3 or 4 years has been the decline of the coconut trees and other palms across the island. Melvin James, Department of Agriculture, stated that it is suspected that a disease, "bud rot," is affecting the plants but insists that they are not entirely sure.

James said: "We are working tirelessly in contacting the Jamaican Coconut Industry Board so we can send them a sample to get an idea of what we are working with." He also noted that the decline in prominence of the coconut palm is a major concern because the palms have become a symbol of St. Kitts, with many tourism logos and promotions using a palm tree.

He also explained that this disease differs from the disease that plagued the coconut trees in Nevis a number of years ago. "A lot of comparisons have been made between St. Kitts and Nevis because both islands are facing the death of coconuts, and so a lot of us simply say that what has happened in Nevis came across to St. Kitts; but the majority of the plants lost in Nevis were lost to a disease called lethal yellow."

James said that bud rot has been in St. Kitts, but in the last years, it has become a significant problem. He also stated that he has only seen it affecting the coconuts and that if the palm trees in the forest areas become affected, there will have to be a major deforestation in order to control the disease.

[Bud rot (also called heart rot) of coconut palm can be caused by several species of fungus-like organisms in the genus _Phytophthora_, as well as some fungal species (such as _Fusarium_, _Thielaviopsis_) and bacterial species in the genus _Erwinia_. Different pathogens may be prevalent in different areas. Usually, the pathogens also affect other palm species, including oilpalm, and are favoured by high rainfall. Palms of all ages can be affected.

Symptoms may include discolouration, wilting, collapse, and death of young leaves, as well as drooping and distorted older fronds, defoliation, stem end rot of nuts, premature nut drop, nut discolouration, and rotting of the growth bud ("heart" of the palm) leading to the death of the tree.

The pathogens enter the host via the crown. They are spread by wind splashed rain, mechanical means (including insect activities) and with infected plant or other material. Disease management may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), removal and burning of severely affected palms, and treatments with appropriate agrochemicals at or before onset of symptoms.

Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the 16SrIV group which can kill palms within 4 to 6 months. LY has seriously jeopardised regional coconut industries and was 1st reported from the Caribbean area. Planthopper species act as pathogen vectors, but seed transmission cannot be excluded, and some weed species may serve as reservoir hosts. Commercial control of LY relies on resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used hybrids, which was 1st noted in Jamaica (ProMED-mail post 20070522.1643), is causing great concern.
