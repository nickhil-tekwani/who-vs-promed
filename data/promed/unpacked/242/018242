[1] Panama comment
Date: Sun 22 Oct 2017
From: Jan Clement <jan.clement.dr@telenet.be> [edited]


In summary, this 10-year-old child in Panama had acute fever, a "sickle cell-like presentation", and an increasing degree of thrombocytopenia, prompting hantavirus serology, which turned out positive. If the sickle cells appear to be in fact schistocytes, this might be seen rarely in HFRS infections, and lead to an erroneous diagnosis of haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), needing sometimes plasmapheresis-therapy as described in 2 Belgian cases (Keyaerts E, .Ghijsels E, Lemey P, et al. Plasma-exchange-associated IgM-negative hantavirus disease after a camping holiday in Southern France. Clin Infect Dis. 2004 May 15;38(10):1350-6) (Clement J, Lee APK, Verpooten GA, et al. Acute hantavirus infection presenting as haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS): the importance of early clinical diagnosis. Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. DOI 10.1007/s10096-017-3113-6). High levels of LDH, which are present in virtually any hantavirus infection, can reinforce the diagnostic confusion.

The finding of acute kidney injury (AKI), accompanied or not by some degree of lung involvement (ARDS) - neither of which are mentioned in the Panama report - might add substantially to a final diagnosis. We are not aware however of American reports mentioning the occurrence of schistocytes in the peripheral blood film as an element of early clinical diagnosis of HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]. Consequently, it would perhaps be wise to exclude serologically an Old World hantavirus infection in this Panama case, in other words, a rat-transmitted Seoul virus (SEOV) infection, which would constitute the 7th such case documented so far in North-America. Another human SEOV case in Meso-America could add further ground to the already formerly found arguments or even evidence of symptomatic human SEOV infections in the New World, as suggested in: Clement J, Neild GH, Maes P, Leirs H, Matthys P and Van Ranst M. Symptomatic Human Hantavirus in the Americas. Emerg Inf Dis 2007;13:345-6 [see section [2] for reference. - CopyEd.AO].

In a recent letter, dos Santos et al. described 3 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) from Juquitiba and stated that "the 1st human cases of symptomatic infection by hantaviruses were reported from Brazil in 1993." However, we described 8 cases of symptomatic hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Recife, Brazil, 5 months before the initial May 1993 report of Sin Nombre virus (SNV)-induced HPS in the United States. Our report was therefore the 1st published account of symptomatic hantavirus infections, not just in Brazil but anywhere in the Americas.

Serum samples from our Brazilian HFRS cases, collected in 1990, were screened by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and ELISA for immunoglobulin G, as were the current Brazilian HPS cases (1) and 2 of our patients had an increased immunoglobulin M titer by ELISA. Rat-transmitted Seoul virus (SEOV) was considered most likely because this was the only hantavirus strain showing clear positive results in IFA (2,3). All the Recife cases in 1990 had reported likely rat contacts and were initially diagnosed as leptospirosis with acute renal failure and thrombocytopenia, clinical hallmarks of both HFRS and leptospirosis. We also subsequently found evidence of SEOV infection in 31 (15 percent) of 201 leptospirosis-suspected acute renal failure cases from Belém, Brazil, confirmed in 1 case with highly specific neutralization tests. Moreover, as we predicted, some of the 133 (41 percent) of 326 urban cases of acute renal failure from Salvador, Brazil, which appeared nonconfirmed for leptospirosis, were later shown to be caused by SEOV (unpub. data). Finally, of 379 schoolchildren from Salvador at high risk for frequent rat exposure, 13.2 percent were IFA positive for the Korean prototype Hantaan virus (HTNV) but none for the American SNV. Because both HTNV and its rodent reservoir are absent from the American biotope, HTNV seroreactivity should be considered a cross-reaction to another related murine antigen; that is to say, the ratborne SEOV.

Wild rats (_Rattus rattus_ and _R. norvegicus_) are the only Old World rodents ubiquitous in the New World and thus a potential source of SEOV infection in the Americas. Moreover, the 1st hantavirus characterized in South America was SEOV, isolated as long ago as 1984 from a rat caught in Belém. Furthermore, the first 3 clinical cases of hantavirus infection in the United States were SEOV-induced (Baltimore rat virus) HFRS cases and not HPS.

The clinical syndromes of HFRS and HPS can appear identical, with pulmonary edema, shock, and renal insufficiency with marked proteinuria and thrombocytopenia. Moreover, worldwide ELISA testing with a single antigen such as SNV or Puumala virus (PUUV) can result in misleading cross-reactions, since both viruses are genetically related. Although this SNV-PUUV cross-reactivity enabled the 1st recognition of HPS cases in the New World 13 years ago, this may now lead to the wrong clinical diagnosis and reinforces the need for specific tests such as neutralization tests or reverse transcription-PCR. Although not as lethal and probably not as frequent as HPS, SEOV-induced HFRS may still be greatly underestimated in the Americas, or misdiagnosed as leptospirosis.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Jan Clement and his colleagues for their comments on this unusual case and for the published report with its advice to consider Seoul hantavirus as an etiological agent responsible for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Americas. There is no indication in the report of this recent case in Panama, or in previous reports, of the specificity of the hantavirus diagnostic test used in Panama. Information has not been provided in this or previous cases to determine if Seoul virus was tested for in addition to Choclo virus, which has been laboratory diagnosed frequently in Panama. It is likely that few diagnostic laboratories in South and Central America have the laboratory capability to diagnose Seoul virus infections. As Dr Clement and colleagues have stated, Seoul virus infections are likely underestimated in the Americas, or misdiagnosed as leptospirosis. And one must not forget that Seoul virus has been found in pet and laboratory _Rattus norvegicus_ rats.

In addition to identifying the specific hantavirus in this case, more clinical information would be very helpful, in particular: Did the patient have underlying sickle cell disease or trait? Did he develop renal failure or pulmonary complications? - Mod. LXL]
