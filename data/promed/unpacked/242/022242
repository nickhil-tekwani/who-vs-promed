RABIES - ECUADOR (3)
====================
Subject: Rabies in Ecuador comment
Just a comment a March 15 message that was sent by Dr. Maria Correa on
the recent rabies outbreak in Ecuador. On the question of whether the
average worker in Ecuador receives $30 weekly or monthly, the answer is
monthly. A businessperson would make much more. $85 for a rabies vaccine
sounds rather high. Is that the price for a human or animal vaccination
in Ecuador?
Here's a piece of information that might interest you. La sanidad, those
responsible for exterminating infected animals, have traditionally been
indiscriminate in their efforts. Their methods involve throwing pieces of
meat poisoned with strychnine to unsuspecting dogs on streets or over the
walls of private homes at night. To check whether these dogs have or have
not been vaccinated is a luxury they cannot take since they are on a tight
schedule (working judiciously while their clients are asleep). So, as you
can imagine, vaccination efforts by pet owners and veterinatians do not
have all their desired effects.
