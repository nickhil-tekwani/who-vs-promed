departementales des services veterinaires) and accredited veterinarians was
placed on the alert throughout the territory of France.
- In accordance with the regulations concerning urban rabies, the districts
of Bordeaux(1) (place of residence of the dog's owners), Hostens(1),
Leognan(1), Gradignan(1), Libourne(1), Perigueux(2) and
Miramont-de-Guyenne(3) (which the animal had visited), were declared by
prefectural decree to be infected with rabies for a period of 3 months,
which led to the following measures being adopted on the territory of these
districts:
- free movement of identified dogs validly vaccinated against rabies under
the direct supervision of their owners;
- dogs not validly vaccinated against rabies, and cats, even if vaccinated,
to be kept tethered or confined;
- ban on owners disposing of their dogs if they have not been vaccinated
against rabies or of their cats, even when vaccinated;
- stricter measures to control free-roaming animals;
- ban on shows and other gatherings of domestic carnivores in the zone;
- ban on the participation of domestic carnivores from the zone in shows or
gatherings outside the zone.
