Controlling FMD with vaccines?
------------------------------
Despite the fact that FMDV was the first animal virus discovered and that
the disease it causes has been extensively studied, the most appropriate
methods of control of the disease are still hotly debated. Policies on
control are tempered by the fact that rapid decision-making in the face of
an outbreak in disease-free regions is essential. Moreover, control must
include restriction of animal movement (and indirect contacts between
animals) and interruption of virus shedding. Both of these activities have
a significant economic cost.
Although wide-spread vaccination in the face of an outbreak would seem to
be the best possible method to prevent virus shedding, there are unique
aspects of FMD that relate to its ease of spread, and large number of
susceptible hosts that suggest vaccination alone is a simplistic approach.
Currently, there is an effective vaccine for FMD, an adjuvented, chemically
inactivated preparation of virus particles that is widely used in countries
that have active eradication campaigns in place to deal with enzootic FMD.
Seven serotypes of FMDV and multiple subtypes exist in the world today,
complicating vaccination. Moreover, existing vaccines may not be effective
for subtypes of virus that periodically arise. Due to its economic impact,
university, company, and government laboratories (including the USDA's
Agricultural Research Service laboratory at Plum Island Animal Disease
Center) have embarked on programs of utilizing recombinant DNA technology
to develop new vaccines to combat this disease.
One collaboration, spearheaded by USDA scientists working with Genentech,
resulted in the first recombinant DNA vaccine capable of preventing a
disease (Science, 214:1125; 1981). Since that time, publications on various
products, including synthetic peptides, E.coli-expressed products, naked
DNA, genetically engineered attenuated FMD viruses and virus vectors have
been developed as FMD vaccine candidates. Despite their promise, most of
these products fall short of the current inactivated vaccine in their
effectiveness.
Even though the current vaccine has been shown to be effective, vaccines
have never been used to control FMD in the UK (even in the devastating 1967
outbreak). However, the widespread use of the inactivated vaccine in the
50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s in Western Europe may have had beneficial effects
for control of FMD in the UK.
There are multiple reasons why vaccines were not utilized in the UK, as
well as in other regions experiencing infrequent outbreaks. Some of these
reasons reflect the limitations of current vaccines, while others reflect
limitations in implementing emergency vaccination programs.
First, the current vaccines can occasionally be contaminated with live
virus, so the vaccines themselves can cause FMD (this has been largely
controlled recently, and quality assurance protocols implemented by the
large multi-national vaccine companies have eliminated this problem).
Second, vaccinated animals may be difficult to distinguish serologically
from previously infected animals (eliminating serology as a method of
identifying infected animals). Although this has been addressed by
developments in diagnostic technology (some developed by the USDA), these
tests are currently undergoing validation, and the economics of their
utility has not been fully developed. Use of marker vaccines may also help
in this regard, and there are some development programs in place. However,
given the nature of the agent, animals that are negative for the marker
pose a tremendous risk for re-kindling the infection.
Third, while attempting to "emergency vaccinate" animals, vaccination teams
would be ideal "vectors" to spread the disease.
Fourth, and probably most importantly, with existing vaccines, vaccinated
animals may become infected, and show less severe signs of disease, despite
shedding virus. Thus vaccination, especially with vaccines that may not
perfectly match the subtype of the outbreak virus, could prolong an
outbreak by producing partially protected animals that shed virus without
showing the readily identifiable overt signs of the disease. Inability to
readily identify animals that could be shedding virus is a critical factor
in FMD control.
In the case of the recent outbreak, this can be seen from the fact that
sheep, which often do not display severe lesions from the disease, may have
played an important role in disease dispersal in the UK.
Current USDA research efforts in vaccine development are aimed at
developing more rapidly acting (suited for emergency response),
cross-reactive (able to combat multiple serotypes and subtypes), and more
effective (able to eliminate spreading) vaccines. We also are utilizing
genomic and proteomic approaches to learn more about virus infection at the
molecular level to develop therapeutics that could help to reduce shedding,
and finally, we are characterizing viral ecology, spread, evolution, and
host range, to provide knowledge that will help in development of control
strategies.
