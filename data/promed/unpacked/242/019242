13 more infected with anthrax in Sirajganj
------------------------------------------
Anthrax infection breaks out in the district every year after the flood water recedes. At least 13 people, mostly women and children, have gotten infected with anthrax in Chor Koijuri village of Shahjadpur upazila in Sirajganj district [Rajshahi division], raising the number of infected in the district to 91 in the last 3 months.

District Civil Surgeon Sheikh Md Monjur Rahman on Friday [19 Aug 2016] said those who handled or prepared the meat of a sick ox from a farm owned by one Nazrul of the village got infected. The animal was slaughtered on 8 Aug 2016. Anthrax infection breaks out in the district every year after the flood water recedes, said the civil surgeon.

The infected have been identified as H 3, R 4, Y 6, A 7, N 8, S 10, A 13, TK 25, HK 35, P 25, S 35, MB 64 and JB 63. Health and Family Planning Officer of Shahjadpur Upazila Health Complex Jafarul Hossain said 8 of the victims had been admitted to Sirajganj Sadar Hospital on Thursday [18 Aug 2016] while the other 5 were brought to the hospital on Friday [19 Aug 2016].

In May this year [2016], 18 people have been infected with anthrax in Koijuri, Porjona and Kayempur unions. During the time, many others also have been reported to be infected in Kamarkhond and Ullahpara upazilas.

After the flood water receded this year, many cattle have been noticed to have various diseases. Livestock officer of Shahjadpur upazila Abdus Samad said despite vaccination, cattle of the upazila may get infected with anthrax or other diseases due to consuming flood washed hyacinth and grass. However, legal actions will be taken against those who sold meat of a sick animal, he added.

[There is a suggestion that the cattle in this area had been vaccinated. So either the vaccine is ineffective or the cattle had been vaccinated before the monsoon rains began and some had lost their immunity by the end of the monsoon. Whichever the cause, this needs investigating because of the constant risk of both human and livestock cases. If the interval is too long, as cattle are essentially penned during the monsoon season, mid-season would be a time when many could be quickly and efficiently vaccinated. But I suspect if it were as easy as that, it would have been done.
