Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: San Jeronimo, San Jeronimo, San Juan del Sur, Rivas
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Feb 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: apiary
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Bees (hives) / 18 / 17 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: in the municipality of San Juan del Sur, an apiary of 18 hives has been affected by infestation with _Aethina tumida_ (small hive beetle). Out of 18 hives tested, 17 were positive to adult as well as 2 larvae of small hive beetles. The beekeepers determined that the hives were weaker and they suspected that this was caused by the presence of the small hive beetle.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Bees (hives) / 94.44 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 100 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: inspection of the apiary was performed for teaching purposes and there small hive beetles were found in the brood chamber, this lead to the suspected presence of infestation with _Aethina tumida_ (small hive beetle). This suspicion was notified to the Official Veterinary Service who decided to carry out the official inspection of the apiary by taking the quantity of one sample of 68 adults and 2 larvae. Samples were handed out to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory who confirmed positive results to _Aethina tumida_. Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: since this is the 1st time that infestation with _Aethina tumida_ (small hive beetle) is identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact circumscribed to a zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures.

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_, is a major threat to honey producers as it consumes brood, pollen, and honey. Combs full of honey can be ruined as the beetle larvae tunnel, defecate, and produce slime over them.
