10 wild raccoons have been found with signs of previous H5N1 bird
flu infections, according to a joint study by Tokyo University and
Yamaguchi University.

This is the 1st time mammals in this country have been found with
bird flu virus antibodies, which develop as a result of infection.
Before the discovery, only birds had been found [here] with bird flu
antibodies.

The research team, which presented a paper on its findings at a
conference of the Japanese Society of Veterinary Science in
Utsunomiya on Saturday [4 Apr 2009], warned that infected raccoons
could introduce the virus into chicken farms and noted that
countermeasures were needed.

It is believed that the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus is highly
likely to mutate into a new type of influenza. In Japan, there have
previously been reports of domestic chickens, wild whooper swans,
jungle crows and mountain hawk-eagles infected with the virus.

The research team collected and examined blood from 988 raccoons
captured since 2005 at 3 locations in western Japan and one location
in eastern Japan. In the blood of 10 raccoons from 3 of the
locations, the team found antibodies that had developed after past
H5N1 infections. In 2 of the 3 places, not even birds had been found
with the antibodies before this time.

According to Taisuke Horimoto, an associate professor of Tokyo
University's Institute of Medical Science, raccoons do not live in
packs. He said the blood test this time showed that in comparison
with other infectious diseases, the proportion of animals found with
the H5N1 antibodies was low.

The researchers think the 10 raccoons likely were not infected by
other raccoons, but by eating the carcasses of infected birds or
inheriting the antibodies from a parent at birth.

Raccoons are found throughout the nation. Many of them are descended from
abandoned pets or have run away from zoos.

[Japan's 1st outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was detected in the middle of
January 2004 in a commercial flock in Yamaguchi prefecture. The
following outbreaks in 2004 occurred in the prefectures Oita and
Kyoto.

The next H5N1 outbreak in Japan occurred in January 2007, affecting
commercial farms in Miyazak and Okayama as well as a hawk eagle found
in Kumamoto -- outbreak summary and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5375>.

During April 2008, 5 infected wild swans were found on the shores of
Lake Towada in Akita Prefecture; a summary and a map available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7003>.

Since the raccoons most probably got infected by the consumption/prey
of infected birds, it will be interesting to obtain details on their
respective locations of origin in order to trace back the source of
their infections.

According to USGS' "List of Species Affected by H5N1 (Avian
Influenza): referenced reports of highly pathogenic avian influenza
H5N1 in wildlife and domestic animals," the following 14 mammal
species have been found infected by H5N1 since 2003:

*cow (_Bos taurus_),
*dog (_Canis lupus familiaris_),
*Owston's palm civet (_Chrotogale owstoni_),
*domestic cat/feral cat (_Felis domestica_),
*cynomolgus
macques (_Macaca fascicularis_),
*stone marten, stone (beech) marten (_Martes foina_),
*ferret (_Mustela putorius furo_),
*New Zealand white rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_),
*leopard (_Panthera pardus_),
*tiger (_Panthera tigris_),
*rat (_Rattus norvegicus_),
*pig (_Sus domesticus_) [_Sus scrofa_],
*red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_)

plua a house mouse (_Mus musculus_), reportedly infected in 1998).

Raccoons will have to be added to this list. - Mod.AS

This report does not tell us whether the species concerned is the
native Japanese animal _Nyctereutes procyonoides_, more properly
called a "raccoon dog" -- see image at:
<http://www.ecosystema.ru/08nature/mamm/052.jpg>
or the American raccoon _Procyon lotor_, imported as pets in the
1970's and now running wild in 36 prefectures. It has a more distinct
mask and a barred tail -- see
