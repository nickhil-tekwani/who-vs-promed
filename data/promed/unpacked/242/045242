The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) confirmed 2 horses in Suffolk were euthanized after testing positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). Both horses were tested for EEE after presenting with acute neurological signs.

The 1st horse tested positive for EEE on 14 Jul 2020, and the 2nd horse tested positive on 15 Jul 2020.

Sometimes called sleeping sickness, EEE is a mosquito-borne illness that causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Signs include the following:
- impaired vision
- aimless wandering
- head pressing
- circling
- inability to swallow
- irregular staggering gait
- paralysis
- convulsions
- death

Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3-10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

VDACS encourages horse owners to speak with their veterinarians about vaccinating their horses for West Nile virus (WNV) and EEE. The mortality rate for WNV is 30% and up to 90% for EEE. Vaccinations are effective for 6-12 months.

For more information on how to control mosquitoes around horses, go to http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/animals-eastern-equine-encephalitis.shtml.

Horse owners may also contact VDACS' Office of Veterinary Services or consult their local veterinarian.

On 20 Jul 2020, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reported 3 confirmed eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) cases in horses in Baker, Holmes, and Jackson counties, according to the Equine Disease Communication Center. All 3 horses showed clinical signs on 13 Jul 2020, and the state confirmed all 3 cases on 17 Jul 2020. The state had previously reported its 9th equine EEE case of 2020 on 11 Jul 2020.

EEE 101
Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases are as follows:
- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[The suggestions on helping to eliminate mosquitoes and their breeding habitats in the second article are worth heeding. Furthermore, vaccinate your horses. The vaccine is a combination vaccine of West Nile virus, eastern and western encephalitis, and usually tetanus. The vaccine is repeated in approximately 3 weeks. The immunity to EEE wanes faster than the others in the vaccine. Therefore, consider vaccinating your horse, with a single booster in approximately 3 months if you have not had a killing frost. - Mod.TG
