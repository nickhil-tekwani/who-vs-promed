A 3rd patient has died after contracting Legionnaires' disease at a
New Brunswick [New Jersey] hospital. The unidentified woman died
Friday [3 Oct 2008] at Saint Peter's University Hospital. A hospital
spokeswoman said she was being treated for a separate, unspecified
illness.

8 patients of the hospital have been diagnosed with Legionnaires'
disease since mid-September 2008. All were staying in the same
oncology wing. One male patient died on 12 Sep 2008, and another man
died on 22 Sep 2008. Officials say 2 patients have recovered from the
disease.

Legionnaires' disease is a form of pneumonia that can be spread
through plumbing and air conditioning systems. Hospital officials
traced the outbreak to a decrease in chlorine levels in the hospital's
water system. The cause of the decrease was under investigation.

[Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused
by _Legionella_, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About 80-90 percent
of cases are caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Legionnaires'
disease is usually acquired by inhalation by a susceptible person of
an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Risk factors include
age over 50 years, cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic heart or lung
disease, and immunosuppression -- patients in an oncology unit would
likely be especially susceptible.

Hospitals caring for immunocompromised patients ideally should have
in-house capability to perform _Legionella pneumophila_, serogroup 1
urinary antigen testing, or a contract with a laboratory that will
provide urinary antigen testing and results within 24 to 48 hours, and
have a system in place to submit cultures to a microbiology laboratory
within 24 hours of specimen collection
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/publ-rel/html/0800legion.htm>.

The above news release does not specify whether there was any delay
in diagnosis of their 1st case. Once the 1st case is diagnosed,
legionella testing should also be done for all other nosocomial
pneumonia cases.

An epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of
_Legionella_ organisms should be initiated when the 1st case of
hospital-acquired legionellosis is identified. Genotyping patient and
environmental isolates will help to confirm the environmental source.

Apparently, the water system in the New Brunswick hospital has been
incriminated. _Legionella_ are usually found primarily in the hot
water portion of plumbing systems and in cooling towers. Warm water
temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations
of the organism in plumbing systems. In addition, _Legionella_ are
embedded in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of the plumbing
system's pipes and containers. Concentrations of the organism can be
increased by any disruption of this biofilm. Infectious aerosols can
be generated by a building's faulty air conditioning systems, shower
heads, misters, and whirlpool spas.

Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot water
system is difficult, especially if the system is old. As _Legionella_
are killed by temperatures over 55 C (131 F), superheating of water
to 71-77 C (160-171 F), from 43 C (110 F), the temperature usually
used by most hospitals, or hyperchlorination (greater than 10
mg/liter of chlorine in water) for a period of time is recommended to
eliminate _Legionella_ from a hot water system
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>).

The above news release does not specify what remediation is being
done but does say that the cause of the outbreak was "a decrease in
chlorine levels in the hospital's water system," which suggests that
the hospital may have been trying to maintain a certain level of free
chlorine to control _Legionella_ in their water system
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>.

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the
source of _Legionella_ organisms, immunocompromised patients should
be prohibited from taking showers, and only sterile water should be
used for their oral consumption until _Legionella_ becomes
undetectable by culture of the hospital water
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>.

The above news release does not say what the hospital is doing for
prevention of nosocomial legionellosis pending eradication of
_Legionella_ from their water system. - Mod.ML]
