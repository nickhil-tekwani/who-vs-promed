Norway has reported its 1st suspected case of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) in several weeks, at a broodstock group at the AquaGen sites at Ørsta and Heim in the west of the country [Møre og Romsdal county].

The company said in a press release that parts of this group of broodstock have been transported to AquaGen's land facility at Kyrksæterøra in Heim.

The transport was made before suspicions arose. This means that these 2 production facilities are now affected. AquaGen stressed that other production facilities have not been affected.

AquaGen said it has carried out individual screening of all broodstock in their production facilities.

The suspicion arose as a result of sampling taken last week [week of 1 Mar 2022] from the broodstock group moved to Kyrksæterøra.

The findings have now been reported to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. It is being stressed that no increased mortality or clinical symptoms have been reported in any of the suspected fish groups.

The roe from the broodstock was routinely placed in the quarantine department pending test results, and it is therefore not expected that the suspicion will affect previously produced roe that is in stock at the company.

AquaGen said the broodstock groups that may have been affected account for up to half of the planned production of salmon roe for deliveries from AquaGen in the 3rd quarter of this year [2022].

It adds: "The scope may therefore lead to delays in our roe deliveries planned late in the 2nd quarter and in the 3rd quarter. "

AquaGen is a breeding company which develops, produces and delivers genetic material to the global aquaculture farming industry and has achieved a leading position as a provider of fertilised eggs of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout.

[Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus and affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease can be systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs.

It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE. - Mod.PMB
