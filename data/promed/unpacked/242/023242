The regional Environment Ministry for Madrid has issued a statement
to report that a 10-year-old cow from a farm in Galapagar diagnosed
with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) on 29 Dec 2008 has been
put down at a local slaughterhouse.

There have been 6 confirmed cases of the disease since 2000 in the
Madrid region, the last being in 2004.

Last year [2008], 10 000 inspections were carried out in the region,
where there are around 4800 cattle farms.

The ministry gave assurances that measures are already in place which
ensure that this last case does not constitute any kind of risk to
the food chain.

[Spain's surveillance of BSE until 2000 was deficient. According to a
Veterinary Record paper of 1997 by leading European BSE experts (see
19970829.1834), it was calculated that of the 55 400 British cattle
exported to other EU countries for breeding purposes between 1985 and
1989, at least 1642 would have succumbed to BSE after export.
However, only 285 cases were reported. For example: by January 1997,
the Republic of Ireland had reported 188 cases, while the number
expected was 911; Portugal reported 61, the expected number being
262; France reported 28; the expected number was 32. The expected
number for Spain was 54, but not a single case was reported until
2000, when the 1st BSE case in Spain was confirmed and reported. The
total number of confirmed cases in Spain from 2000 to 2007 was 717,
the annual numbers being, respectively, 2, 82, 127, 167, 137, 98, 68
and 36. The final figures for 2008 are not yet available. In 2007,
the Annual Incidence Rate (A.I.R.; Number of indigenous cases per
million bovines aged over 24 months) in Spain was 12 297, following
the 2 most-infected countries, namely Portugal (16 142 A.I.R.) and UK
(13 520). According to a GBR (Geographic BSE Risk) assessment,
carried out by the EU in 2000, Spain imported, among others, a
consignment of 1021 tons MBM (Meat and Bone Meal) from the UK in
1988. According to a 2002 updated opinion of the EU, exported Spanish
bovines, or MBM, were regarded to represent an external BSE challenge
to the importing countries since 1985 ("possibly") and 1987 ("likely").

As of December 2008, 5 primary cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease have been reported in humans in Spain, which is the 3rd on
the world list, following the UK (164 primary cases) and France (23). - Mod.AS]
