In humans, psittacosis is primarily a flulike illness following
exposure to psittacine birds. In rare cases, pregnant women
exposed to Chlamydia psittaci can contract gestational
psittacosis: atypical pneumonia, sepsis, and placental
insufficiency resulting in premature birth or miscarriage. In
the United States, only two cases of gestational psittacosis
have been reported, both from exposure to psittacine birds.
Eleven other cases have been reported worldwide, mostly in the
United Kingdom, all from exposure to infected birth fluids and
membranes of farm mammals, notably sheep and goats. In these
mammals, C. psittaci inhabit the reproductive tract, are
transmitted sexually or by the fecal-oral route, and cause
miscarriages. The case of gestational psittacosis in a Montana
sheep rancher is the first farm animal-related case reported in
the United States. Pregnant women should avoid close contact
with C. psittaci-infected animals, particularly sheep and goats
during the birthing season. Obstetricians should consider this
diagnosis along with early antibiotic treatment and cesarean
section delivery in the context of the patient's case history.
Psittacosis is a flulike systemic infection, often with fever, headache,
and atypical pneumonia, caused by Chlamydia psittaci. The number of
reported cases varies from year to year because of periodic outbreaks,
although the true baseline incidence in the United States is thought to be
75 to 100 cases per year with 1 or 2 deaths (1). Montana typically reports
one case per year (Montana Dept. of Health surveillance data). Many cases
are probably not diagnosed. In most reported cases, transmission occurs by
inhaling infectious material from diseased psittacine birds (2).
However, not all cases of psittacosis result from inhaling avian strains of
C. psittaci, nor are they all manifested as a simple flulike illness or
atypical pneumonia. In rare cases, pregnant women contract severe
chlamydial disease after exposure to the infected birth fluids and
membranes of goats and sheep (3). This "gestational psittacosis" can be
defined as a flulike syndrome leading to sepsis, placental infection, and
fetal compromise (4). Only 13 cases have been reported worldwide: Eleven
after exposure to gravid sheep and goats (United Kingdom and France) and
two after exposure to psittacine birds (United States). This is the first
farm animal-related case reported in the United States.
Case Report
In April 1996, a previously healthy 25-year-old Montana sheep rancher,
pregnant for the first time, had cough and congestion for 14 days at weeks
19 to 21 of gestation; the symptoms were followed by 4 days of high fever
(104 F), myalgia, headache, fatigue, and backache, and 2 days of abdominal
pain.................
On the second day of hospitalization, the patient underwent emergency
termination of the pregnancy (22-23 weeks gestation).............
The patient's sera had very high (1:512) IgG antibody titer to C. psittaci;
identical titer was seen on sera collected several months later. No IgM to
C.psittaci was detected. Tests for the other chlamydia, as well as for
other placental-acquired infections (e.g., Q fever and brucellosis) were
negative.
................ The spring lambing season began 4 to 6 weeks
before hospitalization, during which the patient and her husband worked
closely with gravid sheep.
The sheep were purchased from a neighboring flock with reported "pink eye"
and abortions, both of presumed chlamydial etiology. The flock's abortion
problem resolved after tetracycline-fortified feed was administered just
before yearly breeding. Neither antibiotic feed nor the available chlamydia
vaccine was used for the sheep on the patient's ranch.
.........in this case, epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory (human
and animal), and histopathologic data support the diagnosis of gestational
psittacosis. The most likely mechanism of transmission was inhalation of
C.psittaci while manually extracting the retained placenta from the C.
psittaci-infected sheep that lambed prematurely just 2 weeks before the
patient's hospitalization. The usual incubation time for psittacosis is 1
to 4 weeks (2).
