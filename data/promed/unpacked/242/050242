The suspected case of polio reported from Darbhanga in Bihar has been found negative for wild poliovirus.

Earlier in the day, upon being informed of the suspected case of polio, the government rolled out an immunization drive in 28 districts of Bihar as a measure of abundant precaution, while carrying out detailed investigation of the case.

The ERC Mumbai laboratory, where the samples were being investigated, confirmed the case as negative this evening [11 Oct 2012].

[The 1st report from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare stating there was a suspected case of WPV3 associated polio in Bihar was released on 11 Oct 2012 at 17:29 IST; the above report stating that wild poliovirus infection had been ruled out was released on 11 Oct 2012 at 19:53 IST - approximately 2.5 hours later. In the interval between the 2 official press releases, ProMED-mail issued a report on the suspected case based on the information that WPV3 was the suspected etiology. It is not often that "false alarms" involve a mention of a specific WPV type. More information on the epidemiologic and laboratory investigations leading to the initial suspicion that this was due to a WPV3 infection would be greatly appreciated.

One senses a large sigh of relief with the final laboratory results, as India has not confirmed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases due to WPV since January 2011 and is currently 15 months away from being certified as polio-free.
