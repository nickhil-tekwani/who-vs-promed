A total of 190 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients have been
ordered to check in to hospitals by the government this year, the
Ministry of Health and Welfare said Friday [26 Aug 2011]. This is the
1st time MDR-TB patients were forced to receive treatment for the
disease by law, which was implemented in 1967.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an
affiliate of the ministry, the number of patients ordered to be
isolated from the public for having a highly infectious but
hard-to-cure strain of tuberculosis rose to 190 between April and
July. Unlike ordinary tuberculosis, drugs available on the market are
ineffective for MDR-TB. The strain is classified as hard-to-cure
disease by field experts.

Doctors are required to report such patients to the government. If the
patients do not follow the doctors' treatment regime or his or her
symptoms are assumed to be highly contagious, the state may issue the
hospitalization order. The KCDC said the order was issued as part of
its "2030 scheme" to bring TB prevalence below the 10 per 100 000
level from the current 680.

"Though there was a law, there had never been budget for execution of
the scheme. This year, we have managed to secure funds for the
hospitalization," a KCDC official told The Korea Herald. "But the high
number of committed patients does not mean that the number of all TB
patients has soared or that the disease has suddenly become
exceptionally contagious this year," she added.

According to the National Health Insurance Corporation, the number of
newly registered TB cases in 2009 was 35 845 and a total of 71 226
people were treated for the disease. The number of MDR-TB patients was
around 3000.

[Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is defined as TB whose
isolates are resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin. Extensively
drug-resistant (XDR) TB is defined as TB whose isolates are resistant
to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as to any member of the
fluoroquinolone family and at least one of the following injectable
drugs: kanamycin, capreomycin, or amikacin. MDR-TB and XDR-TB require
treatment for up to 2 years with 2nd-line drugs (SLDs) that are less
effective, more toxic, and costlier than 1st-line isoniazid- and
rifampin-based regimens. A successful outcome depends on the extent of
the drug resistance, the severity of the disease, competence of the
patient's immune system, access to microbiological laboratories that
can provide early and accurate diagnosis and drug susceptibility
testing so that effective treatment is provided as soon as possible,
and reliable availability of SLDs.

In South Korea, the national reference laboratory routinely performs
an extended diagnostic panel of drug-susceptibility testing of
isolates from all culture-positive TB patients
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5511a2.htm), and the
majority of MDR-TB patients are treated at (a) the 2 national TB
hospitals (as a public sector), (b) the 76 university or tertiary-care
hospitals (as a private sector), or (c) the 9 Korean National
Tuberculosis Association (KNTA) chest clinics (between public and
private sectors)
(http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/reprint/200801-132OCv1).

The above news release states that there were 35 845 newly reported
cases of TB for 2009 for South Korea. A similar number was reported
for South Korea for 2005, with incidence rate of 70 per 100 000
(http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Seoul-set-to-eliminate-TB-by-2030-7328.html),
as compared to about 4 per 100 000 for the USA for 2009
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5910a2.htm). In
addition, 2292 South Koreans were reported to have died of the disease
in 2009, that was said to represent a death rate of 8.3 in 100 000, as
compared one in 100 000 in the USA
(http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/yhedit/2011/03/24/5/5100000000AEN20110324008500315F.HTML).

The news release above states that there are 3000 cases of MDR-TB or
8.4 percent of the 35 845 newly reported cases of TB for 2009 for
South Korea, which is about 3 times the percentage reported in 2004
and 5 times that reported in 1994
(http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/reprint/200801-132OCv1). A study
reported that 5.3 percent of 1407 South Korean, mostly HIV-negative,
patients who were newly diagnosed or retreated for MDR-TB had XDR-TB
at the start of treatment in the years 2000 to 2002
(http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/reprint/200801-132OCv1).
Treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB is very difficult, but not impossible.
Among the South Korean patients with MDR- and XDR-TB in this study,
cure was achieved in 425 (30.2 percent) during the 3-7 years of
follow-up. In patients with XDR-TB, 41.3 percent of deaths were from
TB-related causes compared with 11.8 percent of deaths in patients
with MDR-TB. XDR-TB was the strongest predictor of both all-cause and
TB-related mortality. The relapse rate was higher in XDR-TB patients
(13.6 percent) than in other MDR-TB patients (8.8%), but the
difference was not statistically significant.
