- National. 15 Oct 2019. Officials are reporting a seasonal spike in dengue fever cases in Yemen in 2019. There have been 14 540 suspected cases of dengue fever, with 79 associated deaths recorded since the beginning of the year [2019], more cases than in previous years. Southern governorates are mainly affected, with 88 districts reporting suspected dengue cases in the last 4 weeks and 83% of the cases reported in 4 governorates: Taiz (38%), Abyan (21%), Lahj (13%), and Aden (11%). The risk of transmission has increased due to years of conflict owing to a lack of sanitation, poor living conditions, and a lack of vector-control activities.

Israel: ex Nepal (Kathmandu). 1 Nov 2019. There have been recent reports from Nepal about an alarming number of dengue cases, including a significant outbreak in the city of Kathmandu [see archives 20190909.6663539 and 20190912.6666838).
The Nepali Ministry of Health reported that during a 2-month period from 17 Jul to 18 Sep 2019 there were 1331 dengue cases in Kathmandu. This is the 1st outbreak in the city of Kathmandu and until now the dengue serotype causing this outbreak had not been identified.

During the last 2 weeks, we have diagnosed 4 ill-returned Israeli travelers who were infected in Kathmandu (based on their itineraries), and were still viremic. The patients were seen at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Sheba Medical Center Tel-Hashomer. Real-time PCR was performed at the central virology laboratory of the Israeli Ministry of Health using CDC primers and probes and demonstrated DEN-3 in three of them and DEN-2 in another one. These results point to a multi-dengue serotype causing this significant outbreak in the city of Kathmandu.

[ref: Afroz S, Shama, Battu S, et al. Amino acid starvation enhances vaccine efficacy by augmenting neutralizing antibody production. Sci Signal. 2019 Nov 12;12(607). pii: eaav4717. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.aav4717]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nearly 50 percent of the world's population is considered at risk of infection with dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne RNA virus that can potentially cause lethal disease. The efficacy of currently approved vaccines is poor in people who have not previously encountered DENV. Afroz et al. found that pretreatment of mice with the amino acid starvation mimetic halofuginone (HF) increased the adaptive immune response to a DENV vaccine. Known to activate the nutrient-sensing kinase GCN2, HF promoted phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α in immune cells, increased germinal center formation, and increased neutralizing antibody responses. These data demonstrate how activation of this stress-induced kinase improves vaccination.
