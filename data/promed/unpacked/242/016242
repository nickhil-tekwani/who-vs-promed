Epidemiology

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: abnormal mortalities were observed in 7 poultry farms in Changhua County, Yunlin County, Chiayi County, Tainan City and Pingtung County. Samples were sent to the national Laboratory, the Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for diagnosis. H5N2 subtype low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) was confirmed by AHRI. These farms have been put under movement restrictions. The pathogenicity of the virus has been subsequently confirmed by national laboratory as low pathogenic (less than 75 per cent mortality of the tested chickens) on 1 Apr 2015. All animals on the infected farms have been culled. Thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within 3 km radius of infected farms are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[According to the information provided in the epidemiological comments section: "The pathogenicity of the virus has been subsequently confirmed by national laboratory as low pathogenic (less than 75 per cent mortality of the tested chickens) on 1 Apr 2015."

Given the current situation with HPAI subtype H5N2 in Taiwan and the increased number of outbreaks with this subtype (see commentaries in ProMED mail post 20150416.3300792) it is understandable that a confirmation of the virus was subsequently conducted. That may be the reason for reporting these outbreaks 3 months after they were detected, since authorities may have believed these were due to a highly pathogenic strain.

Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453. - Mod.CRD
