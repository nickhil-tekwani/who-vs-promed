Over 60 children between the ages of 1-2 have reportedly died of
cholera epidemic in northern Cross River state. The incident, which
occurred 3 weeks ago has been attributed to drinking of contaminated
water. The deaths occurred in Ogoja and its environs. The epidemic in
Yala, Obudu, Mbube, Bekwara, and Ogoja main towns is attributable to
shortage of water supply to the people resulting to the use of water
from ponds, streams, and gutters for domestic use and drinking.

Sources at the General Hospital, Ogoja confirmed that over 30
children have died in the hospital in the past 3 weeks, outside those
who could not make it to hospital. "We are losing an average of 5
kids a day here. When I was on duty, over 7 children have died," a
nurse at the hospital told our correspondent.

The Medical Superintendent of General Hospital, Ogoja, Dr Bart Egabe,
confirmed the epidemic.

The Ministry of Health has confirmed that cholera has hit Kampala
district again. So far 6 patients have been admitted at the cholera

Mohamed Kirumira, the Kampala chief of health services said, 4
patients are undergoing treatment and other patients are reported to
be undergoing tests at Asumpta Clinic in Kamwokya.

Dr Sam Okware, the commissioner of health services, attributed the
outbreak to poor sanitation and lack of personal hygiene among the
masses and is not new.

"We have been having cholera for the last 2 to 3 years in western and
northern Uganda," he said. In 2005, an outbreak of cholera outbreak
killed at least 56 people and made more than 2000 others ill," says
the Ministry of Health.

[3] Cholera - Angola
Date: Wed 6 Feb 2008

<http://www.angolapress-angop.ao/noticia-e.asp?ID=594011>


During the period from 28 Jan to 3 Feb 2008, cholera cases in Luanda,
the country's capital, dropped from 37 with one death to 30 cases
without any recorded deaths.

The reduction was due to the banned consumption of fish from Kilunda
lagoon and distribution of clean drinking water to residents of
Cacuaco district, ANGOP learned Wednesday [6 Feb 2008] in Luanda.
Speaking to ANGOP, the spokesperson of the National Commission of
Combat Against Cholera, Vita Vemba, said that awareness campaigns
directed to residents to avoid defecating neither next nor in the
lagoon has also contributed to the reduction of the number of cases.

The official added that last week [28 Jan-3 Feb 2008] Cacuaco
district recorded 35 cases against 27 registered on the previous
week. Sambizanga district reported 3 cases, one in the "Ossos" ward
and 2 in Porto Pesqueiro.

Precarious conditions of basic sanitation and the consumption of
untreated water in the above-cited localities were accounted for the
recorded cases, noted Vita Vemba, who added that during the 5th
epidemiological week of 2008 [28 Jan-3 Feb 2008], 200 cases with one
death were also registered. About 35 percent of the cases occurred in
Huila province, followed by provinces of Benguela, Cunene, Luanda,
Bie, and Kwanza Norte. Compared to the week before, there was a drop
from 233 with 3 deaths.

A cholera outbreak in the southern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
province of Katanga has spread, despite efforts to bring the epidemic
under control.

The disease has claimed the lives of 97 people and 4029 have been
infected since the 1st cases of the gastrointestinal illness were
reported in Katanga in September 2007, according to Francois Dumont,
spokesman for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF-Belgium). The disease has
spread quickly since the end of December 2007.

"What is remarkable is that the peak of the epidemic has not yet been
reached because the number of patients continues to grow," Dumont said.

Most of the cases have been reported in Lubumbashi, the provincial
capital, where the death toll stands at 49 and the number of
infections at 2543, and Likasi, nearly 100 km (62 mi) north of
Lubumbashi, where 48 people have died and 1486 cholera patients have
sought treatment.

The government and MSF-Belgium have set up 2 centers in Lubumbashi
where patients can seek treatment free of charge.

"Epidemiological data from the 1st week of February [2008] confirm an
upward trend (of the epidemic) in Likasi," said Dumont. He said 404
patients were registered in Likasi, with a population of about 350
000, at the beginning of February 2008, compared with 381 during the
last week of January 2008. "The rate of admissions remains very high,
almost 60 new patients a day," said Dumont.

There is a reported outbreak of dysentery at Salamaua High School in
Morobe province. A Grade 9 student from the school reportedly came
over to Lae to seek medical treatment and was diagnosed with
dysentery. The student said there were many other students too with
similar symptoms still at the school.

The student said they were drinking water from the school's water
system, which was murky, that the same water was also used for
cooking, that the school water pump was unreliable, and that the
water source was not safe for human consumption.

A suspected case of cholera from a new locality of Bangalore has been
confirmed following the outcome of the laboratory tests conducted by
the Public Health Institute. Interestingly, the patient, 4 years old
and a resident of Janakiram Layout in Seva Nagar, had been treated
for the disease and discharged from the Epidemic Diseases Hospital a
few days ago.

Health and Family Welfare Department joint director (Communicable
Diseases) Shivaram said that one of the 41 stool samples of the
suspected cholera patients sent by the hospital during last week,
proved positive for cholera. He said that so far no case of cholera
was detected from Bharathinagar, from where a large number of
gastroenteritis cases were reported after contamination of drinking
water a week ago [28 Jan-3 Feb 2008].
