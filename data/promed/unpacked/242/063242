Unexplained Illness Claims One More Child
-----------------------------------------
GUWAHATI: One more infant's death has been reported in the state due to the
"killer dose" of pulse polio vitamin A [presumed to mean combined polio
vaccination and vitamin A supplementation - Mod.MPP, taking the toll to 2.
A 7-month-old boy, died after consuming vitamin A drops in central Assam's
Sonitpur district. The first death of a 2-year-old child was reported some
days ago.
More than 2500 children between one and 5 years were affected throughout
the state after what is being suspected to be an overdose of vitamin A
drops administered to them orally under a state government-UNICEF Pulse
vitamin A programme.
However, according to official figures, all the 717 children who had so far
been affected were either improving at home or were discharged from
different hospitals after they were cured. Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi
on Thursday denied that his government has received any communication from
the Centre prohibiting the use of several batches of concentrated vitamin A
solution.

Indian Doctors Suspended After Vitamin Overdoses
------------------------------------------------
GUWAHATI: Two Indian doctors and 4 nurses have been suspended after a
2-year-old girl died and at least 700 children fell ill due to a vitamin
overdose, officials stated on Fri 16 Nov 2001. The children were taken to
hospital in the northeast state of Assam after Sunday's anti-blindness
campaign in which medical workers administered vitamin A supplied by UNICEF
to 321 000 children.
The children developed fevers and started vomiting after taking the vitamin
orally. They have since been released. "Now we are almost certain that the
children were affected because of an overdose of the medicine," Assam
Health Minister Bhumidhar Burman told Reuters. "Action has been taken
against the doctors and nurses responsible for it."
UNICEF denied reports of vitamin contamination after the Assam
episode. Officials said the doses were part of a third round of vitamin A
administration in Assam and there had been no complications in earlier cases.

[An earlier BBC News report (reference above) indicated that this incident
in Assam might have been due to contamination of oral poliovirus vaccine.
That report has since been withdrawn from the BBC web-site and replaced by
a report suggesting contamination of a vitamin A supplement. The true
nature of this incident still remains unclear in view of the denial from
UNICEF reported above. - Mod.CP
In response to a criticism of the vertical nature of the polio vaccination
campaigns, and to take advantage of the major mobilization of resources for
these campaigns, many countries have been appending additional antigens or
other public health interventions to polio campaigns (in this case vitamin
A supplementation, in other cases measles vaccine or TT vaccination of
women of childbearing age). There is an analysis of this recommendation on
the WHO webpage:
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-diseases/en/vitamina/operations/ops12.shtml>.
As the major focus of the campaign (and most likely the focus of the social
mobilization messages associated with the campaign planning) it seems there
was an initial inclination to blame the OPV, followed by a realization that
the incubation period was too short to attribute the effects to the OPV.
Subsequently, the vitamin A was considered, and probably appropriately
blamed. From the sketchy news reports, it seems as though the
administration spoon that was distributed along with the vitamin A was a 5
ml spoon rather than the 2 ml spoon previously used. Usually, vitamin A
delivered for use along with vaccination programs is in the form of
capsules containing 200 000 units per capsule, with the recommended dose
for children 6-11 months of age being 100 000 units (or 0.5 capsules) and
the dose for 12-59 months of age being 200 000 units (one capsule). In this
case it appears as though India has been using vials with measuring spoons
and the campaign in question used a larger measuring spoon allowing for a
2.5 fold increase in dose administered if attention wasn't paid to new
instructions (the actual required dose vs. size of new spoon is confusing
in the original articles). - Mod.MPP.
