Further cases of _P.vivax_ malaria in Queensland, Australia
---------------------------------
There are now 8 reported cases of _P.vivax_ malaria that were acquired
in north Queensland in early October 2002.
The cases range in age from 21.5 to 43.5 years; 3 have been hospitalised
(for dehydration, for stabilisation of a pre-existing medical condition and
for a pyrexia of unknown origin). The onset dates range from 18 to 30 Oct
2002; all 8 were campers at the Noah Beach campground, within the Daintree
National Park (Cape Tribulation), north of Cairns. The relevant exposure
period at the campground was approximately 8-18 Oct 2002.
We know that the campground was very full in early October. It is a lowland
rainforest environment, and the brackish streams bordering the site were
prolific _Anopheles farauti_ breeding sites, particularly the creek at the
northern end. It is likely that there are still further cases that have yet
to be linked to Noah Beach. Indeed, 2 foreign nationals are among the 8
cases, and one notification came from interstate (Sydney) in Australia.
We would be grateful for details of any other cases of _P. vivax_ malaria
that may have been acquired at Noah Beach in October 2002.

[The 3 new cases point to local transmission and, as reported in the first
posting, a suspected carrier of _P.vivax_ gametocytes had remained in the
camps through the end of September, which fits with the time it takes the
plasmodia to develop in the mosquito. - Mod.EP]
