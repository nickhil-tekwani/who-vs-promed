A mysterious disease is afflicting children under 12 years of age as well as donkeys in Deleig camp for the displaced in Wadi Salih locality, Central Darfur.

One of the camp sheikhs told Radio Dabanga that about 75 percent of the children in the camp have been infected with the disease. The symptoms are coughing, vomiting, inflammation in the genitals, and sleeplessness.

The sheikh said that the disease has spread over the past 2 weeks. The camp's health centre has 9 rooms that can accommodate 20 children, but there are 100 or more cases. He said that there have been no fatalities thus far. The administration of the health centre has distributed white syrup and painkillers without explaining the reason for the disease's outbreak or how to prevent it.

The Sheikh called on the authorities and organisations working in the field of health care to urgently access the area to contain and identify the disease.

[The description of the disease (coughing, vomiting, inflammation in the genitals, and sleeplessness) affecting mainly children under 12 years of age is too vague and non-specific to suggest a diagnosis. Is fever part of the illness? What is the sex distribution of the cases? What exactly is meant by "inflammation in the genitals," balanitis, orchitis, epididymitis in boys, vaginitis in girls? In what way are the donkeys involved? More information on the illness affecting the children and donkeys in the Deleig camp would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Sudan is an Arab state in the Nile Valley of North Africa. Sudan is divided into 18 states or wilayat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan). Central Darfur is one of the states of Sudan, and one of 5 comprising the Darfur region. It was created in January 2012 as a result of the ongoing peace process for the wider Darfur region (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Darfur). The state was formed from land that was previously part of the states of West Darfur and South Darfur. For a map of Central Darfur showing the location of Wadi Salih and Deleig, see (http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/map_2981.pdf). - Mod.ML

Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ and _Y. enterocolitica_ can occur in equines, but humans get febrile diarrhea and/or abdominal pain, not vomiting and inflammation of the genitals (what ever that represents). - Mod.LL

West Nile virus infection seems unlikely because respiratory symptoms (coughing) are not part of the clinical WNV picture, nor is genital inflammation, nor is a high proportion (75 percent) of the population affected with clinical disease; 20 percent or less of WNV infected people have clinical signs. - Mod.TY

No donkey deaths were mentioned, so it is unlikely to be anthrax. - Mod.JW
