Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: El Peumo, Los Nogales, Valparaiso
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 Aug 2019
Outbreak status: resolved on 4 Sep 2019
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 67 500 / 13 000 / 0 / 67 500 / 0

Affected population: 6-week-old fattening turkeys. Positive results were obtained from a routine sampling internal to the company, dated 27 Aug 2019, prior to a movement towards the final fattening site; consequently, there were no bird movements towards another site. On 28 Aug 2019, the company in question notified a positive result to PCR test (type-A matrix). On the same day, the Service for Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) performed swabbing and serum sampling. On 29 Aug 2019, serum samples gave negative results to agar-gel immunodiffusion tests, positive results to PCR (type-A matrix), and negative results to H7 and H5 PCR tests. Virus sequencing, dated 2 Sep 2019, gave a similar result to a low pathogenic H7 virus, discovered in wild birds in 2016. Virus samples will be sent to the OIE reference laboratory. No clinical sign was observed in the animals. All susceptible animals were killed and buried on the same farm, on 3-4 Sep 2019.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*

[In January 2017, Chile reported LPAI where subtype H7N6 was identified. According to the epidemiological comments found in the final report, "The most probable cause of infection would be the transmission of the virus (of South American lineage) through wild bird fauna." The final report, which was submitted on 12 Jun 2017, can be seen at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=24038.

The event summary and map for this 2017 event is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22152.

The results for the N type involved in this current event are still pending. - Mod.CRD
