The Wyoming State veterinarian, Dr. Jim Logan, was on campus Tuesday [13 Oct 2015] night to inform the community about vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV] that is most commonly found in horses [and cattle and other livestock - Mod.TG] and the concerns and precautions that people with livestock should take.

The 1st reported case of VSV in Fremont County was on 27 Aug 2015. Since then, there have been about 54 confirmed and suspected cases in Fremont County.

"We are here to help protect our livestock," said Dr. Logan. "This is a contagious disease of hoofed animals, and it has been around for a long time, and we have had outbreaks before. We will get through this when we get a couple of hard frosts."

Other cases of VSV outbreaks have happened in the 80s, 90s and in 2007 and 2011. The current outbreak seems to be milder than in the past, Dr. Logan said. This year [2015], there have been 8 [7?] states with VSV cases: Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. Six of those states still have premises under quarantine. For Wyoming, 113 premises have been quarantined in 9 counties. Those counties affected are Albany, Laramie, Goshen, Platte, Natrona, Converse, Weston, Sublette and Fremont.

"We take action on what cases are reported. It is mandatory to report VSV, but there are probably more cases that we do not know of," Dr. Logan said. "We need to know so we can keep VSV and other diseases from spreading so we do not have these outbreaks."

Signs of VSV
---------
Animals stop feeding and drinking
Slobbering
Frothing mouth
Lameness
Blisters and lesions
Scabby crusted lesions on the muzzle

Why Quarantine:
-----------
Prevent spread
Clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease
Highly contagious

The reason it is so important to report this outbreak is because VSV can look like other diseases such as foot-and-mouth, said Dr. Thatch Winslow, assistant state veterinarian. Signs of VSV need to be reported immediately, and it is state and federally mandatory to report it.

It is important to keep an eye on livestock. The quarantining process lasts 2 weeks from when the case was 1st seen; if a new case appears, then the 2 week quarantine starts again. A horse with VSV is only contagious when it has an active lesion, which only lasts about 2 weeks.

Quarantining also helps prevent the spread of the disease. There are no cures for VSV, but there are ways to help prevent the spread. As VSV is commonly spread through flies and midges, keep flies down with spray, keep grass cut, and keep other areas clean around livestock. The disease can also be spread by direct contact such as nose to nose or through indirect contact through troughs. There are no vaccines for VSV.

"Rely on the animals' immune system for it to clear up," Dr. Logan said. "You can use antibiotic or a salve to try to promote healing."

To report suspected cases of VSV, contact your local veterinarian.

[Colorado and Wyoming have been hit pretty hard this year [2015] with this disease. Since this is an insect-transmitted disease, the states are surely hoping for a killing frost soon to eliminate the insects and decrease the spread of this virus.

"Owners should remember:
- Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease.
- Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools, or health care equipment from other herds.

"How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully known; insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals are all factors. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles. Humans rarely contract vesicular stomatitis, but they can become infected.

"Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed only in the western hemisphere. It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically."
