Five swans at Lake Romagnieu, near Pont-de-Beauvoisin (Is√®re) have died from avian botulism, according to the results of analysis carried out by the Pasteur Institute in Paris.

The Departmental Agency for Protecting Populations (HADD) announced this on Friday [5 Aug 2016]. The agency said that this disease is not transmissible to humans; the human form of botulism is caused by a different strain. There is no risk to visitors at Lake Romagnieu.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. - Mod.PMB
