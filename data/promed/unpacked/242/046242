[Tularemia, an OIE notifiable disease, is a zoonosis caused by _Francisella tularensis_. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) and rodents, especially microtine rodents such as voles, vole rats, and muskrats, as well as in beavers. In addition, a wide variety of other mammals, birds, amphibians, and invertebrates have been reported to be infected.

Tularemia occurs endemically in the Northern Hemisphere. The disease can occur as epizootic outbreaks in many countries in North America and Europe, while it occurs only as sporadic cases in some other countries in Europe and Asia. It is rarely reported from the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. Several epizootic outbreaks have been reported as a result of importation of subclinically infected lagomorphs.

The clinically most relevant 2 types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of culture characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence. _Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is mainly associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is primarily transmitted by ticks or biting flies, or by direct contact with infected lagomorphs. It is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp. _palaearctica_ (type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) and voles in northern North America, and in lagomorphs (hares) and rodents in Eurasia. It is primarily transmitted by direct contact or by mosquitoes, but may be transmitted through inhalation or through infected water or food. It is less virulent for humans and domestic rabbits and does not ferment glycerol. The information above is primarily based upon chapter 2.1.18 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual from which additional information, particularly addressing diagnostic techniques, is accessible at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_TULAREMIA.pdf. - Mod.AS
