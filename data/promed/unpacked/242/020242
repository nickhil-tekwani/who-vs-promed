North East measles outbreak
---------------------------
The number of children diagnosed with measles in the North East [of
England] this year [2009] has now reached over 100, according to
figures released today [15 Jul 2009] by the Health Protection Agency
[HPA]. To date, 110 confirmed cases have been reported in the North
East since January 2009 and over 100 suspected cases are under
investigation.

As the number of cases continues to grow in what is the largest
outbreak of measles seen in the region for almost 20 years, experts at
the HPA have warned again that children who are not fully vaccinated
against measles are at risk from this potentially serious illness. The
HPA is continuing to support our colleagues in the NHS [National
Health Service] to tackle this disease. In an effort to turn the tide
against these rising numbers, NHS North of Tyne -- working on behalf
of Newcastle and North Tyneside PCTs [Primary Care Trusts] and
Northumberland Care Trust -- has begun a public awareness campaign to
encourage parents to protect their child against the virus.

Over 35 000 leaflets and posters have been sent to community venues
across the areas, including to GP [general practitioners] practices,
nurseries, children's centres, health centres, and libraries, and over
the next few weeks 20 000 letters are being sent out to parents of
children who have yet to have both, or any doses of the vaccine.

Dr Roberta Marshall, acting regional director for the HPA in the North
East said: "Despite the recent efforts of our partners in the NHS, the
uptake rate for the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine is still
well below the Government target of 95 per cent which the World Health
Organisation advises is necessary to prevent the widespread return of
measles. "Latest MMR uptake figures (January to March 2009) show that
only 86 per cent of eligible children have received both doses of the
vaccine by their 5th birthday. Currently, one in every 10 children in
the North East is at risk of contracting the disease. "And this figure
is only the North East average so there are still several areas in the
region where uptake is even lower. This means that the number of
children catching measles is likely to increase further."

"Worryingly, there are also many children out there who were not
vaccinated as toddlers over the past decade and remain unprotected.
Measles, which is highly infectious, is spreading easily among these
unvaccinated children who are now teenagers. "Measles should not be
taken lightly as you can never tell who will go on to develop the more
serious complications of pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of
the brain). That's why it's incredibly important to remember that
measles isn't a 'harmless' childhood disease and why we are urging
parents to make sure that their children are fully immunised and have
had both doses of the MMR vaccine. "It's never too late to get your
child vaccinated. If they've missed out on MMR in the past it's always
possible for them to catch up. Just contact your local GP."

Measles is potentially a very serious illness, which can on rare
occasions be fatal. It is highly infectious and is spread through
direct contact with an infected person or through the air when an
infected person coughs or sneezes. There is no treatment for measles
but it can be prevented by the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine
and 2 doses are required to ensure children are fully immunised.

[So far little progress has been achieved in the north east of England
to raise the level of acceptance of the MMR vaccine from its current
level of 86 per cent to the target level of 95 per cent needed to
interrupt transmission of measles virus in the community. We can only
hope that the current campaign will have more success.
