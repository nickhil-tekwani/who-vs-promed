The program on safety of anthracic entombments in Nizhny Novgorod is
half completed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The regional purpose-oriented program "Safety maintenance of
anthracic entombment in Nizhny Novgorod region" in 2007 is half completed.
There are objective reasons for incompleteness. One of these reasons
is the absence of information on the locations of anthrax cattle
graves. An objective of the program is to provide safety of 232
anthracic cattle graves. It is offered to significantly solve this
problem -- by means of conservation of the anthracic cattle graves.
Conservation technology of cattle graves means constructing concrete
sarcophagi. According to archival data since 1888 for the Nizhniy
Novgorod region 22 282 animals with anthrax were registered in 2080
settlements.

[Tragically my good friend and colleague Benyamin Cherkasskiy died
earlier this year of lung cancer. He had constructed a 100 year
'cadaster' of anthrax outbreaks in the old Soviet Union and was a
valued reference for what had happened when and where. Many anthrax
cattle gaves were routinely checked annually under the old system,
and if positive most ceased to display any spores within a few years.
The routine system for dealing with them was to lay down a concrete
slab over the grave. Inelegant but effective. - Mod.MHJ]

1180 anthrax pestholes were registered in Kyrgyzstan
------------------------------------------------------
1180 anthrax pestholes [foci] were registered in Kyrgyzstan. In 2007,
1 028 500 cattle, 2 408 000 sheep and goats, 202 400 horses and 17
200 pigs were vaccinated against anthrax.
The main reason of anthrax is serious infringement of veterinary and
sanitary regulations by owners of animals during slaughtering and
realization of slaughter products.

[Unfavorable situation with anthrax cattle graves in Russia (Nizhny
Novgorod, Udmurtia, Mary El, Karelia, Irkutsk region) may result in
animal and human anthrax.
A complicated situation with cattle graves has developed in
Kyrgyzstan where tens of human and animal anthrax cases are annually
registered. All agricultural animals are subject to obligatory
vaccination against anthrax. However some owners of animals evade
vaccination and that may lead to an increased risk of infection and
promote pathogen circulation in the environment. - Mod.NP]
[The 1180 'pestholes' noted above is the historic number of known and
registered sites, not the cases in 2007. The true situation in
Kyrgyzstan may not be as good as these vaccination numbers might
indicate. Funds trickle down from the top and thus rural veterinary
offices are seldom supplied with enough money for gasoline to travel
out to their local farms and villages, much less having vehicles.
This results in a paucity of rural veterinarians. So these
vaccination numbers probably refer to doses purchased centrally.
In addition, the traditional livestock handling procedure is for a
community hired minder to collect up the village livestock in the
morning and walk them out to the grazing area. If an animal sickens
during the day, it will have its throat cut, and the carcass is
skinned and butchered. The pieces are then wrapped in the hide and
delivered to the owner when the animals return to the village and
handed over to their owners in the evening. This traditional system
of management is common throughout Central Asia, those parts of
Russia, parts of eastern Turkey and even in parts of Italy. The
result is that there is significant soil contamination and a real
risk of ongoing anthrax outbreaks. Also retrospectively locating
these foci is not without problems. Attempts at fencing them off
frequently result in the barbed wire being stolen. The only way of
managing this situation is by rigorous annual vaccination, and when
the incidence eventually drops away having a proactive surveillance
system, site management, and laboratory confirmation. Not complicated
when there is adequate funding at the field level and a functional
infrastructure. The real world is frequently different. - Mod.MHJ]
