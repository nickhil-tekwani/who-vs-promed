Rift Valley fever Alert
-----------------------
Several newspapers and websites have rung alarm bells and warned
against a new epidemic of Rift Valley fever [RVF] virus, a virus
mainly transmitted by mosquitoes, that decimates mainly the animal
but also [affects] the human population.

In 2000 the RVF virus struck down 863 people in Saudi Arabia, of whom
120 died, and more than 1000 individuals in Yemen, (121 of whom
died), local press at that time reported [see ProMED 2001 ref. below].

Horror gripped the people of Saudi Arabia after the appearance of RVF
cases in Jeddah and Mecca, Mohamed Sayed Ali reported on 13 Apr 2009
on 'Islamonline.' Quoting government medical sources, the official
Saudi press agency SPA had at the time announced 33 cases of RVF
illness in Jeddah and 103 in Mecca since the beginning of the month.

The daily Okaz had, on 12 Apr 2009, reported that a Saudi man and
woman, aged respectively 20 and 22 years old, afflicted by the virus,
had finally succumbed the previous day at King Faisal hospital in
Mecca. The following day, other newspapers had reported the
hospitalisation in Mecca of more than 100 people affected by the
disease. Most of them were discharged from hospitals after receiving
emergency treatment.

An American company has been called in to eradicate the RVF virus
[vector?] by using biological processes, instead of chemical means,
stated the website Anaween on Thu 28 May 2009.

[Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects
animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can
cause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high
rates of disease and death. The disease also results in significant
economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected
livestock. Outbreaks of rift Valley fever in the human population are
usually preceded by extensive outbreaks of disease in livestock,
therefore the current report from Saudi Arabia should be treated with caution.

According to the World Health Organisation Fact Sheet
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/index.html>) The
vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect
contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can
be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.
Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse
workers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.
The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound
from an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or
through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of
infected animals. There is some evidence that humans may also become
infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of
infected animals.

Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected
mosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ spp., and transmission of
RVF virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.

To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented,
and no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported
when standard infection control precautions have been put in place.
There has been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas. - Mod.CP]
