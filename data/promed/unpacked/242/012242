Community-acquired Legionnaires' disease in southeast Norway, May 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Norwegian health authorities are investigating an outbreak of
Legionnaires' disease in the neighboring cities of Sarpsborg and
Fredrikstad in southeastern Norway, close to the border with Sweden.

As of 26 May 2005, 39 cases, including 5 deaths, have been reported
in this outbreak. All cases have been confirmed by urinary antigen
testing. Cultures of clinical specimens have not yet been completed.
The mean age of patients is 67 years (range: 35-94). 23 cases (59
percent) are in men. All cases are in Norwegian nationals, and there
is no information on any international events in the area in the
period.

35 of the cases (90 percent) are in local residents, while the
remaining 4 cases have been diagnosed in patients elsewhere in Norway
who had visited the area during the probable exposure period.

The 2 cities are situated very close to each other with a total of
120 000 inhabitants. The area is heavily industrial and is not a
particular tourist destination.

The source is still unknown. Because the outbreak is large with many
cases (including deaths) over a wide geographical area within a short
time period (Figure), cooling towers are the most likely source. All
of the known 19 cooling towers in the area have been closed down,
pending results of bacteriological testing and disinfection.
Epidemiologists from Nasjonalt folkehelseinstitutt (Norwegian
Institute of Public Health) are assisting local health authorities
with the outbreak investigation. Other probable sources are also
being investigated. Clinical and environmental samples are being
genotyped to support other epidemiological data.

in Fredrikstad-Sarpsborg, Norway, May 2005 at URL link provided above]

The rate of case reporting has now diminished, and based on
epidemiological data, it is probable that the source is now inactive.
Local health authorities have not issued any specific restrictions
regarding staying in or travel to the area.

The outbreak has stimulated public discussion about statutory
regulations for cooling towers and similar installations. Following a
similar outbreak in Stavanger in 2001 [1], all owners of cooling
towers are now required to notify local health authorities of their
installation and to have an adequate system of control and
maintenance. Local authorities have a statutory responsibility.

Legionnaires' disease in Lyon, France, Apr-May 2005: preliminary results
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In May 2005, an outbreak of 34 cases of Legionnaires' disease was
detected in a suburb of Lyon, in eastern France. All patients
presented with symptoms of acute lower respiratory disease, and all
tested positive for urinary antigen, indicating a _Legionella
pneumophila_ Lp1 infection. Patient ages ranged from 39 to 86 years
(median age 65 years) and 70 percent were men.

27 patients were admitted to hospital. No deaths have been reported.
The dates of symptom onset ranged from 28 Apr to 9 May 2005 (Figure).
Clinical isolates were obtained from 2 patients and are currently
being tested by the National Reference Laboratory for _Legionella_.

[See Figure. Epidemic curve of the legionnaire's disease outbreak,
northeast suburbs of Lyon, France, April-May 2005, at URL link
provided above]

The epidemiological investigation carried out by the local and
national health institutions was based on a standardised
questionnaire. Patients were asked about their living and working
conditions as well as where they had been during the 10 days
preceding the onset of symptoms (incubation period for Legionnaires'
disease is 2-10 days). The environmental investigations were carried
out in the same area by the local environmental authorities. All
devices that can spread aerosols were tested, including cooling
towers, car wash stations and agricultural watering systems. Control
measures implemented included the disinfection and shutdown of these
systems until further verification.

Preliminary findings showed that 32 patients (94 percent) lived in,
or passed through, the 2 adjacent communes of Caluire-et-Cuire and
Rilleux-la-Pape, a residential area located in a northeastern suburb
of Lyon. This suggests a common source of infection such as a cooling
tower. No additional case was detected during the 10 days after the
onset of the last cases on 9 May 2005, suggesting that the source may
have been interrupted.
