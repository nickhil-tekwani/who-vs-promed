[The Artsakh Republic of the South Caucasus includes most of the
territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and several
Azerbaijani districts adjacent to the borders of Azerbaijan with
Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. Artsakh is better known as
Nagorno-Karabakh, a former Azerbaijan enclave in Armenia. It is still
de jure part of Azerbaijan but de facto under Armenian control.

There have been no recent reports of outbreaks of infectious disease
among the inhabitants of the Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) Republic.
Information on the identity of the disease and the severity of the
outbreak would be welcomed from any informed source in the region. -
