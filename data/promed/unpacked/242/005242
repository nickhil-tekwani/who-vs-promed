Farmers fetch a good price for their crop [but] have raised their concerns with Minister for Agriculture, Inia Seruiratu, and his team, about a disease that is affecting their matured chilies.

Principal research officer horticulture, Shalendra Prasad, said the disease in chilies had been raging for 5 years and was known as anthracnose. He said fruits would turn brown and rot just as they approached maturity.

"Chilies should not be planted in the field where you plant tomatoes, cucumbers, and cabbage. Farmers can apply a chemical. We will soon launch 10 chilli [varieties] that are resistant to anthracnose."

[Several fungi in the genus _Colletotrichum_ have been reported as causal agents of anthracnose of _Capsicum_ spp. (including chili varieties) worldwide. The disease is one of the major economic constraints to chili production, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Symptoms on chili usually include leaf spots and sunken necrotic lesions with concentric rings of fungal growth on fruit. Economic losses are due to up to 50 per cent yield loss and severe reduction of product quality before and after harvest. Disease development is favoured by moist conditions.

Fungal spores are spread by wind-blown rain, insects, human activities, or with infected plant material (including seeds). The pathogens can survive for long periods on crop residues. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, cultural techniques (for example to reduce moisture in plantings), phytosanitation, and timely applications of systemic fungicides. Commercial chili cultivars resistant to anthracnose are being developed.

Species and strains in the genus _Colletotrichum_ cause anthracnose and other diseases on a wide range of crops. Some of the pathogens are now considered species complexes.
