[This case was apparently not reported to WHO immediately, as required by
the International Health Regulations. As always, ProMED-mail would
appreciate
information on the origin of this case and the strain of cholera involved.
The last 2 cases imported into New Zealand and reported on ProMED-mail (see
refs. above) were _V. cholerae_ O1: Biotype El Tor : Subtype Ogawa, in
January and August 1999, and they originated in the Pacific Islands. - Mod.JW
