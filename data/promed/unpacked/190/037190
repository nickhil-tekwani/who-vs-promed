The death toll from an outbreak of Rift Valley fever [RVF] in Kenya
has hit 88, said officials on Saturday [13 Jan 2007], as health
authorities fanned out across affected regions in a bid to contain the disease.
The viral disease has infected about 250 people since it was 1st
reported in mid-December 2006 and has continued to spread across
several, mostly arid, districts in the country.
"In northeastern regions, so far we have recorded 82 deaths," said
Omar Ahmed, the medical services chief in the country's worst-hit
Northeastern Province.
Health authorities have also reported the death of at least 6 people
in the coastal province, bringing the overall toll to 88.
"We are moving across the affected region to ensure that we contain
the disease, which is spread by either mosquitoes or by direct
contact with infected animals," Ahmed told AFP by telephone.
Officials said vaccinations targeting 2 million animals, which began
on Monday [8 Jan 2007], have intensified in the region, most of which
was recently hit by flooding triggered by unusually heavy rains [see
commentary].
The exact number of people infected is unknown, but experts believe
it is much higher than officially recorded, because most of those
affected come from communities of nomadic farmers in remote areas.
The government has banned the slaughter of animals in affected
regions, advised farmers to reduce contact between humans and
livestock, boil milk before drinking it and sleep under mosquito nets.
Patients have fever, general weakness, back pain, dizziness, vomit
blood and lose weight at the onset of the illness.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and aid agencies
Medecins Sans Frontieres, the World Health Organization and the
United Nations children's fund are assisting the government in
containing the outbreak.

[Mass animal vaccinations are vital in preventing RVF in animals and
reducing exposure of humans to this zoonotic disease agent. There are
2 commercially available animal vaccines: live-attenuated and
inactivated (dead) vaccines. The live vaccine, prepared from
Smithburn's attenuated strain of RVF virus, is recommended for use in
non-pregnant animals (cattle, sheep, goats, camels) since it may
cause abortions. The inactivated vaccine may be used in pregnant
animals as well; it requires a booster vaccination, and its price is higher.
Here, too, timing is everything. If applied prior to the outbreak,
both vaccine types may be used with good results. When vaccination is
resorted to during the course of an outbreak, its effect will be less
significant.
Details on the vaccine used currently in Kenya and the animal species
vaccinated will be useful. Can one assume that -- in view of time
constraints and the need for immediate effect -- mainly or only live
vaccine will be applied? - Mod.AS]
