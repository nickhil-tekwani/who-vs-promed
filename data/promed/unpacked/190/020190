Scientists discover genetic and immunologic underpinnings of some cases of severe COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New findings by scientists at the National Institutes of Health and their collaborators help explain why some people with COVID-19 develop severe disease. The findings also may provide the 1st molecular explanation for why more men than women die from COVID-19.

The researchers found that more than 10% of people who develop severe COVID-19 have misguided antibodies -- autoantibodies -- that attack the immune system rather than the virus that causes the disease. Another 3.5% or more of people who develop severe COVID-19 carry a specific kind of genetic mutation that impacts immunity. Consequently, both groups lack effective immune responses that depend on type I interferon, a set of 17 proteins crucial for protecting cells and the body from viruses. Whether these proteins have been neutralized by autoantibodies or -- because of a faulty gene -- were produced in insufficient amounts or induced an inadequate antiviral response, their absence appears to be a commonality among a subgroup of people who suffer from life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings are the 1st published results from the COVID Human Genetic Effort, an international project spanning more than 50 genetic sequencing hubs and hundreds of hospitals. The effort is co-led by Helen Su, MD, PhD, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH; and Jean-Laurent Casanova, MD, PhD, head of the St Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases at The Rockefeller University in New York. Major contributions were made by Luigi Notarangelo, MD, chief of the NIAID Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology (LCIM); Steven Holland, MD, director of the NIAID Division of Intramural Research and senior investigator in the NIAID LCIM; clinicians and investigators in hospitals in the Italian cities of Brescia, Monza, and Pavia, which were heavily hit by COVID-19; and researchers at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland.

The wide variation in the severity of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, has puzzled scientists and clinicians. SARS-CoV-2 can cause anything from a symptom-free infection to death, with many different outcomes in between. Since February 2020, Drs Su and Casanova and their collaborators have enrolled thousands of COVID-19 patients to find out whether a genetic factor drives these disparate clinical outcomes.

The researchers discovered that among nearly 660 people with severe COVID-19, a significant number carried rare genetic variants in 13 genes known to be critical in the body's defense against influenza virus, and more than 3.5% were completely missing a functioning gene. Further experiments showed that immune cells from those 3.5% did not produce any detectable type I interferons in response to SARS-CoV-2.

Examining nearly 1000 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, the researchers also found that more than 10% had autoantibodies against interferons at the onset of their infection, and 95% of those patients were men. Biochemical experiments confirmed that the autoantibodies block the activity of interferon type I.

Abstract
Clinical outcome upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from silent infection to lethal COVID-19. We have found an enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus, in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally define LOF variants in 23 patients (3.5%), aged 17 to 77 years, underlying autosomal recessive or dominant deficiencies. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this pathway are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection.

Conclusions [abridged]
Our findings suggest that there may be mutations in other type I IFN-related genes in other patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. They also suggest that the administration of type I IFN may be of therapeutic benefit in selected patients, at least early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract
Interindividual clinical variability in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is immense. We report that at least 101 of 987 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia had neutralizing IgG auto-Abs against IFN-omega (13 patients), the 13 types of IFN-alpha (36), or both (52), at the onset of critical disease; a few also had auto-Abs against the other three type I IFNs. The auto-Abs neutralize the ability of the corresponding type I IFNs to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. These auto-Abs were not found in 663 individuals with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and were present in only 4 of 1,227 healthy individuals. Patients with auto-Abs were aged 25 to 87 years and 95 were men. A B cell auto-immune phenocopy of inborn errors of type I IFN immunity underlies life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.

Conclusion
We report here that at least 10% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia have neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs. With our accompanying description of patients with inborn errors of type I IFNs and life-threatening COVID-19 this study highlights the crucial role of type I IFNs in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. These auto-Abs against type I IFNs were clinically silent until the patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, which is a poor inducer of type I IFNs, suggesting that the small amounts of IFNs induced by the virus are important for protection against severe disease. The neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs, like inborn errors of type I IFN production, tip the balance in favor of the virus, resulting in devastating disease, with insufficient, and even perhaps deleterious, innate and adaptive immune responses.

Our findings have direct clinical implications. First, SARS-CoV-2-infected patients can be screened to identify individuals with auto-Abs at risk of developing life-threatening pneumonia. Such patients recovering from life-threatening COVID-19 should also be excluded from donating convalescent plasma for ongoing clinical trial, or at least tested before their plasma donations are accepted. Second, this unexpected finding paves the way for therapeutic intervention, including plasmapheresis, monoclonal Abs depleting plasmablasts, and the specific inhibition of type I IFN-reactive B cells. Finally, in this patient group, early treatment with IFN-alpha is unlikely to be beneficial. However, treatment with injected or nebulized IFN-beta may have beneficial effects, as auto-Abs against IFN-beta appear to be rare in patients with auto-Abs against type I IFNs.

Hidden immune weakness found in 14% of gravely ill COVID-19 patients
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Two papers published online in Science this week confirm that in a significant minority of patients with serious COVID-19, the interferon response has been crippled by genetic flaws or by rogue antibodies that attack interferon itself. "Together these 2 papers explain nearly 14% of severe COVID-19 cases. That is quite amazing," says Qiang Pan-Hammarstr√∂m, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute.

Tadatsugu Taniguchi, a pioneering interferon scientist and emeritus professor at the University of Tokyo, calls the discoveries "remarkable." He says they highlight the "critical" role of type I interferons in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of potentially lethal COVID-19.

Co-author Isabelle Meyts, a pediatric immunologist at the University Hospitals Leuven, was struck by one paper's finding that rogue antibodies underlie COVID-19 in 10% of gravely ill patients: "There has never been any infectious disease explained at this level by a factor in the human body. And it's not an isolated cohort of Europeans. Patients are from all over the world, all ethnicities." Another finding, that 94% of the patients with interferon-attacking antibodies were male, also helps explain why men face higher risk of severe disease.

The paired studies have immediate practical implications. Synthetic interferons, long used to treat other diseases, might help some at-risk patients, as might other therapies aimed at removing the damaging antibodies. A common kind of antibody test could be readily developed and return answers in hours. Those found to be at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 could take precautions to avoid exposure or be prioritized for vaccination, says Elina Zuniga, an immunologist who studies interferons at the University of California, San Diego.

The findings also raise a red flag for plasma donations from recovered patients. Because it may be rich in antibodies to the virus, "convalescent plasma" is already given to some patients to fight the infection. But some donations could harbor the interferon-neutralizing antibodies. "You should eliminate these patients from the pool of donors," Zuniga says. "You definitely don't want to be transferring these autoantibodies into another person."

Type I interferons are made by every cell in the body and are vital leaders of the antiviral battle early in infection. They launch an immediate, intense local response when a virus invades a cell, triggering infected cells to produce proteins that attack the virus. They also summon immune cells to the site and alert uninfected neighboring cells to prepare their own defenses.

In one study, Jean-Laurent Casanova, an infectious disease geneticist at Rockefeller University, and his team examined blood samples from 987 gravely ill patients from around the world. In 10.2% of the patients, the researchers identified antibodies that attacked and neutralized the patients' own type I interferon. A subgroup of affected patients had extremely low or undetectable blood levels of this interferon. Lab studies confirmed the antibodies knocked the interferon out of action and cells exposed to the patients' plasma failed to fend off invasion by the new coronavirus.

None of the 663 people in a control group with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection had those damaging antibodies. The antibodies were also scarce in the general population, showing up in only 0.33% of more than 1200 healthy people tested. "What this means is that at least 10% of critical COVID-19 is an autoimmune attack against the immune system itself," Casanova says.

The preponderance of male patients was a surprise, because women have higher rates of autoimmune disease. "Our favorite hypothesis is that it is an X-linked recessive trait," Casanova says. "Women with 2 X chromosomes are protected and men, with one, are not." Supporting that suspicion, one woman with a rare condition that silences one X chromosome was among the severely ill patients with autoantibodies.

The 2nd paper found genetic flaws in patients that led to the same end result: a grossly inadequate interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The team sequenced DNA from 659 critically ill COVID-19 patients and from 534 controls with mild or asymptomatic disease. They examined 13 genes, chosen because flaws in them impair the body's production or use of type I interferon; mutations in the genes underlie life-threatening influenza or other viral illnesses. The researchers found that 3.5% of the critically ill patients harbored rare mutations in eight of those genes. In patients for whom blood samples were available, interferon levels were vanishingly small. No members of the control group carried any of the mutations. "This is the 1st paper to pin down indisputably disease-causing mutations underlying severe COVID-19," Pan-Hammarstr√∂m says.

Dozens of randomized clinical trials are now deploying interferons against SARS-CoV-2. One, led by Tom Wilkinson at the University of Southampton, reported promising findings in a small group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But synthetic interferons won't help patients who harbor mutations that prevent interferons from working, or those with antibodies that attack them.

Some researchers caution that the interferon-neutralizing antibodies could be a cause, rather than a consequence, of severe COVID-19. "It's possible that they develop during the disease," says Miriam Merad, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. That would explain why the patients hadn't faced life-threatening viral infections before, she says.

Yanick Crow, a clinical geneticist at the University of Edinburgh who studies interferon signaling, calls the antibody paper "shocking," in part because men were so much more likely than women to carry the rogue antibodies. Tests screening for the antibodies can and should be rapidly developed, he says, and will quickly reveal whether the new findings hold up. Given tens of millions of cases worldwide, he says, "10% is such a high figure and the implications are very important."

[2] Saudi Arabia: gradual resumption of Umrah
Date: Tue 22 Sep 2020
Source: Saudi Gazette [edited]
https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/598325/SAUDI-ARABIA/Saudi-Arabia-allows-gradual-resumption-of-Umrah-from-Oct-4


Saudi Arabia has announced the gradual resumption of Umrah [pilgrimage] and visits to the Two Holy Mosques with a limited number of pilgrims, starting from [4 Oct 2020], the Saudi Press Agency reported on Tuesday [22 Sep 2020] citing a source at the Ministry of Interior.

The ministry source said that based on the reports of the competent authorities regarding coronavirus developments and in response to the aspirations of many Muslims at home and abroad to perform Umrah, and based on the leadership's keenness on the health and safety of the visitors the Two Holy Mosques, a royal approval has been given to allow the performance of Umrah and visits to the Two Holy Mosques gradually while taking the necessary health preventative measures.

In the 1st phase, citizens and expatriates from within the Kingdom will be allowed to perform Umrah at a capacity of 30 percent from [4 Oct 2020] that translates to 6000 pilgrims per day following the health precautionary measures of the Grand Mosque.

In the 2nd phase, citizens and expatriates inside the Kingdom will be allowed to perform Umrah, visit the Rawdah in the Prophet's Mosque in Madinah, and pray in Two Holy Mosques, starting from [18 Oct 2020], with a 75 percent capacity limit that is equivalent of nearly 15 000 pilgrims per day and 40 000 worshippers per day following the health precautionary measures for the Grand Mosque, as well as 75 percent of the capacity in line with the health precautionary measures for the Rawdah in the Prophet's Mosque.

In the 3rd phase, pilgrims from abroad would be allowed to perform Umrah as of [1 Nov 2020] with a full capacity of 20 000 pilgrims and 60 000 worshipers per day and it will continue until the official end of the coronavirus pandemic or the official announcement that the danger is over. The arrival of Umrah performers and visitors from outside the Kingdom shall be gradual from the countries that are free from health risks related to the coronavirus pandemic, the source added.

The 4th phase will allow the performance of Umrah, visit, and prayers by citizens and expatriates from inside and outside the Kingdom, at 100 percent of the normal capacity of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet's Mosque, when the competent authority decides that the risks of the pandemic has disappeared.

Meanwhile, the entry of pilgrims, worshipers, and visitors shall be regulated through the application (Etamarna), which will be launched by the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, with the aim of implementing the health standards and controls approved by the Ministry of Health and the competent authorities.

The source called upon pilgrims, worshipers, and visitors to adhere to preventive measures and apply the health instructions and requirements, including wearing face masks, keeping a safe distance, and avoiding physical contact.

The source affirmed the Kingdom's keenness to enable the pilgrims from inside and outside the Kingdom to perform the rituals in a safe and healthy manner fulfilling the preventative requirements and spatial distancing in order to ensure human safety and protection from the threats of this pandemic, and achieve the objectives of the Islamic law in preserving human lives.

The source explained that the stages announced in this statement will be subjected to continuous evaluation, according to the developments of the pandemic.

[Saudi Arabia has been reporting 400-600 newly confirmed cases on a daily basis for the past week, having decreased from over 1000 cases on a daily basis at the end of August 2020. Using the experience with MERS-CoV as a background experience, there were no cases of MERS-CoV associated with the Hajj but there were cases associated with Umrah; the former associated with controlled movement of the Hajji's while in Saudi Arabia, the latter associated with free movement (see MERS-CoV (25): risk assessment, WHO 20180808.5954813, and MERS-CoV (01): Malaysia (ex KSA), Saudi Arabia, UAE (ex Oman) 20180102.5532148).

Saudi Arabia has been at the forefront of countries in terms of public health management of mass gatherings. One suspects the early phases (1 and 2) described above will involve individuals residing in Saudi Arabia, so the control will be exercised on compliance with NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) such as mask wearing, social distancing, and frequent hand washing. Phases 3 and 4 will be the challenging phases, but one suspects these pilgrims may have movement control during their stay in Saudi Arabia.

The last sentence of the report above is key -- "the stages announced in this statement will be subjected to continuous evaluation, according to the developments of the pandemic." - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (85 919), followed by the USA (45 918) and Brazil (32 129) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 51.8% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 5797 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (23-24 Sep 2020). Reporting numbers have risen, consistent with resuming fuller reporting following a weekend reduction in reports.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, France (16 096), Argentina (13 467), Spain (10 653), Israel (7425), UK (6634), Russia (6595), Colombia (6555), Peru (6235), and Mexico (5408); 35 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 6 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 2.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 0.75%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe and the Americas showing major increasing transmission in many countries. - Mod.MPP]
