[Further information was received on 2 May 2011 from Dr Joseph Adongo
Awuni, Head of the Accra Veterinary Laboratory on the issue of
"mismanagement" as the source of the outbreak(s) or origin of
infection in the OIE report. Dr Awuni indicated that the affected farm
was characterized by poor biosecurity without proper disinfection
barrier/foot bath at the entrance and is located within a village with
free range village poultry. some of which were found to be sick with
signs suggestive of Newcastle disease (ND).

The vaccination regime was highly questionable, with the birds given
infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccine on the 1st week, followed by
Newcastle disease vaccine (HB1) on the 2nd week, another IBD vaccine
on the 3rd week, and fowl pox vaccination on the 4th week. The birds
had not received the 2nd Newcastle disease vaccine (LaSota strain)
when the outbreak occurred. The IBD vaccine was from a hot virus
strain and therefore the birds were possibly immunosuppressed and
hence poorly reacted to the Newcastle disease vaccine.

Diagnosis of the outbreak was by gross pathology, then rapid avian
influenza test to exclude the possibility of HPAI. Brain tissue was
taken for virus isolation in 10-days old chicken embryos from a local
hatchery. 15 embryos were inoculated with the 10 percent brain tissue
suspension and after incubation at 37 deg C (98.6 deg F) all the
embryos died within 48 hours.

Detection of any haemagglutinating virus was by HA and identification
by HI using reference standard sera and inactivated antigens (H5N2,
H7N1, H9N1, and cluster strain of ND Virus) from OIE /FAO reference
laboratory for Newcastle disease and avian influenza in Padova,
Italy.

ND virus was identified, and since the virus killed chicken embryos
within 48 hours, it can be said to be velogenic with an MDT (mean
death time) of less than 48 hours, and also isolating it from brain
tissue supported a conclusion that it is viscerotropic.

Not every die off is always an emerging disease but it sometimes can
be a failure in basic husbandry, as can be seen in this report where
poor biosecurity measures and failure to follow the vaccination
regimen lead to this outbreak. See also
