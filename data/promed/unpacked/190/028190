China reports 4th bird flu death in 2009
----------------------------------------
A woman in China's far west has died from the H5N1 strain of bird
flu, the Health Ministry said Saturday [24 Jan 2009], the country's
4th death from the virus this year as the biggest festive season
approaches [the Chinese Lunar Year begins on Mon 26 January 2009].
The victim, a 31-year-old woman from Urumqi, the capital of the
Xinjiang region, had been to a live poultry market before she fell
ill on 10 Jan 2009, the official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing
Wang Xiaoyan, a deputy director of the regional health department.
She died on Friday [23 Jan 2009].

A woman in eastern China, a teenage boy in southwest China and a
woman in Beijing have also died from the disease this month. A
2-year-old girl was also sickened with H5N1 but recovered. The Health
Ministry said her mother, who like the toddler went to a live poultry
market, had died of pneumonia in early January [2009]. Doctors said
they could not confirm the cause of death.

China launched a daily bird flu reporting system for poultry and
human cases Thursday [22 Jan 2009], underscoring its concerns about
potential epidemics. Provincial health and agriculture departments
must report to the Health Ministry, Agriculture Ministry and the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce every day on whether
there have been infections in their areas. The Agriculture Ministry
has also ordered increased monitoring and management of live poultry
markets, especially before next week's Lunar New Year holiday, when
people will have more contact with chickens and ducks while preparing
celebratory meals.

Despite the new cases, the Health Ministry has said there was no
evidence of a large-scale outbreak of bird flu. It said the illnesses
were isolated, unrelated and did not show significant mutations of
the H5N1 virus. They also occurred during the cold months, which
experts have determined are high season for infections, it said.

According to the World Health Organization, bird flu has killed 251
people worldwide since 2003, including 22 in China. That number does
not include the latest death. While the disease remains hard for
humans to catch, scientists have warned if outbreaks among poultry
are not controlled, the virus may mutate into a form more easily
passed between people, possibly triggering a pandemic that could kill
millions worldwide.

China records its 4th bird flu death this year
----------------------------------------------
A woman from China's far northwest has died from bird flu, health
authorities said Saturday [24 Jan 2009], making her the country's 4th
fatality from the deadly avian influenza so far this year. The
31-year-old woman fell ill on 10 Jan 2009. She died Friday morning
[23 Jan 2009 according to the preceding report], according to
the health department in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Tests
were positive for H5N1, the department said in a statement posted to
the Health Ministry's Web site.

The official Xinhua news agency said a 16-year-old boy, who had
fallen ill on 8 Jan 2009, died in the city of Huaihua in central
Hunan province [infection contracted elsewhere]. The country's
Ministry of Health had then moved to allay fears over the outbreak,
saying that although further human bird flu cases were possible
throughout China, there wouldn't be a large-scale outbreak, Xinhua
and CCTV said.

One week ago, a 27-year-old woman from eastern China died of bird
flu, the Ministry of Health said in a statement.

The [A?] girl fell ill on 7 Jan 2009 in central Hunan province and
was taken to her home province of Shanxi in northern China, the
state-run news agency Xinhua said. The report did not say how she
became infected.

Since the end of 2003, the H5N1 virus has infected numerous species
of birds in more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. It has
not been found in birds in North or South America or the Caribbean,
according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations. Human-to-human transmission of avian flu is rare, but in
some cases the virus has passed from poultry to humans. It has killed
more than 200 people since 2003. China reported its 1st
human-to-human infection case in 2005. Authorities recently
announced they were setting up a nationwide network to test for the virus.

[The death of the woman in Xinjiang province brings the human avian
A/ H5N1 influenza death toll to 4, among 5 cases recorded in China
since the beginning of the year, the 1st cases since late February
2007. The cases are unrelated and spread across 5 provinces. There
has been no onward transmission of infection to the contacts of these
patients. Exposure to potentially diseased poultry has been confirmed
in the majority of the victims. The only problematic feature is that
the mother of the only survivor, a 2-year-old child, died as a
consequence of an undiagnosed illness. - Mod.CP]

Shandong bird flu victim had no contact with live poultry
---------------------------------------------------------
A bird flu victim in China's eastern Shandong Province was not
exposed to live poultry and was only known to have eaten chicken,
said the Shandong Provincial Health Bureau on Thursday [22 Jan 2009].
The 27-year-old woman, whose name was not revealed, died of the bird
flu virus last Saturday [17 Jan 2009] in Jinan, Shandong.

Of the 4 deadly bird flu cases in China since December [2008], 3 were
exposed either to live fowl or market poultry. According to World
Health Organization statistics, one-4th to one-3rd of bird flu cases
have no identified source of infection. Infectious disease experts at
the Infectious Isolation Hospipital in Ji'nan warn the public to
avoid contact with farm birds, wild fowl and bird excrement. There is
no risk for consumers who eat properly cooked poultry.

East China province ends emergency response to bird flu
-------------------------------------------------------
East China's Shandong Province on Saturday [24 Jan 2009] ended the
emergency response to bird flu, a week after a woman died of the
virus. All the 157 people who had close contact with the woman have
been discharged from medical observation as of 7:30 a.m. Saturday. No
one was found to be infected, said a senior official of the
provincial health department.

The 27-year-old woman, who lived in Jinan, the provincial capital,
fell ill on 5 Jan 2009 and went to hospital when her condition
worsened. Her death was the 2nd bird flu-related death in China this
year. The province launched the emergency response after the woman
died on 17 Jan 2009. There has been no report of human or animal
infections of bird flu since then.

Shandong is taking measures to prevent and control the virus. It has
banned the raising of poultry in urban areas and protected water
areas. Medical workers in the province have put more than 400 000
people under surveillance during the emergency response.

There have been 31 856 cases of respiratory disease in Jinan since
this patient's death and 586 people are suffering from [seasonal]
influenza in the Huaiyin District where she lived.

China has reported 4 [now 5] human infections of bird flu so far this
year, including 3 [now 4] deaths. A 2-year-old girl who was
critically ill with the disease was out of danger by Fri 23 Jan 2009
after her vital signs had remained stable for 6 consecutive days.
