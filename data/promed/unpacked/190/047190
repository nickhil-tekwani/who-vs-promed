NEW DISEASE OUTBREAKS - OIE SCREWWORM, HORSE - USA
---------------------------------------------------
On 2 March 2000, USDA-APHIS reported an outbreak of the New World Screwworm
_Cochliomyia hominivorax_ in a horse located in West Palm Beach, Florida.
The horse, a four-year-old chestnut thoroughbred gelding, was imported with
16 others from South America on 27 February 2000.
On 29 February, 16 of the 17 horses were released from quarantine. The one
remaining horse was released from quarantine the next day. On 2 March, a
private practitioner performed a physical examination of a horse, reporting
a minor discharge from the prepuce, no swelling and a bad odor. The private
practitioner collected 50-100 larvae from the area of the distal penis of
the horse. [I assume the detained horse was also the subject of
investigation but the report does not definitively state such. Mod-PC
The practitioner called USDA-APHIS (Animal Plant Health Inspection Service)
who dispatched a Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician (FADD). Samples were
submitted to National Veterinary Services Laboratory, NVSL on 3 March. The
horse and premises were then treated appropriately. On 4 March 2000, NVSL
confirmed that the larvae samples from the subject horse were screwworm
larvae in the third instar stage.
One of the remaining 16 horses has been reexamined. Although found free of
disease, the horse and stall were treated as a preventive measure. The
other 15 horses in shipment will be reexamined and treated preventively, if
appropriate.
USDA-APHIS is increasing screwworm surveillance and offering technical
assistance to states.

[Although not brief, I have included some details of the outbreak and
history of screwworm below. First of all, the horses were shipped to
several states. Two of the horses were shipped to Georgia, five to
California, one to Pennsylvania, one to Texas, and eight to Florida.
Although most common in livestock, humans have been known to be infected -
see the posting on human infection in Alabama in 1998. Secondly,
diagnosticians at NVSL indicated that the larva were at least 24 hours away
from obtaining maturity, so none were likely to have dropped on the ground.
It would take another 3-5 days before larva on the ground could pupate and
then be ready to reproduce. Since the wound itself was treated the next
day, it is unlikely a new generation of flies has resulted. Screwworm is a
nasty infestation. The flies lay their larva in an open wound and the larva
develop by eating the flesh of the wound. Any wound will do but navels of
newborn mammals are a common site.
It is very difficult to see early stages of screwworm larvae feeding in a
wound; only slight movement may be observed. As the larvae feed, the wound
is gradually enlarged, becoming wider and deeper. Usually at this stage,
additional screwworm flies have deposited eggs, resulting in a multiple
infestation. A bloody discharge often exudes from the infested wounds, and
a distinct odor may be detected. In some cases, the openings in the skin
may be small with extensive pockets of screwworm larvae beneath.
Animals with screwworm infestations may die in 7 to 14 days if wounds are
not treated to kill the larvae, especially in cases of multiple
infestations. As many as 3,000 larvae may be found in a single wound. Death
results from toxicity and/or secondary infection. Treatment is topical and
results in death of larva in the wound.
There has been a previous incursion into the United States. A military dog,
imported from Panama, was diagnosed by an extremely alert private
practioner. USDA-APHIS was able to trace all contacts and stamp out the
outbreak.
Screwworm was estimated to cost US livestock producers approximately $400
million per annum in the 1930s. Thus, the Screwworm program represent
several generations of a success story in regional eradication of disease.
The first generation built a plant in Mission, Texas in 1957 and produced
gamma irradiated sterile male flies. These sterile males were released by
aircraft, successfully mating with females but no viable offspring
resulted. Reduced fertility led to the eradication of the pest from the
southeastern United States over a two year period, 1957-59. In 1982 the
entire United States and a buffer zone in Mexico was declared free of disease.
A new plant was built in Chipas, Mexico and the same eradication strategy
was followed resulting in Mexico becoming free of the disease in 1991.
Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras have also been declared free.
Currently, a new plant is planned for Panama in 2003 with the aim of
eradicating the disease north of the Darien Gap, that narrow isthmus
between Panama and Colombia.
