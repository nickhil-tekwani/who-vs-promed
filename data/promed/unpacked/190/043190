A farmer is facing an anxious wait while tests are carried out to confirm
whether his pigs have contracted classical swine fever (CSF).
A 10-kilometer restriction zone has been placed around this farm in
Copdock, near Ipswich, while the tests are conducted to confirm that it is
the 17th outbreak of classical swine fever in East Anglia since August.
The "Form A" restriction was put on the farm last week by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [MAFF. It came just days after pig farmers
in Suffolk and Norfolk were celebrating the lifting of restrictions imposed
at the height of the swine fever outbreak.
A total of 150 farms on the Suffolk coast had been given freedom of
movement for some 36 000 pigs, signaling a possible end to the crisis in
time for Christmas. However, the results of tests taken at this farm will
not be known for at least another week and, in the meantime, restrictions
(including the disinfecting of all people or vehicles leaving the farm and
on pig movements) have been put in force.
The suspect farm is a small tenancy holding with only 75 pigs onsite and
between 60 and 80 head of cattle.
A MAFF spokeswoman confirmed a Form A restriction had been put on a farm
near Ipswich on 29 Nov 2000 after a possible case of classical swine fever
had been reported. "We actively encourage pig farms to report cases where
they think they have clinical disease so we can continue to eradicate CSF,"
she added.
The spokeswoman stressed there was no need to panic, and Jean Turnbull of
the National Pig Association said the restriction was only precautionary at
this stage. "There is no cause for concern at the moment ­ it is just
another Form A and until the results come back, it has not been confirmed
either way yet," she added.
This new restriction brings to 243 the total number of reports of suspected
swine fever. Only 16 have proved to be the actual disease. A pig wasting
disease, which is a non-notifiable condition and originally from Canada,
has similar initial symptoms as CSF and has been a common trigger for a
report to the ministry.
CSF was first discovered on a farm in Sudbourne, near Woodbridge, on 8 Aug
2000 and since then 140 000 pigs have had to be slaughtered in Essex,
Suffolk and Norfolk, causing the loss of thousands of pounds for the
industry. The disease can only be transmitted to other pigs and wild boar.
