[1] Azerbaijan: LSD spread

In Azerbaijan about 40 animals have died of a viral disease called nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease, LSD], Veterinary Service Spokesman Yolchu Hanveli said.

This viral disease is manifested by fever and inflammation of the skin with characteristic nodules. It includes the clinical presentations of multiple nodules, draining tracts, or severe crusted or exudative lesions. The disease is found only among bovine animals transmitted by blood-sucking insects.

"As a result of temperature reduction, there is a significant decrease in the number of infected animals in Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, more than 2800 cases of infection were reported in Azerbaijan. A total of 2600 animals have been treated with more than 200 ones being tested at the moment. The latest data show that 40 animals have died of the disease," the spokesman said.

Khanveli said that many cattle markets in the regions (about 10) which are vulnerable to infection resumed their action on the eve of Eid al-Adha (Gurban Bayram [Muslim Festival of Sacrifice]).

"Appropriate conditions for small cattle sale have been created in this market. Meanwhile, in some places, sale of cattle was also allowed, but under the strict supervision of the Veterinary Service," he said.

Recently, nodular dermatitis disease was observed in Bilasuvar, Ujar, Jalilabad, and Aghdash regions of Azerbaijan. Some cattle markets were closed in these regions as a result of the viral disease.

Earlier, the virus was revealed in Turkey and Iran. And the fact that Azerbaijan has common borders with Iran has spread concerns among the Azerbaijanis about the spread of the disease.

[2] Bulk milk testing for LSD
Date: Tue 30 Sep 2014
From: Shamsudeen Fagbo <oloungbo@yahoo.com> [edited]


As lumpy skin disease [LSD] is endemic in the Middle East and now threatens Europe, testing bulk milk for LSD virus using PCR may not be out of place. Though there is precedence for this in Egypt (see reference below), it does not seem to have been integrated into OIE's recommendations for diagnosis or surveillance of the disease.

[Dr Fagbo's observation on the possible application of bulk milk testing for LSD surveillance deserves discussion/consideration as suggested; see also ProMED-mail post 20140929.2815380.

Azerbaijan submitted an immediate notification to the OIE on its 1st LSD occurrence on 17 Jul 2014 (subscribers are referred to the commentary in ProMED-mail post 20140719.2621294), reporting 2 outbreaks adjacent to its border with Iran. Reportedly, the affected farms included a total of 3142 susceptible animals of which 14 clinical cases and no mortalities. The start of the outbreak was indicated to be 7 Jul 2014, and its source "illegal movement of animals". The applied control measures were "control of arthropods, quarantine, movement control inside the country, disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), and no vaccination."

On 9 Sep 2014, Azerbaijan submitted its follow-up report/final report, declaring the epizootic "resolved". It included the following epidemiological comments: "There are no new affected animals, all previously affected animals have recovered, all necessary veterinary measures are applied, last disinfection was conducted on 28 Aug 2014." The alleged disappearance of a disease like LSD from a territory without the application of vaccination or stamping out is unprecedented and indeed may deserve to be termed rather 'miraculous'. Unfortunately, as might have been expected, the virus has in fact continued its vector-borne circulation. Moreover, we are unofficially but reliably informed about heavy losses, caused by the introduction of the virus into dairy farms. Dairy cattle are particularly susceptible to LSD; the losses are mainly caused by protracted, debilitating disease, rather than by mortality. LSD is not zoonotic.

According to OIE's code requirements, the current outbreaks in Azerbaijan should be officially reported and vaccination applied the earliest. Neighboring countries, such as Armenia, should take precautionary measures.

Azerbaijan is the 1st European territory penetrated by LSD. In the absence of vaccination, the disease may resume its spread within the country next season within Azerbaijan and further on. The disease has been massively spreading in the Near East since 2012, including the Asian parts of Turkey.
