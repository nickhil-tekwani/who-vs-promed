2nd student dies of typhoid
---------------------------
Another student died yesterday [Thu 17 Mar 2005], following an
outbreak of typhoid that has hit 4 secondary schools in Bungoma
District.
A Form Four student at Kimilili Boys High School succumbed at his
Busakala home in Chwele after being treated at a private clinic. The
death brings to 2 the number of students who have died of the
disease. A student from Moi Girls Kamusinga died during the previous
week [2nd week March 2005].
Kimilili Boys High School principal, Mr. Wafula Khisa, gave
assurances that, out of the 16 students admitted to Webuye hospital,
10 had been discharged and were continuing with their studies. He
said a team of doctors has been dispatched to the school and that
there were no new cases.
A team led by the Bungoma Medical Officer, Dr. Isaac Wasike, said
they were satisfied with sanitation standards at the 4 schools. The
medics attributed the outbreak to water intake on the slopes of Mt.
Elgon, which they feared might be unfit for human consumption.
22 other students from Moi Girls Kamusinga, 6 from Kimilili Boys, and
7 from St. Mary's Sosio are still admitted to the hospital.
Meanwhile, more than 10 people have been admitted to Kimilili
sub-district hospital suffering from typhoid. The fresh cases are
mostly from the area bordering the 4 affected schools.
