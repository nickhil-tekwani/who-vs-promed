Yellow fever in Brazil
----------------------------
On 13 Jan 2000, the National Epidemiology Center (CENEPI), Brazil, reported
3 laboratory-confirmed cases of yellow fever to WHO. All 3 persons were
infected while on holiday in December [1999 in the National Park of Chapada
dos Veadeiros, Alta Paraiso, Goias State, located approximately 250 km north
of Brasilia. The park is in a forested area where yellow fever is known to
be endemic, thus these cases resulted from sylvatic transmission [meaning
from forest mosquitoes rather than the urban vector _Aedes aegypti_. -
Mod.JW
Two of the cases were in residents of Brasilia (one fatal) and 1 case was in
Rio de Janeiro. Because the cases were recognized in non-endemic urban areas
where _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are present, immunization programmes and
vector control measures are being carried out in both cities to avoid any
potential urban transmission. Adequate supplies of yellow fever vaccine are
available in Brazil.
