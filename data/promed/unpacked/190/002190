A virus kills half the Pyrenean chamois
-------------------------------------------
Analyses conducted in the laboratories of the Faculty of Veterinary
medicine of the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona have confirmed the
existence of a epizootic affecting the population of chamois (rebecos in
Spanish) of the most western regions of the Catalan Pyrenees, bordering
France and Andorra.
There are fears that the pestivirus (the suspected cause of the epidemic),
the same (virus) that (causes) classical swine fever [see comment], may
spread to adjacent areas and particularly to the east. The French and
Catalan authorities have suspended the chamois hunting season due to start
on the past 15 Aug 2005. The Catalan Executive, in addition, has requested
Andorra to adopt the same measure.
The 1st dead chamois were detected in 2001, but the major outbreak took
place on 12 Dec 2004, when a forest ranger took an agonized animal from
Aranser (Pallars reserve, Lerida province) to the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine in Barcelona.
The animal was 1st diagnosed with bronchopneumonia, a lethal disease common
in chamois. Months later, and after more chamois deaths were recorded,
further tests revealed the presence of a pestivirus.
This pestivirus is transmitted by air and has quickly spread into 3 Catalan
reserves: Pallars, Valle de Aran and Cadi Moixero, although recently, the
incidence has been lower. In the 1st 2 reserves, the animal population has
been reduced by 86 percent. In a census conducted during the past July
2005, only 81 animals were found from a previous population of 563 chamois.
Only 6 out of 81 animals found alive were born this year [2005].

[The Pyrenean Chamois, _Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica_, (order
_Artiodactyla_, family _Bovidae_, subfamily _Caprinae_), known locally as
sarrio and isard, is a free-living ruminant grazing with domesticated
cattle and sheep in the Pyrenean mountains, with a population of about 25
000 animals. The decreased population and concerns about disease have been
published earlier (20020709.4707).
Pestiviruses (family _Flaviviridae_) affect ruminants and suids. There are
4 accepted pestivirus species: Border disease virus (BDV), Bovine viral
diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, and Classical swine fever virus (CSFV).
According to 2 research groups (see further), a pestivirus, closely related
to Border disease virus (and not to the CSFV, as reported in the above news
item), has been isolated from affected chamois.
Border disease (BD) is a transmissible congenital disease caused by a
pestivirus that affects sheep and occasionally goats. The disease has been
recognized in most sheep-rearing areas of the world. Clinically, BD is
characterized in sheep by abortion, stillbirth and the birth of weak lambs
with nervous disorders. The BD virus induces, under some conditions, a
severe hemorrhagic syndrome; this hemorrhagic disease was reported in 1983
in the Aveyron department (southern France).
The isolation of a BDV-like pestivirus, by itself, is not sufficient to
incriminate this virus for the death among Pyrenean chamois; to establish
its role as the causative agent, the requirements of Koch's Postulates
should be fulfilled: the disease has to be experimentally reproduced.
