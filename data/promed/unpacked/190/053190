Measles cases fill wards
------------------------
Dozens of children remain in critical condition and the number of
cases in the measles outbreak continues to grow. Health officials
opened a 2nd isolation unit at Tygerberg Hospital on Friday [26 Feb
2010] as the ward at New Somerset Hospital approached capacity. It is
understood that by the weekend, 28 children had been admitted to the
New Somerset Hospital and 18 to Tygerberg. The 2 wards can
accommodate 30 patients.

On Thursday [25 Feb 2010] the Western Cape Department of Health
reported 422 confirmed cases of measles in the province. This was,
however, at odds with the records of the National Institute for
Communicable Diseases, which said on 12 Feb 2010 that there had been
517 confirmed cases in the Western Cape. The Department has brought
forward a planned immunisation campaign targeting known hot spots.

[Previously it was reported that: "Health MEC [member of the
executive council] Theuns Botha said his administration was handling
the measles issue as an "outbreak," not an "epidemic." He said a
measles and polio [vaccination] drive, which would include radio
health talks, advertorials, posters, and pamphlets, would be
fast-tracked, but could not give a timeline for this (see ProMED-mail
post: Measles - Africa (06): South Africa 20100212.0503).

Council on high alert on measles outbreak
-----------------------------------------
A total of 8 children have died as a result of measles in Bulawayo
since the disease was 1st detected in the country early this year
[2010], it has been learnt. As a result, Bulawayo City Council's
Health Department is now on high alert in a bid to curb the further
spread of the disease.

The measles outbreak which has been reported in 28 of the country's
62 districts has reportedly claimed about 90 deaths countrywide. Of
the 1200 reported cases about 221 have been confirmed. Responding to
questions from the Sunday News the Senior Public Relations Officer,
Mrs Nesisa Mpofu, said the city was on high alert and was embarking
on a citywide immunisation and awareness drive. "To date we have got
8 confirmed cases with the 1st one being reported on 5 Jan 2010 and
the last on 22 Jan 2010, we can thus confirm that there is an
outbreak in the city and we have to be on high alert," she said. Mrs
Mpofu revealed that they had since embarked on a massive immunisation
programme that was going to see them immunising babies from their
homes. "We are going on a mop up exercise where we are now immunising
babies from their homes and to date we have covered about 5 suburbs," she said.

The suburbs that had been attended to include Nkulumane, Nketa,
Mzilikazi, Magwegwe and Luveve, with the total number of babies
immunised pegged at over 3300. Mrs Mpofu revealed that health
education to the communities was ongoing at all council-run clinics
and they had another team moving around the suburbs educating mothers
on the disease. "We have also engaged the church leadership to help
reach out to a greater scope of people. We are also grateful to some
non-governmental organisations that have come in to offer their
services for free and also providing us with the necessary
medicines," said Mrs Mpofu.

The World Health Organisation describes measles as a highly
contagious viral disease affecting mostly children, which can be
effectively prevented by immunisation. In Zimbabwe, children receive
a 1st vaccination against measles at the age of 9 months and 2nd
inoculation at 18 months.

Symptoms usually appear about 8 to 12 days after infection and
include high fever, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the
inside of the mouth. A rash also develops, starting on the face and
upper neck and gradually spreading over the body. Measles causes the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of children in developing countries annually.

Last Friday [26 Feb 2010] it was reported that more than 40 children
had died in the Midlands province. Most of the victims were children
of the Apostolic Sects who are against immunisation.

[This outbreak is now affecting almost the whole of Zimbabwe and is
unlikely to be confined only to certain religious groups resisting
vaccination. A more general breakdown in vaccine coverage is probably
responsible. The number of deaths (90 countrywide) is alarming.
