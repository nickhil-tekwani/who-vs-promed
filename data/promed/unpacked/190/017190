Initial tests have found that a man in northern Vietnam is contaminated by
the bird flu virus, the 1st human case in more than 3 weeks. Doctors from
the Institute of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi say the tests indicate the 55
year old man from Vinh Phuc province tested positive for the deadly H5N1 virus.
The case comes one day after government officials said the country had
reported no poultry or human bird flu cases for at least 21 days. In
another development, a young Cambodian woman has been admitted to hospital
in Vietnam after showing symptoms of bird flu.
The woman is from Cambodia's Kampot province, the same area where 4 people
have died in 2005 from bird flu. The virus has killed 52 people in Asia
since 2003, 36 of them in Vietnam, 12 people in Thailand, and 4 in Cambodia.

Cambodian woman suspected of having bird flu hospitalized in Vietnam?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A young Cambodian woman suffering from bird flu symptoms has been
hospitalized in a serious but stable condition in southern Vietnam, a
doctor said on Friday.
The 20 year old woman from Kampot province has been on a respirator since
she was admitted Wednesday to the General Hospital in Kien Giang province,
which borders Cambodia, Dr Do Thanh Binh said.
Her high fever and coughing have almost disappeared, but 2 x-rays of her
lungs showed serious damage, he said. Binh said the woman first developed
symptoms 2 weeks ago and was treated at a private clinic in Cambodia before
being transferred to Vietnam.
Dead chickens were reported in her neighborhood a month ago, he said. Binh
said the woman's samples have been sent to the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi
Minh City for testing. It was unclear when the results would be returned.
2 Cambodians died of bird flu in the same hospital earlier in 2005. Bird
flu, which began ravaging poultry farms across Asia in late 2003, jumped to
humans and has killed 36 people in Vietnam, 12 in Thailand, and 4 in Cambodia.
