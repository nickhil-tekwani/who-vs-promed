JBS Tolleson, Inc recalls raw beef products due to possible _Salmonella_ Newport contamination
-----------------------------------------------------------
JBS Tolleson, Inc, an establishment in Tolleson, Arizona (United States), is recalling approximately 6 500 966 pounds of various raw, non-intact beef products that may be contaminated with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today [Thu 4 Oct 2018].

The raw, non-intact beef items, including ground beef, were packaged on various dates from [26 Jul 2018] to [7 Sep 2018]. The following products are subject to recall: [for the Products List and Product Labels, see original URL - Mod.LL]. The products subject to recall bear establishment number "EST. 267" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations and institutions nationwide.

On [5 Sep 2018], FSIS was notified of an investigation of _Salmonella_ Newport illnesses with reported consumption of several different FSIS-regulated products by case-patients. The 1st store receipt potentially linking the purchase of FSIS-regulated product to a case-patient was received on [19 Sep 2018]; FSIS was then able to begin traceback of ground beef products. To date [Thu 4 Oct 2018], 8 case-patients have provided receipts or shopper card numbers, which have enabled product traceback investigations. FSIS, CDC, and state public health and agriculture partners have now determined that raw ground beef was the probable source of the reported illnesses. Traceback has identified JBS as the common supplier of the ground beef products. The epidemiological investigation has identified 57 case-patients from 16 states with illness onset dates ranging from [5 Aug 2018] to [6 Sep 2018]. FSIS will continue to work with public health partners and will provide updated information should it become available.

Consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the commonest bacterial foodborne illnesses. The commonest symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours of eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at <www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls>.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 deg F [about 70 deg C]. Other cuts of beef should be cooked to a temperature of 145 deg F [about 63 deg C] and allowed to rest for at least 3 minutes. The only way to confirm that ground beef or other cuts of beef are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.

Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact the JBS USA Consumer Hotline at (800) 727-2333. Members of the media with questions regarding the recall can contact Misty Barnes, Public Relations Specialist at JBS USA, at (970) 506-7805.
