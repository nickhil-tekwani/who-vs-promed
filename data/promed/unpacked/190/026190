[3] Lessons learned re: emerging viral zoonotic diseases

ref: Wang LF, Anderson DE, Mackenzie JS, Merson MH. From Hendra to Wuhan: what has been learned in responding to emerging zoonotic viruses. Lancet, Comment. 2020 [published online]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the world watches the rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-CoV-2]) outbreak, it is important to reflect on the lessons that can be learned from this and previous emerging zoonotic viruses (EZV) in a comparative and analytic way. Although the source of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed, early findings suggest a high possibility of a bat origin[1]. There have been 6 major EZV outbreaks in the past 25 years caused by proven or suspected bat-borne viruses (table)[2-7]. With these in mind, 4 major points are worth considering in the context of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

First, are Koch's postulates still relevant in the era of next-generation sequencing (NGS)? In the heat of the debate about the early response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak, insufficient attention was paid to how the initial aetiological evidence came from NGS analysis requested by clinicians. To our knowledge, all previous EZV outbreak investigations started with a live virus isolation, including the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) discovery[5]. The preliminary sequence data indicating the presence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus in patients' lung lavage samples were obtained on Dec 26, 2019, by NGS[8]. The Chinese authorities ruled out SARS and MERS, as well as a few other non-coronaviruses, on [5 Jan 2020], and confirmed a novel coronavirus as a potential cause on [9 Jan 2020][4]. However, the genome sequence -- crucial for rapid development of diagnostics needed in an outbreak response--was not released until [12 Jan 2020][7], 17 days after the preliminary sequence data were obtained. These events raise challenging questions. Should a national response team report a highly suspected pathogen sequence before confirming an aetiological live agent? Are current national and international policies and regulations adequate to deal with a sequence-based outbreak reporting system? While they have evolved over time, the postulates formulated by Robert Koch and Friedrich Loeffler in 1884 included the isolation of a live agent as a key criterion[9]. We believe that it is time to establish an NGS-based reporting system that can alert to the presence of a new aetiological agent(s) rather than requiring the isolation of aetiological agents.

Second, clinicians and scientists have a crucial role in responding to such EZV outbreaks. In past EZV outbreak investigations, clinicians have largely had supportive roles. This situation is likely to change now that more clinician scientists are better trained and have academic appointments, especially in China. In fact, it was the clinicians who led to the early detection of and warning about the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China. In investigating severe pneumonia cases of unknown cause, clinicians in 2 hospitals in Wuhan independently sent lung lavage samples from patients for NGS analysis by commercial NGS companies. Alarm bells rang, not only through the different levels of the official Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) reporting system but also through social media traced back to 8 doctors who were wrongly accused of spreading "fake news". These doctors were later cleared of any wrongdoing and praised by the government authorities for their brave action in early alerting[10].

Achieving the right balance between information sharing and scientific publication is important during an EZV outbreak response. This is not a new challenge but greatly amplified in the 2019-nCoV outbreak when anger in China was directed towards a few leading scientists who were alleged to have held back sharing data about the virus to publish their findings. These unsubstantiated allegations consumed media attention and created media panic that was counterproductive to the outbreak response. Clear national and international guidelines are needed on how to achieve the right balance in the leadership provided by public health and research experts facing an outbreak of an EZV

Third, a One Health approach[11] in EZV outbreak responses and control is vital. In August 2003, after WHO declared the end of the SARS outbreak, it organised a special mission with international and Chinese scientists to investigate the origin and early transmission events of SARS-CoV. Among the 8 international experts invited, 7 were veterinarians or those working in animal health. By contrast, the 6-member Chinese team only had one participating veterinarian or animal scientist. While recognising the tremendous effort by the China CDC team in the early response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the small number of team members trained in animal health was probably one of the reasons for the delay in identifying an intermediate animal(s), which is likely to have caused the spread of the virus in a region of the market where wildlife animals were traded and subsequently found to be heavily contaminated. Unfortunately, what animal(s) was involved in transmission remains unknown. There is an urgent need to know the risks associated with the presumed animal to human transmission of 2019-nCoV, and the measures that can be taken to prevent such transmission in the future. For example, should the sale of wild animals be restricted in Chinese wet markets? We recommend that a comprehensive One Health team be involved in all future EZV investigations. Indeed, this approach has international implications, with risks of exotic zoonotic diseases associated with the huge quantities of illegal bush meat from central and west Africa being imported into Europe and North America[12].

Finally, naming of a new virus is important not only for virologists in the long term but also for effective communication to the general public. In all the major EZV events over the past 25 years, naming of the new virus has not been straightforward and most went through a renaming process (table). This is also true for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. There has been intensive discussion now among virologists worldwide about an alternative name for 2019-nCoV. To continue the tradition of using a syndrome, as in SARS and MERS, and to avoid the sensitivity of using a city name, we propose to name this new virus Han acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (HARS-CoV). Han is the abbreviation of Wuhan in Chinese. Such a name is, we believe, preferable to the names being used in media headlines, such as "Wuhan virus" or "China virus", and it retains the historical fact that the outbreak started in Wuhan. [Note that the chosen nomenclature change for this virus is SARS-CoV-2, and for the disease COVID-19. This was announced yesterday, 11 Feb 2020, after this comment was published. - Mod.MPP]

Now is not a time for blame. Rather, there are lessons the global health community can and should learn and act on so that we can better respond to the next EZV event, which is almost certain to happen again. These lessons are definitely not unique to China.

[An independent, sufficiently authorised and capable Veterinary Service is (traditionally) expected to exercise force (including recruitment of police/army) and immediately close an animal market where a hitherto unidentified zoonotic disease is highly suspected, destroying the suspected animals while sampling them. One of the problems (in China and elsewhere) is the lack of legal power to apply measures against a new (= not listed) health situation. This event must lead to a significant revision of quite a number of concepts (the authors indicated also the Koch's postulate). - Mod.AS

The authors have put together a concise discussion on the lessons to be learned and gaps in policy, in terms of dealing with an emerging zoonotic viral disease. The need for a One Health approach to investigating a new disease should be applied from the start of the investigation so appropriate specimens are collected at the start, as well as appropriate "clean ups" should be implemented.

Since approximately 2000, China has had a number of outbreaks and individual case reports with facilitated transmission of emerging zoonotic viruses in "wet markets". These have included the SARS outbreak and several different avian influenza outbreaks (H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, H9N2, and H10N8). Recommendations to the public have been to avoid live markets (wet markets), and periodically the wet markets have been closed for a finite period of time, only to reopen. The authors address this need.

The authors raise the need to re-think Koch's postulates in the face of use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), a question that deserves significant thought and discussion. Has the time come to not require isolation of a live viral agent before concluding the etiology of an outbreak, now that viral agents can be identified through next generation sequencing much more rapidly? - Mod.MPP]

[4] China: change in case confirmation criteria
Date: Wed 12 Feb 2020
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/world/asia/china-coronavirus-cases.html


China's health authorities have decided to no longer count as confirmed cases those patients who test positive but don't show symptoms. Overnight, Heilongjiang, a Chinese province near Russia, had cut its count of confirmed coronavirus cases by more than a dozen.

The revision [was] in a series of dense documents from the national government. Health officials said that they would reclassify patients who had tested positive for the new coronavirus but did not have symptoms, and take them out of the total count of confirmed cases.

The change in counting cases is only one factor that has made it difficult for experts to determine the true scale of the epidemic. The tally so far is that the coronavirus has killed at least 1100 people and sickened more than 44 000, but experts say definitive numbers are elusive.

In the days since the changes emerged, several virus experts around the world have said that the reclassification was a minor change, even a typical move during new outbreaks. Other experts questioned the revision.

Heilongjiang's officials were not the only ones to shift their tallies of confirmed cases. Hangzhou, a city in eastern China, reduced its count by 12 on [Sun 9 Feb 2020] because the patients did not live there. Hubei, the province at the heart of the outbreak, recently reduced its confirmed case number by 87 with little explanation.

In all, China's National Health Commission has retroactively subtracted at least 118 cases. But the change in how cases are classified could mean even steeper changes in the totals going forward.

Scientists have debated just how much of a danger asymptomatic transmission poses. Chinese health officials were among the 1st to raise the prospect of asymptomatic transmission, even as health experts in other countries were skeptical of early reports that the virus could be passed on by such patients.

China's reported count of new infections on [Tue 11 Feb 2020] was its lowest in a single day since [30 Jan 2020]. But experts cautioned that it is premature to draw any conclusions from the figure.

The changes to the classification of asymptomatic coronavirus cases emerged on [29 Jan 2020], in a set of guidance from China's National Health Commission. The agency said that it would no longer count patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus but did not display symptoms as "confirmed cases." Instead, those patients would be counted separately, as "positive diagnosis" patients, and would become confirmed only if they began showing symptoms.

The changes prompted debate among some public health experts.

"Adapting definitions during an outbreak is not unusual, with increasing insights and also with prioritizing where efforts need to go," said Dr Marion Koopmans, the head of the viroscience department at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. By shifting emphasis away from asymptomatic cases, officials can concentrate resources on more serious cases, she said.

Dr Benjamin Cowling, who leads the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, said the number of cases affected by the change in terminology would most likely be low. He added that attempts to count individual infections become less reliable anyway as outbreaks increase in size.

Still, even experts who said that the effect of discounting certain cases would be small said that it would be useful to epidemiologists - and the public - to have a complete count of all cases, including asymptomatic ones.

Dr Malik Peiris, the chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong, said in an email that mild or asymptomatic infections could form an "invisible iceberg" that made a given virus's fatality rate much lower than it initially appeared.

Determining the true denominator of the number of people infected -- whether symptomatic or not -- would, he said, "be most informative to, hopefully, calm current panic in China and the world."

[Social media carried this story over the past few days, most with a sensationalistic presentation. If those individuals found to be positive for the SARS-CoV-2 and are asymptomatic are classified as "positive diagnosis" individuals and tallies of these individuals are kept, this information will not be lost. It will also be helpful to see what proportion of these "positive diagnosis" individuals go on to have symptoms, and how many days following the positive diagnosis, to get a better understanding of the duration of the incubation period. The debate on how to classify asymptomatic positive MERS-CoV infections continues 8 years into the identification of the MERS-CoV. There are still many questions that need answering on the epidemiology of this SARS-CoV-2; not all can be adequately addressed through counting every single case, knowing that there are probably many asymptomatic infections that are not confirmed, not coming to the attention of the formal health sector.- Mod.MPP]

[5] Selected media reports of transmission outside of mainland China
A. Japanese cruise ship
Date: Thu 13 Feb 2020 11:19 AM JST
Source: New Strait Times, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2020/02/565123/44-more-novel-coronavirus-cases-japan-ship


Another 44 people on board a cruise ship moored off Japan's coast have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the country's health minister said [Thu 13 Feb 2020]. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the 44 new cases were from another 221 new tests. They raise the number of infections detected on the Diamond Princess to 218, in addition to a quarantine officer who also tested positive for the virus.

Kato said authorities now want to move elderly people off the ship if they test negative for the virus, offering to put them in government-designated lodging. "We wish to start the operation from tomorrow or later," Kato told reporters.

Of the newly diagnosed infections, 43 are passengers, and 1 a member of the crew.

The Diamond Princess has been moored off Japan since [3 Feb 2020], after it emerged that a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month [January 2020] had tested positive for the virus now named COVID-19. [The virus is named SARS-CoV-2, the disease is named COVID-19. - Mod.MPP]

The ship was placed into quarantine shortly afterwards and authorities have asked passengers and crew to remain on board until [19 Feb 2020]. Those who have tested positive for the new virus have been taken off the ship to medical facilities, but questions have been raised about whether the quarantine on the ship is working, with dozens of new cases diagnosed almost daily.

Passengers are confined to cabins and required to wear masks and keep their distance from each other when they are allowed out for brief periods on open decks.

B. USA ex China (Wuhan)

A 2nd person evacuated from Wuhan, China, to a US Marine base near San Diego [California] has been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, raising the tally of confirmed cases in the United States to 14, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on [Wed 12 Feb 2020].

The patient was among 232 individuals who had been placed under quarantine at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar after being airlifted from the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan earlier this month [February 2020], CDC spokeswoman Ana Toro said.

A previous case of coronavirus was documented a few days earlier among the same group of evacuees, the CDC said.

CDC officials said it appeared that the 2 San Diego patients were separately exposed to the virus in China before arriving in the United States. The 2 arrived on different planes and were housed in separate facilities.

"At this time there is no indication of person-to-person spread of this virus at the quarantine facility, but CDC will carry out a thorough contact investigation as part of its current response strategy to detect and contain any cases of infection with this virus," Dr Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said in a statement.

To date, a total of 8 coronavirus cases have been documented in California, accounting for more than half of the infections confirmed across the United States, none of them fatal. 2 of those cases are believed to have been transmitted person-to-person within the United States -- both between married couples after one of the spouses returned home from a recent visit to China.

Britain must now prepare itself for more cases of the coronavirus, health officials have warned, as they confirmed a 1st patient diagnosed in London on a day when the spread of the disease continued to cause disruption across the world.

The new patient, who brings the total number in the UK to 9, is a Chinese woman in her late 20s or early 30s who lives in the British capital with relatives. She flew into Heathrow from China at the weekend [8-9 Feb 2020] and called NHS 111 when she developed symptoms after landing.

She was tested at a London hospital on Sunday afternoon [9 Feb 2020], returned to her London home and kept herself in isolation there. It is not known if the family members she lives with have been tested. Officials have been ordered to trace relatives, friends, and anyone she may have been in contact with since returning to London in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. Fellow passengers on her flight will be contacted and offered testing too.

As schools in Brighton, where 2 GP surgeries have already closed because of the outbreak, instructed pupils to self-isolate, there were warnings that the public should be prepared for the coronavirus -- now named Covid-19 [the virus is named SARS-CoV-2, the disease is named COVID-19] -- to spread further.

Dr Paul Cosford of Public Health England said that more cases were now highly likely and that a growing number of people travelling into British airports could be infected.

Meanwhile more public events around the world were being cancelled in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus, which can lead to pneumonia and has so far killed more than 1100 people in China alone. Other experts said it was too soon to tell whether the new case implied that the virus would spread in the capital, a key transport hub with a population of 9 million.

"It is really not surprising that a case has been reported from London," said Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton & Sussex Medical School. "We will not really be able to estimate the potential risk of onward spread until further information on this patient is known, including details of how long they were in the UK until they were diagnosed and what their movements were."

Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said evidence for the role played by public transport like the London Underground in the spread of a virus was "fairly limited", adding that long-distance trains and international travel were likely to be more important factors. He noted that of the 1750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% had been negative.

Dr Robin Thompson, junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology at Oxford University, said there were some risks associated with a diagnosis in London, but noted that if the patient had quickly self-isolated, then the danger could be mitigated. "In general, if an initial case is in a densely populated area, then the risk of sustained person-to-person transmission following is higher," he said. "This is exacerbated by the fact that London is a transport hub, and the underground could provide a network to spread the virus quickly. "However, the key factor here is the number of contacts that this infected individual has had prior to being isolated. If this is low, then the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is also low."

It was confirmed on [Wed 12 Feb 2020] that 12 patients and medical staff who came into contact with doctors diagnosed with the coronavirus in Sussex had been traced. The 2 GPs worked between Worthing hospital's A&E department, a nursing home, and 2 doctor's surgeries in Brighton, Public Health England said. One of the infected GPs had worked as a locum doctor at the hospital. It also said that all those who came into [contact] with the 2 doctors were now receiving medical advice.

[A case in London is not surprising, much as a case in New York City, Bangkok Thailand, Tokyo Japan, etc. These are all major cities with international airports and transportation hubs. The key is the early identification of symptoms and self-isolation to prevent spread of the virus to others. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO has published key considerations for repatriation and quarantine of travellers in relation to COVID-19. More information can be found at https://www.who.int/ith/Repatriation_Quarantine_nCoV-key-considerations_HQ-final11Feb.pdf.

- The UN activated a Crisis Management Team (CMT) on the COVID-19 outbreak, to be led by WHO. The WHO Director-General nominated Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO Health Emergencies Programme as the Crisis Manager. The CMT brings together WHO, OCHA, IMO (International Maritime Organization), UNICEF, ICAO, WFP, FAO, the World Bank, and several departments of the UN Secretariat. It held its 1st meeting yesterday via teleconference. This mechanism will help WHO focus on the health response while the other agencies will bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak. Additional members will be included depending on the evolution of the outbreak and its impact globally.

- WHO has prepared a list of Q&A on infection prevention and control for health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV [COVID-19]

Technical focus: internationally exported COVID-19 cases
--------------------------------------------------------
Excluding China, there are 24 countries reporting cases of COVID-19. Among these 24 countries, 23 report cases with an exposure in China. In addition, 11 of these 23 countries report cases attributed to local transmission inside the reporting country. 4 of the 24 countries report cases where likely exposure occurred outside the reporting country and outside of China. Among these 4 reporting countries the most likely countries where exposure occurred were France, Germany, Japan, and Singapore ([see map at the source URL above]). All transmissions occurred within known defined clusters.

[The figures provided in the report are the figures from the National Health Commission of China from 11 Feb 2020. The 12 Feb 2020 figures are included in Section [1] above. They are posted at approximately 7 p.m. (GMT-5), which is 1 a.m. (GMT+1) in Geneva. - Mod.MPP]
