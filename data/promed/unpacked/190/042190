A 2-year-old boy died from bird flu [avian [A/H5N1) virus infection] last Friday [27 Apr 2012] in a state hospital in Riau, the Health Ministry has confirmed.

A ministry team has investigated the boy's neighborhood and found that he may have had contact with quails' eggs because his parents sold them, the Ministry's directorate general for disease control and environmental health said in a press statement released on Tuesday night [1 May 2012].

The boy, a resident of Siak in Pekanbaru, was brought to a private clinic on 20 Apr 2012 after developing a fever on 17 Apr 2012, the statement said. He was then rushed to a private hospital on the night of 20 Apr 2012 because his condition had not improved, it said. On 21 Apr 2012, he was treated in another hospital identified only as EB, where doctors reported the case to the Riau Health Agency's post command. He was referred to a state hospital, identified only as AA. "[The boy's] condition deteriorated, and he died on 27 Apr 2012 at 11:45 p.m. at Hospital AA," the statement said.

The total number of bird flu cases since 2005 now stands at 189, with 157 fatalities after the latest case. Director general Dr. Tjandra Yoga Aditama has reported the latest case to the World Health Organization, the statement said.

[Not all reports of human cases of avian influenza virus infection in Indonesia are subsequently confirmed. However, this report emanates from the Indonesia Ministry of Health and is likely correct. Therefore, this case will become the 7th case and 7th fatality to be recorded in Indonesia in 2012.
