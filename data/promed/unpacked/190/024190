[1] Cholera - UK (England) ex India

A case of toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Inaba biotype El Tor has been
confirmed in a Spanish national returning home to Spain from India via
London Heathrow airport. The woman developed severe vomiting and diarrhea
during her flight from Delhi to London and could not complete her ongoing
flight to Barcelona due to her illness.
On arrival in London on 1 Oct 2006, she was taken off the plane and was
admitted to the intensive care unit of the local acute district general
hospital with profuse diarrhea and vomiting. The patient had rice water
stools and copious fluid loss, and required intravenous fluid replacement
_V. cholerae_ was isolated from her feces on 4 Oct 2006. This isolate was
sent for confirmation and typing to the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens
(LEP) at the HPA Centre for Infections on 4 Oct 2006 and was reported to
the source laboratory as a toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 Inaba biotype El Tor
on 9 Oct 2006.
A family member of the index case remained with her in London and developed
diarrhea on 5 Oct 2006 but did not require hospitalization. _V. cholerae_
O1 Inaba biotype El Tor was isolated from feces and was sent for
confirmation on 9 Oct 2006. Both cases have now recovered and have returned
to Spain.
Both cases were part of a group of more than 100 tourists who had toured
the Golden Triangle' in India (Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur) for a week, as part
of a holiday package, and stayed in good-quality hotels. It is unusual for
tourists staying in such hotels to develop such serious cholera symptoms.
The HPA is currently not aware that anybody else became ill on the flight
from Delhi to Heathrow.
The HPA has informed the public health authorities in Spain of the case,
and they have interviewed the other members of the party. The WHO has been
notified under the current International Health Regulations.
Around 10 imported cases of cholera are diagnosed in the UK each year,
mainly associated with travel to the Indian sub-continent. Prior to these 2
cases, LEP had received 9 isolates of _V. cholerae_ O1 in 2006.
This small outbreak of imported cholera involving 3 countries demonstrates
the importance of rapid international notification of suspected cases of
cholera in order to review contacts, as the incubation period can be from
as little as a few hours to 5 days.

[2] Cholera - India (Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory)

The Andaman and Nicobar administration on Tue 10 Oct 2006 claimed that
there was no reason to panic about a cholera epidemic in the islands. "No
fresh case has been reported from any part of the islands except for 8
cases in children, admitted to a local hospital earlier and were cured,"
according to islands' health director N Sadasivan. He said only 3 to 4
cases of suspected cholera had been treated in the children's ward of G B
Pant Hospital.
Earlier, a team of doctors from the Health Department and Indian Centre for
Medical Research had moved to all the areas from where 8 suspected cholera
cases were reported.

[The Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory is an administrative
division of India. Unlike states, which have their own local governments,
union territories are ruled directly by the national government. There are
over 570 islands in the territory, of which only some 38 are permanently
inhabited. A map showing the location of the Indian territory in the Bay of
Bengal can be found at:

[3] Undiagnosed illness, human, fatal - Indonesia (West Java)

As of Fri, 6 Oct 2006, 238 people were ill and 5 dead from an illness
producing diarrhea and vomiting. According to the Garut Regent, Agus
Supriadi, who was accompanied by Kabag public relations and Garut Regional
Government representatives, 124 patients are still being treated in DPT
Limbangan Community Health Center.
The regent believes these cases may be related to the source of water and
is seeking an alternative large clean source for the community. While
waiting for construction of an artesian well in Cibiuk, the regent
continued, the Garut Regional Government will increase assistance and
supplies of clean water there.
Construction on the artesian well in Cibiuk could begin within a month, the
regent reported. There is a commitment to supply extra help to the Darul
Ulm Islamic School in the Jatisari Village, Kec Karangpawitan.
Results could be expected from the laboratory on several samples as early
as Mon or Tue [8-9 Oct 2006] said Dr Hendi Buniman, who is with the
sanitation department. He said that _E. coli_ was suspected but that his
investigators did yet want to confirm it as the cause.
Dr Hendi believes part of the problem may be environmental sanitation. He
reported that only 43 per cent of the households in Garut have a family
toilet. There is also concern about sanitation in the home. Many people in
the area still defecate in the river and in gardens, from where food is
consumed. He said that the diarrhea illness and vomiting was in north Garut
territory, especially Kec, Malangbong, Cibatu, and Sukawening.
A similar situation may have happened in 1993 in Malangbong and the
surrounding area.

[The area sanitation seems lacking. Perhaps this is _E. coli_ or
Salmonella. There is no indication of whether these are water or fecal
samples or both. We hope, however, that there will be some word from the
laboratory. - Mod.TG

district bordering South Sudan and Adjumani district. Three people were

[This posting infers that Amuru has been now made into its own district.
Amuru had been one of the 23 sub-counties of Gulu. Amuru means "boiling"
because of a hot spring located in the area. A map of Uganda can be found
at: <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/uganda.pdf>. The area
where Amuru is located is close to Sudan and Adjumani. - Mod.LL]
