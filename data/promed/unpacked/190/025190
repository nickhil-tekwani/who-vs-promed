So far, 7 people have died from Paraguay's 1st outbreak of yellow
fever [YF] in 34 years. The government says authorities are
conducting a massive vaccination campaign in high-risk areas.

The health minister said 300 000 people are being vaccinated against
yellow fever. Authorities also say workers will begin cleaning up
standing pools of water and trash where mosquitoes breed in the
affected district outside the capital Asuncion.

[Metropolitan Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, has between 1.2-5.4
million people, depending on the source (Google), raising the
question if the 300 000 people being vaccinated, cited above, will
provide adequate coverage. The good news is that nearly one million
YF vaccine doses are now available in the country, and more doses
appear to be on the way. - Mods.JW/TY]

[Since immunity to YF vaccine can take up to 10 days following
vaccination, it would not be surprising to see a few more cases
before the outbreak is halted.

The Ministry of Health on Monday [18 Feb 2008] confirmed one
additional yellow fever (YF) case, bringing the number of YF deaths
[in 2008] to 16. To date, Brazil has had 31 confirmed YF cases.

According to this agency, the death occurred in December [2007] and
was among the [suspected] cases under investigation. The victim was
infected [with the virus] in a forested area in the state of Mato
Grosso, according to the Ministry, and was the 2nd [YF] death in the state.

According to the Ministry, from December [2007] to date, about 13
million doses of YF vaccine were distributed in the country, of which
6.8 million were applied in January [2008], focusing on areas where
sylvan [forest or jungle] YF cases occurred or where cases of this
disease occurred in monkeys.
