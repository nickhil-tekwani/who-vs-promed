Yellow fever outbreak in Liberia threatens Sierra Leone
-------------------------------------------------------
NEW DELHI: Alarm bells have started ringing in Sierra Leone following an
outbreak of yellow fever in neighboring Liberia. Health authorities in
Sierra Leone have plunged into action to prevent its further spread in
Liberia Experts from WHO and Sierra Leone's ministry of health are visiting
[the risk-prone districts of Kenema, Pujehun and Boto this week to provide
crash training to health workers in identification and management of the
disease. International non-governmental organizations such as Medicins Sans
Frontieres, Merlin and International Medical Corps, which are running
temporary clinics in the border districts have put their staff on alert.
On 16 Aug 2000, Liberia's Ministry of Health confirmed an outbreak of
yellow fever in the coastal Grand Cape Mount County in Liberia which flanks
Sierra Leone's Eastern province. 29 cases and 4 deaths have been reported
and more cases are coming in. Laboratory tests conducted at Institut
Pasteur, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivore, confirmed that yellow fever virus has now
spread to 6 of Liberia's 14 counties. All the investigated cases occurred
among unvaccinated persons. In Grand Cape Mount, the population lives in
small villages or towns of 5 000 to 10 000 persons, with a lot of movement
across the border into Sierra Leone. Grand Cape Mount is closely-linked
also to the Liberian capital, Monrovia. Introduction of yellow fever into
Monrovia would put 1.5 million people at risk.
A nationwide yellow fever vaccination campaign was conducted in Liberia in
1995, but coverage was reported to be low, leaving much of the population
susceptible. The risk of further transmission is high, WHO has warned. Both
countries have a large unvaccinated population, the area is notoriously
insecure and hard to access due to rebel activity. There is also
considerable movement of displaced and vulnerable persons across the
border. WHO has now dispatched 30 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine to
Sierra Leone. Recently, 150 000 doses of the vaccine were sent to Liberia
for a mass vaccination campaign, which is starting this week.
