Potato farmers in Kurigram Sadar [district, Rangpur Division] are harvesting before maturity. They may suffer loss as late blight disease has attacked their potato fields.

"The plants are around 65 days old. Dense fog and cold caused late blight that affected the plants. About 25 per cent of potato fields have been attacked," [a farmer said].

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind, and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material, and fungicide sprays of crops.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. More virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. Farm saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks in the past. Thus, seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen. Clean planting stock (potato seed tubers, tomato seeds, or explants) and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control PLB in the future.

A current outbreak of PLB in Bangladesh is being reported from the neighbouring Rajshahi division (ProMED-mail post 20170115.4767829). Furthermore, an unspecified fungus is affecting potatoes in the adjacent division of Dhaka (ProMED-mail post 20170203.4812065), and this may also be PLB.
