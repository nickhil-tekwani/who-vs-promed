[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE terrestrial manual, Chapter 2.2.3 on European foulbrood of honey bees (EFB) at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.03_EUROPEAN_FOULB.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Bee larvae usually die of European foulbrood 1-2 days before being sealed in their cells, or sometimes shortly afterwards, and always before transformation to pupae. The disease is caused by _Melissococcus plutonius_ and occurs mostly during the period when colonies are growing quickly. Most sick larvae become displaced from their coiled position in the bottom of their cells before they die. Many are quickly detected and removed by nurse bees, leaving empty cells scattered randomly among the remaining brood. Some infected larvae survive, successfully pupate and emerge as adults. These surviving larvae are able to defecate and their infected faeces contribute to the continued propagation of the disease.

"Infected larvae that escape detection by adult bees 1st become flaccid and turn a light yellow colour that becomes increasingly brown, and at the same time they dissolve into a semi-liquid mass. They then become dry and form a dark brown scale that can easily be removed from the cells. Severely affected brood may have a very stale or sour odour, sometimes acidic, like vinegar, but often there is no smell.

"Signs of disease usually disappear spontaneously from infected colonies before the end of the active season, but are likely to return in subsequent years."

"A number of other bacteria are often associated with and may be confused with _M. plutonius_. _Bacterium eurydice_ inhabits the alimentary tract of adult bees and occurs commonly in the gut of healthy larvae in small numbers. It is more numerous in larvae infected with _M. plutonius_. The incidence of _B. eurydice_ in healthy bees is very low in winter and early spring, but it increases in summer. It forms thin square-ended rods, which can grow either singly or in chains. When grown in certain media, it sometimes resembles streptococci and has been confused with _M. plutonius_. However, its cultural characteristics closely resemble those of _Corynebacterium pyogenes_, and it multiplies poorly in the form of thin rods, under the conditions necessary for the cultivation of _M. plutonius_.

"_Enterococcus (=Streptococcus) faecalis_ closely resembles _M. plutonius_ morphologically and has often been confused with it, although they are both culturally and serologically distinct. Unlike _M. plutonius_, it does not remain viable for long when dried, or persist as mechanical contamination within bee colonies. It is probably brought into the hive by foraging adult bees, and is responsible for the sour smell sometimes encountered with European foulbrood."

"_Paenibacillus (=Bacillus) alvei_ is generally more common than _E. faecalis_ in bee colonies affected with European foulbrood, but it is not invariably associated with the disease and so cannot act as a reliable indicator of it. In bee colonies, it multiplies only in the decomposing remains of larvae, and then its spores often predominate over all other bacteria, even to their apparent exclusion. _Paenibacillus alvei_ forms very resistant spores and becomes well established in bee colonies with enzootic European foulbrood. It causes a characteristic stale odour. _Paenibacillus alvei_ multiplies poorly under the conditions necessary for the in-vitro growth of_M. plutonius_. It produces a spreading growth of transparent colonies, some of which are motile and move in arcs over the surface of the agar. Cultures have the characteristic stale odour that is associated with European foulbrood when the bacillus is present. Spores are formed rapidly."

_Paenibacillus alvei_ is occasionally associated with human infection. http://tinyurl.com/o65bmtg
