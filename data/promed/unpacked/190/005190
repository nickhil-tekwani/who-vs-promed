A malformed and stillborn calf from Funen is the 1st Danish animal tested positive for Schmallenberg virus [SBV]. The National Veterinary Institute examined the calf for the new virus that was spreading in Europe in summer and autumn 2011.

"Abortions, and in particular births of deformed kids, lambs and calves, may be caused in pregnant ruminants due to infection with SBV during their gestation. The mother of the positive calf tested positive for antibodies to SBV; the pregnant animal was probably infected by infected culicoides during the fall of 2011," says Bertel Strandbygaard, veterinarian at the National Veterinary Institute.

The National Veterinary Institute, in agreement with the Food and Drug Administration, investigated stillbirths and weak-born calves, lambs, and kids with deformities of SBV in March, April, and May [2012]. There were 56 animals studied, and a single calf has thus tested positive for the virus, using the PCR method.

[Denmark has become Europe's 9th SBV-affected country; the others are Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium, UK, Luxembourg, Italy, and Spain. The virus circulated in the affected territories during July-December 2011; its behaviour during the 2012 vector season is anticipated with interest and concern.

The Danish press release includes a picture of the affected calf with arthrogyposis changes. - Mod.AS
