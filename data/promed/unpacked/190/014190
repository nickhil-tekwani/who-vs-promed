According to records of the Ministry of Agriculture Foods and Fisheries
[MAFF] at least seventeen calves (of the 23.000 confirmed BSE-infected cows
since the feed ban) were BSE-confirmed below the age of 30 months, but older
than 20 months. (source: Dutch scientists, among them A. Osterhaus, a
member of the European Scientific Veterinary Committee, in a letter to
the Dutch minister of Agriculture, dated April 1st 1996).

In 1994 MAFF released figures (answering questions of shadow minister of
agriculture Strang) that state that in the period from june 1988 (feed ban)
till december 1993 three calves younger than two years (24 months) were
BSE-infected. The figures of infected cows between 24 and 36 months were:
1988: 6, 1989: 47, 1990: 70, 1991: 81, 1992 : 39, 1993: 22. (source:
Institute for Animal Science and Health, ID-DLO, Lelystad, Netherlands).
So, how do "we know that animals infected as young calves show no
infectivity at 30 months even in their Central Nervous System"? The chance
that a cow younger than 30 months will show infectivity seems relatively small.

OK, you are talking about something under 1:1000

Unfortunately I do not have the total numbers in these birth groups,
although MAFF have (several times) said they will post them to me. One
might hazard a guess that 1:1000 might be of the right order. I should
point out that record keeping amongst some british farmers (a sizeable
minority) is what you could describe as rudimentary. It is not unusual
for an ear tag to be lost and another reapplied some time later that
could give the appearance of the animal being younger than it is unless
very good records are kept. In beef herds records were often non-
existant. I would expect an error rate at some level in farmer kept
records, and many 'typical' errors would end up making an animal
'younger' than it really was. We can discuss this further if you like.

Please note my 1:1000 is a guess for the ratio of animals 24-36 months
with confirmed BSE to those older with confirmed BSE. NOT total animals.

OK. Without further detailed investigation I have to agree with you.
