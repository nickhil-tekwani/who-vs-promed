Statement by WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan
27 April 2009
Swine influenza
---------------
The Emergency Committee, established in compliance with
the International Health Regulations (2005), held its
2nd meeting on 27 April 2009.

The Committee considered available data on confirmed
outbreaks of A/H1N1 swine influenza in the United States
of America, Mexico, and Canada. The Committee also
considered reports of possible spread to additional
countries.

Current WHO phase of pandemic alert
-----------------------------------
On the advice of the Committee, the WHO Director-General
decided on the following.

The Director-General has raised the level of influenza pandemic alert
from the current phase 3 to phase 4 [see explanation in comment at end].

The change to a higher phase of pandemic alert indicates
that the likelihood of a pandemic has increased, but not
that a pandemic is inevitable.

As further information becomes available, WHO may decide
to either revert to phase 3 or raise the level of alert to
another phase.

This decision was based primarily on epidemiological data
demonstrating human-to-human transmission and the ability
of the virus to cause community-level outbreaks.

Given the widespread presence of the virus, the
Director-General considered that containment of the
outbreak is not feasible. The current focus should be on
mitigation measures.

International Health Regulations (IHR)
--------------------------------------
The Director-General recommended NOT to close borders and
NOT to restrict international travel. It was considered
prudent for people who are ill to delay international
travel and for people developing symptoms following
international travel to seek medical attention.

The Director-General stressed that all measures should
conform with the purpose and scope of the International
Health Regulations.

Vaccine
-------
The Director-General considered that production of
seasonal influenza vaccine should continue at this time,
subject to re-evaluation as the situation evolves. WHO
will facilitate the process needed to develop a vaccine
effective against A/H1N1 virus.

Swine influenza - update 3
--------------------------
The current situation regarding the outbreak of swine influenza
A(H1N1) is evolving rapidly. As of 27 April 2009, the United States
Government has reported 40 laboratory confirmed human cases of swine
influenza A(H1N1), with no deaths. Mexico has reported 26 confirmed
human cases of infection with the same virus, including 7 deaths [but
see report below], Canada has reported 6 cases, with no deaths, while
Spain has reported one case, with no deaths.

Further information on the situation will be available on the WHO
website on a regular basis.

WHO advises NO restriction of regular travel or closure of borders. It
is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay international
travel and for people developing symptoms following international
travel to seek medical attention, in line with guidance from national
authorities.

There is also no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of
well-cooked pork and pork products.

Individuals are advised to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water
on a regular basis and should seek medical attention if they develop
any symptoms of influenza-like illness.

Mexico Raises Swine Flu Death Toll to 149 [suspected]
-----------------------------------------------------
The suspected death toll from the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico rose
Monday [27 Apr 2009] to 149 people as health authorities cancelled all
schools across the country until 6 May 2009.

Mexican cabinet officials led by Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova
gave a press conference today [27 Apr 2009] in Mexico City with the
latest information they have gathered about the outbreak of a deadly
new strain of swine flu that has halted many aspects of public life
here and appears to continue to be spreading.

Since the first case of swine flu was reported, 1995 people have been
hospitalized with serious cases of pneumonia, said Cordova, and 1070
of these people have been released. He said 20 of the deaths so far
have been confirmed as swine flu, but that just 2 laboratories in the
country, one in Mexico City and one in the state of Veracruz, are able
to confirm this new strain.

[4] USA (5 states): 40 cases confirmed
Date: 27 Apr 2009

<http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/?s_cid=swineFlu_outbreak_internal_001>


U.S. Human Cases of Swine Flu Infection
(As of April 27, 2009 1:00 PM ET)
California 7 cases
Kansas 2 cases
New York City 28 cases
Ohio 1 case
Texas 2 cases
TOTAL COUNT 40 cases

CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center to coordinate the
agency's response to this emerging health threat and yesterday [26 Apr
2009] the Secretary of the Department Homeland Security, Janet
Napolitano, declared a public health emergency in the United States.

This will allow funds to be released to support the public health
response. CDC's goals during this public health emergency are to
reduce transmission and illness severity, and provide information to
assist health care providers, public health officials and the public
in addressing the challenges posed by this newly identified influenza
virus.

To this end, CDC has issued a number of interim guidance documents in
the past 24 hours. In addition, CDC's Division of the Strategic
National Stockpile (SNS) is releasing one-quarter of its antiviral
drugs, personal protective equipment, and respiratory protection
devices to help states respond to the outbreak.

Laboratory testing has found the swine influenza A (H1N1) virus
susceptible to the prescription antiviral drugs oseltamivir and
zanamivir.

This is a rapidly evolving situation and CDC will provide updated
guidance and new information as it becomes available.

UK probes '17 swine flu reports'. There have also been cases of swine
flu reported in Canada and a suspected case in France. Swine flu is
usually found in pigs and contracted only by people in contact with
the animals.


Some reports say as many as 149 people may have died from swine flu,
but WHO officials put the figure much lower and said only about 20 of
the deaths could be definitely attributed to swine flu.


Israel renames unkosher swine flu.
Israel's health minister updates a nervous public about the swine flu
epidemic - and starts by renaming it Mexican flu.


Swine flu fears hit travel shares.
Global stock markets fall, with airlines leading the declines on fears
over the economic impact of the swine flu outbreak.

[WHO Phase 4 "is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission
of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause
'community-level outbreaks.' ... Phase 4 indicates a significant
increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a
pandemic is a forgone conclusion."

A 6th US state, Minnesota, has reported a suspect case.

The pharmaceutical company GSK?s shares have risen as it promises to
produce more of the flu antiviral Relenza.

When checking the HealthMap swine flu map at:

be aware that the markers on China, Japan & Hawaii do NOT mean that
they are reporting suspect cases, only that they are mentioned in
swine flu news stories. - Mod.JW]
