Victorian sheep infected with foot rot have been blamed for
introducing the disease into the Riverina [an agricultural region of
south western New South Wales] this spring [2010]. The Hume Livestock
Health and Pest Authority is investigating 3 recent cases in the
district.

Right now seasonal conditions are ideal for the spread of the disease.
But, Hume district Vet Dr Tony Morton says Victoria should be more
vigilant in defending [against] foot rot.

"The clear cut case is in sheep bought in from Victoria earlier this
year [2010]. Regrettably, Victoria has never had a foot rot program
like NSW and as such, it remains our highest threat for the
introduction of foot rot.

"People buying sheep from Victoria should get a foot rot declaration
or an animal health statement with foot rot on it saying it's free.
The other thing is if you're introducing sheep from Victoria
particularly, you need to keep them isolated during the spring period,
so they don't cross the path of any of your other sheep."

[Foot rot in Australia is a contagious bacterial disease of sheep and
goats, caused by the organism _Dichelobacter nodosus_ in association
with a number of other bacteria. With full expression, virulent foot
rot is a severe, debilitating disease with significant economic loss
from reduced wool growth and quality, poor ewe fertility, poor growth
rates, losses from blowfly strike, and reduced sale value. In infected
flocks, there are also significant costs associated with the control
of the disease.
