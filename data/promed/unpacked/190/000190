Avian Influenza in Poland
-------------------------
Authorities and veterinary experts have confirmed today [5 Mar 2006] the 1st
case of H5 influenza virus detected in 2 dead swans found in the city of Torun
in the middle of Poland. The dead birds were found in the city water sports
club area near the Vistula [Wisla] river.
1st results of examinations performed in the National Veterinary
Institute in Pulawy suggested that both swans died of the highly
pathogenic H5 influenza virus. Samples will be sent on Monday [6 Mar
2006] to Weybridge [UK] for confirmation.
The local veterinary authorities and crisis management team have
introduced an emergency plan with introduction of protection and
surveillance zones, increasing the awareness of the population in the
city of Torun [Turun], and enhanced control measures in the
agricultural sector outside the city.

[We are grateful to Dr. Grzesiowski for this firsthand information.
According to additional media reports, the Polish authorities have
informed the European Commission and have taken precautionary
measures. They have established a high risk area of 3 km (2 miles)
around the outbreak and a surveillance zone of 10 km. Restrictions
have also been placed on the 6 poultry farms and 4 processing plants
in the region.
The farm minister and the country's chief vet said Poland was
well-prepared to deal with the outbreak.
Poland last month [January 2006] imposed a ban on keeping poultry in
open spaces after bird flu was confirmed in neighboring Germany.
Turun is about 160 km northwest of Warsaw; see map at

action=showmap&country=237_0_4&language=1>.
Data on the species of the affected swans, and results of the
reference laboratory, when received, will be appreciated.
Affected wild birds -- mainly swans -- have been recorded, since the
beginning of February 2006, in 13 European countries without
involvement of domestic poultry (Austria, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden
& Switzerland (where 4 additional cases in wild ducks have been
reported during the weekend). A 14th country, France, experienced
infected swans in several sites, while a single commercial turkey
farm, adjacent to the site where infected swans were located, has
been found infected. One wonders whether the absence of recorded
infected wild birds in other central and north European countries
(excluding the UK (where extensive tests have, reportedly, been
performed) reflects absence of disease or rather a less active
surveillance. - Mod.AS]

As announced Sun 5 Mar 2006 by the Minister of Agriculture, H5N1 has
been detected in a swan in the region Bouches-du-Rhone (south) and in
a duck in Ain (east).
So far, 31 wild birds have been found positive in France, 30 in Ain,
and now the 1st report from elsewhere.
The swan [species?!] was found on 28 Feb 2006 in Saint-Mitre-les-Ramparts,
near Berre.

Ain is right above the R of the word Rhone-Alpes on the east, & Bouches-du-
Rhone's capital is Marseille, the only red dot right on the Mediterranean
coastline. - Mod.JW]
The duck [species?!] was found [no date] in Prevessin-Moens, just across the
Swiss border from Geneva.
Confirmation as HPAI was received from the national laboratory of AFSSA
(French Agency of Sanitary Food Safety) in Ploufragan (west).

[3] Uganda, suspected

Bird flu scare hits Uganda
--------------------------
The unexplained death of thousands of birds on poultry farms in
several districts has thrown health and veterinary authorities into a
panic, fearing that it could be avian influenza, commonly known as
bird flu. Thousands of birds have died on poultry farms in several
districts in central and eastern Uganda in the past week alone.
Dr. Christopher Rutebarika, the assistant commissioner for veterinary
health and disease control in the Ministry of Agriculture, confirmed
the deaths in a telephone interview on Friday [3 Mar 2006]. He said
samples had been taken out of the country for tests but that the
results were yet to be known. "We are awaiting the results of the
tests," he said. "It is after we get the results that we shall
determine what action to take."
But on a positive note, he said, bird flu testing kits have arrived
in the country; hence there will be no more need to send samples
abroad for testing [though confirmation at reference labs should
always be sought - Mod.AS].
The government has undertaken several preparatory steps to counter
the virus, should it strike. A multi-sector National Task Force has
been constituted, comprising Ministry of Health, Ministry of
Agriculture, Ministry of Tourism and Trade, Uganda Wildlife
Authority, poultry associations and other partners to prepare and set
up an emergency response mechanism.
