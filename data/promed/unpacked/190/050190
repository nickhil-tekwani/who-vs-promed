AIDS epidemic grows at record rate
----------------------------------
The AIDS epidemic is continuing to grow at a record rate with roughly 4.8
million people becoming infected last year with the virus that causes AIDS,
according to a United Nations report released today
<http://www.unaids.org/en/other/functionalities/ViewDocument.asp?href=http://gva-doc-owl/WEBcontent/Documents/pub/Media/Press-Releases02/PR_Globalreport2004_06Jul04_en.pdf>.
That is the largest increase in any year since the global outbreak began,
the report said.
Thirty-eight million people are living with HIV, as the epidemic continues
to deepen in sub-Saharan Africa, by far the hardest hit region, and new
epidemics seem to be swelling unchecked in Asia and Eastern Europe.
Life-prolonging drugs are not getting to those who need them most,
according to the report. Some 400 000 people in the developing world have
access to the drugs out of 6 million who need them, UN experts here said.
According to the report, the most global epidemic in history is also
becoming increasingly feminine. Now, nearly half of all people infected
between the ages of 15 and 49 are women. In Africa, the proportion is
almost 60 per cent.
The report comes at a time when the world has significantly boosted its
commitment and resources to HIV/AIDS, but the need is still far greater,
according to the fourth global report by the Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS released in advance of Sunday's 15th International AIDS
Conference here. "Over 20 years of AIDS provides us with compelling
evidence that unless we act now we will be paying later -- a trenchant
message for the countries of Asia and the Pacific," said Peter Piot, the
program's executive director, in the report.
In Asia, with 60 per cent of the world's population, 7.4 million people are
living with HIV. One of every 4 newly-infected people is Asian. The
epidemic is fueled by drug use, sex work, and sex between men, but it is
fast moving into the general population, UN experts said. China and India
have severe epidemics in a number of provinces, territories, and states. In
Indonesia and Vietnam, infections among injecting drug users have soared.
"There's a . . . window of opportunity to get prevention programs up to
scale in Asia," said Kathleen Cravero, the program's deputy executive
director at a press conference here. "If we miss it, we will see an
epidemic the likes of which we never imagined despite what has happened in
Africa."
Far from leveling off, in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa infection
rates are on the rise. In that region alone last year, 3 million people
became sick with HIV. Seven countries in southern Africa report prevalence
rates -- the percentage of people who have HIV -- of more than 15 per cent.
They are Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, and
Zambia. A prevalence rate higher than 1 per cent is considered to be a
generalized epidemic.

[ProMED-mail does not normally carry reports on HIV/AIDS, but the
seriousness of the current situation and the magnitude of the developing
global epidemic requires this rule to be over-ridden to post this UN
report. - Mod.CP]
