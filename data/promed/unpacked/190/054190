The investigation of a salmonellosis outbreak in 3 Ottawa schools and
a daycare is focusing on 2 particular dishes served by a catering
company that delivers to all 4 places, according to an email sent to
parents by the caterers.

"Tacos and meat lasagna, which were identified as possible sources,
have been removed from our menu, and replaced with vegetarian
lasagna," says the message from [JM] who owns 2 franchises of The
Lunch Lady catering company in Ottawa. Public health investigators are
working on tracing the source of contamination that appears to have
come from a Lunch Lady kitchen on Boyd Avenue.

Dr Isra Levy, the city's top public health official, confirmed that as
investigators interviewed victims, several said they ate one or both
of those dishes. But, he said, there's no scientifically definitive
conclusion yet. "People don't really remember what they ate a week
ago," Levy said.

The early stages of an investigation are driven "more by instinct and
judgment of the on-the-ground investigators," Levy said, which will
point them in the direction of foods that seem more likely to be
contaminated. Then comes scientifically rigorous examination, which is
really just getting started; 5 inspectors and 6 nurses are working on
it.

The investigation's threads are still "diverging rather than
converging," Levy said. He's concerned, as well, that identifying
these particular foods might influence the memories of people
investigators haven't yet reached. The department has taken samples of
suspect food at the Lunch Lady kitchen for analysis -- ground beef,
cottage cheese, sour cream, and some spices.

Given the facts known so far, there are plenty of plausible
explanations for the outbreak, Levy said, from a bad batch of beef to
a kitchen worker who didn't wash his/her hands after handling a [pet] turtle
at home (reptiles often harbour salmonella on their skins).

The department now has 20 lab-confirmed cases of salmonellosis
reported since the outbreak was declared, including 16 children and
4 adults. The schools known to be involved are Steve MacLean Public
School, Turnbull Academy and Jean-Paul II elementary school, plus
Tiny Hoppers daycare in Kanata, all of which get hot food delivered by
The Lunch Lady.

Schools served by [JM's] other kitchen, or by a 3rd Lunch Lady
franchise that serves eastern Ottawa, aren't known to have been
affected by the outbreak.

[The investigation of this outbreak is continuing. It is likely, given
the temporal link of the cases occurring in the schools and day care
center, that the cases will be found to be caused by the same serotype
of _S. enterica_. - Mod.LL
