This is in reference to posting ProMED V2011 No.195: B Charleston, BM
Bankowski, S Gubbins, ME Chase-Topping, D Schley, R Howey.
Relationship between clinical signs and transmission of an infectious
disease and the implications for control. They concluded that the
infectious period in FMD is shorter (mean 1.7 days) than currently
realized, and animals are not infectious until, on average, 0.5 days
after clinical signs appear. [See:
http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/05/04/332.6030.726.DC1/Charlest
on-SOM.pdf. - Mod.MHJ]

In our review of the literature on FMD on the control and eradication
of FMD (Sutmoller et al., Virus Research 91 (2003) 101-144), we
concluded that the peak of infectivity is just prior to or during the
development of lesions. Infectivity is much reduced 3-4 days after the
lesions develop. Some virus strains are host adapted.

Charleston et al., in their FMD transmission experiments (1), exposed
8 source cattle to tongue inoculated donor cattle. Of the 8 source
cattle exposed, the development of clinical signs, virus isolation
results from blood, oesophageal and nasal fluids were all fully
compatible with those reported in the literature.

Seven of the 8 infected source cattle transmitted FMD to naive cattle
during 8-hours contact every other day. Five of the source cattle
transmitted FMD during one contact period only, but transmission could
have occurred during a 3-day period, because on the day before or the
after, there were no contacts. One source animal transmitted FMD
during days 4 and 6 post exposure, but transmission could have lasted
for 5 days. In 3 cases, the transmission period could have even lasted
longer, because of the termination of the experiments.

Thus, all observations of Charleston et al. nicely fit the general
knowledge of FMD as reported in our review.

In addition, I would like to make the following comments: Conditions
in bio-secure isolation boxes are far removed from the normal stable
or field conditions. To extrapolate from such laboratory results to
field conditions is quite hazardous. Also, in a herd situation, it is
not the cow with "the mean value" that counts, but most likely the
exceptional one. For instance, the one source cow that successfully
transmitted FMD on day one or 2 after exposure might be the one that
defines the character of the whole outbreak.

when I was posted to PANAFTOSA. He is eminently reliable, whether in
the laboratory or in the field. Experienced old scientific hands, such
as he, have seen it all before. - Mod.MHJ]
