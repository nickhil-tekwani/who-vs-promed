The report by Dr. Emmons describes a well-known pattern of rodent
population dynamics; "population explosions" are known to occur in
all biogeographical regions. In South America, the association
between the flowering of certain bamboos [which does not occur
every year - Mod.JW] and the multiplication of rodents is the most
remarkable example (see PEREIRA, C. 1941 Sobre as "ratadas" no
sul do Brasil e o ciclo vegetativo das "taquaras". Arquivos do
Instituto Biologico, S. Paulo, 12:175-96, and HERSHKOVITZ, P.
1962 Evolution of neotropical cricetine rodents. (Muridae) Fieldiana:
zoology, 46:1-524).
Population explosions of the species mentioned by Dr. Emmons
occur usually in rural areas where seasonal crops of cereals are
cultivated. Harvesting is followed by a social disruption in
populations of rodents, which invade houses and campsites
searching for food. The operation of natural controlling mechanisms
eventually reduces their numbers, not only through epizootics but
also through reduction in the number of embryos (see ELTON, C.
S., 1924. Periodic fluctuations in the numbers of animals: their
causes and effects. Brit .Jour. Experim. Biol., 2 :119-163. ELTON,
C. S., 1925. Plague and the regulation of numbers in wild animals.
Journal of Hygiene, 24 :138-63. ELTON, C. S. 1931 The study of
epidemic diseases among wild animals. J. Hyg, 31(4): 435-456).
Epizootics in South America such as those due to pseudo-
tuberculosis, murine typhus, plague, and Argentinian and Bolivian
hemorrhagic fevers, among others, are due to several causes
[besides increases in the food supply]. The role of hantaviruses in
rodent die-offs has not been established so far. Leishmanias have a
completely different ecology, and they are not associated with the
control of rodent populations.
