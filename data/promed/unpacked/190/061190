Anthrax outbreak hits Bangladesh leather and meat sectors
---------------------------------------------------------
Health officials here are battling to contain an outbreak of anthrax, which
commonly infects livestock here, so farmers are suffering too.

Anthrax exists naturally in the soil in some parts of Bangladesh. Livestock
get ill after eating contaminated grass, especially during or after the
monsoon when water brings it to the surface. Some north-western areas have
repeated anthrax outbreaks.

The latest outbreak, which is hurting the leather industry that depends on
raw hides from slaughtered cattle, is thought to have been caused by people
slaughtering anthrax-infected cattle and selling or eating the contaminated
meat. Scores of anthrax-infected cattle have died in the last few weeks.

The outbreak was 1st detected in the central district of Sirajganj in
August and has now spread to 12 districts. It has infected about 600 people
so far. Officials say all of them have been infected with cutaneous, or
skin anthrax, which causes wound-like lesions. Health officials say
cutaneous anthrax is not life-threatening if detected early and there is
treatment available.

No humans have died so far, but the anthrax outbreak has caused panic. As a
result, demand for beef and mutton has dropped significantly after
consumers stopped buying red meat, with sales down nearly 90 percent in the
past month. The sharp fall in the number of cattle slaughtered in various
slaughtering houses has drastically limited the supply of hides to the
tanneries.

There has been a sharp increase in the prices of hides and many tanneries
are running out of material. "We are using hides from our old stock," says
Abu Taher, who runs a tannery in Hazaribag, a suburb of the capital Dhaka.
"But how long we can continue to use it? Those who are raising cows, those
who are selling beef and also those who are slaughtering, they are all
losing jobs."

Bangladeshi firms make both finished leather and leather products. Leather
handbags, boots, jackets, belts and ornamental goods are exported to the
USA, Italy, Germany, Japan, Korea and China. Bangladeshi companies earned
USD 460m (GBP 290m) in leather and leather goods exports last year [2009].
And this year was supposed to be even more lucrative, as the industry was
just beginning to recover from the global recession. Instead, the anthrax
outbreak has hit them hard.

"Due to the anthrax crisis, we lost more than USD 100m in our export target
in the last one-month period," says Muhammad Hai, general secretary of the
Bangladesh Tanners Association. "If this situation continues in this way,
it will be difficult for us to continue with the leather business. I am
afraid most of the tanneries will be closed."

Exporters say they are not taking any new orders from their buyers abroad
as they afraid that they will not be able to supply in time. There are more
than 200 tanneries in Bangladesh employing 70 000 people, but millions of
others, such as farmers, dairy owners and traders, are directly and
indirectly dependent on the cattle industry. However, officials are
confident that they can manage through the present anthrax outbreak.

"I think it is well contained, it is under control," says Sharful Alam,
secretary of the Department of Livestock and Fisheries. "Things will
improve further with the decision to vaccinate all the cattle in the
infected areas. "By the middle of October [2010] the total vaccination will
be completed in infected districts, so the concern of the tanneries should go."

It is estimated that almost 40 per cent of the country's annual hide
procurement will be done during the Muslim religious festival of
Eid-ul-Adha, when millions of cattle will be slaughtered as part of the
festival. The festival is less than 2 months away, so tannery owners and
exporters are anxious.

At the moment, they can only hope the anthrax outbreak will subside
gradually. Otherwise it could spell disaster for a Bangladeshi industry
worth some USD 500m to the impoverished country.
