INFLUENZA VACCINE FAILURE? REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
**************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Several weeks ago there was a posting from a physician in Wade City, VA
regarding fluviron manufactured by Evans. We have recently been through an
outbreak in the long term care facility where I work. Out of 247
individuals (residents and staff combined), 159 were affected. Eleven of
the residents died. Ten of the deaths were directly related to
flu/pneumonia. All residents had been vaccinated for influenza, and all had
had the pneumovax vaccine. Staff compliance (including volunteers,
consultants, etc.) was approximately 35% for the influenza vaccine.
Temperatures were sub-normal to 106.2 (in an 80+ year-old gentleman). The
first case occurred on 2/1 and by midnight that day there were 6 cases. On
2/2, the case load had doubled, and had tripled by 2/3.
Because we also vaccinated with fluvirion manufactured by Evans, I was
wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.
