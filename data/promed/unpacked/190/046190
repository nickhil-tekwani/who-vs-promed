Anthrax cases grow
------------------
[A dead cow was] noticed in the Zovuni district of Kotayk region on [13 Nov 2012]. Sampling was carried out and was sent [for expert analysis]. The spokesperson for the State Food Security Service Babken Pipoyan told Aysor.am today [20 Nov 2012] it was found out that the animal was infected with anthrax.

He also added that on Sunday [18 Nov 2012] in Hrazdan city there has been recorded another case of anthrax in Akunk district [possibly human this time. - Mod.MHJ]

B Pipoyan also said that the necessary measures are being carried out and the additional information will be provided later.

Cases of anthrax had been recorded in Tavush, Gegharkunik, and Armavir regions.

[To find Kotayk region, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/armenia_rel_2002.jpg. It is to the immediate north of the capital Yerevan.

Confusingly there appear to be 2 Zovuni's in Aparani Shrjan http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AM/01/Zovuni.html and http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AM/01/Zovuni2.html; and Hrazdan can be found at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AM/05/Hrazdan.html. All are in northern Kotayk.

Such an increase in anthrax outbreaks so late in the year and so widespread over Armenia -- in 4 regions -- makes me wonder whether we are seeing a livestock feed related series associated with the use of contaminated bone meal. Anthrax in Armenia is, from the official reports to OIE, a sporadic event and has been absent from reports in the last few years. Which is not to say it hasn't happened, but it does suggest that we are not witnessing a sudden surge in contaminated grazing, outside the normal summer season for this disease in livestock. - Mod.MHJ
