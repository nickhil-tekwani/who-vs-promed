Escherichia coli O157 infection and unpasteurised cream in England - update
Three recent primary cases of Vero cytotoxin producing _Escherichia coli_
(VTEC) O157 infection in south east England had consumed unpasteurised
cream from a small local farm and a further four secondary cases were
identified (1). Strains from the cases were phage type (PT) 2 and
hybridised with the Vero cytotoxin (VT) 2 gene probe. Supplies of the cream
were withdrawn from sale, distribution halted, and a pasteurisation notice
was served. The farm has now made a legal undertaking to supply only
pasteurised dairy products. VTEC O157 has not been isolated from samples of
the cream, but six swabs (all from young cattle) out of 81 swabs from the
farm obtained by the local Veterinary Investigation Centre have yielded
VTEC O157 PT 2, VT 2.
The PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens has shown that the strains
isolated from human cases and animals were all resistant to sulfonamides
and tetracycline, and further molecular studies are in progress. The
infective dose of _E. coli_ O157 is very small, and faecal contamination of
milk may be unevenly distributed, which can hinder its detection (2). The
identification in the cattle of VTEC O157 with the same properties as those
isolated from human cases offers strong microbiological support for the
epidemiological link with the farm.
