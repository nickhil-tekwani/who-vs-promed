On Tuesday, Albert Kyuregyan, chief doctor of the Russian anti-plague
center indicated Russian epidemiologists have introduced enforced security
measures in several of the North Caucasian autonomous republics, Kalmykia
and the Astrakhan region to prevent the spread of plague.
Security measures were introduced in Daghestan, Karachayevo-Cherkesia,
Kabardino-Balkaria and Kalmykia to localize natural nidi of plague abundant
in these republics, as well as in the Astrakhan region, which is bordering
on Kazakhstan, where several cases of plague have been registered recently.
At present, Russia is not threatened by plague, Kyugeryan told Itar-Tass.
"Epidemiologists control the situation around natural plague nidi in the
North Caucasus," he said, adding that increasing political tensions and
high crime rates did not affect the work of epidemiologists.
The only exception is Chechnya, where two natural plague nidi are
registered, but it is not possible to hold anti-epidemiologic works there,
Kyugeryan said.
Russian epidemiologists are constantly monitoring the country's border
regions, he continued. Special attention is given to the Astrakhan region,
which borders with Kazakhstan where 6 cases of plague have been registered
this year. These care are mostly caused by contacts with plague-infected
camels, Kyuregyan said.
According to epidemiologists, 30 million hectares of the Russian territory
are natural nidi of plague. Besides North Caucasus and Kalmykia, they are
spotted in the Astrakhan region and the Altai territory in Southern
Siberia. Most epidemiologic works are conducted 6 months a year: in spring
and in autumn, when the plague pathogen becomes active and affects rodents.
In case an epizooty of rodents is registered, specialists begin mass
anti-epidemiologic works in the whole region.
Each year, 30,000 to 40,000 Russian citizens get anti-plague vaccinations.
They are mostly geologists, cattle breeders and live-stock experts who are
most likely to be in contact with plague-infected animals. The vaccination
is valid for 6 months.
"Russia has not registered cases of plague for a very long period of time,"
Kyuregyan stressed. [The meaning of this statement is unclear, since
Astrakhan is a region of the Russian Federation. - Mod.ES The last case
occurred in Kalmykia in 1979. As to the former USSR, Middle Asian republics
registered cases of plague almost every year, he said.
