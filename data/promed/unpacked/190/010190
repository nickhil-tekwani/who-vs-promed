Scrub typhus is caused by bacteria called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. The patients who died of scrub typhus belonged to Sriganganagar, Jaipur, Dausa, Sikar and Jhunjhunu [Rajasthan state].

Scrub typhus cases reported even in summers have surprised the doctors of Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital. Even persons brought to the SMS hospital were diagnosed with scrub typhus in June. 5 such cases were reported in May and 13 were brought to the hospital in April [2016].

So far this year [2016], 5 patients have already succumbed to the disease in the hospital. In 2015, 4 patients had died. "I am surprised that cases of scrub typhus have been reported in summers. It is normally a disease of the rainy season.
