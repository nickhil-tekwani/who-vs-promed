I have read with interest the comments of Dr N. Honhold about peste des
petits ruminants (PPR) disease.
I agree with him that PPR can be overlooked officially (for economic
reasons) but is quite easy to diagnose clinically. This is true for people
who are aware of the disease. However, the clinical symptoms that Dr
Honhold has talked about are for a typical acute case. Unfortunately things
are not so simple and sometimes the symptoms don't allow [us to do a clear
diagnose clinically (subacute cases for example). Anyway, any PPR diagnosis
based on clinical signs should be considered as provisional until a
laboratory test confirmation. Indeed, clinically, PPR could [be confused
with rinderpest, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia and pasteurellosis
(this latter coexisting with PPRV infection in almost all acute cases).
Considered for a long time as a disease of West African countries, PPR is
now widespread in Africa in an area lying between Sahara and Equator, in
the Middle and in Southwest Asia. The fact that a rinderpest-like disease
was occuring in small ruminants population in countries where bovine
rinderpest was eradicated and the advent of specific diagnostic tests have
allowed [us to build up more information about PPR. The fact that our
knowledge on this disease has progressed eastwards from West Africa to Asia
doesn't mean at all that the diffusion of the virus has been in that
direction: apart from the situation in the Middle East, the animal trade
routes and the geographical distribution of the different PPRV lineages are
not correlating with the direction by which the information has grown up.
Indeed, in Cirad-emvt (Montpellier, France), an OIE Reference Laboratory
for PPR, we have a rich collection of PPRV strains collected from Africa,
the Middle East and Asia. The data we have got from partial sequencing of
NP gene of those PPRV strains (and of cDNA amplified from different PPR
pathological samples sent to us) have allowed us to define 4 main PPRV
lineages: 3 being in Africa. Both lineage III (a lineage found in East
Africa) and lineage IV (Asian lineage) are coexisting in the Middle East, a
finding which can be expected according to the animal trade routes.
In his comments, Dr Honhold has stated that the PPR case fatality in Nepal
is lower in Nepal (20-40%) than in Africa. I would like to let him known
that for PPR, the mortality is very variable (from 0% to 90%, subclinical
infection occurring very frequently). In some outbreaks in Africa, the rate
of mortality is not exceeding 20% sometimes. Animal species, animal breeds
and maybe the climate are important factors in the severity of the PPR
outbreaks.
