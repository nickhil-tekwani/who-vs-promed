Thus far in 2012, 43 states have reported West Nile virus [WNV] infections in people, birds, or mosquitoes. A total of 693 cases of West Nile virus disease in people, including 26 deaths, have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of these, 406 (59 per cent) were classified as neuro-invasive disease (such as meningitis or encephalitis), and 287 (41 per cent) were classified as non-neuro-invasive disease.

The 693 cases reported thus far in 2012 are the highest number of West Nile virus disease cases reported to CDC through the 2nd week of the month of August since West Nile virus was 1st detected in the United States in 1999. Over 80 per cent of the cases have been reported from 6 states (Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and California), and almost half of all cases have been reported from Texas.

[This report does not offer reasons why human WNV infections are occurring early in the transmission season. Many states are experiencing drought conditions this summer [2012], which would lead one to postulate that WNV mosquito populations ought to be lower than usual, with reduced probability of transmission. Or perhaps the susceptible cohort of wild bird WNV host populations is greater than usual. Or perhaps people are being less careful about avoiding mosquito bites. It will be interesting to see which factors are involved in this spike in cases as studies are completed. It will also be interesting to learn how many patients convalescent from WNV infections develop chronic kidney disease, as reported in ProMED-mail archive no. 20120714.1202043 below.
