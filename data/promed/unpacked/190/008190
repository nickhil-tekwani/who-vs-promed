Revision of the International Health Regulations: Progress Report, July
1997
The International Health Regulations (IHR) are being revised in accordance
with a resolution adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1995...The
purpose of the revision is to develop IHR which are adapted to the present
volume of international traffic and trade and take account of current
trends in the epidemiology of communicable diseases, including emerging
disease threats... In renewing the IHR, the original fundamental principle
- to ensure maximum security against the international spread of diseases
with minimum interference with world
traffic and trade - will be retained. Furthermore, many of the public
health provisions of the current IHR remain valid at the present time and
for the foreseeable future, and will be included in the revised IHR.
However, important changes are proposed under the revised IHR, involving a
new approach to mandatory notification as well as a major alteration in the
structure of the IHR, as follows:
(a) Notification... the revised IHR will require immediate reporting of a
number of defined disease syndromes that are of international importance.
This will facilitate timely notification, which would normally be followed
by specific disease reporting once the diagnosis has been confirmed. It
will also provide for reporting of disease outbreaks of unknown origin
where a potential hazard to international travel or trade is identified.
The syndromes, which will be notifiable only in cases where an
international threat is involved, include
haemorrhagic fever, acute respiratory, acute gastrointestinal and
neurological syndromes as well as a category covering other undefined
syndromes of presumed infectious origin. The precise definitions of the
syndromes, to ensure appropriate levels of sensitivity and specificity for
reporting purposes, are the subject of international consultation at the
present time.
(b) Structure of the revised IHR - The proposed structure for the revised
IHR will take the form of:
- a framework document consisting of core provisions, as an enabling basis
for the adoption of national legislation, and
- a separate series of annexes describing technical provisions and specific
requirements and forming otherwise an integral part of the IHR.
For example, the IHR framework will stipulate appropriate measures that
should be taken for the management and control of syndromes or diseases
subject to the Regulations; the appropriate measures to eliminate or reduce
animal hosts or vectors of disease subject to the Regulations; measures
that may be taken to disinsect aircraft leaving an airport in an area where
mosquito-borne disease occurs using internationally approved procedures. In
all such instances, the technical details of the measures to be taken will
be described in detail in the annexes. The annexes will be subject to
regular review and will be updated as
necessary. Thus, this new structure for the IHR will provide basic
regulations of a generic nature which should remain valid for many years...

The next progress report will be published in January 1998.
CDPC Note: These are very important and long overdue revisions of the IHR.
With all of the interest and priority that has been given to emerging
infectious diseases, it is hoped that a workable and internationally
acceptable set of IHR can be developed.
