The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services [VDACS] today [26 Sep 2014] announced 2014's 1st positive case of West Nile virus (WNV) in a horse. The horse, an 8-year-old Paint Gelding, is from Augusta County. It had not been vaccinated for WNV.

Dr. Joe Garvin, head of VDACS' Office of Laboratory Services, urges horse owners to check with their veterinarians about vaccinating their animals for WNV. "WNV is a mosquito-borne disease," he said, "and we generally start seeing our 1st cases in August and September. The disease is preventable by vaccination, as is Eastern equine encephalitis, so many veterinarians recommend vaccination at least yearly, and in mosquito-prone areas, every 6 months." He adds that mosquito season in Virginia can run through November.

The WNV vaccine for equines initially requires 2 doses administered 3 to 6 weeks apart. The vaccine takes 4 to 6 weeks from the 2nd dose for optimal effectiveness. Horse owners should consult with their veterinarians to choose a re-vaccination schedule to protect their horses effectively. Prevention methods besides vaccination include destroying standing water breeding sites for mosquitoes, use of insect repellents and removing animals from mosquito-infested areas during peak biting times, usually dusk to dawn.

Mosquitoes can transmit the virus from bird to bird. Occasionally a mosquito that has bitten an infected bird will then bite a human, horse or other mammal and transmit the virus to them. Transmission between horses and humans is extremely unlikely. Continuous, effective mosquito control can minimize the risk of exposure of both horses and humans to mosquito-borne diseases.

Currently, no drugs exist to treat WNV specifically in horses or humans. The mortality rate in equines is about 30 percent. Treatment for an infected horse consists of supportive therapy to prevent the animal from injuring itself throughout the 2 to 3 weeks of the disease. A veterinarian can prescribe treatment tailored to the particular case.

Animal owners should consult their veterinarians if an animal exhibits any neurological signs such as a stumbling gait, going down, facial paralysis, drooping or disinterest in their surroundings. Currently, there are live-animal tests for WNV in horses and chickens, but none for other animals, although testing can be done on any dead animal. Animal owners should consult their veterinarians or the nearest VDACS Regional Animal Health Laboratory for advice or information should an animal exhibit signs of WNV.

The location and phone number of each lab is available at http://vdacs.virginia.gov/about/directory-ais.shtml.

[So many diseases are so easily preventable with a vaccination.

West Nile virus, like Eastern equine encephalitis, is preventable by a vaccine, as mentioned in the article. The 2 are usually in combination, so it is only a single injection to prevent these diseases. Admittedly, injection needs to be given an initial time and again about 21-30 days later. Then it should be given annually or every 6 months depending upon your location or the recommendation of your veterinarian.

West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of arbovirus encephalitis in horses and humans in the United States. Since 1999, over 25 000 cases of WNV encephalitis have been reported in US horses. Horses represent 96.9 percent of all reported non-human mammalian cases of WNV disease.

This virus has been identified in all of the continental US, most of Canada and Mexico. Several Central and South American countries have also identified WNV within their borders. The virus is transmitted from avian reservoir hosts by mosquitoes (and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects) to horses, humans and a number of other mammals. WNV is transmitted by many different mosquito species and this varies geographically. The virus and mosquito host interactions result in regional change in virulence of the virus and no prediction can be made regarding future trends in local activity of the viruses. Horses and humans are considered to be dead-end hosts for WNV; the virus is not directly contagious from horse to horse or horse to human. Indirect transmission via mosquitoes from infected horses is highly unlikely as these horses do not circulate a significant amount of virus in their blood.

The case fatality rate for horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV infection is approximately 33 percent. Data have supported that 40 percent of horses that survive the acute illness caused by WNV still exhibit residual effects, such as gait and behavioral abnormalities, 6 months post-diagnosis. Thus vaccination for WNV is recommended as a core vaccine and is an essential standard of care for all horses in North America.
