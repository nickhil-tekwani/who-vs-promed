A Saitama Prefecture special committee discovered Saturday that a public
health center in the prefecture that mistakenly ordered the recall of three
ham and sausage products believed to be contaminated with the O157 strain
of _E. coli_ bacteria accidentally tainted the product samples during the
inspection process.
Based on an analysis of the DNA patterns of the bacteria, the special
committee on O157 contamination determined that the food products were
contaminated with O157 bacteria at the Kawagoe Public Health Center when a
vessel containing the bacteria was opened during the inspection.
The committee suspected that proper measures were not taken to prevent a
fine spray of bacteria entering the food products being tested nearby when
the cap of the vessel was removed.
The committee concluded that the contamination occurred during the
inspection process because the bacteria detected in the food products were
identical to the bacteria in the vessel.
The committee said sufficient attention was not paid to the inspection
process, and that the prefectural government should take steps to ensure
that such an accident never happens again.

[This sounds like an expensive laboratory error. In a separate report
submitted by Dr. Goto, officials of the Tochiku Ham Co. which distributed
the recalled meat products were reported to be "roasting with anger".
Understandable. This thread is cut. - Mod.ES
