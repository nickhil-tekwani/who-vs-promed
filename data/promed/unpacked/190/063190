National Microbiology Center of Majadahonda (Madrid) with the 'Carlos III' Health Institute (computer translated) has confirmed the presence of the Crimean-Congo virus in the samples sent corresponding to a male who died on Tue 11 Aug [2020] at the Complex University Assistance of Salamanca.

The 69-year-old patient had been admitted to the ICU of the Salamanca Clinic on Mon 10 Aug [2020], after going to the Hospital 'Nuestra Senora del Castanar' in Bejar, due to the worsening of the nonspecific symptoms that, days before, he had referred in a home consultation and for which he was in treatment.

In the hospital center, a blackish lesion is observed on one of his legs, in view of what his family environment reports that they had seen him remove a tick the week before.

Faced with this situation, as soon as the suspicion of a possible case of Crimean-Congo virus infection was established, Public Health, and in coordination with the healthcare field, set up the protocol of action and coordination between the national and regional health authorities, with the sending of the analyzes that have given positive results to the FHCC and the adoption of the appropriate protection measures for health professionals.

The Epidemiology Section of the Territorial Health Service of the Junta de Castilla y Leon, in collaboration with the health professionals of the Salamanca University Assistance Complex, has identified the contacts of the affected person to indicate the follow-up to be carried out; in close contact, this consists of periodically monitoring your body temperature and communicating any change in your health status to your reference epidemiologist.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by a virus, the main transmission mechanism of which is the bite of the tick of the genus _Hyalomma_, although it can also be transmitted from person to person through contact with blood or fluids of the patient, especially among healthcare personnel if they are not properly protected.

The general directorate of public health of the Junta de Castilla y Leon maintains information available to the population and health professionals on risks in order to avoid new infections as much as possible.

Regarding the prevention of tick bites, the health authorities recall the importance of wearing appropriate clothing and footwear during field trips, as well as traveling on the roads and using repellants for both people and pets. Likewise, we must insist that the ticks that may have been fixed must be removed as soon as possible and in an appropriate way, preferably by health professionals.

This was the 2nd case of CCHF reported in Spain this year [2020]. On 11 Jun 2020, public health authorities in the autonomous community of Castile-Leon reported a confirmed case of CCHF. The case was bitten by a tick at the end of May [2020] in Salamanca province and developed compatible symptoms in the days that followed.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is considered an emerging or even a probable re-emerging pathogen in southern Europe. Presence of this virus had been reported previously in Spain in 2010.

On 8 Aug 2018, a locally acquired fatal case of Crimean-Congo virus infection was reported from Castile and Leon in a 74-year-old male associated with a tick bite (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/spain-locally-acquired-crimean-congo-hemorrhagic-fever-case-reported-castile-leon-19612/).

Evidence of the virus circulation in Castile-Leon province in western Spain has been reported by Arteaga et al. in a 2017-2018 study with CCHFV seroprevalence of between 0.58% and 1.16% in healthy people (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.1900507).

Transmission potential of CCHF in potential hot spots can be reduced by timely identification of the disease and implementation of barrier-protection and patient-isolation practices. The risk of further human-to-human transmission in hospital settings can be significantly reduced by applying timely appropriate infection prevention and control measures.

Furthermore, enhanced awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and laboratory confirmation should be emphasized among healthcare providers in areas with potential circulation of CCHF virus. Standard precautions, preferably combined with contact and droplet precautionary measures, should be taken when caring for patients presenting with haemorrhagic fever syndrome. Laboratory tests on patient samples present a high risk of transmission and should only be conducted under appropriate biological containment conditions.

As a precautionary measure, risk groups should be informed about the mode of transmission and urged to comply with advice on the prevention of tick bites. In order to better target preventive measures and raise clinical awareness, areas with CCHF virus circulation and areas suitable for CCHF circulation should be defined by multidisciplinary investigations and surveillance. - Mod.UBA
