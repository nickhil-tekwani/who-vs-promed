A 73-year-old Massachusetts [man] is suffering from eastern equine
encephalitis [EEE], the 1st time in 2 years that a Bay State resident
has been diagnosed with the highly lethal mosquito-borne illness,
state health authorities announced this afternoon [27 Oct 2008].

The Essex County man, whose identity was not disclosed because of
patient privacy laws, developed symptoms 21 Sep [2008] while
vacationing in Maine. During the 2 weeks before falling ill, the man
had traveled extensively in Maine and New Hampshire, enjoying the outdoors.

While it is impossible to determine where the man was exposed to the
viral disease, Massachusetts health authorities said, it appears
likely he caught the illness in another state.

After being hospitalized for several weeks in Maine, the man was
transferred to a Massachusetts hospital, where his prognosis remains
guarded, state disease trackers said. Eastern equine [encephalitis]
is the deadliest of the diseases [viruses] spread by mosquitoes,
killing up to half of people who develop symptoms. From 2004 through
2006, 13 Massachusetts residents contracted the virus, resulting in 6 deaths.

With the arrival of cooler autumn weather, the threat of
mosquito-borne illnesses [viruses] such as eastern equine
encephalitis and West Nile viruses has significantly subsided. Still,
until the 1st hard frost, disease specialists recommend that to avoid
being bitten, limit outdoor activity from dusk to dawn, peak time for
mosquito activity. If outdoor activity is necessary during those
hours, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks can provide protection.

Repellants can help, too, including DEET, permethrin, picaridin, or
oil of lemon eucalyptus, health authorities said. DEET should not be
used on babies younger than 2 months and should be used in
concentrations of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon
eucalyptus should not be used on children under the age of 3 years.

Draining standing water from gutters, unused flower pots, and wading
pools can deprive mosquitoes of necessary breeding grounds. And
having secure window screens can prevent the bugs from getting inside
homes. [Entomologically, mosquitoes are not "bugs," they are diptera. - Mod.TY]

[Massachusetts recorded 35 confirmed and probable EEE human cases
from 1964 through 2007, whereas New Hampshire and Maine, the other
states where the victim traveled, have recorded 11 and no human cases
respectively over the same period (data from the US CDC
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/pdf/EEE_DOC.pdf>, although
Maine had an equine case in September 2008 (see ProMED archive no.
20080923.2996).

New Hampshire had a human case in August 2008 (see ProMED archive no.
20070821.2728). Thus, it is possible that the man was infected in
Massachusetts (least likely time-wise), New Hampshire, or in Maine.
With the onset of cold weather in these states, EEE virus
transmission should now have come to a halt. Essentially the same
story by Alice C Elwell appeared in Enterprise News.com
(<http://www.enterprisenews.com/news/x1197761642/State-sees-first-human-case-of-EEE>).
