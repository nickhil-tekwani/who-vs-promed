A potentially fatal _E. coli_ outbreak in London has grown to 72
suspected cases and shows no signs of stopping. It has left at
least one child with kidney damage.
There are still 5 confirmed cases of the aggressive bacterial
superbug that has struck a local day-care center. The outbreak is
believed to have stemmed from contact with animals in the
agricultural pavilion at last month's Western Fair. A cow has been
isolated and is being tested for the bacteria.
Associate medical officer of health Bryna Warshawsky said 179
calls have been received about _E. coli_ 0157:H7 Â¯ a strain that
can take from 3 to 8 days to turn into symptoms such as bloody
diarrhea and abdominal cramps.
It is transmitted by fecal-oral contact and is found in the intestines
and manure of cattle and other livestock.
One 9-year-old boy who visited the petting zoo and spent 9 days in
the hospital had to receive 4 blood transfusions and had kidney
damage.
Environmental health director James Reffle of the Middlesex-London
[Ontario Health Unit said investigating is tough because the fair
took place weeks ago and the bug could have been transmitted a
"limitless" number of times by now. "It's not like an outbreak of
influenza in a nursing home where you can say, 'OK, we have this
many cases, now close down the ward.' "
Warshawsky advises anyone with symptoms to get tested.
