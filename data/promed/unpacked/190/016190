Romanian and European authorities are on alert after the
avian flu virus was confirmed in Romania. The samples
indicative of the virus' presence in the 3 dead birds at
Ceamurlia de Jos, Tulcea County, will however be sent for
confirmation by expert laboratories in the UK [see further
comment below].
The European Commission met in an emergency meeting Thu, 13
Oct 2005, whose 1st measure was to ban imports of live birds
and poultry from Romania.
Meanwhile, the slaughtering of the birds from certain areas
in Tulcea County carried on, and quarantine measures taken
by authorities have been stepped up. Expert doctors did not
rule out that the residents of Ceamurlia might have come
into contact with the virus, yet no such case has been
reported. It is however reassuring to know that the avian
flu virus is not transmitted from human to human but only
from the sick birds to humans.
Authorities urged population to stay calm, but also asked
people to comply with the minimum of hygienic measures, to
avoid purchasing poultry from unauthorised sources and to
take antiviral medicines.
The National Audiovisual Council (CAN) also called on radio
and television stations to broadcast information from
authorised sources to avoid creating panic among the
population.
The European Commission banned Thursday the imports of live
birds and poultry from Romania. Brussels made the
announcement Wednesday night, which then was reported by
press agencies. The 3 European experts that the EC sent to
Bucharest confirmed that the H5 virus of the avian influenza
was found in the Romanian samples. The embargo comes a day
after European experts said the test results in Romania were
negative. [again, see further comment below].
The risks of the bird flu spreading in Romania are small,
say experts of the European Commission who came to Romania.
"Given that the virus emerged in a small locality, where
locals do not buy birds from outside their community,
chances of the disease spreading are smaller compared with
what would be in a similar case in western Europe," says
Danish expert Jorgen Westergaard.
The European Commission has announced it will provide
assistance to Romania in eliminating the bird flu focus at
Lower Ceamurlia.
Fowl farmers are claiming that the contradictory information
regarding the existence of the bird flu in Romania has
triggered a fall of 40 per cent in the sales of fowl and
products, although the risks of an epidemic are minimal as
long as the population eats only tested meat.
The same farmers are warning that the confirmation of the
bird flu virus does not mean there is a pandemic. "There is
talk of a pandemic only when this virus has undergone some
mutations, when the mutated DNA of it further replicates. If
there are deficiencies in the replication process, there
will be equally odds of the virus being pathogenic or
non-pathogenic for humans," Chairman of the Union of
Romanian Fowl Farmers Ilie Van told a conference on Thursday
about the measures against and the consequences of the bird
flu.
Romanian authorities confirmed late Wednesday night into the
early hours of Thursday the existence of the avian influenza
virus in Romania. Veterinary experts succeeded to isolate
the virus 6 days after identifying the viral antibodies in
the samples taken from the dead birds at Ceamurlia de Jos,
Tulcea County. [This piece of information, repeatedly
published by the Romanians, will need explanation. Were the
antibodies against H5? Could the birds/geese have died from
other cause/s? - Mod.AS]
The BBC reports it is the 1st time that the avian flu has
been discovered in Europe, since the virus had originated
and spread through South East Asia. The samples taken from
the geese in Ceamurlia de Jos proved positive for the H5
virus. Still, whether this is the subtype N1 that had been
transmitted to humans and killed 50 people in Asia is yet to
be proved.
The samples will be sent for analysis to expert laboratories
in the UK, whose confirmation is expected in a few days. The
lab tests sent to UK will clearly indicate whether the virus
suspected in Romania is the same as the one detected in
Asia, and also if it is highly or slightly pathogenic. [The
continued confusion about the fate of the said samples and
the test results is puzzling. A Romanian statement of 8 Oct
2005 said that samples were sent by them to the EU/OIE
Reference laboratory in Weybridge; this was refuted by the
laboratory, who stated that their experts were due to arrive
in Romania on Tue, 12 Oct 2005, to take samples. On 13 Oct
2005, several hours after a Romanian newswire saying that
the samples were found negative by EU experts, the EU
Commission officially announced that "its experts had
detected the H5 virus strain in 2 samples taken in a
suspected backyard farm in the Danube delta, while further
tests were necessary to ascertain if the virus in question
is the H5N1 strain". In addition, a statement of Defra,
dated 13 Oct 2005, said that "results from further tests to
find out the exact strain of (the Romanian H5) virus will be
available in a few days"; see
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/latest/2005/animal-1013.htm>.
Clarification will help. - Mod.AS]
Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur said that measures had
been taken to completely isolate the village in Tulcea
County, and that European officials have also been informed
that the virus had been confirmed.
The bird flu does not spread by human contact, and it is
caught only through direct contact with infected birds.
Doctors assure that the virus only passes from contaminated
animals to humans and not from human to human, but they are
warning about the danger of the emergence of a crossbred
virus between bird flu and a human influenza virus.
Meanwhile, birds continue being slaughtered in the area of
Ceamurlia de Jos, with local authorities asking for more
staff to take care of the action. "All the birds at
Ceamurlia de Jos and within a radius of 3 kilometres around
the village are being slaughtered," said the Agriculture
minister. Authorities in Tulcea requested the sending in the
area of expert chemical weapons troops, to avoid
veterinarians from becoming overworked, and to allow bird
slaughtering to continue at a fast pace.
Meanwhile, neighbouring counties stepped up the safety
measures. Teams made up of border police and representatives
of the Braila Veterinary Department (DSV) beefed up the road
blocks at the Bac Smardan crossing point that connects the
county to the neighbouring county of Tulcea. All the
vehicles crossing the Danube and entering the municipality
through that point are inspected and disinfected with a
special pump installed at the Bac crossing point.
Also, all ship captains received written advisories against
transporting birds and animals from Tulcea. Similar safety
measures have also been taken at the Small Island of Braila
County, which is on the list of places with a high risk of
avian flu, given its opening to the Danube and the large
number of migratory birds that take shelter here each year.
Authorities in Constanta have also been on alert in the
northern part of the Constanta County, at the border with
the Tulcea County, where they are conducting preventive,
disinfection, and control measures. The dead body of a
pelican was found on Wednesday night on a field between
Mangalia and Albesti. Given the bird's advanced state of
decomposition, no samples have been taken. There are also
signals that hundreds of birds had died in the village of
Silistea over the past few weeks, yet the deaths went
unreported.
Answering a request for medicines by Romania's Health
Minister, Eugen Nicolaescu, the representatives of the World
Health Organisation (WHO) agreed to supply, at no charge,
1000 of the 5000 doses of antiviral medicines the government
needs for the preventive treatment of the population that
came into contact with the identified focus of avian flu.
A special commission was set up at the Health Ministry on
Thursday. The chairmen of the Ministry's expert commissions
for infectious diseases and epidemiology respectively, have
also been convened. During the next few days, the Health
Ministry will be made available 25 000 doses of antiviral
medicine. In about 10 days, the ministry emergency stock
will be supplemented by another 20 000 doses.
Health minister Eugen Nicolaescu said that aside from the
protection offered by the ministry, "citizens need to know 3
basic things: firstly, to wash their hands with water and
soap, secondly, to only purchase poultry and egg from
authorised sources, namely veterinary-certified stores, and
thirdly, to keep away from dead birds or birds that had come
in contact with dead birds".
The National Audiovisual Council (CNA) requested the radio
and TV channels to avoid speculations over the bird flu, and
give priority to the official information, in order to avoid
alarming the population. CNA requests the radio companies to
not enhance the concern of the people and the speculations,
to show responsibility and to use insomuch as possible the
opinion of the specialists in their programmes. CNA recalls
that mass media have the obligation to check the information
from their own sources and from occasional collaborators,
comparing it with the data furnished by the competent
authorities, before transmitting news or points of view
which can generate panic.

9 people are under medical observation in Turkey after
reports of 40 pigeons in their neighbourhood died in
mysterious circumstances. All 9 are from Manisa, which is
close to the village where the fatal H5N1 strain of bird flu
was identified this week. The 9 are being monitored as "a
precaution", officials said.
The news comes as EU veterinary officers begin an emergency
meeting to discuss measures to contain bird flu.
The H5N1 strain of avian flu has killed more than 60 people
in South East Asia since 2003. Those who have been in the
presence of dead or dying birds are most likely to become
infected, and the chances of human-to-human transmission are
still seen as very slim.
In Turkey, around 8600 birds were culled this week in and
around the village of Kiziksa, in the neighbouring province
to Manisa.
The Anatolia news agency reported samples from the dead
pigeons have been sent for testing in Izmir, western Turkey.
There have been several other reports of unexplained bird
deaths in the country, but except for those in Kiziksa, none
has been confirmed as bird flu.
Osman Ozturk, deputy head of the Manisa health department,
said: "There is no sign of illness in the 9 people." He said
they were put under medical observation simply as a
precaution while their house was being disinfected.
Scientists fear that the bird flu virus could mutate into a
human pandemic strain if people suffering normal human flu
are also infected with the H5N1 type.
European Union health commissioner Markos Kyprianou
confirmed on Thursday that the virus found in the Turkish
village of Kiziksa was the deadly strain, adding: "There is
a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia,
Mongolia, and China." He went on: "It is a highly pathogenic
and aggressive virus and we in the European Union have to
deal with that."
The EU veterinary officers meeting in Brussels will look at
measures to try to reduce the chance of contact between wild
birds and poultry in high-risk areas, which could include
requiring some poultry to be kept inside.
A separate EU meeting of bird flu experts is expected to
issue advice on the potential risk for humans who come into
contact with migratory birds.
EU foreign ministers are also to hold emergency talks on the
bird flu threat on Tuesday [18 Oct 2005] when they meet in
Luxembourg for WTO negotiations.
Turkish authorities have urged calm, amid reports of people
flocking to pharmacies to buy Tamiflu (oseltamivir), the
antiviral believed to be most effective against bird flu.
Health minister Recep Akdag said the situation was "under
control", adding that Ankara was prepared for any possible
flu pandemic. Pharmacies in Romania have also reported a big
surge in demand for vaccines against common flu.
The EU moved to ban all bird and poultry products from
Romania on Thursday after tests on 3 ducks which died last
week in the Danube delta confirmed the presence of the H5
strain of bird flu. Tests for the H5N1 strain are expected
to be completed on the ducks on Friday. The EU has also
banned the import of live birds and feathers from Turkey
until April 2006.
The H5N1 strain remained largely in South-East Asia until
this summer, when Russia and Kazakhstan both reported
outbreaks. Scientists fear it may be carried by migrating
birds to Europe and Africa but say it is hard to prove a
direct link with bird migration

People should not panic after the discovery of a deadly form
of avian flu among birds in Turkey, the UK government has
said. The Department of Health stressed its advice on who
should be vaccinated against flu was unchanged. It said
vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and some children, to
have the seasonal flu jab as normal. EU veterinary officers
are holding an emergency meeting in Brussels to discuss
measures to contain bird flu.
People in the UK with weak immune systems, such as children
with asthma or diabetes, have long been advised to have an
annual jab to protect them against flu. "I don't think, at
this stage, the public should feel they are under a
different threat than before," said Dr David Salisbury, head
of immunisation at the Department of Health.
Since the H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has killed 60
people in South East Asia, was confirmed in birds in Turkey
on Thu, 13 Oct 2005, concern has risen about the UK's plans
to contain any outbreak here.
News of the outbreak in north west Turkey came after avian
flu was also confirmed in ducks in Romania. The EU said
those cases were assumed to be the same strain. Samples of
the dead birds were sent from Turkey and Romania to the UK
for laboratory analysis.
David Salisbury, head of immunisation at the Department of
Health, told BBC News that people in identified groups,
including the elderly, children with conditions such as
diabetes or asthma, and others who had weakened immune
systems should get the seasonal flu vaccination as normal.
But he added: "The currently available vaccine is for people
vulnerable to flu, but will not protect them against an
emerging pandemic strain."
The government orders around 14 million doses of flu vaccine
for the annual vaccination campaign again seasonal
influenza. But Dr Salisbury said experts were planning for
the eventuality of bird flu mutating to spread between
humans. "The risk is very real, we're very aware of what's
happening in South East Asia and are monitoring very
carefully the spread of disease amongst birds. We're
watching very carefully for cases in humans, and the
presence of bird disease in Europe of course raises
everybody's anxieties."
Dr Salisbury said the UK public should not feel the dangers
from bird flu had increased, following the emergence of bird
flu in Turkey. "I don't think, at this stage, the public
should feel they are under a different threat than before."
But he said the developments in Turkey would be considered
in UK preparations. He said developing a vaccine would take
3-5 months, and could only be undertaken once the strain of
any virus causing a pandemic was identified.
This time delay was the reason the UK was stockpiling
antiviral drugs to treat symptoms if they emerged, Dr
Salisbury said. The government has ordered 14.6 million
doses of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. This would be enough
for 25 per cent of the population -- the proportion the
World Health Organization predicts would be affected in a
pandemic. "Normal" flu affects 5-10 per cent of the
population.
The UK government said plans were also in place to contain
the spread of avian flu among wild and domestic birds. But
the National Farmers' Union has expressed concern that
public fears over the virus could damage chicken and poultry
sales -- even though the virus cannot be passed on through
eating chicken.
Meanwhile EU specialists are meeting to discuss new measures
to stop bird flu spreading in Europe after the outbreaks in
Turkey. The European Commission has already banned the
import of live birds, poultry and feathers from Romania.
EU veterinary officers are also holding emergency meetings
to explore measures to reduce the chance of contact between
poultry and wild birds in high risk areas.

Over the last few weeks, many birdwatchers will have become
aware of considerable media interest in the subject of avian
influenza or 'bird flu', following outbreaks in central Asia
and the Black Sea region of the highly pathogenic type of
the H5N1 virus strain which developed within poultry.
Representatives of BTO (British Trust for Ornithology), WWT
(Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust), RSPB (Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds), and JNCC (The Joint Nature
Conservation Committee = UK Government's wildlife adviser)
have been involved in discussions with the relevant
government agencies, principally to advise on the latest
knowledge of the origins of birds wintering in the UK,
migration routes and timing, and bird distributions within
the UK. Such information is derived in large part from the
hard work of volunteers working on schemes such as the BTO
Ringing Scheme and the BTO/WWT/RSPB/JNCC Wetland Bird Survey
(WeBS). We have also remained in close contact with
international colleagues.
The overall assessment is that the chance of this strain of
the virus being carried to the UK by a migrating bird is
currently low (and perhaps much less than the chance of
transmission via illegally imported poultry). In addition,
even if the highly pathogenic form of H5N1 avian influenza
did make it to the UK, it is important to note that there
are no known cases of transmission from wild birds to
humans. In South East Asia, the virus has spread
(infrequently) to humans as a result of people coming into
close contact with infected poultry within the context of
the confined proximities of poultry farms. Thus, the risk to
human health from wild birds carrying avian influenza would
currently appear to be very low.
Nevertheless, it is clearly sensible to keep the situation
under review. A number of organisations are working together
to deliver a national surveillance programme for wild birds
on behalf of Defra; for further details see
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/index.htm>.
This will include enhanced monitoring for sick or dead
birds, coupled with a programme of taking faecal samples
from a) apparently healthy live birds, and b) birds shot as
part of legal wildfowling activities. As part of this
process, we would ask birdwatchers in the field to keep an
eye out for any suspicious cases of large-scale mortality or
sickness among wild birds.
Waterbirds are potentially among the most vulnerable wild
birds. Obviously, all birdwatchers encounter dead birds
occasionally, almost all due to perfectly natural causes, so
use your common sense. However, if you should come across an
incident that seems out of the ordinary, this should be
reported via the Defra Helpline on 08459 335577. Calls would
then be referred to more local laboratories. Specialists at
the labs would then make an assessment on what further
action, if any, should be taken.
Although there have been no proven cases of humans catching
the disease from wild birds, the virus is spread through
nasal secretions and faeces, so please do not touch sick
birds or carcasses in the event of a suspicious die-off.
Note that separate guidelines have been provided to ringers
and these will be made available to anyone else who
regularly handles wild birds. In general, however, to guard
against a wide variety of illness including avian influenza
it is always prudent to exercise basic hygiene (such as
washing hands with soap, especially before eating) when
coming into close contact with wild animals.
At a time when there is a lot of misinformation circulating
on this issue, it is essential to keep matters in
perspective and to sift fact from fiction. We reiterate
that, to the best of our current knowledge, we consider the
chance of wild birds bringing highly pathogenic H5N1 to the
UK to be low and the potential for onward transmission from
wild birds to people to be very low. Obviously, however, we
are continuing to monitor the situation and if there are any
further developments we will communicate these widely, in
the first instance via organisational websites.

[The advice to birdwatchers provided in the common statement
of the 4 British ornithology-related organisations, includes
information and instructions which are currently useful for
birdwatchers anywhere. They are applicable in the many other
countries -- particularly in Europe and the Middle East --
which have recently intensified the surveillance in wild and
migrating birds. This has become particularly important in
view of the following new OIE press release. - Mod.AS]

At the request of the Russian authorities the World
Organisation for Animal Health sent a team of worldwide
renowned experts in avian influenza and ornithology to
Siberia in order to assess the avian influenza situation in
the region (see OIE press release of 4 Oct 2005].
The complete Mission Report of this scientific mission will
be available online in the Highlights of the OIE website
this afternoon(<http://www.oie.int>).
One of the main conclusions of the report is that in certain
conditions migratory birds could carry the Asian H5N1
influenza virus to other parts of the world. The migratory
routes of these potentially infected wild birds are mainly
directed to the Caspian Sea, the Middle East, and Africa. A
number of these birds could rest during the migration or
migrate to western Europe.
Facing the current and potential evolution of the Avian
influenza spread, the OIE confirms its position about the
priority of eliminating the virus at the animal source,
emphasizing the importance of the early detection and rapid
response mechanisms carried out by Veterinary Services in
countries at risk.
