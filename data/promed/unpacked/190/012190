Veterinary Services have started FMD vaccination in 3 governorates
------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Essam Abdel Shakur, head of the central Information and Extension Service Department at the Head Office of the General Organisation of Veterinary Services [GOVS], Ministry of Agriculture, has announced that FMD vaccination has started. The vaccine used is new, produced locally by the vaccine plant in Abbassiyah [Serum and Vaccine Laboratory, Ministry of Agriculture] jointly with the Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines ('VACSERA'; Ministry of Health). This vaccine has already been found to be more effective than an imported vaccine, as observed in 3 governorates: Al-Ismailia, New Valley (Al Wadi Al-Jadid), and Al-Buhayrah. Dr Abdel Shakur said that all livestock would be vaccinated against diseases which are present in Egypt -- namely FMD serotypes A, O, and SAT2, and Rift Valley fever [RVF; see comment].

He added that, in the initial phase, 600 000 doses of the locally produced vaccine have been distributed in 11 provinces [governorates], out of the 2 million doses planned. Abdel Shakur described the special efforts exercised to educate and guide the Egyptian animal holders about the importance of implementing security measures which are essential to prevent the spread of the SAT-2 virus to healthy uninfected animals or into yet-uninfected locations and to control the disease.

A source in the Veterinary Services informed 'Al-Youm Al-Sabah' that the veterinary services have decided to carry out the vaccination in the various provinces following observations showing that post-vaccination swelling at the site of injection disappears after 4 days. The Veterinary Services advised the vaccine producers to include the information on the possible occurrence of 4-day swelling on the vaccine's use instructions, to avoid panicking of smallholders.

The vaccine has been released for field use following safety tests during the initial experimental phase.

[Manufacturing an FMD vaccine from a new virus strain and within a timeframe of probably less than 2 months, should have required maximised efforts and deserves appreciation. Hopefully, the product is protective and side effects (such as the described 4-day swelling; adjuvant-related?) are bearable and minimal, to secure the essential cooperation and trust of the farmers.

Mentioning the vaccination against RVF to be combined with the FMD vaccination in Egypt is briefly discussed in ProMED-mail posting 20120410.1096341. It will be interesting to note if the Egyptian animal health authorities suspect current circulation of the RVF virus on top of the FMDV SAT2 virus. It would also be interesting to note if the RVF vaccine, currently applied, is the live attenuated (Smithburn) vaccine, widely used in Egypt since 1993, or a killed vaccine. A live vaccine cannot be mixed with a killed vaccine (such as the FMD vaccine), though both can be applied simultaneously by separate injections. Killed vaccines can be combined in a multivalent preparation.

The potential adverse effects of live RVF vaccines are long known; their use in non-endemic areas is generally not recommended. The Egyptian aspects of the issue have been recently reviewed and discussed (reference below; thanks to Dr Dany Shoham for bringing the paper to our attention).
