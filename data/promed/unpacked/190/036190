Request for clarification

First, thank you for sharing the statements and background provided by the Centers for Disease Control. There is one concerning section in the middle of the email which is troubling because it is factually inaccurate. The statement reads:

"The probability is that the infection was contracted outside of the USA and most likely during residence in the UK. In the absence of a link with any of the countries recording vCJD cases, it might mean that the BSE prion is present in cattle in Texas."

Neither the CDC nor the Texas Department of State Health Services has made any statements about BSE prions in US cattle. In the CDC's statement, which you have in your email, they clearly state that there have been vCJD cases reported in other countries:
"Worldwide, more than 220 variant CJD patients have been reported, with a majority of them in the United Kingdom (177 cases) and France (27 cases)." According to CDC, other cases have also been reported in Spain, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. The history of this 4th patient, including extensive travel to Europe and the Middle East, supports the likelihood that infection occurred outside the United States."

We want to ensure the most accurate and reliable information is available to the public. Thank you for your consideration in making the clarification.

[ProMED-mail has received several letters of concern suggesting that the moderator deviated from the CDC report on vCJD by mentioning the very unlikely possibility that if the disease was not acquired abroad, that it could have been acquired in the US. His statement, "The probability is that the infection was contracted outside of the USA and most likely during residence in the UK" and the CDC report, "The history of this 4th patient, including extensive travel to Europe and the Middle East, supports the likelihood that infection occurred outside the United States," agree. While no one (neither the CDC nor ProMED-mail) believes that the infection occurred in the US, and there is nothing to suggest that it did, there is no way of categorically ruling out that theoretical possibility.

ProMED-mail has and will always encourage responsible dialog and differences in opinion, but here all opinions are that the infection occurred outside of the US. - Mod.DK]
