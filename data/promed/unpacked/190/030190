[1] USA: prison outbreaks
Date: Wed 17 Jun 2020

Cases of the coronavirus in prisons and jails across the United States have soared in recent weeks, even as the overall daily infection rate in the nation has remained relatively flat. The number of prison inmates known to be infected has doubled during the past month to more than 68 000. Prison deaths tied to the coronavirus have also risen, by 73 per cent since mid-May [2020]. By now, the 5 largest known clusters of the virus in the United States are not at nursing homes or meatpacking plants, but inside correction institutions, according to data. The New York Times has been collecting about confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic reached American shores.

A muddled, uneven response by corrections officials to testing and care for inmates and workers is complicating the spread of the coronavirus. In interviews, prison and jail officials acknowledged that their approach has largely been based on trial and error, and that an effective, consistent response for US correctional facilities remains elusive. "If there was clearly a right strategy, we all would have done it," said Dr Owen Murray, a University of Texas Medical Branch physician who oversees correctional health care at dozens of Texas prisons. "There is no clear-cut right strategy here. There are a lot of different choices that one could make that are going to be in-the-moment decisions."

The inconsistent response to the spread of the coronavirus in correctional facilities is in contrast with efforts to halt its spread in other known incubators of the virus. Much of the cruise ship industry has been closed down. Staff members and residents of nursing homes in several states now face compulsory testing. Many meat processing plants have been shuttered for extensive cleaning.

As the toll in prisons has increased, so has fear among inmates, who say the authorities have done too little to protect them. There have been riots and hunger strikes in correctional facilities from Washington State to New York. And even the known case numbers are most likely a significant undercount because testing has been extremely limited inside prisons and because some places that test do not release the results to the public.

"It's like a sword hanging over my head," said [a 77 year old] inmate at a California prison who has chronic inflammatory lung disease and other respiratory ailments. "Any officer can bring it in." Public officials have long warned that the nation's correctional facilities would most likely become vectors in the pandemic because they are often overcrowded, unsanitary places where social distancing is impractical, bathrooms and day rooms are shared by hundreds of inmates, and access to cleaning supplies is tightly controlled. Many inmates are 60 or older, and many suffer from respiratory illnesses or heart conditions. In response, local jails have discharged thousands of inmates since February [2020], many of whom had been awaiting trials to have charges heard or serving time for nonviolent crimes. State prison systems, where people convicted of more serious crimes are housed, have been more reluctant to release inmates.

Testing for the virus within the nation's penal institutions varies widely, and has become a matter of significant debate. Republican-led states like Texas, Tennessee, and Arkansas -- which generally spend less on prisoners than the national average -- have found themselves at the forefront of testing inmates.

In Texas, the number of prisoners and staff members known to be infected has more than quadrupled to 7900 during the past 3 weeks after the state began to test every inmate. Yet states that typically spend far more on prisons have carried out significantly less testing. California, which spends USD 12 billion annually on its prison system, has tested fewer than 7 per cent of inmates in several of its largest, most crowded facilities, according to the state's data.

New York has tested about 3 per cent of its 40 000 prison inmates; more than 40 per cent of those tested were infected. Critics say that the dearth of testing in some facilities has meant that prison and public health officials have only vague notions about the spread of the virus, which has allowed some elected officials to suggest that it is not present at all. "We have really no true idea of how bad the problem is because most places are not yet testing the way they should," said Dr Homer Venters, who served as chief medical officer for the New York City jail system and now works for a group called Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, which strives to improve health care services in local jails. "I think a lot of times some of the operational challenges of either not having adequate quarantine policies or adequate medical isolation policies are so vexing that places simply decide that they can just throw up their hands." Most state prison systems have conducted few tests. Systems in Illinois, Mississippi, and Alabama have tested fewer than 2.5 per cent of inmates. And in Louisiana, officials had tested several dozen of its 31 000 inmates in March [2020] when the warden and medical director at one of the state's largest prisons died of the coronavirus. The state has since announced plans to test every inmate.

Prison officials in states where only a limited number of inmates have been tested say they are following federal guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that only prisoners with symptoms be tested.

Prisons that have conducted mass testing have found that about 1 in 7 tests of inmates has come back positive, the Times database shows. The vast majority of inmates who have tested positive have been asymptomatic. Public health officials say that indicates the virus has been present in prison populations for far longer than had previously been understood. "If you don't do testing, you're flying blind," said Carlos Franco-Paredes, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

But in California, there continues to be reluctance to test each of the state's 114 000 inmates, despite growing criticism to take a more aggressive approach. One in 6 inmates in the state's prisons have been tested, and the state has released some inmates who were later found to have the virus, raising fears that prison systems could seed new infections outside penal institutions. "Nothing significant had been done to protect those most vulnerable to the virus," said Marie Waldron, the Republican minority leader of the California State Assembly. But J Clark Kelso, who oversees prison health care in California, said that mass testing would provide only a snapshot of the virus's spread. "Testing's not a complete solution," Mr Kelso said. "It gives you better information, but you don't want to get a false sense of security."

California's health department has recommended that a facility's prison inmates and staff members be given priority for testing once an infection has been identified there. But the state prison system has conducted mass testing at only a handful of institutions where infections have been found, according to state data. In one of those facilities, the California Institution for Men in Chino, nearly 875 people have tested positive and 13 inmates have died. Instead, California has employed surveillance testing, which involves testing a limited number of inmates at each state prison regardless of the known infection rate. That method, Mr Kelso said, had led officials to conclude that a vast majority of its prisons are free of the virus. "We're not 100 percent confident because we're not testing everyone," he said. "As we learn every single day from what we're doing, we may suddenly decide, 'No, we actually have to test all of them.' We're not at that point yet."

In interviews, California prison inmates say prison staff have sometimes refused to test them, even after they complained about symptoms similar to the coronavirus. Several prisoners said they had been too weak to move for weeks at a time, but were never permitted to see a nurse and had never been tested.

In Texas, mass testing has found that nearly 8000 inmates and guards have been infected. 62 people have died, including some who had not exhibited symptoms. Dr Murray, the physician who oversees much of Texas' prison health care system, said the disparate approaches taken by prison authorities might actually be beneficial as officials compare notes.

[On 13 May 2020, 3 agencies -- UNODC [UN Office on Drugs and Crime], WHO, UNAIDS [United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS], and OHCHR [Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights] -- issued a joint statement on COVID-19 in prisons and other closed settings: "We, the leaders of global health, human rights and development institutions, come together to urgently draw the attention of political leaders to the heightened vulnerability of prisoners and other people deprived of liberty to the COVID-19 pandemic, and urge them to take all appropriate public health measures in respect of this vulnerable population that is part of our communities.

"Acknowledging that the risk of introducing COVID-19 into prisons or other places of detention varies from country to country, we emphasize the need to minimize the occurrence of the disease in these settings and to guarantee that adequate preventive measures are in place to ensure a gender-responsive approach and preventing large outbreaks of COVID-19. We equally emphasize the need to establish an up-to-date coordination system that brings together health and justice sectors, keeps prison staff well-informed and guarantees that all human rights in these settings are respected.

"Prisons and other places of detention must be part of national COVID-19 plans with dedicated participation of affected populations. All cases of COVID-19 in closed settings should be notified to responsible public health authorities, who will then report to national and international authorities."

[2] Al Jazeera updates (17 Jun 2020)
Date: Wed 17 Jun 2020

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/brazil-coronavirus-cases-hit-daily-record-live-updates-200617002826411.html


- More than 8.1 million people have been confirmed to have the new coronavirus around the world. Nearly 4 million have recovered, while approaching 444 000 have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United States has the most cases and deaths, followed by Brazil.

- Facing coronavirus surge in Arizona, Navajos reimpose virus curfew
The Navajo Nation has reimposed 57-hour weekend curfews to protect citizens from a surge in coronavirus cases in neighbouring Arizona after the largest Native American reservation managed to flatten its own COVID-19 curve. A month ago the coronavirus was tearing through the nation, with daily cases spiking above 170 among a population of around 174 000. That gave the Navajo Nation, which straddles parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, the highest per-capita infection rate in the country if it were a state.
In Arizona, with a population more than 41 times greater, daily cases plateaued around 500 in mid-May [2020], leading Arizona Governor Doug Ducey to lift a stay-at-home order.
The tables have since turned, with Arizona recording a record 2392 new cases while the Navajo Nation reported 39.

- Chile tightens restricting measures in Santiago
Residents of Chile's capital will be subjected to tighter measures as the country's confirmed coronavirus cases exceeded 200 000. Under the new severe restrictions, city's residents will be allowed to leave their homes just twice a week, instead of 5 times, amid concerns that lockdowns of up to 3 months in some parts of the capital had not succeeded in stopping the spread.

- Black patients in Atlanta more likely to be hospitalized: CDC
A new study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention focusing on coronavirus patients in Atlanta, Georgia has found that black patients are more likely to be hospitalized than white patients.
According to the study -- which looked across 6 metropolitan hospitals and outpatient clinics between March and April 2020 -- about 79 percent of black patients were hospitalized against 13 percent of white patients.
Patients tended to be older, male, black, and with underlying conditions, said the researchers.

- New York marks record low in number of cases and deaths
New York City reported on Tuesday [16 Jun 2020] 17 new fatalities, a record low since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.
"We mourn those we lost," NY governor Andrew Cuomo said on Twitter. "But we are thankful this is the lowest number since the pandemic began." Cuomo also added that the city registered the lowest number of new infections which stood at 567 -- less than one percent of the total.

- Researchers invent mask that kills virus
As researches in Israel were trying to find an alternative to disposable masks they invented a reusable face mask that can kill the coronavirus with heat by drawing power from a mobile phone charger.
The disinfecting process takes about 30 minutes -- and users should not wear the mask while it is plugged in, said professor Yair Ein-Eli, who led the research team at Technion University in Haifa.
The new mask has a USB port that connects to a power source such as a standard cellphone charger that heats an inner layer of carbon fibres to 70 deg C (158 deg F), high enough to kill viruses.
"You have to make it reusable and friendly, and this is our solution," said Ein-Eli.

- German government seeks ban on big events until at least end of October [2020]
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is seeking to ban big events until at least the end of October [2020] over fears of renewed transmission of the coronavirus, according to an official draft seen by AFP.
Berlin also plans for schools to return to normal operations after the summer holidays, although recommendations for social distancing and mask-wearing in shops and on public transport will stay, according to the document to be discussed by Merkel and premiers of Germany's 16 states on Wednesday [17 Jun 2020].

- Sweden to lift travel curbs to 10 EU countries
Sweden will lift its advice against non-essential travel to 10 European countries starting from [30 Jun 2020], said foreign minister Ann Linde.
The countries are Greece, Croatia, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, France, Iceland, Belgium, Switzerland, and Luxembourg.
"For other countries, the advice (against non-essential travel) still applies. Countries outside the EU and Schengen will be extended to [31 Aug 2020," said Linde.

- Coronavirus hits back Kazakhstan's capital
A fresh wave of cases is spreading across Kazakhstan's capital Nur-Sultan, according to authorities. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said that the situation was "challenging" because of widespread non-compliance with social distancing rules, however, he added that the government remained in control.
The head of Nur-Sultan's healthcare department Saule Kisikova said that since the situation had worsened over the last few weeks, more hospitals were being converted into COVID-19 facilities. But doctors and other medical personnel are already stretched in the city of 1.2 million, she said, with more than 150 fresh cases reported daily for the last 3 days. "If city dwellers continue behaving carelessly, there will not be enough doctors and hospital beds for everyone," she said.

- COVID-19 deaths in Sweden pass 5000
Deaths in Sweden from COVID-19 have passed 5000, the Public Health Agency said, far more than in neighbouring Nordic countries.
The official death toll has now reached 5041, up from 4939 on Tuesday [16 Jun 2020].
Sweden has taken a softer approach to fighting the coronavirus, leaving most schools, shops, and restaurants open and relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene.
The number of deaths in Sweden has been far higher relative to the size of the population than in Denmark, Norway, and Finland, where authorities have taken a stricter approach. But they have been lower than in the UK, Italy, and Spain, where there have also been lockdowns.

- EU proposes emergency leeway on gene engineering rules for coronavirus vaccines
The European Commission has proposed to temporarily relax rules on trials of drugs involving genetically engineered organisms as an emergency measure to speed up the development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus.
The proposal is part of a wider European Union strategy, which also includes investing about 2 billion euros (USD 2.3bn) for the advance purchase of vaccines under development, in a bid to secure enough doses for the bloc as it fears lagging behind the United States and China.

- Beijing says COVID-19 cases could stay at current levels for some time
Beijing cannot rule out the possibility that the number of COVID-19 cases in the city will stay at current levels for some time, a city official has said.

- Beijing virus outbreak not connected to Norwegian salmon: Oslo
Chinese and Norwegian authorities have concluded that Norwegian salmon was likely not the source of the novel coronavirus that was found on cutting boards in a Beijing food market.
Following a meeting between Chinese and Norwegian officials on Tuesday [16 Jun 2020] both countries have concluded that the source of the outbreak did not originate with fish from the Nordic country, Odd Emil Ingebrigtsen, the Norwegian fisheries and seafood minister said.
"We can clear away uncertainty and the halt in salmon export to China," he told a video conference including journalists.

- German coronavirus tracing app downloaded 6.5 million times
Germany's smartphone app to help trace coronavirus infections has been downloaded 6.5 million times in the 1st 24 hours since its launch, the CEO of software company SAP has said.
"It's a big success, it scales, it's user friendly and it helps society," Christian Klein told journalists in a video briefing.
Germany joins European countries like Italy, Poland and Latvia in launching apps that use bluetooth wireless to measure contacts between people and issue a warning should one of them later test positive for COVID-19.

- Post-lockdown jump in coronavirus cases rattles Turkish officials
Turkey may have to adopt a harder line on social interactions following a worrying jump in coronavirus infections.
This month [June 2020] restaurants and cafes reopened, intercity flights and car travel resumed and weekend stay-at-home orders were lifted. However, new COVID-19 cases have roughly doubled to 1600 a day since [1 Jun 2020].
One senior government official called the new infections "a serious problem" and said steps may be taken after president Recep Tayyip Erdogan chairs a cabinet meeting this week.

- Taiwan to ease virus border controls to let in some business people
Taiwan will from the start of next week [week of 22 Jun 2020] ease border controls put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and will allow in business travellers from some lower-risk countries, though they will have to be tested and quarantined.
Taiwan has never gone into total lockdown and life has continued largely as normal due to its early and effective prevention work and a 1st-rate public health system.
While it has largely lifted domestic restrictions, Taiwan has been more cautious about opening up its borders, which have been shut to most foreign visitors since mid-March [2020].

- Chinese provinces impose curbs, quarantines on people from Beijing
The semi-autonomous Chinese territory of Macau has just announced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all people who have been in Beijing in the past 2 weeks. The measure will come into effect at 12 noon local time (04:00 GMT). Heilongjiang province in the northeast has introduced a 21-day quarantine for anyone recently arrived from Beijing's medium and high-risk areas. The capital has already imposed restrictions on outward travel. That's led to a sharp drop in flights at its main airports.

- Brazil cases at daily record, official claims crisis 'managed'
Brazil has reported a record 34 918 new coronavirus cases, on the same day, one of the senior officials leading the country's response to the crisis claimed the outbreak was under control.
Brazil also registered 1282 COVID-19 deaths bringing confirmed fatalities to 45 241.
Walter Braga Netto, the head of the office of the president's chief of staff and one of the top officials handling the crisis, said it was under control. "There is a crisis, we sympathise with bereaved families, but it is managed," Braga Netto told a webinar organised by the Commercial Association of Rio de Janeiro. Braga Netto based his claim on deaths-per-million-people, which suggested the country was doing better than many European nations, saying he "was trying to convey a message of optimism in the management of the crisis."
Latin America's largest country accounts for about 1/4 of the roughly 4 million coronavirus cases in the Americas and nearly 25 per cent of the deaths, he said.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 17 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO welcomes initial clinical trial results from the United Kingdom that show dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, can be lifesaving for patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. According to preliminary findings shared with WHO, for patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one third, and for patients who only require oxygen, mortality was cut by about 1/5th.
- Older people have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders from around the world have expressed their concern, and called for a response that addresses the needs and rights of older people.
- Dr Carissa F Etienne, director of the WHO Regional Office for the Americas (PAHO), has called on countries to "work together to strengthen the health response within their territories and across frontiers," in order to contain the spread of COVID-19 among migrant and vulnerable populations in border areas.
- PAHO has extended its alliance with Twitter to provide factual, reliable information on the COVID-19 pandemic in the Americas. An agreement recently signed with the platform will enable it to continue training public health social media managers and provide advertising credits to PAHO for the dissemination of evidence-based information.
- In today's 'subject in focus', we provide an update on operations support and logistics supplies.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 48.6% of the global newly reported cases and 36.1% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 35.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, USA reported 31.8%, Chile 8.6%, Mexico 5.8%, and Peru 5.6%. The same 5 countries at the top.

The European region reported 15.1% of the global newly reported cases and 14.6% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region, Russia reported 43.4% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Turkey 8.1%, the UK 7.1%, Sweden 5.2%, Ukraine 4.2%, and Belarus at 3.8%. Again, same countries, minor juggling of orders and percentages on a daily basis.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 17.3% of the global newly reported cases and 9.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 28.2% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Saudi Arabia 20.6%, Iran 12.4%, Egypt 7.5%, Iraq 6.7%, Afghanistan 6.0%, and Qatar 5.8%. Afghanistan reported more than 1000 cases in the last 24 hours, overtaking Oman.

The African region reported 4.7% of the global newly reported cases and 2.0% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 49.0% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cote d'Ivoire 10.4%, Nigeria 8.5%, Ghana 4.0%, Congo DR 3.4%, and Central African Republic 3.3%. While South Africa and Nigeria are consistently number 1 and number 2 in terms of 24 hour increase in cases, in the last 24 hours, Cote d'Ivoire overtook Nigeria at number 2. Other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.55% of the global newly reported cases and 0.20% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 54.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 22.7%, China 6.6%, South Korea 6.5 %, and Japan 6.1%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets has brought China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases.

The South East Asia region reported 13.6% of the global newly reported cases and 38.0% of global fatalities. India reported 67.1% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 23.6%, Indonesia 6.8%, and Nepal 2.3%. Same countries, same order as in previous days.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 8000+ new cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean has surpassed the European region with Pakistan reporting 5-6000+ cases a day. South East Asia is approaching parity with the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean region has surpassed the European region for the past 2 days in terms of newly confirmed cases. The Americas region is reporting around 70 000 cases a day with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day (today16 Jun 2020, was only 17 110 cases), and the USA seems to have stabilized at 20 000+ a day. In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 2000-3000+ range daily, and in the Western Pacific region, they are maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 400+ cases per day (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 17 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has overtaken the European region; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 8 313 126, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count increased by 0.6 % in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.21 million confirmed cases, now represents 26.6% of the global cases of COVID-19, as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases. A global total of 447 437 deaths have been reported, an increase of 1479 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, there is major underreporting of numbers of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, possibly 1/10th to 1/20th in order of magnitude. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home and who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Italy, Peru, Iran, and Germany at number 10. China is number 19. In descending rank order, Russia is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Bangladesh, Iran, Sweden, and Qatar.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region, a new country from the South East Asia region was added in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most newly confirmed cases include 7 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the European region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, none from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.UBA]
