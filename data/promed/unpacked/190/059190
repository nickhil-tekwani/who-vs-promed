The New York State Departments of Health and Agriculture & Markets today [17 Jul 2018] cautioned New York residents, visitors, and farmers about the continued importance of taking measures to protect against ticks, as a new tick species has been found in the state. The _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick, commonly known as the "longhorned tick", was recently discovered in multiple locations in Westchester county.

New York State Department of Health research scientists collaborated with researchers at Fordham University and at the Lyme Disease Diagnostic Center of New York Medical College to identify these ticks. The identifications were confirmed by the Rutgers University Center for Vector Biology and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

While the longhorned tick has transmitted disease to humans in other parts of the world, more research is needed to determine whether this can happen in the United States. Regardless, New Yorkers should continue to take steps to protect themselves, their children and their pets against ticks and tickborne diseases that are present in New York state.

This tick is also a concern for the New York state agricultural industry and may pose a threat to livestock. Farmers should continue to work with their veterinarians to check their animals, particularly cattle, sheep and horses, for exposure to ticks and to ensure their parasite control plans are up to date and working. Symptoms of tickborne disease in cattle include fever, lack of appetite, dehydration, weakness and labored breathing.

The Department of Agriculture and Markets encourages livestock owners and veterinarians to also be vigilant for unusually heavy tick infestations. If longhorned ticks are suspected, farmers should consult with their veterinarians and contact the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Division of Animal Industry at 518-457-3502 or <dai@agriculture.ny.gov>.

The longhorned tick is not native to the United States and is commonly found in Australia, New Zealand, and eastern Asia. However, these ticks have been found recently in New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Arkansas.

State health commissioner Dr Howard Zucker said, "Taking steps to protect yourself, your children, and pets against ticks is the best way to prevent tick bites and tickborne diseases. We will continue to conduct surveillance and research on this new type of tick, but it is encouraging that the same steps that protect against [blacklegged] ticks are also effective against the longhorned tick."

State agriculture commissioner Richard A Ball said, "While we continue to learn more about the longhorned tick, it is evident that this species may possibly cause illness not only in humans, but also in livestock and our pets. We encourage farmers to be vigilant and keep a watchful eye out for this tick to protect their animals and stay ahead of any potential problems for the livestock industry in New York state."

Tick prevention tips
--------------------
While hiking, working, or spending time in wooded areas:
- wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts to protect against ticks other biting insects;
- check for ticks often while outdoors and brush off any ticks before they attach;
- perform a full body check multiple times during the day, as well as at the end of the day to ensure that no ticks are attached;
- consider use of repellents containing DEET, picaridin or IR3535, following label instructions.

If you have been bitten by a tick of any kind, contact your health care provider immediately if you develop a rash or flu-like symptoms.

[This invasive tick has now been found in another state. As noted earlier, this discovery makes one wonder whether this tick has become established in the eastern USA. Either the tick is spreading rapidly or surveillance has been intensified, or both. With discovery of this tick in widely divergent localities in the USA in the past 7 months, one wonders if it is being moved via birds or by infested domestic animals.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. One wonders if this tick is capable of transmitting tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional bush ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
