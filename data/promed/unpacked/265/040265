A village sparked its 2nd national public health scare in 5 years yesterday
as the 1st case of the deadly avian flu virus found in Britain was traced
to a private bird importer.
Little Warley, Essex, is home to Pegasus Birds, a tropical bird specialist
which is thought to be linked to the quarantine centre where a parrot
carrying the lethal H5N1 strain of the disease died on 16 Oct 2005.
The shop is opposite the abattoir that reported the 1st case of
foot-and-mouth disease in the 2001 outbreak.
Brett Hammond, the owner of Pegasus Birds, was convicted of VAT fraud and
jailed for 18 months at Knightsbridge Crown Court in February 1997. The
sentence was reduced to 12 months on appeal. He also featured in a BBC
Radio 4 investigation about the importation of wild cockatoos from
Indonesia that were sold in Britain as captive reared birds, which command
higher prices.
Last night government vets confirmed they are investigating the possibility
that H5N1 was present at the facility much earlier than thought.
On Sunday [23 Oct 2005] it announced its "working hypothesis" was that the
bird had been infected by a batch of birds from Taiwan.
But yesterday authorities in Taiwan said there had been no reports of cases
of H5N1 on the island and the British Government's theory had no "solid
evidence" to back it up.
An alternative possibility is that birds in an earlier batch delivered to
the facility could have had a "subclinical" infection and began secreting
virus only after the stresses of quarantine. Contaminated droppings could
have released the airborne virus that may have infected subsequent batches
of birds from Taiwan and South America.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is now looking at
what went into the quarantine before the parrot's arrival.
Although Defra refused to disclose the location of the avian flu case, the
commuter-belt village came under suspicion. Little Warley, just east of the
M25, is home to numerous pet centres, kennels, catteries and aquariums, as
well as farms and expensive gated homes.

Mr Hammond could not be contacted at his home in Upminster, near the
centre, yesterday. Katrin Geller, his partner, said he was not in the house
when The Times called.
She subsequently denied that Mr Hammond lived in the house. When asked if
she could confirm that the parrot had died at Pegasus Birds, however, she
said: "Defra have told us not to say anything to you about that."
Staff at the Pegasus Centre, which is the biggest importer of birds and
reptiles in Essex, denied that the parrot had died there after a transfer
from Heathrow. The bird originated from Surinam, South America, and entered
the country in a consignment of 148 birds on 16 Sep 2005.
11 days later a batch of 218 birds from Taiwan were also moved into the
quarantine premises, and 2 parrots were found dead last Thursday [20 Oct
2005]. Only one was found to contain the suspect H5 strain, though further
tests on tissue samples from both birds confirmed the H5N1 strain.
Debby Reynolds, the Government's chief veterinary adviser, confirmed that
the birds had been kept in Essex and had shared air space.
Defra declined to confirm or deny that Pegasus Birds was at the centre of
the bird flu scare. A spokesman said: "As a matter of course we always
discourage people from approaching any disease sites and will therefore not
be naming the facility. It is not our practice to release personal
information of the owner. Investigations continue into the circumstances
surrounding the death of these birds."

[2] UK, parrot infected in quarantine

Wild birds caught in the jungles of Africa and South America end up for
sale in the pet shops and markets of Europe, part of an often illicit
global trade that is raising increasing concern as a deadly avian flu
spreads around the world.
Many fear the European Union's bird quarantine system is not tight enough
to protect it from the illness and are calling for a ban on imports of live
wild birds. Animal protection groups warn the conditions in which exotic
birds are held and transported make them highly vulnerable to infection and
ripe for carrying viruses across borders.
Britain on Sunday [23 Oct 2005] confirmed its 1st case of bird flu since
1992, a South American parrot that died of the disease in quarantine. The
British environment agency's chief veterinarian has said the animal
probably contracted the illness while being held in Britain with birds from
Taiwan.
The parrot that died in British quarantine had the deadly H5N1 strain of
bird flu, which has spread across Asia and recently entered Europe. While
H5N1 is easily transmitted among birds, it is difficult for humans to
contract, and most of the more than 60 people killed in Asia had been in
close contact with birds. Experts fear the virus could mutate into a form
of flu contagious among humans and cause a pandemic.
The case in Britain raised worries for some about the EU-wide quarantine
system, although Britain's environment agency said it showed protections
were working.
Bird traders are generally responsible for holding their own animals for
the mandatory 30-day quarantine, and animal protection groups say that can
create a dangerous conflict of interest. The traders can make more money if
they rush their stock to market before some of the birds die, as they often
do, the groups warn.
They could also be tempted to cut corners by keeping the birds in poor
conditions that can breed disease, said Arthur Lindley, director of science
at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
EU rules also require exporters to quarantine birds for 21 days before
shipping them to Europe. But it can be nearly impossible to know whether
they have done so, Lindley said.
"All we can check at this end is a piece of paper," he said.
The society said it had found in an investigation that in Ghana, which
exports parrots, there were no sealed quarantine areas, and birds were
often shipped abroad after only a week. Species may be able to mix during
quarantine and transport, raising the risk of diseases spreading, the
society said.
Lindley said similar problems likely existed in other bird-exporting
nations. Once birds enter the European Union and are released from
quarantine, they can move freely within the 25-nation bloc.
Britain's environment agency said it believed the quarantine system worked
well, though it said it was constantly seeking to boost protection. The
government has asked the EU to ban the import of live wild birds and
expects a decision within days.
3 of Britain's biggest bird trading companies declined to discuss bird flu
quarantines, hanging up when The Associated Press called.
The world trade in exotic birds is vast. Elaine Toland, director of the
Animal Protection Agency, an advocacy group, said between 2 million and 5
million birds are captured and sold legally each year. It's harder to
estimate the number traded illicitly, but it may be nearly as high, she said.
About 65 percent of the legal trade ends up in Europe, Toland said. As many
as 75 percent of the birds die between capture and sale. The others end up
in European bird markets or shops and eventually become household pets.
They come from jungles around the world, where they are trapped by nets or
with glue smeared on tree branches.
Traumatized by confined conditions and hours of travel in trucks and
planes, their immune systems are often weak and unable to fight off
illness. Cramped cages with species from around the world create the
potential for diseases to spread quickly.
Advocates said illicit traders often piggyback on the legal industry, using
fake paperwork and sending animals to bird markets around Europe.
The United States sharply restricted imports of exotic birds with the Wild
Bird Conservation Act of 1992, and most pet birds sold in America are now
raised in captivity, a method considered more humane than trapping wild birds.

The EU is expected to announce a temporary ban on the commercial
importation of millions of wild birds today after a request from the
British government for tougher action against avian flu.
The decision, which is due to be endorsed by EU veterinary experts, comes
as experts in the UK called for a review of quarantine procedures in the
wake of Britain's 1st case of infection from the most virulent strain of
the virus.
Alan Jones, a leading avian vet, said there should be an urgent review of
the quarantine conditions in the UK. "In my experience there should never
have been a situation where birds from different continents shared the same
air space," he said. "In this instance the Taiwanese birds have infected
the South American parrot. I would question the wisdom at the moment anyway
of having brought in birds from south-east Asia at all."
Debby Reynolds, the government's chief veterinary officer, said yesterday
that quarantine regulations would be examined urgently, adding there were
"quite a number of unanswered questions." Imported birds must spend at
least 30 days in quarantine.
Quarantine facilities are privately run and licensed by Defra, but Duncan
McNiven, an RSPB investigative officer, said the system was badly
regulated. "What people often don't realise is that these birds aren't held
in some state-of-the-art facility at Heathrow airport. They go as a job
lot, often to the dealers themselves, and are quarantined in a shed in a
backyard and a government vet will visit and take away dead birds to test.
They are then sold on through pet shops and bird fairs in huge halls like
the NEC with all these imported birds and lots of people crowded round."
Avian vets yesterday welcomed the EU decision expected today, to widen the
ban on importing live birds to Europe. Import bans have already been
imposed on live birds from areas where H5N1 has been confirmed, including
Turkey, Romania and the Greek island of Chios.
According to the RSPCA up to 250 000 rare birds, some of which are under
threat of extinction, are commercially imported into England and Wales each
year under the convention on the international trade in endangered species,
or Cites. Across Europe, between 2000 and 2003, some 2.74 million birds
were imported under Cites from South America, China and Africa for sale in
pet shops.
David Bowles of the RSPCA said the ban could not come too soon. "We have
campaigned actively for this for the last 6 months because of the avian flu
issue. But we also have asked for it for the last 15 years because the
business is loaded with birds that have been traded almost to extinction."
Some vets, however, feared the import ban would fuel an already thriving
underground trade in bird imports.
Professor Mac Johnston, the head of the Royal Veterinary College's animal
and public health division, said "The question is whether it is right to
stop the legal trade, knowing that at the same time you are giving the
crime gangs a boost."
The most popular species for pet owners in the UK are the grey parrot, the
Senegalese parrot and macaws. Bird enthusiasts can pay up to GBP 1000 (USD
1785) in a British pet shop for a wild-caught grey parrot.

[General guidelines for the importation of captive birds into the UK are to
be seen at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/int-trde/animl-im/Captive%20Birds%201.pdf>.
Generally, they are in line with the guidelines prevailing in many other
countries, where there are similar problems and health risks.
Ideally, each consignment of captive birds should undergo a testing scheme,
performed on a statistically representative number of samples, checking for
several listed diseases such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease.
Initial testing should be performed prior to the exportation from the
country of origin; if the birds are approved for export, a 2nd test should
be performed during the quarantine period following their arrival in the
country of destination. They should be efficiently separated from other
consignments and their air space, throughout the entire said period, with
special attention to separation during the transfer through intermediate
stations. An "all in -- all out" principle should be applied. Dead and sick
birds should undergo immediate clinical and laboratory investigations. The
birds, preferably identifiable, should be kept under veterinary observation
throughout their quarantine period. Ideally, this means at least one daily
visit by the official or authorised inspecting veterinarian, who should
preferably be an avian disease specialist. Transportation and maintenance
throughout the said periods should be carried out in disinfected
vehicles/cages, preferably in state-managed facilities and not in privately
owned ones, where conflict of interests are indeed a disturbing factor.
Though the said desirable requirements are not easy to implement, they are
needed -- being proportional to the risks involved in the affected
industry.- Mod.AS]

[4] Thailand, further spread

Cases of suspected human infections are on the rise as villagers resist
efforts by livestock officials to cull fowl. Avian influenza has spread to
more than half the country, with 39 provinces reporting confirmed or
suspected cases of fresh bird-flu infections. Last week, the authorities
had just 21 provinces under close watch for bird flu, suggesting the virus
is spreading rapidly.
Meanwhile, Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Suphan Buri and
Kamphaeng Phet have been put on a list of provinces with severe bird-flu
problems. [see map:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/thailand_admin_2002.jpg>].
"We are receiving more and more reports of fowl deaths," Jatuporn Kamchuen,
the livestock chief of Kanchanaburi's Phanom Thuan district, said
yesterday. Livestock officials were busy culling fowl suspected of
contracting bird flu.
At the same time, he complained that officials were facing resistance from
some villagers who had tried to prevent officials from taking their birds.
"We need to raise people's understanding of the situation."
Last week, 2 residents of Phanom Thuan district became the latest confirmed
bird-flu patients in the country. One has since died.
As of yesterday, 3 others in Kanchanaburi were on a list of people
suspected of catching bird flu. Kanchanaburi public-health chief Surapong
Tanthanasrikul said health volunteers were going to areas where bird-flu
infections had been reported to check whether the disease had spread to any
other people.
Samart Prasitphol, a senior livestock official in Kanchanaburi, said staff
had set up checkpoints to enforce the ban on the movement of birds as a
measure to curtail the spread of the deadly disease.

dealing with 5 new outbreaks in 4 provinces, is available at
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Thailand%20Follow-up%20Report%20No74.pdf>.
The notification included the following comments:
1. Thailand has been conducting the current nationwide surveillance since 1
Jul 2005.
2. There was one more province (i.e. Nonthaburi) affected during this week.
3. In total, there were 64 positive cases confirmed in 8 provinces.
4. These 8 affected provinces are still in the Central Poultry Zoning of
Thailand. The country has been divided into 5 poultry zones: Northern (9
provinces), Northeastern (19 provinces), Eastern (8 provinces), Central (25
provinces), and the Southern (15 provinces), for the effective movement
control and farming management. - Mod.AS]
