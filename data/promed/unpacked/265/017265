Bird flu confirmed in dead swan
-----------------------------------
Preliminary tests have found the H5 avian flu in a sample from a swan found
dead in Fife, health officials have revealed. The exact strain of the virus
is not yet known, but tests were continuing, and further results were
expected on Thursday [6 Apr 2006]. The Scottish Executive said the area was
being sealed off.

If the disease is confirmed as the deadly H5N1 strain, there may be further
restrictions put in place.

An executive spokesman said: "In accordance with a recent EU decision, the
Scottish Executive is putting in place a protection zone of a minimum of 3
km radius and a surveillance zone of 10 km. Keepers of birds in the
protection zone are being instructed to isolate their birds from wild birds
by taking them indoors where ever possible." Measures to restrict the
movement of poultry, eggs and poultry products from these zones will be
brought into effect immediately. Officials stressed that there was no
reason for public health concern.

Chief Veterinary Officer for Scotland Charles Milne said: "Whilst disease
has yet to be confirmed, this is an important development. "Bird keepers
outside the protection zone should redouble their efforts to prepare for
bringing their birds indoors if that becomes necessary. "They must also
review their biosecurity measures to ensure that all possible precautions
have been taken."

Ruth Watkins is a retired clinical virologist who told NEWS 24 about the
distinctions in the virus. "The H5N1 highly pathogenic virus has come
across Asia from China and into Europe, with birds fleeing the very very
cold conditions in central Europe, and it's been found in wild birds in
many European countries, particularly where ducks and geese and so on have
congregated in wetland areas. Of course, it's possible it might also be
brought by a wild birds into the United Kingdom. But so far, there's been
only one incident where turkeys that actually were enclosed in a house in
southern France were infected: they were slaughtered, and it didn't spread
any further. There's been one incident, I believe, in Denmark, where one
mallard was positive for it on a farm where I believe there were about 500
other birds of various kinds who were all slaughtered, and none other was
found to be infected. So basically, it sounds to me like sensible
precautionary measures have been taken, and I presume the specimen is at
Weybridge and they'll be doing a preliminary chain reaction and sequencing
it, and they'll be able to say, probably tomorrow [6 Apr 2006], definitely
whether or not it's the highly pathogenic strain."

[The European Commission (EC) said Wednesday, 5 Apr 2006: "The authorities
of the United Kingdom have informed the European Commission that
preliminary tests have found the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5
in a sample from a dead wild swan detected in Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland".

[2] Germany, EU measures

Avian Influenza: several preventive and control measures agreed by Standing
Committee
-----------------------------------------------
Member States have backed a series of Commission proposals to reinforce EU
preventive and control measures with regard to avian influenza at the
Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH). The
decisions relate to the outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza on a German turkey
farm, rules on preventive measures taken with regard to zoo birds and an
extension of the import bans for Croatia, Romania and Turkey.

Following confirmation of an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza on a turkey farm in Wermsdorf (Saxony) in Germany [for the exact
site of the small village Mutzchen, near Wermsdorf, which is the precise
site of the outbreak, see:
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=51.2729&lon=12.9093&scale=50000&icon=x>
- Mod.AS],
the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health today [5 Apr
2006] agreed to a Commission proposal to establish a risk area around the
protection (3 km) and surveillance (10 km) zones, as required by Decision
2006/135/EC on avian influenza in poultry. The risk area acts as a buffer
zone between the outbreak and the non-affected parts of the Member State or
its neighboring countries. Strict movement restrictions, bio-security
measures and controls have to be applied in the risk area, in addition to
the measures already foreseen for protection and surveillance zones under
EU legislation. The establishment of a risk area helps to prevent any
further spread of the virus and aims to provide reassurance to consumers,
the poultry sector and trade partners about the safety of products dispatched.

The decision agreed to today [5 Apr 2006] adds a list of all the German
municipalities covered by the protection and surveillance zones and the
risk area to the Annex of Decision 2006/135/EC. The protection zone covers
Wermsdorf, Stadt Mutzschen, while municipalities in the districts of
Muldentalkreis, Kreis Torgau-Oschatz and Kreis Dubeln fall within the
surveillance zone or the wider risk area. This list aims to provide legal
certainty with regard to the area where the movement restrictions and
control measures must be applied and will enable 3rd country trading
partners to regionalize import bans they may impose as a result of the
outbreak. The measures in these zones will remain in place until 8 May
2006, subject to review over the coming weeks.

A draft Commission Decision on measures to prevent the spread of highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in zoo birds was unanimously backed by the
Standing Committee today [5 Apr 2006]. The Decision, which replaces
Decision 2005/74/EC of last October [2005] (see IP/05/1326), brings the
rules on vaccinating zoo birds into line with the new Avian Influenza
Directive. The main change is that any Member State wishing to vaccinate
zoo birds must 1st submit a vaccination plan to the Commission for
approval. These plans will be published on the Commission website.
Vaccination in a zoo, once undertaken, must be completed as quickly as
possible, within one week, and must be supervised by an official
veterinarian. Vaccinated zoo birds are required to be individually
identifiable, and their movement is subject to certain conditions, e.g.
vaccinated zoo birds must carry a health certificate if being moved from
one zoo to another, and if vaccinated birds are being moved from one Member
State to another, the authorities in the Member State of origin must notify
the authorities of the recipient country. The Decision also states that
"appropriate and practicable" measures should be carried out in zoos to
avoid the introduction of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, for example
preventing direct and indirect contact between wild birds and zoo birds.
The Decision includes in an Annex the 16 Member States whose vaccination
plans for zoo birds have already been approved by the Commission.
