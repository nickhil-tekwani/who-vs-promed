PetSmart withdrew parakeets for sale at 511 stores, including the one in Odessa [Texas], after a confirmed case of a rare disease that can cause flu-like signs and spread to humans.

PetSmart spokeswoman Michelle Friedman described the removal as a "voluntary withdraw" of all birds from a vendor she declined to identify. "It was just an abundance of caution," she said, instead of a mandate from regulators.

The disease is psittacosis, also known as "parrot fever," with clinical signs including fever, nausea, diarrhea and weakness, among others. PetSmart stores such as Odessa's began notifying people who bought the birds from 12-20 Mar 2014.

Those customers were told to visit PetSmart if their bird displayed clinical signs such as lethargy or loss of appetite, and store officials would recommend and pay for a visit to an avian veterinarian, Friedman said. They could also return the animals.

The birds withdrawn from the stores were returned for antibiotic treatment to the vendor, Friedman said.

[While this is originating out of Texas, with 511 stores involved, it is quite possible there are stores in other states.

A similar situation happened in 2008 and involved multiple states (46), see: prior ProMED-mail post 7 Psittacosis - USA 20071230.4174, and http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/vet-breaking-news/psittacosis-concerns-suspend-bird-sales-at-petsmart-stores.aspx and http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-news/latest-bird-news/petsmart-test-positive-psittacosis.aspx.

Avian chlamydiosis is a zoonotic disease of birds caused by the intracellular bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. This disease is called psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, in humans. It may be called either avian chlamydiosis or psittacosis in psittacine birds; the term avian chlamydiosis is generally used in other avian species. Infections are particularly common among psittacine birds (such as parrots, macaws, cockatiels, budgerigars, pigeons, sparrows, ducks, hens, gulls and many other species of bird) and pigeons, but most or all species of birds are probably susceptible. Some birds carry this organism asymptomatically. Others become mildly to severely ill, either immediately or after they have been stressed. Significant economic losses may be seen in turkeys and ducks, and high mortality can occur in clinically affected psittacines. Humans are readily infected by _C. psittaci_.

In 1929, exposure to imported pet psittacines caused a pandemic in the U.S. and Europe. Since that time, improved screening and control of avian infections have decreased the incidence of human disease. However, _C. psittaci_ is difficult to eliminate entirely; sporadic cases and outbreaks continue to occur. Unusual sources of outbreaks have also been reported. In Australia, one cluster of cases was linked to outdoor activities in an environment contaminated by wild birds. In people, psittacosis is readily treated with antibiotics, but it can be fatal if it is left untreated.

_C. psittaci_ can be transmitted between birds by the inhalation of infectious dust or airborne particles such as feathers, and by the ingestion of infectious material including carcasses. Large quantities of this organism are excreted in feces and can become aerosolized when the fecal material dries. _C. psittaci_ is also found in respiratory and oral secretions. Some birds carry the organism asymptomatically, and can shed it intermittently for long periods. Shedding can be stimulated by concurrent infections or stressors (such as shipping to various pet stores) such as nutritional deficiencies, handling, overcrowding or egg laying. _C. psittaci_ can also be transmitted on fomites including contaminated feed or water. The infectious form found outside cells, which is called the elementary body, is resistant to drying and can remain viable for months if protected by organic debris. It is reported to survive in bird feed for up to 2 months, on glass for 15 days, and in straw for 20 days. Biting flies, mites and lice may be involved in mechanical transmission.

Humans usually become infected after inhaling contaminated dust, feathers or aerosolized secretions and excretions. Direct contact with infected birds, including bites, can also spread the disease. Rare cases of person-to-person transmission have been reported, possibly via aerosol spread during paroxysmal coughing. Dogs can be infected with _C. psittaci_ if they eat bird carcasses or feces. They are probably also infected via inhalation.

Psittacosis (in people) can be acute or insidious in onset. The disease varies from a mild, flu-like illness with fever, chills, headache, myalgia, anorexia, malaise, sore throat and/or photophobia, with or without respiratory symptoms, to severe atypical pneumonia with dyspnea. Some patients have a dry cough, which may become mucopurulent. Gastrointestinal signs, arthralgia, joint swelling and nonspecific rash have also been reported. In uncomplicated infections, the illness usually lasts approximately 7-10 days and may be self-limiting. Death can occur in untreated cases, but it is rare in patients treated with appropriate antibiotics. Some infections are asymptomatic.

Tetracycline antibiotics combined with supportive care are effective. Other antibiotics such as macrolides may be used in some patients. Relapses are possible.
