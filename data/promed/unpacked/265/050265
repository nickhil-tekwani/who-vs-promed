Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle Disease in New South Wales - Update
Further to my reports of 21 September, 25 September and 8 October, I wish
to provide the following additional information.
Since stamping out was implemented on the three infected poultry farms, New
South Wales (NSW) veterinary authorities have conducted extensive
surveillance in the Restricted Areas [Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan
terminology which equates to OIE Infected Zone and the surrounding Control
Areas [Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan terminology which equates to
OIE Surveillance Zone around the three infected farms. Authorities have
visited more than 100 poultry farms twice to sample birds, and more than
14,000 blood samples and 13,000 swabs have been collected. No further
infected poultry farms have been identified and all wild bird testing
around the three farms has been negative. An extensive passive surveillance
program remains in place.
Gene sequencing shows the outbreak strain most likely evolved as a mutation
of an endemic lentogenic strain. Epidemiological and gene sequencing
evidence shows that, while highly pathogenic, the virus demonstrates low
transmissibility (see Attachment 1).
Disinfection has been completed at Farm 3 at Rylstone, and the respective
control and restricted areas have been lifted. This area should now be
considered an ND-free zone.
Preliminary disinfection has been completed on the two Sydney farms.
National funding arrangements to deal with disinfection are being
implemented. The NSW Government has used its powers under the NSW Exotic
Diseases Act to issue legal orders and require the owners to contribute to
clean-up and decontamination costs.
Disinfection programs appropriate to the circumstances of each farm are
being employed on these two farms, and they will remain as infected
premises until the programs are completed. Australian authorities have
assessed that these programs, together with ongoing biosecurity of the two
infected premises, will produce an effective outcome to eliminate the virus
from these previously-infected farms.2.
A property approximately 20 kms to the south-west of the first infected
farm has been quarantined as a precaution, pending full clarification of
anomalous laboratory results. Mortality rates on this farm remain very low
and investigations are not indicative of clinical Newcastle Disease. The
Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong has been unable to identify
Newcastle Disease in several batches of samples submitted from this farm.
Based on the negative second round of surveillance results, the restricted
and control areas were revised on 20 November. There has been a reduction
in the size of the infected and surveillance zones in relation to these two
poultry farms. The restricted area/infected zone is now confined to the
boundaries of the infected farms. The control area/surveillance zone is now
a 1 km radius surrounding each infected premise areas (refer to attached
map). Movement controls outside of the revised control areas have been
lifted.
Australia has managed this outbreak by implementing a stamping out policy.
NDV vaccination is not permitted within Australia. Surveillance has
confirmed that the disease remains effectively regionalised according to
the principles established by OIE. Therefore no restrictions have been
placed on the movement of poultry or poultry products within Australia,
except from the surveillance zone around the infected farms, ie the rest of
Australia should continue to be recognised as a virulent Newcastle
Disease-free zone. I shall keep you informed of further developments.

Newcastle Disease

Farms 1 and 2: 33*440' south, 151*0' east, near Sydney, NSW.
Farm 3: 32*58' south, 149*0' east, near Sydney, NSW.
Details concerning the outbreak
-------------------------------
Farm No. Species No. of animals
1 Avian 76,000 layers
9000 pullets
10 geese
Ratites 4 ostrich
wild pigeons (unknown number)
2. Avian 12,000 layers
3. Avian 2,500 broilers
Comments concerning affected population
---------------------------------------
* These farms supply eggs and meat to the domestic market in the Sydney
metropolitan area
* No birds, poultry or products have been exported from these properties
Comments on the epidemiology
----------------------------
The disease occurred on three epidemiologically connected poultry farms
with it being detected on the index property by a significant increase in
mortality. Gross and microscopic examination of tissues from birds on the
three properties showed lesions consistent with infection with a virulent
virus inducing clinical signs of neurological disease. The ICPI for the
virus from infected farm 1 was 1.6, and from the second farm was 1.9. No
virus was isolated from the third property - its presence and virulence
being determined by immunohistochemical and molecular techniques. Spread of
the disease both within- and between- sheds on the affected farms was slow.
Gene sequencing indicated that the virus on the three affected properties
was the same virus, although there were very minor and unimportant
nucleotide sequence differences between viruses on the different
properties. The outbreak virus was very closely related on analysis of the
haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) protein genes to a known
endemic lentogenic strain of the virus and it probably arose by mutation
from this strain, or another closely related but as yet unidentified
Australian virus.
Extensive active surveillance in the restricted and control areas has
resulted in more than 100 poultry farms being visited twice and the
collection of almost 27,000 blood and swab samples. These were all negative
when tested. Almost 100 samples collected from wild birds around the three
infected farms were also negative when tested for infection with the virus.
Passive surveillance with the assistance of an organised network of private
veterinarians is also in place.
There is no evidence of infection with virulent ND virus elsewhere in
Australia.

Control measures taken to date
------------------------------
* The first two farms were officially placed in quarantine on 17 and 18
September 1998 respectively, and poultry were destroyed by 28 September.
The third farm at Rylstone, was placed in quarantine on 22 September and
poultry destroyed on 24 September.
* A revised 1km surveillance zone has been imposed around the infected
premises.
* A comprehensive active surveillance program has been completed and
passive surveillance continues.
* Disinfection arrangements are in place for the first two farms. The third
farm is no longer an infected premises.
