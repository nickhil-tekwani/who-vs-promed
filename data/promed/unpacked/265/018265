[1] WHO situation report
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2016
Source: WHO situation report [edited]
http://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/situation-reports/12-august-2016/en/


A yellow fever outbreak was detected in Luanda, Angola late in December 2015. The 1st cases were confirmed by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa on 19 Jan 2016 and by the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IP-D) on 20 January. Subsequently, a rapid increase in the number of cases has been observed.

Summary
Angola: 3867 suspected cases

In Angola, no confirmed cases have been reported in July or August [2016]. As of 4 Aug 2016, a total of 3867 suspected cases have been reported, of which 879 are laboratory confirmed. The total number of reported deaths is 369, of which 119 were reported among confirmed cases. Confirmed cases have been reported in 16 of 18 provinces.

The priorities for the response in Angola are to complete the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns in bordering areas and at-risk districts, to maintain a strong surveillance and case-finding system, and to continue vector control activities.

Mass reactive vaccination campaigns have covered most of the affected parts of Angola. The pre-emptive vaccination phase targeting 3 million people in 18 districts is expected to start on 15 Aug [2016]. Four additional districts which border Namibia will be vaccinated in early August.

Democratic Republic of the Congo: 2269 suspected cases

As of 8 Aug [2015], Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has reported a total of 2269 suspected cases.

As of 8 Aug [2015], out of 1943 samples analysed in DRC 74 cases have been confirmed including 16 deaths (CFR: 21.6 per cent). Confirmed cases have been reported in 7 of 26 provinces. Of the 74 confirmed cases, 56 are reported as imported from Angola, 3 are sylvatic (not related to the outbreak), 12 are autochthonous and 3 are under final investigation.

Preventive vaccination campaigns are scheduled to begin on 17 Aug [2016] in 32 Health Zones in Kinshasa province and 16 Health Zones in border areas with Angola. Fractional dosing, also known as emergency vaccines, will be implemented in the vaccination campaigns in Kinshasa.

Vaccination
WHO has sent more than 28 million vaccine doses to Angola, DRC and Uganda through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile and with additional vaccines from Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.

As of 10 Aug 2016, 21 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 11.5 million doses for DRC.

Risk assessment
The outbreak in Angola is receding and no confirmed case has been reported in the country during July and beginning of August (as of 4 Aug [2016]). However, a high level of vigilance needs to be maintained throughout the country, and the pre-emptive mass vaccination campaign will be implemented as planned.

In DRC, there is a need for heightened vigilance as the outbreak has spread to new provinces and new Health Zones in the 3 previously affected provinces. Given the presence and activity of the vector aedes in the country and low immunity of the population, the outbreak might continue to extend to other provinces.

[An earlier report indicated that a new shipment of yellow fever (YF) vaccine was due to arrive on 10 Aug 2016 -- 3 days ago. An 11 Aug 2016 press release said that "WHO has sent more than 19 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine to Angola, DRC and Uganda" and that "Angola has received 15 million doses, DRC 3.2 million doses, and Uganda 800 000 doses of the yellow fever vaccines" http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/pressreleases/item/8888-who-calls-for-enhanced-vigilance-amidst-reports-of-declining-yellow-fever-cases.html. It must be hoped that the doses are available and ready for application when the massive campaign is slated to begin on Wednesday 17 Aug 2016. Kinshasa has some 11 million inhabitants and abundant mosquito vectors, so the risk of increasing incidence as well as spread to other provinces is real. Action is urgent. - Mod.TY

[2] Letter to WHO
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2016
From: Daniel R Lucey MD, MPH <daniel.lucey8@gmail.co> [edited]


I am writing this open letter to the WHO director-general, Dr Margaret Chan, to request respectfully that she reconvene the WHO IHR Emergency Committee on Yellow Fever that initially met 3 months ago on 19 May [2016]. I write as a ProMED-mail consultant and physician, having just returned from 2 weeks in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to understand better the yellow fever epidemic response in the region. The 2 main reasons to reconvene the WHO Emergency Committee are:

(1) to reconsider whether a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) should be declared by Dr Chan. Reasons to consider declaring a PHEIC include: (A) Continued spread of the yellow fever epidemic in the DRC (as noted in today's 12 Aug [2016] weekly WHO situation report); (B) Lack of sufficient yellow fever vaccine such that the unprecedented measure of offering a 1/5 dose of vaccine (thought to confer immunity for at least one year, in contrast to lifelong immunity after a full-dose), is scheduled to start 17 Aug [2016] as a pre-emptive vaccination campaign for over 8 million people in Kinshasa. (C) Concern that the yellow fever epidemic that began last December [2015] in Angola, then spread into the DRC, is now spreading into the Republic of Congo.

(2) The 2nd main reason to reconvene the WHO Emergency Committee is to discuss, with input from the Republic of Congo, what criteria warrant offering vaccination to the approx. 1.8 million people in Brazzaville, the capital of Republic of Congo, located within view directly across the Congo River from Kinshasa, the capital of DRC. In Kinshasa the entire approx. 11 million population will have been offered vaccine by the end of this month of August [2016]. The rainy season, with its proliferation of mosquitoes that can spread yellow fever, could begin by the end of September, adding urgency to vaccination campaigns and yellow fever surveillance.

Of note, a report shared this week by an official in Brazzaville states that as of 3 Aug 2016, in Republic of Congo 193 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported, 4 cases have tested positive for yellow fever IgM and 29 samples are awaiting test results ... currently, initial testing for yellow fever virus is performed by the national reference laboratory in neighboring DRC.

[The evidence for spread of YF into the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) is of significant concern. This is the 1st notification of that spread that ProMED-mail has received. Its occurrence may further complicate the vaccine availability situation, given the continued spread in the DRC and the demands for vaccine there.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Lucey for sharing his concern with our readers. - Mod.TY]
