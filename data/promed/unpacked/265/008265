["Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus in the family Retroviridae, subfamily Orthoretrovirinae

Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) occurs world-wide. The infection, formerly known as swamp fever, is limited to equids. The disease is characterised by recurrent febrile episodes, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, rapid loss of weight and oedema of the lower parts of the body. If death does not result from one of the acute clinical attacks, a chronic stage develops, and the infection tends to become inapparent. The incubation period is normally 1-3 weeks but may be as long as 3 months. In acute cases, lymph nodes, spleen and liver are hyperaemic and enlarged. Histologically these organs are infiltrated with nests of immature lymphocytes and plasma cells. Kupffer cells in the liver often contain haemosiderin or erythrocytes. The enlarged spleen may be felt on rectal examination.

Once a horse is infected with EIAV, its blood remains infectious for the remainder of its life. This means that the horse is a viraemic carrier and can potentially transmit the infection to other horses. Transmission occurs by transfer of blood from an infected horse. In nature, spread of the virus is most likely via interrupted feeding of bloodsucking horseflies on a clinically ill horse and then on susceptible horses. Transmission can also occur by the iatrogenic transfer of blood through the use of contaminated needles. In utero infection of the fetus may occur. The virus titre is higher in horses with clinical signs, and the risk of transmission is higher from these animals than the carrier animals with a lower virus titre.

EIAV is not considered a risk for human health."
