Highly pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), [Taiwan]
-----------------------------------------------------
General information
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 16 Nov 2021
Confirmed: 20 Nov 2021
Reported: 24 Dec 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 8 Nov 2021
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Summary of outbreaks
New outbreaks (9)
[The 9 outbreaks of HPAI subtype H5N2 (clade 2.3.4.4.b) occurred in the province of Taiwan in the following counties: Yunlin (6), Pingtung (1), Nantou (1), Changhwa (1). See details of each outbreak at the source URL above. - Mod.CRD]

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 66 408 / 10 707 / 10 624 / 53 029 / 2755 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: a novel H5N2 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b was isolated from a duck carcass near the wetlands along the Zhuoshui River on [9 Aug 2021]. Later, the same virus was found in poultry farming in both Yunlin County (6 farms) and Changhua County (1 farm near the Yunlin outbreak) under the annual active surveillance program for avian influenza. All farms have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after culling farmed birds. Adjacent farms within 3 km of the infected farms will be under strengthened surveillance for a period of 3 months. Suspected signs were observed in poultry carcasses during postmortem inspection in the abattoir in Pingtung County. Samples were sent to the Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for diagnosis. Novel H5N2 subtype HPAI was confirmed by the AHRI. The carcasses were destroyed, and thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted in the abattoir. After tracing back to the farm of origin, any positive results will be included in follow-up reports. Samples from Nantou County were sent to the National Laboratory, Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for diagnosis. Highly pathogenic avian influenza novel H5N2 subtype was confirmed by AHRI. The sampling spots in Nantou County were disinfected. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3 km [2 mi] radius of the sampling spot are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures applied in domestic: movement control inside the country; disinfection; zoning; surveillance within containment and or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone; stamping out.
Control measures to be applied in domestic: screening.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) National Laboratory/ birds / gene sequencing / [21 Nov to 17 Dec 2021] / positive
Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) National Laboratory/ birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / [20 Nov to 16 Dec 2021] / positive

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Black-faced spoonbill (_Platalea minor_): Threskiornithidae-Phaethontiformes / 0 / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on [15 Dec 2021] two _Platalea minor_ carcasses were found in Tainan City Sihcao Wildlife Refuge. H5N1 HPAI viruses were detected from the rotted _P. minor_ carcasses. The sequences of HA and NA genes showed 99-100% similarity to the sequences of H5N1 HPAI viruses identified in Korea and Japan analyzed by Animal Health Research Institute. According to the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, intensified surveillance will be carried out following the HPAI outbreak for three months.

Control measures applied [in wild]: zoning; surveillance within containment and or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone; disinfection
Control measures to be applied [in wild]: screening

[A presentation on the avian influenza situation in Taiwan made during the 3rd Regional Workshop for Avian Diseases in Asia and the Pacific, 29-30 Sep 2021, is available at https://rr-asia.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/day-2-c-taipei.pdf.

"Monitoring and controlling avian influenza at its poultry source is essential to decrease the virus load in susceptible avian species and the environment. Implementation of biosecurity measures, in line with OIE international standards, is key to secure the production sector and trade, to safeguard food security and the livelihoods of farmers (in particular in developing countries), as well as to limit the risk of human infection with avian influenza strains that have zoonotic potential."
