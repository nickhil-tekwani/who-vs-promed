The City of Hamilton on Friday [7 Sep 2018] confirmed its 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

A horse has tested positive for the virus, which is typically found in wild birds and transmitted by infected mosquitoes.

Generally, humans do not show symptoms when they are infected, according to public health. Yet in severe cases, EEE can progress to swelling of the brain, seizures, or a coma. Lesser symptoms include the sudden onset of chills, fever and vomiting.

To date, there are no confirmed cases of human illness related to the virus in Hamilton.

Residents are being advised to use bug spray with DEET, wear long sleeves and pants in wooded areas, and remove any standing water on their property to prevent potential breeding sites.

[It is unfortunate that this article does not mention vaccinating the horse or using equine-specific sprays for control of mosquitoes and flies on horses. It is also unfortunate there is no mention of cleaning up standing water, such as puddles, old tires holding water, even the catch pan of potted plants. Mosquito larvae are found in standing water puddles.

In addition to protecting yourself, please protect your equine friend by completing the vaccination regimen. Generally, an initial vaccination is followed 3-4 weeks later with a 2nd injection. Injections should be repeated approximately very 4-6 months, as immunity to EEE wanes fairly quickly.

Most EEE vaccines are combined with those for western equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, and tetanus, so you get a lot of bang for the buck when it comes to equine protection. If you have not vaccinated, please do so immediately. - Mod.TG
