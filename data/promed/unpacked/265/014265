Elk positive for disease exposure in Ruby Valley
------------------------------------------------
Wildlife officials report that blood tests on 12 of 100 elk that were
captured in southwestern Montana's Ruby Valley showed signs of
exposure to the animal disease brucellosis.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks on Friday [25 Feb 2011] released
results from the 1st round of a 5-year study to track the prevalence
of the disease.

Largely eradicated elsewhere in the country, brucellosis persists in
portions of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming surrounding Yellowstone
National Park. It causes elk, cattle, bison, and some other animals to
prematurely abort their young.

Government agencies go to great lengths to prevent transmissions from
bison to livestock, including periodic slaughters of bison that leave
the park. But dealing with infected elk has proven more difficult
since they are more numerous and far roaming than bison.

[Brucellosis in the wildlife remains a thorn to most regulatory
agencies. Indeed it is a complicated situation. Wildlife carrying the
disease can transmit it to domestic animals, which causes more testing
when shipping domestic animals.

However the feeding grounds for elk and bison in the winter are huge
tourist attractions and the public is loathe to hear of the slaughter
of these 2 great animals because of a disease they cannot see and has
no effect on trade issues. - Mod.TG]
