[Thanks to our colleagues at the National Epidemiologic Surveillance System
network of the Subscretariat for Prevention and Promotion of the Ministry
of Health of Argentina, we received a copy of a report with available
information on the actions and recommendations in response to the yellow
fever epizootic in monkeys in Rio Grande do Sul (Brasil). Translated and
edited by Mods. MPP and JW
Summary:
Between epidemiologic weeks 10 and 20 (4-10 Mar to 13-19 May) 2001, an
epizootic of yellow fever in monkeys was reported in the frontier zone
between the state of Rio Grande do Sul [Brazil and the Provinces of
Misiones and Corrientes [Argentina. In the surrounding populations of
those provinces the risk of an outbreak of urban yellow fever exists, due
to low yellow fever vaccination coverage, along with high indices of _Aedes
aegypti_ [the mosquito vector associated with urban yellow fever
transmission. - Mod.MPP and the simultaneous circulation of yellow fever
virus in the border primate populations.
Risk of Yellow Fever in the Provinces of Misiones and Corrientes: On 28 Jun
2001 notification was received from the National Coordination of SGT 11
"Health" MERCOSUR of an epizootic in howler monkeys in the state of Rio
Grande do Sul [Brazil, in the municipalities of Santo Antonio das Missoes
and Garruchos; the deaths of the monkeys were concentrated in the
localities of Cerro do Ouro and Rincao dos Mirandas.
In Argentina, on the left bank of the Uruguay river, there are 15 urban
populations within the Provinces of Misiones and Corrientes, with a total
of 100 982 inhabitants. The Department of Vector Control estimates that 100
percent of the municipalities in these zones have infestation indices with
_Aedes [aegypti_ mosquitos greater than 5 percent [the level at which
virus transmission can be maintained. The coverage with yellow fever
vaccine [in these populations is in general less than 10 percent. There
exists intense traffic between the neighboring areas [the populations in
the municipalities in Brazil and Argentina as mentioned above, due to
commerce between the small population on the 6 authorized border crossings
and an undetermined number of neighboring paths.
Immediate Response Actions: The Ministry of Health has made [yellow fever
vaccination available to the population in the border zone and in the
neighboring urban areas with a background of _Aedes aegypti_ infestation,
control actions integrated with vector control, educational campaigns in
the population and intensified surveillance for febrile illnesses [in the
population.
[Sequence of events:
2 May 2001: In the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RGS), inhabitants of the
municipalities of Garruchos and Santo Antonio das Missoes claimed that
during the preceding 2 months they encountered dead howler monkeys. Some of
the dead monkeys were sent to the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC) of Belem
(PA), and a live monkey that was captured was sent to the laboratories of
the Veterinary Pathology Department of the Federal University of Santa
Maria (UFSM).
14 May: Technicians from the Brazilian Environmental Institute (IBAMA) and
the IEC conducted field investigations on the deaths of more than 40 howler
monkeys in the municipalities of Garruchos and Santo Antonio das Missoes.
The results of the analyses performed on the monkeys were negative for
yellow fever.
18 May: The State of RGS Secretariat of Health (SES) mounted a preventive
vaccination campaign in the municipalities of Garruchos and Santo Antonio
das Missoes based on the suspicion of yellow fever. Vaccinations were
directed at the particular populations that live or are in contact with the
zone where the dead monkeys were found, among which were dam construction
workers and police teams that were involved in the sanitary barriers for
foot and mouth disease on the border with the Republic of Argentina. In
addition surveillance for suspect cases in the health services was intensified.
27 June The IEC confirmed the presence of yellow fever virus in 2 lots of
sylvan mosquitos _Haemogogus leucocelaenus_ captured in the municipality of
Santo Antonio das Missoes.
29 June: The SES of RGS prepared a campaign against dengue and yellow
fever, to include vaccination of approximately 447 233 persons in 43
municipalities. The campaign will begin around 15 Jul 2001.
Actions taken [by SINAVE
- Coordinating meeting of the Subsecretariat of Prevention and Promotion
Programs on the epizootic of yellow fever in Brazil.
- Notification of the risk [of yellow fever to the Provinces of Corrientes
and Misiones [Argentina in the border area.
- Coordination with the Directorate of Frontiers, Department of Vector
Control, Public Health Laboratories, to organize surveillance,
investigation and collaborative interventions.
- Coordination with the Vigia program [program of health surveillance and
disease control to help in the prevention and control interventions.
- Programming the provision of yellow fever vaccine to the Provinces of
Corrientes and Misiones [Argentina to begin control operations.
Recommendations:
1. Intensified epidemiologic surveillance: Cases that correspond to the
following definition should be notified and investigated with a clinical
epidemiologic form: A patient of any age, with a fever greater than 38 C,
jaundice, and any signs of hemorrhagic manifestations.
2. Health Services: Strengthening of laboratories to diagnose yellow fever.
Monitor yellow fever vaccination coverages in the zones at risk.
3. Education, information, and communication: Intensify information,
education and communication through the use of mass media to sensitize the
population on the need to be vaccinated.
4. Vaccination of populations at risk: In the rural population bordering
the epizootic zone, with greatest probability of exposure, the residents of
these communities and workers who enter the forest zone. In urban
populations near the epizootic zone, and in areas with _Aedes_ infestation,
they should vaccinate the population that has not previously been vaccinated.
5. _Aedes aegypti_ control campaigns: Reduction in the _Aedes aegypti_
indices in urban areas with environmental actions (disposal of unused
containers) and chemical control.

[Congratulations to Brazil for launching YF vaccination in the area, even
though the first monkeys tested negative (probably because the corpses were
too decomposed). It is always better to be safe than sorry, and in this
case the action was amply justified by the subsequent isolation of YF virus
from mosquitoes caught in the area. But it is disappointing that neither
SGT 11 "Health" of MERCOSUR nor Argentina seems to have taken note of the
early warning of monkey deaths in the border area in the media, posted in
ProMED-mail on 22 May 2001 (see ref. above), and that no official report of
those deaths has yet been sent to WHO. - Mod.JW
