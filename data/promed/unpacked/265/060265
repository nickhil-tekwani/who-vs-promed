One Case of Encephalitis in a Horse Detected
Residents Urged to Vaccinate Horses
Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA) Director Dan Wyant (Aug 10)
announced today the first reported case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis
(EEE) this year has occurred in a horse in Barry County. This diagnosis was
based on clinical signs and laboratory evaluation of brain tissue conducted
by the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory at Michigan State University.
This follows the report last week that the EEE virus had been detected in
mosquitoes from Gladwin County and from juvenile wild birds in Kalamazoo
County. These detections indicate the presence of EEE virus in those areas
and possibly other areas of southern Michigan.
Clinical signs of EEE (also known as sleeping sickness) in horses include
fever, progressive muscle incoordination, paralysis, blindness, and an
inability to rise. The fatality rate for this disease in horses often
reaches 95 percent. Human infection with the EEE virus is rare in Michigan
and is characterized by a high fever progressing rapidly to coma.
Horses and humans contract EEE from mosquitoes having fed on birds carrying
the virus. Birds are able to harbor the virus without becoming acutely ill
and serve as a reservoir for EEE. Horses do not develop a high enough level
of the virus in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans.
Horses that contract EEE, however, indicate that the virus is in a
particular region and should serve as a warning to residents to avoid being
bitten by mosquitoes.
*People can avoid the risk of EEE by taking reasonable precautions to
prevent being bitten by mosquitoes,* said Dr. Mary Grace Stobierski of the
Michigan Department of Community Health. *Avoid areas where mosquitoes are
prevalent, particularly during evening hours when they are most active, use
insect repellent when it is necessary to be out-of-doors, and repair
defective window and door screening to keep mosquitoes out.* The mosquitoes
most likely to carry the EEE virus are found near swamp areas in rural and
suburban areas.
EEE does not occur in Michigan every year; however, when it does occur it
can be fatal to humans and horses. Four human victims have died in Michigan
since 1980, the most recent in 1997. Since 1980, 254 horses in Michigan
have died from EEE.
Michigan has an active EEE Surveillance Program involving a cooperative
effort between MDA, the Michigan Department of Community health, Michigan
State University, 22 local health departments, nearly five dozen veterinary
practices, and 4 county-wide mosquito control programs. The EEE
Surveillance Program identifies and confirms cases of EEE in horses, traps
and test mosquitoes, identifies and tests wild bird flocks, and monitors
suspect human cases.
Detecting EEE is important because the disease is fatal in 90 to 95 percent
of infected horses and 60 percent of infected humans. Michigan physicians
are encouraged to submit specimens from suspect human cases to the Michigan
Department of Community Health Reference Laboratory in Lansing where a
rapid test is available to rule out this disease in humans.
A vaccine is available to prevent EEE in horses. Vaccination for humans is
neither readily available nor practical for routine human use. Horse owners
should contact their veterinarian to discuss vaccination against EEE.
Veterinarians should report all suspect EEE cases to MDAs Animal Industry
Division at (517) 373-1077. Physicians should immediately report all
suspect human cases to their local health departments.
The Michigan Department of Agriculture is the official state agency charged
with serving, promoting and protecting the food, agriculture and
agricultural economic interests of the people of the State of Michigan. MDA
supports agriculture, Michigan*s second-largest industry.
