At the height of tropical storm "Ondoy", a 24 year old man braved the
floods to save his neighbors from drowning in the murky floodwaters of
Santolan, Pasig City [one of the cities and municipalities that make up
Metro Manila]. Little did he know that his selfless act would eventually
cost him his precious health.

In an interview with GMA News' John Consulta, [the man], who saved the
lives of at least 15 people, turned to the camera and begged for rescue.
Doctors at the Rizal Medical Center said he is infected with leptospirosis
and is already in critical condition. [A woman] could not help but get
emotional when she talked about how her 21 year old son [also] suffers from
the disease. These men are only 2 of the hundreds of patients downed by
leptospirosis, a disease usually caused by exposure to water contaminated
with the urine of infected animals. In humans it causes a wide range of
symptoms, and some infected persons may exhibit no symptoms at all.

According to the Department of Health, at least 28 people have already
succumbed to leptospirosis this year [2009]. About 812 cases have also been
recorded from January to [13 Oct 2009]. Of these, 375 are from Metro
Manila. According to the Medical City hospital in Pasig, it is experiencing
shortage of rooms because of the sudden increase in the number of
leptospirosis cases. The Medical City is one of the top hospitals in the
country.

Maria Fe Raymundo-Tayzon, head of the hospital's infectious disease center,
told GMA News' Claire Delfin in an interview that it is necessary for all
government agencies concerned to work together to resolve the problem. From
[8-13 Oct 2009], the hospital has already admitted 93 cases, some coming
from Marikina [one of the cities and municipalities that make up Metro
Manila], one of the heavily submerged cities at the height of Ondoy.

Most of the patients are male whose ages range from 31 to 40. The report
said many of them have waded through the floods during the storm.

Apart from the threat of leptospirosis, flooding victims are also in danger
of acquiring diarrhea, cholera, influenza A (H1N1), and dengue. In Pasig
City Elementary School, GMA News' Trisha Zafra reported that a lot of
children ages 2 and below are infected with diarrhea due to contaminated
tap water. DOH Epidemiology Center chief Eric Tayag assured that the
government is now monitoring cases of diarrhea and cholera due to the
possibility that their drinking water may be contaminated.

He advised residents wading in floodwaters to see a doctor immediately when
they encounter symptoms such as chills, red eyes, or yellow skin, and not
to wait until it is too late. "Patients who went to us turned out to have
renal failure. It turned out they sought medical attention too late," he
said. He also said residents should boil their drinking water or at least
use a chlorine solution to stave off diseases from contaminated water, such
as diarrhea and cholera.

As of 13 Oct 2009, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said 45 129
families or 216 941 people displaced by storm Ondoy are staying in 443
evacuation centers mostly in Metro Manila and the provinces of Rizal and
Laguna.

Leptospirosis [is] a bacterial infection caused by a corkscrew-shaped
bacterium called _Leptospira_. [It] occurs through direct contact with the
urine of infected animals or by contact with a urine-contaminated
environment such as surface water, floodwater, soil, and plants. [It]
affects both humans and animals. Leptospira have been found in rats,
insectivores, dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, and horses. [The] bacteria enter
through broken skins, through eyes, nose, or mouth exposed to contaminated
water although less frequently through animal bites, handling infected
animal tissues, or swallowing contaminated food or water.

[Leptospirosis is] an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or
with animals, such as rice and sugar-cane field workers, farmers, sewer
workers, veterinarians, dairy workers, and military personnel. [It is] a
recreational hazard to those who swim or wade in contaminated waters. In
endemic areas the number of leptospirosis cases may peak during the rainy
season and even may reach epidemic proportions in case of flooding.

The incubation period lasts 7 to 12 days. During this period, the symptoms
[include] (although sometimes it can also be asymptomatic) high fever,
severe headache, chills, muscle pain, vomiting, jaundice, redness in the
eyes, abdominal pain, hemorrhages in skin and mucous membranes (including
pulmonary bleeding), diarrhea, and rash. However, if these aren't treated,
they may develop into kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, and
respiratory distress.

[To prevent leptospirosis] reduce the rat population with the destruction
of their habitats; maintain a clean home; avoid immersion in natural waters
such as rivers, lakes and canals; avoid immersion in floods; use protective
footwear or clothing when immersion to natural waters or floods is
inevitable; and provide clean drinking water. (Source: GMA News Research,

[Metro Manila and 25 Luzon provinces experienced heavy rains and flooding
brought on by the storm called Ondoy in the last week of September 2009. It
caused the worst flooding seen in the capital in 20 years.

Leptospirosis is a frequently waterborne zoonotic disease. Cases of this
spirochetal infection invariably increase during flooding. More than 90 per
cent of patients with leptospirosis have a mild, self-limited illness, with
fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, pharyngitis,
skin rash, and muscle pain especially in calves and lumbar region, which is
rarely fatal. About 10 per cent develop a more severe illness with
myocardial, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic involvement that may be fatal in
5-40 per cent. In recent studies of patients admitted to hospitals, about
20 per cent die (see
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/513767> and
<http://www.psmid.org.ph/vol31/vol31num4topic1.pdf>).

Leptospirosis is usually treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone
intravenously for severe disease and doxycycline or amoxicillin for milder
disease; penicillin therapy may be complicated by a Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction [temporary worsening of clinical status in patients undergoing
anti-infective treatment, when large quantities of toxins are released into
the body as bacteria die). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ] Efficacy of antibiotic therapy
when used late in the course of the disease may be limited by the
immunologic causation of the 2nd phase of this illness. For a review of
leptospirosis, see Levett PN. Leptospirosis. Clin Microbiol Rev 2001; 14:
296-326, available at <http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/14/2/296>.

Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for
short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (Takafuji ET, Kirkpatrick
JW, Miller RN, et al. An efficacy trial of doxycycline chemoprophylaxis
against leptospirosis. N Engl J Med 1984; 310: 497-500, abstract available
