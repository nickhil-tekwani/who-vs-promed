The JAMA publication mentioned by Col John Grabenstein is available from
the JAMA web site
<http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/287/12/1556.pdf>

According to the authors of this paper, "The study does not have adequate
statistical power to rule out a small effect of vaccination on adverse
birth outcomes, given the low incidence of adverse outcomes. A post hoc
power analysis showed the study only had a 12 percent power to detect a 20
percent increase in abnormal birth outcomes, based on potential effects on
likelihood of pregnancy."

In their abstract they state, "However, this study did not have sufficient
power to detect adverse birth outcomes" but conclude that "Anthrax
vaccination had no effect on pregnancy and birth rates or adverse birth
outcomes."

Medline abstract:
Wiesen AR, Littell CT. Relationship between prepregnancy anthrax
vaccination and pregnancy and birth outcomes among US Army women. JAMA.
2002 Mar 27;287(12):1556-60.

Context: Substantial concern surrounds the potential health effects of the
anthrax vaccine, particularly the potential adverse effects on reproductive
processes.

Objective: To determine whether receipt of anthrax vaccination by
reproductive-aged women has an effect on pregnancy rates.

Design, setting, and patients: Cohort study, based on information from a
computer database, of women aged 17 to 44 years who were stationed at Fort
Stewart, Ga, or Hunter Army Airfield, Ga, from January 1999 through March
2000.

Main outcome measures: Pregnancy and birth rates and adverse birth outcomes.

Results: Of a total of 4092 women, 3136 received at least 1 dose of the
anthrax vaccine. There was a total of 513 pregnancies, with 385 following
at least 1 dose of anthrax vaccine. The pregnancy rate ratio (before and
after adjustment for marital status, race, and age) comparing vaccinated
with unvaccinated women was 0.94 (95 percent confidence interval [CI],
0.8-1.2; P =.60). There were 353 live births and 25 pregnancies lost to
follow-up. The birth odds ratio after anthrax vaccination (before and after
adjustment for marital status and age) was 0.9 (95 percent CI, 0.5-1.4; P
=.55). After adjusting for age, the odds ratio for adverse birth outcome
after receiving at least 1 dose of anthrax vaccination was 0.9 (95 percent
CI, 0.4-2.4; P =.88). However, this study did not have sufficient power to
detect adverse birth outcomes.

Conclusion: Anthrax vaccination had no effect on pregnancy and birth rates
or adverse birth outcomes.

I cited the Wiesen & Littell article for what it informs us regarding lack
of difference in rates of conception and rates of delivery (i.e. lack of
miscarriage) before or after anthrax vaccination. Among the 353 live
births, no unusual patterns were seen, but issues of statistical power do
apply, as the authors noted. This led to my comments about the pending
report of chart review and blinded analysis of birth defects being
performed jointly by the Naval Health Research Center and the Centers for
Disease Control & Prevention.

Anthrax vaccination of troops is in part the subject of a senate
investigation (on 'Current health preparation arrangements for the
deployment of Australian Defence Forces overseas'), but it is early days,
and not much is yet available on this inquiry. The Defence Department's
submission to the inquiry does not mention birth defects. The issues are
more about 'informed consent' and the fact that some troops who declined to
have the vaccine were excluded from undertaking duties: some were even
'sent home'. Media coverage has focused on a range of 'side effects'
allegedly reported by troops who had the vaccine. However, I've seen
nothing (so far) on claims of any foetal/neonatal effects, but I've not
been following this closely.

[For those interested] other submissions to the senate investigation (most
are available online):

[Mike has kindly offered to forward more information on the Australian
military problems with the UK vaccine as it comes available. Reading
between the lines of his comments it seems Australia may be a replay of the
vaccine side-effects sensitivity that we witnessed in the US a few years
ago. From what I saw when visiting a number of US Air National Guard units
at the time, that sensitivity reflected more the concerns of members of the
National Guard with prolonged periods abroad in a time of peace than actual
side-effect rates and severity -- and therefore of troop morale and
leadership. And as one can see from John's responses, the problem of
possible side-effects is under constant review in the US military. - Mod.MHJ]
