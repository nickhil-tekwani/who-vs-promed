As of today, 6 Apr 2014, there are NO laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone (SL).

On 23 Mar 2014, samples from 2 suspected Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) patients from Guinea collected by the Guinean authorities were referenced to the Ministry of Health & Sanitation (MOHS, Sierra Leone) investigation field team and subsequently referred to the Kenema Government Hospital reference laboratory. All were found to be negative for Ebola, Lassa fever, Marburg, and yellow fever [viruses] by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR].

On 25 Mar 2014, an MOHS multidisciplinary field team carried out epidemiological investigations to examine reports on the death of a suspected case (one of 2 previous reported to ProMED-mail). The patient had expired and was buried prior to the arrival of the investigation team. In total, 15 close case contacts were identified, sampled and tested negative by RT-PCR for all existing known 5 Ebola virus species.

On 3 and 4 Apr [2014], disease surveillance officers and district medical officers investigated one suspected case from Bombali and 2 suspected cases from Bombali and Kambia. These 3 cases were sampled and were negative for Ebola virus by conventional and real-time RT-PCR. Additional testing protocols are ongoing to test for other viral pathogens.

In order to effectively manage this emergency, the SL MOHS established a National Outbreak Response Taskforce, and the following actions have been undertaken in response to the potential for spread of the epidemic:

- the office of the chief medical officer (CMO) is coordinating all operations involving suspected cases of Ebola as well as the follow-up investigation;
- active surveillance of suspected cases meeting the WHO case definition for either Ebola or Lassa fever is ongoing and on an as-needed basis;
- national taskforce biweekly meetings are being held, bringing together all senior officials of national and international health institutions to provide them with relevant information in real time;
- the MOHS, the UN, foreign governments, NGOs and other national and international stakeholders are currently positioning support funds and other resources to aid in sensitization, distribution of PPE and care guidelines, educational campaigns by radio and television, and other support;
- the MOHS has established a central reporting "hotline" for the reporting of suspected viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF);
- radio and television "jingles" have been developed in local languages to sensitize the community to this disease;
- daily press conferences are being held by the MOHS to inform the public and prevent panic initiated by the spread of rumors;
- just in time, barrier care and isolation ward training is being conducted using the train-the-trainer method at the Kenema Government Hospital VHF Ward, where the WHO manual for the management of VHF in the African Setting will be distributed, along with local materials needed to construct makeshift isolation wards;
- a locally produced educational skit aimed at Ebola prevention and sensitization is under way and will be distributed via national television and through NGO networks;
- standardized data collection forms for surveillance, VHF notification, and VHF clinical care were adapted for local use and are being distributed at in-country training sessions to appropriate parties;
- the WHO standardized Ebola case definition is currently being distributed to all healthcare facilities;
- locally adapted public health prevention campaign posters are in the final stages of development and will be distributed nationwide;

As part of an existing collaboration between the SL MOHS, Metabiota and the USAMRIID Diagnostics Systems Division, the Kenema Government Hospital reference laboratory had previously installed a Zaire Ebola-specific PCR, which was used to screen the 1st contact cases from Sierra Leone reported to ProMED.

The MOHS/WHO/Metabiota response team has installed and is currently running a full suite of Ebola-specific and differential diagnostics, including the WHO recommended Ebola Zaire-specific RT-PCR, Ebola Zaire-specific antigen and IgM capture ELISAs, a pan-filovirus RT-PCR, as well as published PCR assays for the detection of Lassa fever, yellow fever and other confounding locally endemic pathogens.

The MOHS and other partners are providing the recommended full personal protection equipment (PPE) for health workers exposed to suspected cases.

The MOHS National Task Force is continuing to actively conduct surveillance for Ebola virus, as well as Lassa fever, which is hyperendemic in eastern Sierra Leone, and the Kenema Government Hospital Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Ward has been designated as the central receiving and treatment facility for anyone suspected of contracting either Ebola or Lassa fever [virus infections]. This facility is highly specialized in the treatment and management of viral hemorrhagic fevers. A specialized barrier-care, infectious disease ambulance provided by Metabiota to transport acute Lassa fever patients is also being used to transport suspected cases, and every precaution is being made to protect both health care workers and local populations from the risk of spread of the disease.

Metabiota Inc., working under the direct supervision of the SL MOHS and the WHO Country Office (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4079-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-5-april-2014.html) is being supported by a US government inter-agency response effort, including the DTRA Cooperative Biological Engagement Program, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Integrated Research Facility, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, the US DoD Critical Reagents Program, and other US and international partners.

Just-in-time, hands-on clinical management training for district healthcare workers, including how to set up local isolation wards, will be conducted in the next week. Additional training and VHF sensitization will also be provided to National level and District level surveillance officers as well as border checkpoint health surveillance workers. Each training event will be used as a distribution opportunity for up to date materials, as well as the recommended PPE and instructions on its use. The training of trainers for clinical personnel is being managed by Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, chief physician of the Lassa fever ward at the Kenema Government Hospital, and Dr Jean-Paul Gonzalez, Metabiota senior scientist and physician, according to the WHO manual on the control of viral hemorrhagic fevers.

The test result of blood samples collected from a 12 year old suspected to have been killed by the deadly Ebola [virus] disease has proven negative. The Noguchi Memorial Institute took the samples to test following the girl's death at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi at the weekend.

Suggestions the girl might have died of Ebola [virus infection] was a matter of concern to Ghana's health officials and members of the public. The virus has already claimed more than 80 lives in Guinea alone. It has also killed more than 5 people in Liberia.

Though controversy surrounding the girl's death has been dealt with now, the Health Ministry is leaving nothing to chance. Minister of health Sherry Ayittey, who confirmed the test result at a press conference in Accra on Monday [7 Apr 2014], said 66 quarantine centres would be set up, especially at health facilities across the country.

The ministry is also looking at having similar facilities at the nation's border entries, wild game, or forest reserves. A taskforce is already in place to monitor a possible occurrence of the disease.

Guinea's government raised the death toll in the Ebola epidemic raging through its southern forests and capital to 95 on Mon 31 Mar 2014. The health ministry added 9 deaths to the toll of 86 given before the weekend, saying that 52 cases had been confirmed in laboratories to be the killer tropical virus.

"Up to now, the Guinean authorities have registered 151 suspect cases and 95 deaths," the ministry's chief disease prevention officer Sakoba Keita told AFP, without specifying the locations of the new deaths.

A number of patients have been discharged from Ebola treatment centres after beating the virus. Marie-Claire Lamah, a Guinean doctor working for medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres [MSF; doctors without borders] in its treatment centre in Conakry was quoted as saying: "When the 1st patient came out from the treatment centre, I was so happy, and the whole team was cheering!"

Various studies -- including a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine last year [2013] -- have demonstrated some immunity in survivors from the particular strain to which they were exposed, but life-long immunity has not been demonstrated. MSF said it was working with local communities to ensure that discharged patients who have beaten the virus can return home safely and that everyone understands they are no longer contagious. "We explain to the families and neighbours that the patient is now negative and doesn't present any risks to anyone; they can be kissed, touched and hugged without any risk of contagion," says MSF health promoter Ella Watson-Stryker. MSF has some 60 international staff working in Guinea and has flown in more than 40 tons of supplies to tackle the epidemic.

Ebola [virus infection] leads to haemorrhagic fever, which causes muscle pain, weakness, vomiting, diarrhoea and, in severe cases, organ failure and unstoppable bleeding. The tropical virus can be transmitted to humans from wild animals, and between humans through direct contact with another's blood, faeces or sweat. Sexual contact, or the unprotected handling of contaminated corpses, can also lead to infection.

[It is curious that the additional 9 fatal cases were not included in the WHO fatal case count reported on 5 Apr 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive 20140406.2385791). It will be of interest to see whether the 95 cases are cited in subsequent reports.

The motorcyclist who drove the last victim of the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia is reported to be ailing, and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare wants the public to help find him before he spreads it on to others.

Health minister Dr Walter Gwenigale made the disclosure last Friday shortly after the World Health Organization (WHO) presented a consignment of protective gear to Liberia to aid health workers in the fight against the killer virus.

"The motorcycle driver who drove that sick woman to Firestone -- and the woman has already died -- that motorcycle driver is sick," the minister said. "They called us last night; we sent people to go and find him, but when we got there, they said that the mother had taken him somewhere. Now we are looking for him because whoever gets in contact with that young man including the mother now, is in trouble. So you have to help us to get the word around that whoever has that young man somewhere, please turn him over to us so we can take care of him."

The yet-to-be-identified deceased woman contracted the virus from Foyah Lofa County. The latest woman to die from the Ebola virus at Firestone contracted Ebola while caring for her sister who died of Ebola in Foya, Lofa County. The woman had been at Firestone under observation in isolation. Prior to that, she left the Foya area late on the night of 29 Mar 2014 and travelled via taxi to Monrovia to see her husband. Five other people were in the taxi with her, including the driver. The woman then took a motorcycle to a nearby clinic, where she was seen and released.

In addition, authorities are said to be on the lookout for at least 40 people who may or may not have crossed paths with the deceased woman. Until her death, the woman and her family were being quarantined in their home until they could be moved to an appropriate facility. Although the Health Ministry has been monitoring those who came in contact with the woman, including the taxi driver, the failure of authorities to find the motorcyclist could hamper attempts by health authorities to stop the deadly virus in its tracks.

[This story illustrates the difficulty in tracing contacts in a highly mobile population. One hopes that the other 40 individuals were not exposed. It would be unusual if the motorcyclist who transported the patient to the hospital or 40 others in casual contact with the infected person became infected during, before, or after the ride. Transmission occurs when people are exposed to blood or other bodily fluids, or are in physical contact with acutely ill or deceased individuals.

ProMED-mail thanks Ryan McGinnis for sending in this report.
