The Department of Natural Resources [DNR] is investigating a fish
kill of approximately 300-500 common carp in Kent Lake in Livingston
County and in portions of the Huron River upstream of the
impoundment.

"The fish kill started around [14 Jun 2011] and we have already
collected samples to try to determine the cause," said Liz
Hay-Chmielewski, DNR Fisheries Division Lake Erie Management Unit
supervisor.

"This is a relatively small fish kill and there is no reason for
anglers not to fish or boaters not to use this lake."

Fish kills at this time of year are usually associated with
weather-related conditions, though occasionally they can be caused by
pollution or improper use of herbicides or other chemicals. Disease is
sometimes also a factor.

"It will take 2 to 4 weeks to get laboratory information back to
allow us to understand what the cause of the fish kill could be," said
Gary Whelan, DNR Fisheries Division's fish production manager.

"We want to remind anglers and boaters that they need to drain bilges
and live wells upon leaving water, clean their boats and disinfect
their gear, and not to move live fish in order to reduce the
possibility of any fish diseases being transported from waterbody to
waterbody."

The public is encouraged to report any significant fish kills by
sending an email to <DNR-FISH-Report-Fish-Kills@michigan.gov>.

[This may be a relatively small fish kill in the grand scheme of
things and certainly ProMED-mail has reported on much larger
situations. However what is appalling about this article is the length
of time it takes for the laboratory to return results. While some
testing takes some time, this kind of turn around time for results is
way too long. What if this were a large fish kill or had human
implications? What could be the consequences then?

We appreciate Michigan contacting us and look forward to the
results.- Mod.TG]
