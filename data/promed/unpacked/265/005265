We have two comments on Florida's "TICK ALERT - HELP STOP THE SPREAD OF
HEARTWATER DISEASE" [ProMED-mail 20000109133946 cited above: 1) The
posting implies heartwater has been imported into the United States. In
fact, heartwater has never been diagnosed in the United States; 2)
Potential tick vectors of heartwater are foreign animal disease agents;
suspects should be sent to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA),
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL).
Any ticks, especially those suspected to be exotic, those collected from
exotic animals, or those collected from recently imported animals should be
sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, P.O. Box 844, Ames,
Iowa 50010. The parasitology unit of the NVSL is headquarters for the
National Tick Surveillance Program and the USDA reference center for
identifying animal ectoparasites. Specialists in the unit are highly
experienced and skilled in identifying both domestic and exotic ticks from
all kinds of animals, including reptiles.
USDA, Veterinary Services, Emergency Programs staff and parasitologists at
NVSL regard introduction of any exotic tick into the United States as a
potential foreign animal disease incursion. Veterinary Services has
procedures, trained personnel, and resources devoted to eradicating or
controlling such introductions. However, we must know about the
introductions to respond. Sending all suspected exotic ticks directly to
the NVSL will shorten the response time and dramatically improve chances of
successful control or eradication should a significant event occur.
