[3] Cruise ships: overview
Date: Sat 25 Apr 2020
Source: The Washington Post [abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/cruise-ships-coronavirus/


On land, more than 300 000 people worldwide had contracted the deadly coronavirus [COVID-19], and the governor of California had just ordered all 39 million residents to stay at home. But as the Celebrity Eclipse cruise ship steamed north across the Pacific Ocean on [21 Mar 2020], hundreds of passengers crammed together on the ship's pool deck and overlooking gangways. As they stood shoulder-to-shoulder and crowded around pool chairs, the captain led the ship in a special salute to healthcare workers of the world, an onboard version of the nightly applause adopted by some cities to honor medical professionals battling the novel coronavirus.

Five days later and thousands of miles away in the Atlantic, a group of British passengers aboard another ship, Coral Princess, likewise gathered elbow-to-elbow to cheer the United Kingdom's National Health Service. The celebratory mood did not last long. Soon, passengers on both ships were contending with flu-like symptoms.

There have been 150 coronavirus cases and 6 deaths reported so far among passengers of the 2 vessels, which finally docked weeks after the virus was declared a global health crisis, according to a Washington Post tally. 2 people died on the Coral Princess before passengers could even come ashore in Miami.

The Eclipse and the Coral Princess were among scores of ships that continued voyages even after early outbreaks on other vessels, carrying thousands of international passengers to far-flung ports and helping seed the virus around the globe, health officials say.

A Post review of cruise line statements, government announcements, and media reports found that the coronavirus infected passengers and crew on at least 55 ships that sailed in the waters off nearly every continent, about a 5th of the total global fleet. The industry's decision to keep sailing for weeks after the coronavirus was first detected in early February [2020] on a cruise ship off the coast of Japan, despite the efforts by top US health officials to curtail voyages, was among a number of decisions that health experts and passengers say contributed to the mounting toll.

At least 65 people who traveled or worked on the ships have since died, according to The Post tally, although the full scope of deaths is unknown. A similar review by the Miami Herald also identified 65 deaths linked to ships.

Public health experts say that a number of factors contributed to the rapid spread of the virus around the world, predominantly air travel; an estimated 4.54 billion people flew last year [2019], compared with the 30 million passengers who traveled on cruise ships worldwide. But with hundreds of people dining, swimming, and dancing together over a sustained period of time, the ships provide unique environments for disease to spread, they say. "People on a large ship, all together, at the same time, all the time -- you couldn't ask for a better incubator for infection," Anthony S Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert, said in February [2020].

For their part, US agencies struggled to manage the escalating crisis, initially deferring to the industry's own plan to manage the pandemic. Until early this month [April 2020], federal health officials also allowed passengers who left infected ships but appeared healthy to board commercial airlines home. Even as the virus exploded into a global story, cruise officials failed to immediately recognize flu-like outbreaks as possible signs of the coronavirus, passengers said. In many instances, they did not immediately isolate passengers in their cabins when sickness broke out. In some cases, such as on the Celebrity Eclipse and the Coral Princess, those aboard said they were reassured by company officials there was no coronavirus infection on their ships -- even as some travelers were wracked with fevers and coughs.

Officials with the cruise industry said they took extraordinary efforts to limit outbreaks of the new virus on ships and get tens of thousands of passengers and crew home safely as the pandemic spread, going beyond measures adopted by other industries.

Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise company and the parent company of Princess Cruises, noted that federal health officials initially issued limited warnings about the risks of cruises and that the company voluntarily paused new voyages in mid-March [2020].

But top US health officials said there is evidence that cruise ships have been a factor in the spread of the coronavirus, both aboard ships and through their travel. A no-sail order extended for at least 100 days this month by Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found "cruise-ship travel exacerbates the global spread of COVID-19" and "has not been controlled sufficiently by the cruise ship industry or individual state or local health authorities."

Early warnings
--------------
One of the world's 1st indications of the wild infectiousness of the coronavirus came in February [2020], when it whipped through the Diamond Princess, a 2666-passenger ship docked at a port in Japan. A study published in March [2020] by the CDC found that the coronavirus was brought aboard by a passenger but quickly jumped to the crew, including those responsible for preparing food, and spread quickly among ship workers from there. More than 700 passengers and crew members ultimately tested positive and 13 died. Some Americans tested positive for the coronavirus only after they were aboard buses headed to government-chartered airplanes to be flown back to the United States.

James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who traveled to Japan to help Americans evacuate, said the Diamond Princess demonstrated the difficulty of attempting to discern sick from healthy people in a closed environment like a cruise ship. "You just have to treat everybody like they're infected," he said.

It was a lesson that the cruise industry and government agencies took weeks to absorb. In late January [2020], cruise lines started to step up health screenings and deny boarding to people who had recently been in China. Cruise officials assured passengers that they had increased cleanings on ships. More hand sanitizer became available as the crisis went on, passengers said. On some ships, buffet meals became plated affairs. But top US health officials did not view the measures as sufficient. On [8 Mar 2020], Fauci warned older people and those with underlying health issues to avoid cruise ships.

The following day, another coronavirus-stricken cruise ship docked in Oakland, California. The Grand Princess, which had left San Francisco on [21 Feb 2020] for a cruise to Hawaii, had idled for days before officials decided to send many of its American passengers to military bases across the country for quarantine. Ultimately, more than 130 people from the ship tested positive, and at least 6 have died, including 5 passengers and 1 crew member, according to authorities and the cruise line.

Health experts noted that the ships' tight quarters, their communal eating and entertainment, and older passenger demographics made them especially vulnerable. "This is not to point blame," said Marty Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, in an interview earlier this month [April 2020]. "But we have to be honest about the science and the evidence." He said widespread testing of passengers on the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess showed that the "attack rate" of the coronavirus on board was especially high. "We don't see those kinds of attack rates in other settings -- even in household settings," he said. "Even in cities experiencing outbreaks, this is pretty dramatic."

Pushing back against restrictions
---------------------------------
Tensions were running high as top officials from the Jamaican government squared off against top cruise executives in Florida for an emergency summit on [6 Mar 2020]. The coronavirus was spreading, and Caribbean countries worried about their citizens' exposure began to impose new rules on ships and limit access to their ports.

When the Dominican Republic turned away a ship after reports of passengers with flu-like symptoms in late February [2020], the ship's operator, Britain-based Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, issued a statement calling the government's move an "overreaction." Jamaica barred port entry [27 Feb 2020] to people traveling from areas with known COVID-19 outbreaks, such as Italy, and the following day denied entry to all Italian passengers who arrived on the Costa Luminosa ship. A few days later, officials put out interim guidelines that also required ships to document illness on board and conduct temperature checks.

The standoff threatened one of the region's biggest economic drivers. Cruise companies employ thousands of people on Caribbean islands and deliver an estimated USD 2.5 billion in tourism dollars, according to industry estimates. 2 days after Florida meetings [with cruise line officials], Jamaican authorities announced that after "rigorous" discussions, the cruise lines had accepted the country's health protocols, including the submission of medical logs for review and the quarantining on board of anyone with symptoms who had visited a country with COVID-19.

By early March 2020, several top health officials and members of the administration's coronavirus task force wanted to impose a temporary ban on Americans going on cruise ships, as The Post previously reported. They included Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma, and Surgeon General Jerome M Adams. Behind the scenes, the industry scrambled to head off a no-sail order.

The day after meeting with the Jamaican officials, top cruise line executives huddled in Fort Lauderdale with Vice President Pence, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, arguing cruise lines could voluntarily contain the outbreak. On [10 Mar 2020], the industry submitted a plan to the White House that proposed measures including stepped-up health screenings, monitoring of passengers and requiring a doctor's note for passengers older than 70. At the time, Adam Goldstein, global chair of the Cruise Lines International Association, told The Post that it was "a very practical, actionable plan that makes a difference." Days later, under pressure from the administration, the industry abruptly went further, voluntarily suspending new voyages to and from the United States for a month.

It still wasn't enough. On [14 Mar 2020], the CDC issued a no-sail order for 30 days -- and noted that there were already signs of COVID-19 clusters associated with cruise ships, including in communities far from the water.

Tracking the spread
-------------------
In Iowa, state health officials found that the state's 1st 16 confirmed coronavirus cases were all part of a group that had recently returned from a cruise on the Nile River in Egypt. Pockets of cases were linked to the same cruise voyage in Houston and Maryland. The March [2020] CDC study found that cruise ship-linked cases accounted for 17 percent of all known cases in the United States between the key early weeks of the spread from [3 Feb 2020] to [13 Mar 2020]. Those cases included passengers returning from the Diamond Princess, the site of one of the biggest outbreaks in the world in mid-February [2020].

The biggest driver of the coronavirus cases in Australia has been an outbreak on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney on [19 Mar 2020]. Authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the ship, which has been linked to 21 deaths and more than 600 positive cases.

And in France, authorities have grappled with a massive outbreak on a ship that had not yet carried any passengers. There, the brand new Celebrity Apex -- which boasted more than 2 dozen restaurants, bars, and lounges and a venue towering 13 stories above sea level -- had been preparing for its 1st sail, a 4-night preview cruise scheduled to leave [1 Apr 2020]. By early March [2020], 1400 crew members were living on board the ship, preparing to welcome its 1st guests. A lawsuit filed by a crew member alleges that contractors continued to board the vessel, and Celebrity conducted crew drills even after signs of the coronavirus began to appear. So far, 284 crew members have tested positive, according to French health authorities.

Along with airplanes, cruise ships also played a role in the spread of the virus in the Caribbean, a region with small island populations and a fragile health-care system. While air travelers brought the 1st cases to islands such as St Lucia and Cuba, cruise passengers were the 1st confirmed coronavirus patients in places such as the Cayman Islands and Puerto Rico, according to local health officials. A Post analysis found that 5 ships -- the Costa Favolosa, Costa Magica, Costa Luminosa, MS Braemar, and MSC Meraviglia -- made 18 stops in the Caribbean between [29 Feb 2020] and [11 Mar 2020] while carrying someone who later tested positive for coronavirus.

Dozens of passengers who disembarked in their native countries in the region have since tested positive. Among former passengers from the Costa Favolosa, there have been at least 52 COVID-19 cases and one death in Trinidad and Tobago, 13 cases in the Dominican Republic, and 2 cases in the French territory of Martinique, according to local health officials.

MSC Cruises said it "has no reason to believe" that the MSC Meraviglia contributed to any local outbreak, saying it screened the health and travel history of its passengers and has had no known cases on any ships while sailing. After a Canadian passenger who had traveled on that ship tested positive nearly 6 days after disembarking, the ship isolated 7 crew members who had contact with him and never showed symptoms, the company said. Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, which operates the MS Braemar, said that once it learned that 2 passengers from a previous Caribbean cruise had been diagnosed with COVID-19, it arranged to test those currently on board who had flu-like symptoms. When 6 people tested positive, it barred passengers from disembarking until the ship ended its journey in Cuba.

'This is COVID-19'
------------------
The emergency medical treatment of passengers placed a significant burden on the region's healthcare infrastructure. Much of a hospital in the Cayman Islands was shuttered for 2 weeks after a 68-year-old Italian man who suffered a stroke was evacuated from the Costa Luminosa ship on [29 Feb 2020] and later tested positive for the coronavirus [note that strokes associated with microclots have been identified as related to COVID-19. - Mod.MPP] More than 40 healthcare workers who came into contact with the man and their families were quarantined, and the nation's limited testing capabilities were used to test nurses and other patients in the hospital, according to a spokesperson for Health City Cayman Islands, where the passenger was treated. The hospital reported 6 positive cases connected to the passenger, including 4 healthcare workers. On the Costa Luminosa's next sail around the Caribbean, the ship dropped off an Italian couple in Puerto Rico on [8 Mar 2020] after the woman was experiencing flu-like symptoms.

Carmen Cruz, who owns the ambulance company that transported her to a hospital, said the dispatcher told local medical personnel that the woman possibly had pneumonia -- but that COVID-19 was not suspected. "As soon as they described the symptoms, we said, 'This is COVID-19,' " Cruz said. "They described it saying 'No, that this was pneumonia, and she had a history of respiratory issues.' " At the time, Puerto Rico had no other confirmed cases of the illness. The woman and her husband tested positive for the coronavirus on [13 Mar 2020]. She died 8 days later.

While the woman was still in the hospital, Costa Luminosa officials isolated those who were in close contact with her, and then took further measures when it got the results of her test, quarantining all guests and performing daily temperature checks, according to the company. Still, signs of sickness spread as the ship traveled across the Atlantic and into the Mediterranean, where it struggled for days to find a port that would accept its passengers. Finally, 350 Americans and Canadians disembarked [19 Mar 2020] in Marseille, France. The group was crowded together on buses and then an airplane to Atlanta, where the CDC allowed many to enter the terminal and then board commercial airliners home.

It would take more than 2 more weeks for the CDC to change its guidelines about disembarking passengers from stricken ships, barring even those without symptoms from further commercial travel. Cetron, the CDC's head of global migration and quarantine, said the agency shifted courses after fully realizing the implications of asymptomatic transmission. "Not only is this virus fast moving in terms of its spread and transmission and stealth, it's also teaching us every day something new," he said.

As of [20 Apr 2020], at least 145 crew members and 48 passengers who were aboard the Costa Luminosa have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Costa Cruises. Former passengers who have started a Facebook page to track their experiences have reported accounts of at least 7 deaths.

Aboard the Celebrity Eclipse and Coral Princess, the vicious virus seemed a world away as the ships headed in early March [2020] toward Cape Horn at the tip of South America -- a bucket list trip for many cruisers. "There were whales and penguins and glaciers. You name it, we saw it," said [a passenger from the ship]. Then countries began barring ships from docking. Off the west coast of South America, Chile prohibited the Eclipse from scheduled stops there. On the other side of the continent, Uruguay and Argentina did the same to the Coral Princess. There was confusion on both ships, where passengers initially believed their days at sea had kept them walled off from the coronavirus.

By late March 2020, both ships were headed toward the United States, where they could finally disembark -- California for the Eclipse and Florida for the Coral Princess.

"The ship is virus free, so we can move around as normal with no social isolation," [a] British passenger told The Post via email on [27 Mar 2020]. But soon, people were getting sick on both ships. Meanwhile, Coral Princess passengers continued to sunbathe, swim, and socialize in what was "glorious weather," [the passenger] recalled later. As the ship sailed toward Barbados on [30 Mar 2020], where a stop the next day was planned, the cruise line released a public statement at 6 p.m. Eastern that said in part: "There remains no known risk of COVID-19 onboard." Nearly 19 hours later, there was suddenly a different message. After a "higher-than-normal number of people presenting influenza-like symptoms," all passengers were being confined to their rooms, the company announced [31 Mar 2020]. By then, those aboard had been freely socializing for 26 days.

That night, the Coral Princess stopped in Barbados, where a sick passenger was taken off the ship. There, the company also collected coronavirus test samples and sent them to the island. 2 days later, on [2 Apr 2020], ship officials said 13 people had been tested; 12 were positive for the coronavirus. By the time the ship finally reached land in Miami on [4 Apr 2020], 2 people aboard had died. 6 were brought to hospitals in Florida the day the ship arrived, and a dozen more the next day, according to county officials.

[Take away message: cruise ships are ideal incubators for easily transmitted diseases (which we have learned is where COVID-19 sits). When I was a CDC EIS (Epidemic Intelligence Service) officer, frequent outbreak investigations involved EIS officers boarding cruise ships for foodborne outbreaks -- usually armed with their own care packages of food and drinks. Most of those outbreaks were bacterial and bacterial toxin related. Then it morphed into predominantly viral norovirus related outbreaks (see Norovirus - USA: frozen raspberries, cruise ships, 2019 20200428.7278050) for good background of 2019 norovirus on cruise ships). And influenza related outbreaks were identified as well, probably helping to obfuscate the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the early days on board the ships. There are definitely lessons to be learned here. - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO situation report 99 (as of 28 Apr 2020)
Date: Tue 28 Apr 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200428-sitrep-99-covid-19.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 28 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published the 'R&D Blueprint: COVID-19 Experimental Treatments', which lists drug and non-drug experimental treatments for COVID-19; it can be found at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/covid-19-landscape-of-experimental-treatments.

- WHO has called on countries to ensure that usual immunization is maintained wherever possible and surveillance for vaccine-preventable diseases is not disrupted during the ongoing pandemic. The WHO Regional Office for Europe explores this in an article available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/italy/news/news/2020/4/countries-working-to-sustain-population-immunity-to-vaccine-preventable-diseases-during-covid-19-pandemic.

- WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing yesterday [27 Apr 2020], highlighted, "As lockdowns in Europe ease with declining numbers of new cases, we continue to urge countries to find, isolate, test, and treat all cases of COVID-19 and trace every contact, to ensure these declining trends continue". More information is available at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---27-april-2020.

- WHO continues to source millions of dollars of medical equipment and supplies to help Member States access global markets, which are overwhelmed by unprecedented demand. WHO is also supporting design and installation of COVID19 treatment centres in a number of countries. For more, see 'Subject in Focus' below.

Subject in focus: Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) update
---------------------------------------------------------------
Sourcing supplies - progress update
-----------------------------------
WHO and partners continue to work with suppliers to secure commitments for supplies needed for the COVID-19 response in countries with limited means to access markets for personal protective equipment, diagnostic testing supplies and clinical care equipment.

A diagnostic purchasing consortium, established by WHO to negotiate with manufacturers to address market shortages of diagnostic tests and supplies, has secured commitment for 5 million tests to be procured over the next 4 weeks. WHO continues to look for suppliers who can provide sample collection kits to increase overall procurement stocks.

Collective UN efforts to source extremely limited supplies of clinical equipment are ongoing. WHO and consortium partners have conducted market mapping activities to identify supply sources for oxygen concentrators, ventilators, and other essential equipment for COVID-19 treatment centers. To date, approximately USD 400 million in clinical care equipment has been identified from oxygen production, biomedical equipment, and accessories manufacturers.

Discussions with private sector partners indicate manufacturers are generally in favour of the COVID-19 Supply Chain approach to sourcing and allocating supplies. This should bring clarity and transparency to requests for critical supplies that manufacturers are receiving from around the world.

Sourcing activities for personal protective equipment are ongoing. The 1st batch of purchases are expected to be placed for 75 million masks, 50 million respirators, 28 million gloves, and 10 million face shields.

Discussions are ongoing with the Jack Ma Foundation for an additional provision of 100 million surgical masks and one million respirators.

Technical support for COVID-19 treatment centres
------------------------------------------------
WHO is supporting Italy's Bologna and Puglia provinces, helping to design and install COVID-19 treatment centres in these provinces' hospitals.

In Nigeria, WHO has provided technical guidance for a proposed self-quarantine facility in an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

WHO has also provided support for the installation of COVID-19 treatment facilities in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Sao Tome and Principe, and Australia.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
The Americas region reported 39 087 new cases (51.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 1722 deaths (43.8% of the global newly reported deaths). Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 74.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 8.7% and Peru at 5.6%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 34.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 22.2%, Canada at 15.6%, Mexico at 8.5%, Ecuador at 5.3% and Chile at 4.9%.

The European region reported 27 313 new cases (35.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 1904 deaths (48.4% of the global newly reported deaths). Russia reported 23.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 15.9%, France 13.7 7.9%, and Turkey 7.8%. Noteworthy is Belarus that reported 6.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5305 new cases (7.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 157 deaths (4.0% of the global newly reported deaths). Saudi Arabia reported 1289 new cases representing 24.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran at 18.7%, Qatar 18.0%, Pakistan at 11.1%, and the United Arab Emirates at 9.2%. This is the 4rd consecutive day that Saudi Arabia has surpassed Iran.

The African region reported 769 new cases (1.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 16 deaths (0.41% of the global newly reported deaths). South Africa reported 32.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria at 17.6%, Guinea at 9.0%, and Nigeria and Senegal each at 8.3%. Noteworthy is that 21 countries did not report any newly confirmed cases, including Ghana.

The Western Pacific region reported 1264 new cases (1.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 40 deaths (1.0% of the global newly reported deaths). Singapore reported 63.2% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 15.7%, and Japan at 15.1%. Given the high proportion of cases reported by Singapore, removing Singapore from the denominator, the Philippines represents 42.6% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan at 41.1% and Malaysia at 8.6%.

The South East Asia region reported 2288 new cases (3.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 93 deaths (2.4% of the global newly reported deaths). India reported 67.4% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 21.7% and Indonesia at 9.4%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 66.7% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 28.7%, and the Maldives 3.4%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through (28 Apr 2020) at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend; the European region appears to have its cyclical weekend drop, lower than previous weekends and the rebound today (28 Apr 2020) is lower than pre-weekend reports. The America's region does not appear to have decreased even though there were 25 countries reporting no new cases in the past 24 hours.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
