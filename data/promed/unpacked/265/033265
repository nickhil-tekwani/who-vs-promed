[Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a notifiable disease (see: http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/oie-listed-diseases-2014) caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a virus currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. Two major antigenic types of the virus exist -- type 1 (European) and type 2 (American).

For additional background on PRRS, see commentaries in ProMED-mail archive number 20140308.2321341.

Mongolia reported 3 outbreaks of PRRS in 2011. These occurred in Darkhan-Uul province (1) and in Tuv province (2). See final reports and maps for these events at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000010449_20110418_142641.pdf and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000011034_20110922_140753.pdf, respectively.

In 2012, one outbreak of PRRS was again reported in the Darkhan-Uul province. This outbreak was reported only in the 6-monthly report January-June 2012 (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail).

PRRS is considered to be endemic in China. A total of 43 outbreaks were reported in 2012, but no information is available for 2013. Russia reported 6 outbreaks in 2012 and 1 outbreak in the 1st semester of 2013. See detailed information on these outbreaks at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: to view information on PRRS, choose the country or region, and scroll down to the name of the disease and time period).

According to the information found in the WAHID database, PRRS is not a notifiable disease in China, Mongolia or Russia, and no surveillance is being done as a basic control measure. See latest 6-monthly report available for each country: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation.
