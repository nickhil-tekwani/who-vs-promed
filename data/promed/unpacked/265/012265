Suspected foot and mouth disease spreads in Zambia
--------------------------------------------------
The suspected foot and mouth disease which broke out in Zambia's Northern
Province in February 2004 has now spread to 5 other districts in the
province, the official Zambia News Agency said on Thursday. Northern
province senior veterinary officer Obvious Kabinda was quoted as saying
that the disease which was first reported in Kawimbe town of Mbala district
on 25 Feb 2004 has now spread to Mungwi, Isoka, Nakonde, Mpulungu, and
Kasama. He did not say how many animals have contracted the suspected disease.
Kabinda attributed the rapid spread of the disease to his office's failure
to carry out sensitization [consciousness raising? - Mod.SH] campaigns and
vaccinations due to logistic problems. He said that apart from collecting
samples, which have already been sent to South Africa for testing, his
department has been unable to sensitize farmers and vaccinate the animals
in the affected area. He warned that over 67 000 animals in the affected
districts were at the risk of contracting the disease if nothing urgent is
done.
The official said his department has, however, imposed a stock movement ban
in the affected districts to curb the spread, adding that farmers are no
longer allowed to sell their animals outside their respective districts.

[The initial report on suspected FMD in Zambia was reported to the Office
International des Epizooties (OIE) on 1 Mar 2004 (see reference
20040303.0640). A first follow-up report was sent to the OIE on 8 Apr 2004,
covering the period between 26 Feb 2004 and 29 Mar 2004 and informing of
spread of the disease from the Mwenzo Veterinary Camp, which had cases
earlier in the month of Feb, to Nakonde district, central veterinary camp.
Mode of spread: direct contact with illegally moved animals
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_50.HTM#Sec4>.
The affected herds (all age groups) were reported to be in the central part
of Nakonde district bordering Tanzania. Both reports indicated that samples
were dispatched to the Onderstepoort laboratory; results of the tests will
be helpful, with emphasis upon the typing/subtyping of the FMD virus
involved. - Mod.AS]
