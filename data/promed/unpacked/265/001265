A deer had to be euthanized after being infected with the eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus, state officials said on Thursday [31 Oct 2019].

The deer, discovered in Winslow, was the 1st in New Jersey with a confirmed case of EEE, a dangerous mosquito-borne virus that's affected 4 people in the state this year [2019], officials said.

The disease, which is similar to West Nile virus, can infect humans, mammals and birds through the bites of mosquitoes that have fed on infected reservoir hosts, according to a press release from the NJ Department of Environmental Protection's Division of Fish and Wildlife.

Most people infected with the EEE virus show no signs of illness and make a full recovery. However, the disease is serious with 4 to 5 percent of those infected developing flu-like symptoms that advance rapidly, leading to permanent disability or death, the division said.

Severe cases of EEE begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting, according to the NJ Department of Health.

In August 2019, an older man in Somerset County was hospitalized with the virus and later discharged to a rehabilitation center, according to the health department.

Human cases of EEE also have been confirmed in Union and Atlantic counties, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A pair of deer did not shy away from the spotlight in a Cherry Hill yard. The homeowner learned the deer had visited after watching security footage.

As of 29 Oct 2019, the CDC has received 35 confirmed reports of the disease, including 13 deaths, across the country. That's 5 times the average of 7 human cases per year, according to the health agency.

Animals also can exhibit severe symptoms if infected with EEE.

The deer in Winslow was disoriented, thin and drooling when it was discovered. It did not exhibit fear of humans and was lying down with its head up. The deer was euthanized by a Division of Fish and Wildlife conservation police officer and was sent to the NJ Department of Agriculture for testing.

Other EEE symptoms in deer can include depression, weakness, loss of coordination, circling, seizures, blindness, excitability, aggression and irritability, the division said.

Most birds with EEE do not show any symptoms and never become ill. However, the virus can cause illness and death in some bird species including pigeons, pheasants, turkeys, emu and quail. Birds infected with EEE might stagger or have drooping wings, a twisted neck or tremors.

The division cautions hunters and anyone who spends time outdoors to protect against mosquito bites.

It's not the 1st warning about the EEE virus issued in South Jersey.

In September 2019, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst officials said an insect carrying the disease was discovered in a trap near a housing area.

The military base, which spans parts of Burlington and Ocean counties, advised staff and their families to guard against mosquitoes as insect breeding grounds were treated.

The state said in September 2019 that 65 mosquito samples across 13 counties had tested positive for the virus since the beginning of the summer season

The Division of Fish and Wildlife offers the following tips to reduce the potential for contracting EEE:

Use insect repellent when outdoors and cover exposed skin, especially at dusk when mosquitoes are most active. Standing water around homes also should be removed. The 1st killing frost ends the adult mosquito season in any given area.

Hunters should take precautions when field-dressing harvested animals to avoid contracting potentially infectious diseases. Wear gloves when field-dressing, skinning, and/or processing game, and clean knives thoroughly before and after using them. Thoroughly wash hands when through.

Hunters must be careful when removing a deer's antlers. Infectious material may also become aerosolized and be inhaled when hunters saw through brain tissue to remove the antlers.

These modes of transmission of EEE virus to humans are probably unlikely, but it is important to be cautious.

Cook wild game meat thoroughly to a minimum internal temperature of 165 F [73 C]. While there is no evidence that people can become infected with EEE from preparing or eating infected meat, any risk of infection can be eliminated by proper handling and thorough cooking of meat before it is consumed.

If you observe wild birds or mammals exhibiting unusual behaviors as described in this story, call the Division's Wildlife Pathology Office at 908-735-6398 or the DEP Hotline at 877-WARN-DEP (877-927-6337).

A horse in the town of Williamstown has died of EEE, according to the Oswego County Health Department. It's at least the 5th horse in Oswego County killed by the mosquito-borne EEE virus this year [2019].

Oswego County Public Health Director Jiancheng Huang said EEE-infected mosquitoes will continue to be active until the 1st heavy frost occurs. He said people should still use insect repellent and take other steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites when outdoors.

EEE is a rare, but potentially deadly virus spread by mosquitoes. Both humans and horses are at risk of getting EEE through the bite of infected mosquitoes.

There have been 8 reported human EEE deaths in Onondaga and Oswego counties since 1971.

While there is no EEE vaccine available for humans, there is a vaccine for horses.

Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) officials confirmed on 1 Nov 2019 that a 6-year-old Quarter Horse gelding from Leelanau County tested positive for eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). The horse 1st experienced a sudden onset of neurologic signs, including ataxia (loss of control of body movements), depression, recumbency (down and unable to rise), on 1 Oct 2019. He had reportedly been vaccinated against EEE, but the vaccination had expired. He was euthanized on 2 Oct 2019.

MDARD records dating to 1942 indicate that this is the 1st recorded equine case of EEE from Leelanau County.

Michigan's 2019 equine EEE cases now total 29 from 14 counties: 1 from Allegan, 2 from Barry, 1 from Calhoun, 2 from Cass, 4 from Jackson, 6 from Kalamazoo, 1 from Kent, 1 from Lapeer, 1 from Leelanau, 1 from Livingston, 1 from Montcalm, 1 from Newaygo, 6 from St. Joseph, and 1 from Tuscola.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

How to Protect Horses From EEE
Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:

Avoid mosquito bites:
**Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
**Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
**Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
**Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
**Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses.
**Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
**If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
**Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
**Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[In addition to New Jersey, Rhode Island and Michigan (and probably others) have confirmed deer with EEE. The question for some hunters is if the animal is confirmed with EEE is the venison safe for human consumption? I read numerous articles from health departments, and physicians, but the one which stood out was from Michigan;
https://www.wlns.com/news/michigan/hunters-concerned-if-deer-is-safe-to-eat-with-eee-outbreak/:
"Triple E is not transmitted via deer meat or blood. It is only transmitted via a mosquito bite. So your real risk is being outdoors and being bitten by a mosquito. That would be the cause for concern, not eating the deer meat, said Milea Burgstahler, Community Health Promotion Specialist for Barry-Eaton District Health Department."

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is transmitted by mosquitoes. It can be deadly to your horse. So while it seems the EEE season is dragging on well into autumn [2019], it will end when there is a hard, killing frost to kill the mosquitoes.

The best protection you can offer your horse is vaccination. EEE vaccination is usually combined with ones for West Nile virus, western equine encephalitis (WEE) and tetanus. This is a series of 2 shots administered approximately 3 weeks apart. As this season is dragging on, it is recommended to vaccinate your horse if you have not already done so, and if you have, please boost your horse's immunity with another vaccine. EEE wanes the fastest; consequently, it means your animals need re-vaccinating or boosting when there are prolonged seasons such as this year. - Mod.TG
