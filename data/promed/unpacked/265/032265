The state has invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act in the textile town of Ichalkaranji in the wake of 12 hepatitis E deaths and over 4085 people infected in a month. As many as 78 pregnant women are also among the infected, of whom 40 in their 3rd trimester have been admitted to hospitals in Kolhapur, some 25 km from Icchalkaranji. Kolhapur civil surgeon Dr L Patil told The Indian Express that the act provides for steps to control and prevent the spread of the disease, such as closure of schools, liquor and wine shops, and ice factories. The primary and secondary schools of the town, which has a population of 300 000, will remain shut until 22 Jun 2012.

Health officials said the National Institute of Virology, Pune has confirmed that a majority of samples from Ichalkaranji had tested positive for hepatitis E [virus]. Of the 12 deaths, 3 were pregnant women. "We have hospitalised 40 women who are in their 3rd trimester. We checked at least 2000 pregnant women, of whom 78 were infected." As many as 2096 patients have been treated on an out-patient basis since 15 May 2012, while 1250 were hospitalised. At least 180 of them are still hospitalised, and no deaths have been reported in the past 3 days, Patil said, adding that nearly 41 villages have also been infected.

A death audit committee, comprising doctors of Kolhapur government medical college and the district deputy director of health, has been constituted to confirm whether the deaths were owing to hepatitis E infection. There have been cases of people with underlying illnesses such as liver cirrhosis.

A review committee has attributed the infection to the Panchganga river. Water from the river was used in the town after filtration due to a shortage in the Krishna river in January, February and March 2012. Health officials say the river is polluted due to release of sewage and industrial process water from Kolhapur. As many as 90 leakages in the drinking water pipeline in Icchalkaranji have also been identified as a source of infection.

Once the infection spread across the 25 wards of Icchalkaranji by 15 May 2012, the municipal corporation stopped [taking] water from the Panchganga river. The civic body has initiated sanitation measures and an awareness campaign with banners and leaflets.
