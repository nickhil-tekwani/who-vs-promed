Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Sweden
----------------------------------
Information received on [Fri 20 Jan 2017] from Dr Ingrid Eilertz, chief veterinary officer director and head, Swedish Board of Agriculture Department for Animal Welfare and Health, Ministry for Rural Affairs, Jonkoping, Sweden

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 15 Nov 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 12 Jan 2017
Date event resolved: 17 Nov 2016
Reason for notification: listed disease in an unusual host species.
Causal agent: rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: RHDV2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Hallands Vadero, Bastad, Skane Lan
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Nov 2016
Outbreak status: resolved 17 Nov 2016
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Mountain hare:_Lepus timidus_(Leporidae) / -/ 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: This is a small isolated island population of mountain hares (_Lepus timidus_). A handful of hares were found dead during last autumn. Only one of them was sent for analysis. RHDV2 is known to be present among wild rabbits in the adjacent mainland.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: This is the 1st time RHDV2 has been detected in a hare in Sweden and the 1st time ever in a mountain hare (_Lepus timidus_). There are no wild rabbits on this island and it is not known how this hare has been infected. However, it is known that the virus can be spread by insects, birds, contaminated material and indirectly with objects brought by visiting people. RHDV2 has been detected in both wild and domestic rabbits in the south part of Sweden up to mid Sweden. A comprehensive picture of the spread of infection in the country is unclear including how RHDV2 was originally introduced into Sweden.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) /
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Mountain hare / histopathological examination / 30 Nov 2016 / Positive
Mountain hare / immunohistochemical test / 6 Dec 2016 / Positive
Mountain hare / real-time PCR / 13 Dec 2016 / Positive
Mountain hare / real-time PCR / 12 Jan 2017 / Positive
Mountain hare / virus sequencing / 12 Jan 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[This appears to be the 1st time that RHDV2 has been identified in a mountain hare _Lepus timidus _.

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused by a calicivirus (genus Lagovirus). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to 1 of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

"RHD is characterized by high morbidity and a mortality of 70 to 90 per cent for RHDV/RHDVa and 5 to 70 per cent for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission, and are often the source of long distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12 to 36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4 to 6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15 to 20 days of age onwards...

"RHDV2 is able to cause an RHD-like disease in 2 hare species: Cape hare (_Lepus capensis_ var. mediterraneus) and Italian hare (_Lepus corsicanus_)."http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf
