[In September of 2014, Italy reported its 1st occurrence of small hive beetle infestation (_Aethina tumida_). Based on information obtained from Italy's OIE annual 2014 report, 54 outbreaks were reported, 52 of which were located in the Calabria region and 2 in Sicilia. See report at http://tinyurl.com/o3ljzrp (note: see section 1 and 3 of this report).

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.2.5 Small Hive Beetle Infestation (_Aethina tumida_), at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.05_SMALL_HIVE_BEETLE.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"The small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_ (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), is a parasite and scavenger of honey bee colonies. Adult and larvae small hive beetles feed on honey bee brood, honey and pollen, thus causing brood death, fermentation of honey, and comb destruction. The beetles can promote structural collapse of the nest and cause the adult honey bees to abscond. The extent of beetle-associated damage likely depends on climate conditions, among other factors. Small hive beetles tend to be more problematic in areas with warm temperatures and high humidity than in areas with lower temperatures and humidity. The small hive beetle can be a serious problem in honey-extracting facilities where stored comb, honey and wax cappings are potential feeding and breeding areas. Beetle development from egg to adult requires 3-12 weeks, depending on humidity, temperature and food availability. The flying adult beetles actively infest honey bee colonies of all strengths and sizes."
