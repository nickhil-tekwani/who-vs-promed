PFP lawmaker questions Council of Agriculture about abalone virus
------------------------------------------------------
The recent die-off of small abalone known as "Taiwan abalone" has caused
financial losses to the industry but no harm to humans, the head of the
Council of Agriculture told the legislature yesterday.
PFP Legislator Cheng Mei-lan yesterday questioned council Chairman Lee
Chin-lung at the Legislative Yuan about the recent die-off of small abalone
along the northeast coast, saying that an epidemic has resulted in a 400
million TWD (11.5 million USD) loss to the domestic abalone industry.
According to Cheng, the annual product value of Taiwan abalone exceeds 7
billion TWD (200 million USD), including 2 billion TWD (58.8 million USD)
from those raised in farms along the northeast coast.
Most of the abalone is consumed domestically, but part of the annual
harvest is exported to Japan, Hong Kong, and other markets.
Cheng said 800 000 kg of Taiwan abalone raised in farms in Santiao Chiao
and Auti in Taipei County began to die 3 weeks ago. Due to the die-off,
Cheng said, the price of the delicacy had dropped to 400 NTD from 600 NTD
per kilogram.
"There's a big hole in Taiwan's epidemic-prevention network. The virus
spreading in the Taiwan abalone population could have been brought in by
abalone smuggled into the country," Cheng said.
Cheng said the die-off of Taiwan abalone first occurred 2 years ago, but
the Council of Agriculture failed to prevent the spread of the disease.
Cheng said the threat could jeopardize the nation's abalone farming
industry, forcing farmers to move it to other countries such as Vietnam and
Thailand. Lee said that a task force established to investigate the
epidemic is continuing its research.
"So far, we've confirmed the epidemic has been caused by a virus," Lee
said. It remained unclear, however, whether the virus is the same as that
which caused an epidemic in another species of abalone found in coastal
areas of China years ago, according to Su Mao-sen, deputy director-general
of the council's Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute.
Su said, however, the infection would not be spread to other aquatic
products such as fish and shellfish. "The contaminated abalone is safe to
eat if it is cooked," Su said.
To fight against the spread of the virus, Su said, scientists of the
institute have helped the abalone-farming industry to disinfect affected
areas in a bid to ensure water quality and will help farmers adopt a water
circulation system to stem the spread of the virus.
Su said scientists would also investigate the aquatic feedstuff used by the
industry. In late 1980s, Taiwan experienced water quality problems that
plagued the prawn industry.
Su also said that the agricultural officials had paid attention to the
outbreak, and that the authorities are hoping to raise a virus-resistant
breed of the abalone, which would raise the industry's competitiveness.

[Abalone are marine snails belonging to the genus Haliotis, family
Haliotidae, and are related to clams, oysters, mussels, and squid.
Worldwide there are approximately 90 species of abalone, 15 of which are
harvested commercially. Countries with large abalone industries include
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Korea, Taiwan, and China. The
last 2 are the world's biggest abalone-farming countries.
No details of the "virus" involved in the described abalone disease in
Taiwan are presented. It would be helpful if further details were supplied
by colleagues in Taiwan, especially since outbreaks of mass mortality among
the Taiwan abalone, _Haliotis diversicolor supertexta_, reported from
Taiwan in recent years were not attributed to a virus but to a "swarming
bacterium, strain H-11 of the bacterium _Vibrio alginolyticus_", isolated
from the hemolymph of the moribund small abalone (P.C.Liu, Y.C. Chen & K.K.
Lee in Microbios 2001;104(408):71-7). - Mod.AS]
