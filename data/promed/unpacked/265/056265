On 4 Jun 2007, 13 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been
registered in the Stavropol region. The management of RosPotrebNadzor
(Federal Supervision Agency for Customer Protection and Human Welfare) in
the Stavropol region reported that cases of CCHF have been registered in 10
districts. Of this number, 2 cases were laboratory confirmed in each of
Apanasyevsky, Budenovsky, and Neftekumsky districts and one case in the
each of Alexandrovsky, Arzgyrsky, Blagodarnensky, Izobilnensky, Ipatovsky,
Krasnogvardeysky, and Novoselitsky districts.
As of today [4 Jun 2007], 8 people have been discharged from hospitals, and
5 people are being treated in hospitals. Most of them noticed tick bites
during the care of farm animals; 4 patients had tick bites acquired in
nature. Only last week, more than 700 people sought medical aid after tick
bites.
Public health physicians have noticed a high activity of ticks, the
carriers of [CCHF virus]. For inhabitants of the region, it is necessary
during caring for farm animals and when in natural areas to observe
measures of personal preventive maintenance: to wear clothes that protect
from tick bites, to use repellents, and also to avoid removing and crushing
ticks with unprotected hands.
