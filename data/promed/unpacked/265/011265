From: Hall, Robert (DHS) <Robert.Hall@dhs.sa.gov.au>

We have been investigating a cluster of cases of infection with
_Salmonella_ Typhimurium phage type 135A. To date we have had 127
positively identified cases reported this year (normal range 0-2 reported
cases per year, population of South Australia around 1.5 million). The 127
cases were reported over a period of just over 2 weeks. We conducted a
case-control study over the weekend of 06 and 07-03-99. Analysis of the
results indicated a significantly raised odds ratio associated with the
consumption of a particular brand of fresh orange juice. Microbiological
results have confirmed the presence of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium phage type
135A in that brand of fresh orange juice. A product recall was issued and
order to stop sales was issued on 09-03-99. Further investigation is
continuing.

On behalf of the investigation team.
