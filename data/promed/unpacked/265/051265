[On 17 Jul 2020, new cases were also reported in Brod and Kicevo. See the follow-up reports at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=35077 and https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=35080, respectively.

The reported spread of the vectorborne BTV-4 is not surprising -- reflecting the unfortunate combination of BT disease season (June through November) and the animal population's susceptibility (vaccination prohibited). As can be seen in OIE's interactive map (https://tinyurl.com/y37ea4cu, zoom in to North Macedonia), 13 BTV-4 outbreaks have been reported from 6 western provinces.

According to these current reports (immediate notification and follow-up reports), the affected population is mixed and includes sheep and goats; however, the epidemiological data do not differentiate between them. As was mentioned in ProMED-mail posting 20200712.7564181, "BTV-4 (as most other BTV serotypes) rarely causes clinical signs in goats; sheep, and in particular European mutton breeds as well as other susceptible sheep breeds (for example, Chios), may be seriously affected, with mortality that may, in some cases, exceed 20% to 30%".

It would be interesting to note which breeds of sheep have been exposed and to know whether goats are included among these cases and the death recorded in these flocks. If when vaccination is applied, goats will not be vaccinated. - Mods.CRD/AS
