Onderstepoort Biological Products (South Africa) produces a formalinised,
alum-
precipitated toxoid of _Clostridium perfringens_ type B, known as Lamb
dysentery
vaccine and only registered for use in sheep.

_Clostridium perfringens_ type B causes lamb dysentery and a variety of
other syndromes in domestic animals, although I'm not sure how the
moderator's comment on this fits into a discussion of human necrotic
enteritis [I only provided a update on availability of the status of
various veterinary vaccines queried by Dr. Schechter in the previous
posting. - Mod.PC, which is exclusively (or almost exclusively) caused by
_C. perfringens_ type C. Of the four "major" toxins of _C. perfringens_,
type C produces alpha and beta, type D produces alpha and epsilon, and type
B produces alpha, beta, and epsilon. Thus, the cautious label claims of
toxoid manufacturers that vaccination with a C/D product may protect
against type B infection. Anecdotal evidence supports this claim.
Therapies which neutralize beta toxin are doubtless helpful to some degree,
but the often rapid course of disease frequently necessitates surgery to
restore the integrity of the small intestine. An interesting popular
article on a case in the US appeared in Discover in February 1995 (The
Beast in the Belly, by Sherwin B. Nuland).
Wellcome made a beta toxoid for use in humans, and it was remarkably
effective in decreasing the incidence of necrotic enteritis in PNG [Papua
New Guinea and Southeast Asia. This product was obviously for a small
market, and, although I've not seen the financial data, profitability is
exceedingly unlikely. My understanding of the current situation is that
incidence of disease has increased with decreased availability of the
toxoid.
Type C products prepared for use in domestic animals would, in theory, be
immunogenic in humans. However, these products are notoriously reactogenic
in animals (producing local reactions which are subsequently discovered and
trimmed at slaughter), and one would expect at least some adverse effects
of using them in humans. Work in several laboratories around the world
promises the availability of a recombinant, genetically-toxoided beta
toxin, which may answer the problems posed by _C. perfringens_ type C for
humans and domestic animals.
We have genotyped isolates from several putative cases of necrotic
enteritis, and have yet to find any to be other than type A. In some ways,
this is not surprising, since type A is a normal inhabitant of the human
bowel. On the other hand, consider that (a) the only criteria for
membership in type A are production of alpha toxin and failure to produce
beta, epsilon, and iota toxins, and (b) maybe 90% of combined human and
domestic animal isolates of _C. perfringens_ are type A. It becomes
tempting to speculate that, floating in the literal and figurative cesspool
that is type A, there may be clusters of isolates with heretofore not
described virulence attributes which allow them to produce specific disease
syndromes.
