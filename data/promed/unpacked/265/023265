A recent paper in Archives of Ophthalmology (Manohar B et al.
Outbreak of Acquired Ocular Toxoplasmosis Involving 248 Patients.
Arch Ophthalmol. 2010;128:28-32) describes an outbreak of ocular
toxoplasmosis in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, Southern India.

209 patients were residents of one city in Southern India. A total of
35 patients had a prodrome of fever, and 242 patients had unilateral
retinitis without associated old retinochoroidal scars. All had
laboratory evidence of acquired systemic infection with _Toxoplasma
gondii_, and all favorably responded to antitoxoplasma therapy.
Toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibodies were detected, suggesting recently
acquired systemic disease. Complications seen were macular scars in
50 eyes (25.1 percent); epiretinal membranes, 23 eyes (11.5 percent);
cataract, 5 eyes (2.5 percent); posterior vitreous detachment, 12
eyes (6 percent); and retinal detachment, 12 eyes (6 percent). One
recurrence has been seen. The suspected source of infection is
municipal drinking water.

Conclusion: Large numbers of residents of any age in a population are
at risk of acquiring ocular disease during an outbreak of
toxoplasmosis, which can go unnoticed, and can cause significant
ocular morbidity.

[The report is followed by an editorial (Holland GN. An Epidemic of
Toxoplasmosis. Lessons From Coimbatore, India. Arch Ophthalmol.
2010;128:126-8) discussing the implications of the outbreak and
briefly discussing previous outbreaks of ocular toxoplasmosis.

Acquired ocular toxoplasmosis is well known in Southern Brazil and is
believed to be caused by so-called atypical _Toxoplasma gondii_
strains in combination with infections through consumption of surface
water.

The report contains no indication of the _T. gondii_ strain(s) involved.

It is possible to get an indication of the _T. gondii_ genotype by
analysing the sero-reactivity to strain-specific peptides, and this
should be done.

The authors hypothesize that the infection was spread by
contamination of the reservoirs for drinking water, as happened in
the Victoria (British Columbia) outbreak. It would be interesting to
analyse patients for their socio-economic background to exclude
consumption of raw and untreated surface water as the source.

An idea of the strain causing the outbreak can be obtained from
sampling _T. gondii_ from cats and poultry in the vicinity of the
water reservoirs.

It should be kept in mind that the outbreak occurred 6 years ago, and
ProMED will be happy to post an update on the situation since the
outbreak. - Mod.EP]
