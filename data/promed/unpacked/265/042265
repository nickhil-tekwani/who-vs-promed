Anthrax reappears in Orissa, 10 afflicted
---------------------------------------------------------
At least 10 people in Orissa's Raigada district are reported have
contracted anthrax, the cattle disease that killed 7 in the same area
during August 2003. All the cases have been reported from Malpguda, a
tribal village, over the past week. The victims include a 4-year-old child.
However, officials said only 6 people had got the disease. Chief district
medical officer Dr. M.R. Sahu said over phone that 6 anthrax cases had been
reported in the last 7 days, with one case coming to light Tuesday. Giving
an assurance that there would be no casualties this time, Sahu said the
condition of the patients was improving.
Last week, 6 goats died in Malpguda village of suspected anthrax. The
villagers, in all probability, were infected after eating the improperly
cooked meat, said Sahu. "We have launched a health awareness programme in
most of the villages requesting people not to eat rotten meat," Sahu told IANS.
The district administration has constituted a task force of health
officials, who have been visiting the affected villages to monitor the
situation. The main hurdle they faced was the tribals' resistance to taking
medicine, he said.
The first anthrax case in the district was reported by a missionary
hospital in Lamptaput in June 2003. The hospital sent a specimen of the
skin lesion found on the patients to a specialised hospital in Vellore and
confirmed the disease. The discovery put the district on alert and led to
an expert team from New Delhi and Bhubaneswar visiting the area. Sahu said
veterinary department officials seized about 200 kg of infected meat and
burnt it in the affected villages. The authorities also administered
massive preventive vaccines in the district, he said.
The district health department has reported more than 80 cases of anthrax
since January 2003.
Anthrax is a rare disease caused by the spores of the bacterium _Bacillus
anthracis_. It causes enlargement of the spleen and is also known as
spleen fever or "wool sorter's disease". It is carried from animals to the
human population.

[There is an interesting disconnect between the claim that the disease is
rare and that in this one district there have been 80 cases recorded since
the beginning of 2003. The phrase "Giving an assurance that there would be
no casualties this time" is hard to interpret without other knowledge;
charitably one might assume that all the 10 cases are expected to promptly
recover. While cutaneous lesions are what one expects in such
circumstances, Dr. Sahu's comment about "improperly cooked meat" would
suggest that some may have gastroenteric anthrax. The problem is not from
eating "rotten meat" but from eating meat from animals dying or dead from
anthrax. All in all, this report reinforces the perception that India
urgently needs to develop an effective anthrax control programme, both from
the public health side as well as from the veterinary services side, and
especially by the governments of the affected states. Report after report
from India has the authorities implementing a vaccination programme
reactively, that is after human cases are reported, and not proactively. -
