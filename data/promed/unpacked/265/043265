Two Mwea [Central Province] traders are calling upon the government
to revive the rice board to stabilise prices. The cost of living has
shot up because of low production of rice.

They said rice blast and high rice prices are now a big challenge.
"When Mwea Rice Board was in place it did a lot of research to boost
rice yield and that is why there were no diseases [like the ones that]
are being witnessed today."

They attributed the high prices to lack of enough rice due to lack of
water and rice blast -- a rice disease that is a threat to the
production of rice. They said the fertiliser and chemicals given by
the government are also substandard and called on the government to
find a way to improve the rice.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously
classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). It is one of the most
destructive diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of
more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the
shoot, stem rot, and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all
plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When
infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often
completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be
affected by different strains of the fungus, but most strains isolated
from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen
levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The disease
is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect
activity), water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides
and cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence.

A serious outbreak of rice blast was reported from Central Province
also in 2008 (ProMED-mail post no. 20080402.1211). It was attributed
largely to heavy rains, poor cultural practices and infected rice
seed, but it is not clear whether the agricultural and phytosanitary
problems were addressed.
