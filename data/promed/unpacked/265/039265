Cote d'Ivoire: Boy dies of yellow fever in northwest
----------------------------
A 13-year old boy has died of yellow fever in a village near Odienne, a
town in the rebel-held north of Cote d'Ivoire close to the frontier with
Guinea, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Thursday.
UNICEF doctor Emile Alfani told IRIN that the boy died in the village of
Kadiasso, 12 km from Odienne and 800 km northwest of the commercial capital
Abidjan, on 6 November [2003], three days after becoming ill.
A crisis committee which includes representatives of the Ministry of
Health, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Committee of
the Red Cross, the Pasteur Institute, and ECHO, the aid arm of the European
Union, has been formed to deal with the outbreak. Alfani said it was
officially considered to be an epidemic even though no other cases have
been reported.
The UNICEF doctor said all the 1,600 inhabitants of Kadiasso and 3
neighbouring villages had been vaccinated against yellow fever, which
produces a high fever, headaches and internal bleeding and a further 10,000
more doses of vaccine were sent to the area on Monday.
An official at the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Belgium health centre in
the northern town of Korhogo, told IRIN that MSF health workers had
detected the case in Kasiaso and had been conducting a vaccination campaign
in the area since then.
All medical staff fled the Odienne area when civil war broke out in Cote
d'Ivoire in September last year and official records show that no yellow
fever vaccination campaign had been carried out there since 1999.
Alfani said the crisis committee was investigating whether the outbreak is
linked to another 500 km away in Gaoua in the south of Burkina Faso.

[Cote d'Ivoire borders with Liberia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso and
Ghana. While the newswire mentions a possibility that this outbreak is
related to the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Burkina Faso, there has also
been YF activity in neighboring Guinea. Checking maps of the three
countries, it appears as though the outbreak location in Guinea (Macenta)
is closer to Odienne than the outbreak location in Burkina Faso (Gaoua).
More information on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
