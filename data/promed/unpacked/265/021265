Thailand reported that avian influenza virus had killed a man in a central
province, the 2nd such human death in less than 2 weeks, a senior official
at the Health Ministry said today [Sat 5 Aug 2006]. A 27 year old man in
Uthai Thani province who died on 3 Aug 2006 has tested positive for the
H5N1 virus, Thawat Suntrajarn, director general of the Ministry's Disease
Control Department, said by mobile phone. He was the country's 16th human
bird flu death [and 24th case since the onset of the outbreak in early
2004. - Mod.CP].
Thailand, the world's 4th-biggest poultry exporter, has widened its search
for avian flu patients and improved surveillance for the virus in poultry
after the government on 26 Jul 2006 confirmed the death of a 17 year old
man from bird flu, its 1st human fatality in 7 months.
New cases create chances for H5N1 to mutate into a pandemic form and world
health authorities are tracking the disease for signs that it may become
more contagious. "The man had a history of contacting dead poultry" Thawat
said. "His initial test in the province had an inconclusive result and
further tests in Bangkok just came out today, confirming the H5N1 infection."
The Health Ministry is concerned that an outbreak of seasonal influenza
during this rainy season will increase the risk of dual infections with the
H5N1 virus. Dual infections may help the H5N1 virus to mutate into a
pandemic form, Thawat said at a news conference yesterday.

[It is likely that the prevalence of seasonal human influenza in Thailand
will complicate surveillance of the population for H5N1 avian influenza
virus infection. However, recent reverse genetic reconstruction experiments
suggest that interaction between human and avian viruses (by reassortment
of genome subunits) is not a sufficient condition for generation of a
potentially pandemic virus: see "Avian influenza, human (106): synthetic
hybrid virus 20060802.2138". - Mod.CP]
