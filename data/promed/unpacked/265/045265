Sightings of rabbit carcasses with signs of a deadly disease have
sparked an investigation into a possible outbreak of a lethal virus on
Hampstead Heath [London].

Park authorities have launched a fact-finding mission following
reports of dead rabbits near Kenwood House and Jack Straw's Castle.
The Ham & High has also received eyewitness accounts of rabbits with
swollen eyes sitting very still around the Heath, symptoms of
myxomatosis.

There are fears the lethal strain could spread to pet rabbits around
Hampstead. The disease is near incurable and almost always leads to an
agonising death for the affected rabbits.

Park user Maureen Rose, who has seen a few of the afflicted rabbits,
said: "They are dying slowly, and the crows are picking them off. It
should serve as warning for people to be aware that if they traipse
around on the Heath with their dogs, fleas could transfer from the
rabbits to their pets and be taken home with them."

Head vet at the Village Vet in Hampstead, Sean McInnes, said the
recent heat wave could be to blame, with mosquitoes and fleas
spreading the disease between animals. But he said his surgery has not
yet treated any pet rabbits with the condition.

"Most rabbits these days are confined to more narrow yards, and there
is not too much rabbit-to-rabbit contact. But if you are living near
the Heath and some wild rabbits come into the garden, physical contact
is definitely possible, and that's difficult to guard against," he
told the Ham & High.

Rabbit owners can have their pets vaccinated every 6 months, which
provides a partial protection against the disease.

Rangers are removing any dead rabbits from the Heath and ask park
users to report any further sightings.

Hampstead Heath Superintendent Simon Lee said: "The rabbit population
is fairly large on the Heath at the moment, and cases of myxomatosis
are very rare here. We understand that there may be a small number of
rabbits that have the condition, and we are currently investigating
all reports. We would like to encourage the public to notify Hampstead
Heath staff if they do spot dead rabbits so that we may record
sightings to monitor their numbers."
