In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in the Columbus, Ohio area, city health officials now report 50 total confirmed cases since the start of the outbreak in November [now 56].

All 50 cases were unvaccinated children 17 years and younger. 7 out of 10 cases were in children 2 years and younger.

No fatalities have been reported.

According to the CDC, a total of 76 measles cases were reported by 5 jurisdictions through 1 Dec 2022.

Measles is very contagious and can cause serious illness. About 1 out of 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection, 1 out of 20 gets pneumonia, and 1-2 out of 1000 die from measles complications. Measles can also cause pregnant women to miscarry or give birth prematurely. Serious health problems from measles are more common among children younger than 5 and adults older than 20.

Measles causes fever, runny nose, cough, conjunctivitis (red, watery eyes), and a rash all over the body. People can spread measles before they show symptoms. Symptoms usually last 7-10 days.

["12 of the cases [in Ohio] are in children younger than 1 year old; 26 are between 1 and 2; 13 are from 3 to 5, and the remaining 5 range from 6 to 17 years old. This means 46% of the cases are 1-2 years old.

"Typically, a child gets the vaccine between 12 and 15 months, this means some of these cases could be from babies who are unvaccinated due to age or parental choice.

"As this outbreak continues to grow, we are encouraging all parents to make sure that their child's immunizations are up-to-date," Columbus Public Health told News 5. "If your baby is 12 months of age or older and hasn't received the 1st dose of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] yet, please get them vaccinated as soon as possible.

"[Dr Amy Edwards, who is the associate medical director for UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital's Pediatric Infection Control] said the outbreak in Ohio is happening because people aren't getting vaccinated.

"Every time you add more children to the unvaccinated, that increases the susceptible population," she said.

"Among all of the other problems measles causes, it also hurts all of the children who aren't old enough to get the vaccine or who are immunocompromised, Edwards added."

Anti-vaccine sentiment is growing in the state of Ohio, which is dangerously fueled by misinformation. Education of children and families is critical to counteract this problem that threatens the health of the population, especially as stated above, children too young to be vaccinated and those individuals who are immunocompromised.

According to CDC, before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3-4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; of these, 400-500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles virus-containing vaccine has led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. - Mod.LK

[2] India: boost surveillance

Maharashtra and Kerala have so far reported at least 914 cases of the viral disease. There have been 18 deaths in Maharashtra alone.

As cases of measles are rising in certain parts of the country, the central government has directed affected states to strengthen fever and rash surveillance, according to people familiar with the matter.

Maharashtra and Kerala have so far reported at least 914 cases of the viral disease. There have been 18 deaths in Maharashtra alone.

"The Union health ministry has been asking states to heighten surveillance so that cases are not missed, and also detected early so that treatment reaches on time. This will help save lives," an official aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.

Measles is a highly infectious viral disease, with a basic reproduction number of 12 to 18 by most estimates, which means one infected person can pass it on to 12 to 18 others, and each of those to a similar number further.

The disease normally sees a surge between November and March, which is why states have been directed to remain vigilant during this period. Even in healthy children, measles can cause serious illness and can require hospitalisation. It can be particularly dangerous for children who are unvaccinated and are moderately or severely malnourished. Nearly 1 to 3 of every 1000 children who are infected die from respiratory or neurological complications.

In a detailed advisory issued last month [November 2022], the Centre asked states to undertake a headcount survey of all children aged 6 months to 5 years in the vulnerable outbreak areas to facilitate full vaccination coverage in an accelerated manner. The institutionalized mechanism of district task force on immunization under the chairmanship of the district collector must be activated to review the measles situation on a daily and weekly basis and plan the response activities accordingly, it said.

Since the disease is known to be fatal among children with moderate and severe malnourishment, the Centre asked doorstep searches to be conducted in affected areas to identify vulnerable children and provide pre-emptive care with nutritional and vitamin A supplementation.

"Any suspected cases with development of fever and maculo-papular rash must be reported and investigated. Immediate isolation of laboratory confirmed cases must be done for at least 7 days from the date of identification," the advisory said. "Guidance for home-based care of such cases must be issued with reference to age-appropriate 2 doses of vitamin A supplementation with adequate nutritional support."

Roughly 2.5 million infants, who were supposed to be inoculated with the 1st dose of measles vaccine, did not receive the shots last year [2021], a number that explains why the country is recording a surge in the viral disease that is highly contagious and can lead to fatalities.

At 2.5 million, India accounts for the 2nd highest numbers of missed doses in infants in 2021, with Nigeria recording the most at 3.1 million doses, according to a recent estimate by the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control.

The government has decided to accelerate vaccinations for all children between the age of 9 months and 5 years, following a review meeting on the situation last month [November 2022]. Increasing immunization coverage is more important for India, as the government has set December 2023 as target for measles elimination.

Ideally, 95% coverage should be done among the eligible population, according to WHO.

"People must take all the vaccines that are due as per the national schedule as not taking vaccines could have serious consequences," said Dr Anupam Sibal, senior paediatrician and group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.

[3] India: cases

Taking note of the rising cases of measles in Malappuram [Kerala], the Indian Academy of Paediatricians stepped in and appealed for vaccination amidst the reportedly alarming hike in the cases.

Officials informed that the Malappuram district was the worst hit.

"As of now, all states are facing measles outbreak. In Kerala, Malappuram is the most affected. 160 cases of measles reported in the dist. So far there hasn't been any mortality due to measles in the district," said Dr Jose Ouseph, State President of Indian Academy of Pediatrics, Kerala.

His remarks came in the wake of the declining rate of immunisation for measles, after the pandemic.

There is a chance of it spreading in the coming days. So, we're pushing for maximum vaccination coverage in the affected areas," Dr Jose added.

On Wednesday [30 Nov 2022], the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that measles immunisation had dropped significantly since the coronavirus pandemic began, resulting in a record high of nearly 40 million children missing a vaccine dose last year [2021].

"There is now an imminent threat of measles spreading to different regions around the world as COVID-19 has led to a steady decline in vaccination coverage and weakened surveillance of the disease," said WHO and CDC in a joint report.

Measles is one of the most contagious human viruses and is almost entirely preventable through vaccination. However, it requires 95 per cent vaccination coverage to prevent community outbreaks.

"A record high of nearly 40 million children missed a measles vaccine dose in 2021," read the joint report.

Earlier on 28 Nov 2022, a 1-year-old girl died in Mumbai after contracting measles, said a statement issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

The minor's death took the city's official death toll from the highly infectious disease to 14.

[4] Africa: CDC travel notice
Date: Fri 02 Dec 2022

https://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-outbreaks-reported-in-17-african-countries-cdc-travel-notice-69406/


The [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that a number of countries in Africa are experiencing measles outbreaks and says all travelers to Africa, including infants and pre-school aged children, should be fully vaccinated against measles, according to CDC immunization schedules.

In Africa, health officials in the 17 countries listed have reported measles outbreaks, meaning the number of measles cases is higher than normal: Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Togo.

Destinations reporting measles outbreaks are not the only places where infection is a risk. Locations where measles is common may have many cases but not be considered to have an outbreak. Measles can also spread in airports, on public transportation, and at tourist attractions. It is critical for travelers to be protected against measles, regardless of destination.

Measles spreads from person to person by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. Signs and symptoms of measles include rash, high fever and a cough, runny nose, or red, watery eyes. People can spread measles up to 4 days before and 4 days after they have a rash. Measles can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia, and even death.

Vaccination with a measles-containing vaccine is the best way to make sure that you are protected. There are 2 measles-containing vaccines available in the United States: measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) for those aged 6 months and older, and measles, mumps, rubella & varicella (MMRV) vaccine for children aged 1 through 12 years. If you are 12 months of age or older you need 2 doses of measles vaccine to be fully protected. Infants 6 through 11 months of age should receive 1 dose of vaccine, though this dose does not count as the 1st dose in the routine childhood vaccination series. You are also protected if you have laboratory confirmation of a past measles infection or if you were born before 1957.
