Tests have confirmed that botulism caused the death of more than 200 wild ducks on 2 ponds in Nowra.

During December [2012] and January [2013] wild ducks were found dead or dying on the ponds in Harry Sawkins and Marriott Parks.

Testing by the Environment Protection Authority ruled out chemical poisoning, with the Cumberland Livestock Health and Pest Authority discovering the birds had died from botulism.

LHPA [Livestock Health and Pest Authorities] senior district veterinarian, Dr Keith Hart, said botulism is a paralytic disease which is difficult to diagnose. "It is caused by the ingestion of a toxin, in this case created through a combination of low water levels and warm temperatures," he said.

"Several dead and dying ducks and a dying seagull were examined," he said, adding that botulism was a difficult disease to identify.

"Swabs were also taken to exclude virulent avian influenza -- a potentially serious viral disease that could show up initially as water bird mortalities on or near the coast.

"My diagnosis has been based on the history and clinical signs exhibited by the sick birds examined and described by council staff, and the fact that botulism is a fairly common cause of waterbird deaths under these conditions."

Dr Hart says while the recent rainfall and cooler weather will assist in flushing out the toxins, people should stay away from any duck carcasses. "It is important that the public don't touch duck carcasses or allow dogs to touch them," he said.

[From the text, is not entirely clear whether botulism was confirmed by laboratory tests, or if the diagnosis was based on a presumption after other possible causes have been ruled out

Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Spores of these bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

From the NWHC (USGS National Wildlife Health Center) field manual (Chapter 38):
"A presumptive diagnosis of avian botulism is often based on a combination of signs observed in sick birds and the absence of obvious lesions of disease when the internal organs and tissues of sick and dead birds are examined. However, this initial diagnosis must be confirmed by the mouse-protection or ELISA test to separate avian botulism from algal poisoning, castorbean poisoning, and other toxic processes that cause similar signs of disease." (...) "The most widely used test for avian botulism is the mouse-protection test, although an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for type C toxin has been developed recently".
