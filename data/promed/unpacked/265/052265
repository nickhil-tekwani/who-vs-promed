The Federal Minister of Health, Bahar Idris Abu Garda, denied that there are any cases of yellow fever in Khartoum state or in any other state except in Darfur.

While answering an urgent question on yellow fever in Darfur in front of the Council of States yesterday [26 Nov 2012], Abu Garda announced the possibility of other diseases emerging in Sudan, especially in peripheral and forest areas, as a result of heavy rains in most parts of the country.

The minister acknowledged the lack of medical personnel in Sudan and the lack of specialists in peripheral states. He demanded that the Ministry of Finance increase the salaries of all doctors working in remote areas to encourage them.

He called on the competent authorities to adopt the central laboratory project, as many of the samples are sent abroad. Abu Garda revealed the vulnerability of the ministry's budget, which has been allocated only 4 per cent of the state budget.

The health minister said that the number of cases of yellow fever has reached 578; about 129 died, giving a mortality rate of 28.3 per cent. He pointed out that Central Darfur is the most affected by the disease, with 156 cases, compared to just 3 in East Darfur.

Abu Garda denied that the disease will be communicated to neighbouring countries, revealing the formation of a coordination and cooperation committee with Chad, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic to ward off the disease, which is transmitted by nomadic and cross-border travels.

He said yellow fever emerged among nomads. The minister praised the medical personnel, local organisations, and international bodies for their role in the success of the campaign. The Council of States passed the answer of the minister of health on the urgent issue with some recommendations, including the development of the central laboratory, providing assistants for the elimination of epidemiology [?], increasing medical personnel in the states, and encouraging doctors to work in rural areas.

[Apparently, the minister refutes earlier reports of occurrence of the reported 2 cases of yellow fever (YF) in Khartoum. There have been no additional press or official reports of subsequent cases there. The numbers of cases and fatalities continues to increase, but fortunately, slowly. However, it will take a few more additional days before the individuals vaccinated over the past 5 days, when the vaccination campaign started, to develop effective immunity against YF virus infections.

Development of a central laboratory would materially speed up diagnosis and increase the effectiveness of surveillance and case response. The Council of States recommendation for provision of more assistants "for the elimination of epidemiology" makes no sense and perhaps is an error in reporting. More assistants could help materially with surveillance.
