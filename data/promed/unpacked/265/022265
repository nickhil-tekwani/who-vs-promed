Fog damaging tomato crops in Uttarakhand
----------------------------------------
Due to a constant layer of fog, tomato crops in Uttarakhand [previously
Uttaranchal] have come into the clutches of a disease resulting in their
damage. Farmers of Terai region in the Nainital district raise tomato crops
on a large scale but due to the fog in the region and lack of sunlight, the
crops are getting infected with a disease named "blight". The disease is
affecting the growth of tomatoes. Farmers in the region have already
incurred losses of nearly INR 400 000 [about USD 9000].

[Late blight of tomato and potato is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. To a lesser
extent, it can also affect other solanaceous crops such as aubergine and
capsicum. The pathogen can affect leaves, stems, and fruit of tomato
causing spots, lesions, and rotting, and in potato it affects leaves as
well as tubers. The disease can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it
within a few days. It is spread by contaminated plant and other material,
wind, and water. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be
even more rapid than in potatoes.

Disease management requires an integrated approach and includes
phytosanitary measures, removal of solanaceous weeds and volunteer crop
plants serving as pathogen reservoirs, limiting free moisture in the crop,
preventative fungicide treatments of planting material (tomato transplants,
potato seed tubers), and fungicide sprays of crops. Crop rotation with
non-hosts may reduce available inoculum. While commercial crop cultivars
vary in susceptibility to late blight, development of resistant cultivars
is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen, with new strains
evolving all the time.

Outbreaks of late blight on potato crops were reported from several Indian
states as well as neighbouring countries in 2009, and the emergence in the
region of new strains with increased fungicide resistances cannot be
excluded. While weather conditions may favour the disease, it must be
considered that lack of efficient certification of planting material may
play a role in large scale outbreaks (see ProMED-mail post 20090629.2350).

The Terai region mentioned in this item is a belt of marshy grasslands,
savannas, and forests at the base of the Himalaya range in India, Nepal,
and Bhutan.
