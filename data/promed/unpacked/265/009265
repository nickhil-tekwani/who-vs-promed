The Japanese mosquito has invaded Italy. Discovered in the north east of our country, this species, the 3rd-most invasive among mosquitoes and in the world top 100, is conquering all of the north. It arrived in north eastern Italy, starting from Carnia (Friuli), and surprisingly adapts to urban environments. "The Japanese mosquito (_Aedes japonicus_) reproduces in the woods," points out Dr Fabrizio Montarsi, head of the parasitology laboratory of the Zooprophylactic Institute of Padua, "but in Europe and in Italy we find it in cities and even in small towns surrounded by nature."

The most salient feature of this species, which also lives in the humid tropical areas of South East Asia, is that it feeds on human blood. It lives and thrives in Europe in cold environments, but may infest warmer areas. It resembles the infamous tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] but is generally larger in size. Likewise, it bites even during daytime hours and is particularly aggressive and annoying.

"The fear," observes the veterinarian of the Edmund Mach Foundation, Annapaola Rizzoli, "is that from the eastern area of northern Italy it will move to the western part." There is another fear, the transmission of some specific diseases [viruses] such as dengue and chikungunya, and [it] could enter the West Nile epidemiological cycle.

"Another consequence would be Japanese encephalitis," explains Montarsi, "but in Europe, so far, we have not found any cases. For the virus to be transmitted, there must be the insect, the virus, and the exact same environment in which this transmission is possible, typically that of South East Asia."

Further laboratory tests will better establish whether the insect may be able to do harm, and with what consequences, in the [Italian] peninsula. Meanwhile, the Veneto Region website also indicates the existence in Italy of a vaccine that can be administered from 2 months of age intramuscularly, with a booster [for which virus? Japanese encephalitis? - Mod.TY]. The same page, however, currently tends to reduce the problem, underlining that "in the world there are 50 000 cases of encephalitis". And that the insect has precisely the characteristics of an invader, in the true sense of the word, is also confirmed by scientific research: "It is the 3rd-most invasive species in the world among mosquitoes," specifies Rizzoli, "and is in the top 100 of all the most invasive."

"The success of the invasion of the Japanese mosquito," observes Rizzoli, "is also due to its remarkable resistance [during movement over] long distances and the ability to develop in a series of natural and artificial containers in which there is stagnation of water." It is therefore necessary to adopt all possible good practices to avoid the proliferation of the insect. "Starting with not leaving open containers that can become full of water, not stacking materials, using mosquito nets, emptying and overturning the watering cans, keeping the areas where you live clean."

It is necessary to put in place all kinds of effort and would be wrong to underestimate this animal. We move from insecticides for adults to larvicidal interventions repeated over time up to using, with companies created ad hoc, sterilization remedies for males that, during mating, do not allow females to be fertile. But first, any action to curb the proliferation of the insect [is necessary] in order to carry out an effective deterrent action. It is necessary to monitor it in order to precisely establish where it lives and in what environments it is found.

[Carnia is a region in the north eastern Italian area of Friuli. It is not surprising that this mosquito has now been found in a new area of north eastern Italy. As of 2020, _Aedes japonicus_ has already become established in an area that includes northern Italy, north western France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, and Slovenia (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-japonicus-current-known-distribution-may-2020).

Apparently, the local health officials are concerned about the possibility of this mosquito transmitting Japanese encephalitis virus in their area because both mosquito and this vector occur in Asia, but the virus is not present in Europe. The real risk is that _Aedes japonicus_ could transmit West Nile virus, which is already present in Europe. There is no human vaccine available for West Nile virus. The increased surveillance that the local authorities propose is prudent.
