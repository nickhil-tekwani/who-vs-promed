[There is some information available on US preparedness regarding FMD.
However, lessons learned from other countries, things that have worked, and
things that need to be incorporated into a plan of this nature have been
discussed by a number of us in ProMED-mail, and several other agencies. Out
of this discussion the following has developed. We do not present it as a
complete plan, but rather as a collection of necessary points to be
addressed immediately as part of any plan in the US. - Mods.TG/MHJ
[1 Capability of slaughtering a diagnosed herd quickly (60% herds in the
first 24 hours, 40% in the next 24 hours).
[2 Confirmed diagnosis, when necessary, within 3 hours of any sick
animal's being seen. With presently available hand-held ELISA kits this
should be possible even within 15 minutes, but we are allowing some slack.
[We are amazed at the number of states that seem to be ignorant of this. -
Mods.
[3 Highly effective [100% movement controls for all stock in controlled
areas from the first hour.
[4 A compensation system, pre-agreed and acceptable to ranchers,
producers, and owners, and guaranteed capability of compensation within 3
months of date of slaughter. It is regrettable that the majority of states
do not have this in place. Many are greatly underestimating the value of
animals, the lost production, the loss of feed, and the cost of restocking.
[5 Procedures in place and industry support for the rapid preemptive
slaughter of high risk in-contact herds and flocks. Also, if slaughter is
delayed beyond the normal incubation period and evidence of disease or
infection is not seen, the culling decision can be rescinded.
[6 Rapid carcass disposal, complete within 5-6 days, regardless of the
method. Domestic napalm may be the fastest and most appropriate means of
disposal. Other systems should be explored. [See 10 below.
[7 Efficient tactical field support for predicting (a) where "it" came
from; (b) where is "it" (which neighbors -- each with a probability rating
-- may be incubating disease); (c) where will "it" next appear? Accurate
and timely meteorological data is ESSENTIAL though often neglected. This
tactical system must be capable of being updated as new data are acquired.
[8 "War-gaming" of all strategic and tactical folk within the previous
12-24 months. With rare exceptions, this has not happened. Unfortunately,
the opportunity window for training may be closing. Disaster planning as a
whole is woefully inadequate.
[9 Quartermaster support: sleeping, feeding, laundry, vehicle maintenance,
mental health/chaplain, grief counselors. This is critical and often
overlooked.
[10 Legal team and informed environmental team to instruct what can be
done, where it can be done, and to head off troublemakers. This must
function without downtime (e.g., no waiting for signatures, further
permissions) and on the phone. Phone recorders may be necessary to maintain
a record.
[11 Minimal necessary (phased) data to be collected using wireless
data-loggers with GPS (Global Positioning System), including the
information needed for tracing movements. In this way the master (common)
database is updated in real time as work is completed. Once coupled with
the meteorological and GIS data, this would provide the accurate GPS of
locations and weather data crucial to success.
[12 Liaison team to keep press well informed but out from under the feet
of workers. This is very important, but it is equally important not to hide
information. GPS systems, meteorological data, and web sites with maps and
real-time updating are most helpful to keep the flow of information open
and timely. It is vitally important to support the farming community so
that suspected new cases are called in quickly.
[13 Respect for human feelings, including those of the producers/owners of
the animals. This is a tragic and traumatic time for them. It is no easier
on the veterinarians, the slaughter-persons, and those charged with carcass
disposal. Remember to provide rotation teams or time off so that these
people can recuperate. It is appropriate to have grief counselors for these
teams and for those who lose their animals.
[14 There is a vaccine; there is also a test which can differentiate
between antibodies produced by vaccine and those produced by disease. It is
critical and essential that pressure be put on the Paris-based Office
International des Epizooties to ensure that the protective capacity of new
vaccines is confirmed, that antibodies are produced, and that the new
differentiating tests are available and standardized.

Is there no concern in the US at the governmental level with how the wild
deer population factors in? I do not see it mentioned in articles concerned
with outbreak control, other than the brief mention by Dr. Waldrup. The
population numbers are staggering, and infection of the wild herds would
doom any chance we would have, at least in the northeastern US, to control
an outbreak. (I do not know how large the herds are in other areas).
Here are some statistics and other info from the web. There were 1984 dead
deer removed from Hunterdon County (New Jersey) roadways between 1 Jun 1998
and 28 Feb 1999.

An Act concerning deer management and control, establishing a permanent
venison donation program, supplementing Title 23 of the Revised Statutes,
amending N.J.S.2C:39-3 and P.L.1997, c.268, repealing section 2 of
P.L.1997, c.268, and making an appropriation.
