Re Dr. Schaffner's comments on the difficulty of isolating shigellae
from foods, the following development might be of interest:
Together with Prof. Wanpen Chaicumpa from the Department of
Immunology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University,
Bangkok, we have developed monoclonal antibody-based antigen test
kits for _Shigella spp._ groups A, B, C, and D. A study on the
validation of those kits using rectal swabs of patients has been
published. As the kits are detecting antigens, they could also be used
for rapid food screening, but we would need a collaboration partner
for such a validation.
If you are interested, I will be glad to send you the publication and
would be most grateful if you could suggest possible partners. Any
collaboration could be directly with Prof. Wanpen and the University,
without private sector intermediaries. We would just sponsor the kits.

[Disclaimer: ProMED has no financial interest in this test, & is not
endorsing it. However, we believe that sensitive and specific assays to
detect enteric pathogens in foods will be very helpful in the evaluation
of potential food-borne pathogen transmission vehicles. - Mods.LL &
