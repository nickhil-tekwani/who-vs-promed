Veterinary laboratories in the north zone of the Ministry of Public
Health have confirmed the presence of 2 positive bovine rabies cases
from the El Triunfo paroquia, Patate canton, Tungurahua [province].

The Ecuadorian Agency for Agricultural Quality Assurance
(Agrocalidad) has indicated that, before the confirmation of this
news, 1500 doses of foot and mouth disease vaccine were sent, the
number of doses required for a population estimated at 1200 bovine
animals. [Foot and mouth disease has nothing to do with rabies. This
was mentioned as an indication of the estimated bovine population at
risk for rabies in the area. - Mod.TY]

The animals that were positive and died were not previously
vaccinated against rabies.

Agrocalidad technicians have gone to the affected area in order to
verify what happened and take measures for control together with
livestock producers and officials, recommending vaccination of cattle
in Patate and the vicinity.

[The origin of rabies in these 2 bovine cases is not indicated but
they could have been transmitted by vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_).
The presence of vampire bat bites should provide an obvious warning to
ranchers to vaccinate their cattle and horses against rabies. Saving
the life of just one animal more than pays for the cost of the vaccine
for the herd. One hopes that the remaining bovine and equine animals
in the area now have been vaccinated. Interestingly, there was a small
vampire bat-transmitted bovine rabies outbreak (4 animals) in coastal
Ecuador just 2 weeks ago (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110611.1780).
There were suspected human vampire bat-transmitted rabies cases in
Ecuador's Amazonas in 2005 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20050717.2046). Human cases of vampire bat-transmitted rabies are
rare.
