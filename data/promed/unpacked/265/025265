In late June 2007, the Epidemiological Surveillance Network in
Castilla y Leon, northern Spain, reported a series of cases in a
rural area in the province of Palencia and in the provincial capital
city of Leon, labelled as "fever of unknown origin." Subsequent
epidemiological investigation confirmed an outbreak of tularemia.

On 22 Oct 2007, the Epidemiological Surveillance Network in Castilla
y Leon confirmed 362 cases of tularemia, using the case definition
and confirmation criteria agreed to by the National Network for
Epidemiological Surveillance together with the Epidemiological and
Control Surveillance Network for Communicable Diseases in the
European Union (1,2).

A clinical picture compatible with one of the different forms of
tularemia included:
-ulceroglandular (cutaneous ulcer with regional lymphadenopathy);
-glandular (regional lymphadenopathy with no ulcer);
-oculoglandular (conjunctivitis with preauricular lymphadenopathy),
-oropharyngeal (stomatitis or pharyngitis or tonsillitis and cervical
lymphadenopathy);
-intestinal (intestinal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea);
-pneumonic (primary pneumonic disease); and
-typhoidal (febrile illness without early localizing signs and symptoms).

Laboratory criteria for diagnosis:
-isolation of _Francisella tularensis_ from a clinical specimen;
-detection of _Francisella tularensis_ genome by PCR; or
-demonstration of a specific antibody response in paired serum samples.

Case classification of confirmed case: a clinically compatible case
that is confirmed by laboratory.

Cases were confirmed using serological techniques (microagglutination
in 74.8 percent and tube agglutination in 25.2 percent), culture in 6
percent or PCR in 2 percent. _F. tularensis_ subspecies holarctica
has been identified as the causative agent of the outbreak.

The onset of symptoms in half of the cases occurred between
epidemiological weeks 28 (ending 14 Jul 2007) and 31 (ending 4 Aug
2007); 81.4 percent of reported cases were males and 18.6 percent
females. Some 62.5 percent of cases were concentrated in the 45 to 64
year old age group, although all ages were affected (6 to 88 years old).

The presentation of the disease in the cases analysed to date is
shown in the table [the table revealed that 56.6 percent of the cases
were typhoidal, 16 percent ulceroglandular, 12.1 percent glandular,
7.7 percent pneumonia and a scattering of other presentations - Mod.LL].

Some 74.6 percent of the cases were treated as outpatients by general
practitioners, while the rest required hospitalization. Patient
recovery in all cases was favorable, with a good response to the
prescribed treatment and few complications. The most frequently used
antimicrobials in this outbreak have been ciprofloxacin and
doxycycline, but other fluroquinolones and tetracyclines were also used.

The epidemiological surveillance showed that 33.7 percent of cases
were farm workers or people whose jobs involve contact with the
environment (for example, gardeners and lake and reservoir
maintenance staff). A significant number of cases report having been
in contact with rodents (23.5 percent), recent arthropod bites (16.6
percent) or animals such as dogs or cats (17.4 percent), or having
handled crayfish (17.1 percent), taken frequent walks in the country
(10.5 percent), having contact with livestock (9.7 percent), straw,
manure or alfalfa hay (5.8 percent) or having handled and/or skinned
hares (4.4 percent).

The most frequent clinical presentation of the disease and background
risk factors reported suggest 2 different means of transmission
responsible for the outbreak; firstly and principally by inhaling the
bacteria, a pattern seen in just over half the cases (pneumonic and
probably many of the typhoid forms); and secondly, through direct
inoculation with local manifestations of the disease.

Measures taken
-------------
Further cases are actively being sought. The general public and, in
particular, workers with high risk of exposure have been informed of
the disease and of preventive measures that should be taken. These were:
- avoid contact with dead, sick or unusually behaving animals;
- avoid the consumption of unsanitary water that has not had adequate
sanitary control;
- use protective clothing and repellent products to avoid bites from
insects and ticks,
- use gloves and masks when handling animals;
- do not allow children to touch dead animals;
- ensure that the meat of wild animals is cooked through before you
eat it, as freezing does not inactivate the agent responsible for tularemia,
- communicate to hunting and/or animal health authorities the
presence of dead, sick or unusually behaving animals; and
- in case of the appearance of symptoms compatible with this disease,
contact your doctor immediately.

Discussion
----------
We believe that the exposure in this outbreak has come to an end. The
majority of recently confirmed cases have a not recent onset of
symptoms. The outbreak is focused in the central areas of Castilla y
Leon (in 5 of 9 provinces) and has not spread to all areas of
Castilla y Leon or to other Spanish regions. Taking this and the
specific climatic and other conditions in the affected provinces into
account, we believe that a spread of this outbreak to Portugal is unlikely.

Tularemia has been identified as a potential agent for intentional
release, but due to the fact that this outbreak occurred in a rural
area that has fauna and crops with very particular characteristics,
and which has also experienced previous outbreaks of tularemia, we
believe it is naturally occurring. The 1st tularemia outbreak in this
region occurred in 1997 (3,4,6), with 534 cases, and there was
another in 2004 with 13 cases (5). Between 2000 and 2003, 7 cases
were reported in this region (5). In the 1997 outbreak, the mechanism
of transmission was by contact, while this year [2007], inhalation
has been more frequent. We are still investigating this outbreak but
believe that unusual climatic and environmental circumstances may
have contributed to it, together with the significant diversity of
reservoirs and sources of infection that have taken part in
transmission (leporids, sheep, rodents, canids, haematophagus
vectors). All these factors have probably aided the proliferation of
_Francisella tularensis_, a bacterium that can survive for long
periods in water, mud and animal carcasses. We intend to undertake
further studies in order to advance the knowledge of the causes of
this outbreak.

[ProMED reported on this outbreak at an earlier stage in August 2007.
It is certainly possible that the primary vehicle for transmission to
humans in this outbreak was contaminated water, as aerosolization of
the water can cause pneumonic tularemia, and skin or mucous membrane
contact can cause the varied other presentations. It is not clear
whether aerosolization of _F. tularensis_ would cause more typhoidal
cases than if the bacterium was ingested.

Unfortunately, unlike this report, most reports do not characterize
the specific subspecies. As mentioned below, both subspecies are
found in the USA, whereas holarctica is the one primarily found in Eurasia.

The following is from
<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/idsa/bt/tularemia/biofacts/tularemiafactsheet.html>:

"There are several subspecies of _F. tularensis_ with somewhat
confusing nomenclature. These subspecies can be differentiated by
biochemical tests, and the current taxonomy is as follows:

Subspecies tularensis (type A; also referred to as subspecies
nearctica by investigators in the former Soviet Union): demonstrates
citrulline ureidase activity; highly infectious and virulent; found
primarily in North America; 2 distinct genetic clades have been identified.

Subspecies holarctica (type B; formerly referred to as palaearctica
or palearctica in some sources): less virulent; does not demonstrate
citrulline ureidase activity; three biovars have been identified:

-Biovar I: erythromycin sensitive; primarily found in North America,
Europe, Siberia, the Far East, and Kazakhstan

-Biovar II: erythromycin resistant; primarily found in Eurasia

-Biovar japonica: found in Japan

Subspecies mediasiatica: found in the Central Asian republics of the
former Soviet Union (virulence is similar to _F. tularensis_,
subspecies holarctica).

Subspecies novicida: considered to be of low virulence and generally
causes illness only in immunocompromised hosts (_F. tularensis_ and
_F. novicida_ traditionally have been considered separate species;
however, the current approach is to consider _F. novicida_ as a
subspecies of _F. tularensis_.)"
