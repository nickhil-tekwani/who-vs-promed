More taken to hospital with anthrax symptoms in Jalalabad
-----------------------------------------------------------
Kyrgyz Emergency Ministry reports that 5 more patients have been
taken to hospital with anthrax symptoms in Jalalabad. All are
residents of Semet village, Aksy region, where farmers ate cow meat
and 10 days later turned to hospital with ulcers typical for anthrax.
The patients are taken care of now, while 167 persons who might have
tried that meat are taken under medical control, reported "24.kg."

The Kyrgyzstan's south has experienced an anthrax outbreak in 2008.
That time the epidemic killed one and brought dozens to hospital.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland

[The previous report had 7 medical staff from the Regional Sanitary
and Epidemiological Control Station out administering tetracycline
and the veterinary officers vaccinating the local livestock
apparently as a result of the vodka swilling single cutaneous case,
and 12 in-contact people under medical observation. The normal
anthrax incubation period is 4-8 days but it can be drawn out with
low dose exposures. I suspect we may expect to see a few more human
cases. - Mod.MHJ]
