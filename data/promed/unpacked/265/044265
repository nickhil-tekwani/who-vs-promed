The isolation of _Listeria monocytogenes_ from a sample of "Chef Daniel
Boulud Atlantic Smoked Salmon" has prompted a recall of the product by
Browne Trading.
The recalled items include four-ounce, eight-ounce, and 16-ounce
vacuum-packed containers and whole and sliced vacuum-packed sides of the
salmon with labels coded from lots "158" and "160".
Brown Trading said the salmon was distributed nationwide to restaurants,
stores, and directly to the public. No illness has been reported from
eating the salmon. Suspect salmon can be returned to the stores where it
was purchased, for a refund.

[The Gram-positive bacillus _Listeria monocytogenes_ can cause severe
disease, including life-threatening infections such as meningitis and
bacteremia with sepsis. The organism is most likely to infect people who
have defects in their cell-mediated immune system, such as solid organ
transplant recipients, pregnant women (pregnancy is a relatively
immunosuppressed state), and patients with lymphoma or AIDS. _L.
monocytogenes_ is also a cause of neonatal septicemia (granulomatosis
infantiseptica) and neonatal meningitis that may be acquired in-utero.
Although there have been no cases thus far as a result of this recalled
product, food-borne outbreaks of listeriosis have been reported from
several different types of food, including soft cheeses, meat products, and
milk. A superb summary can be found in the posting "Listeria monocytogenes
(GIDEON) 19970826111223" - Man. Ed. DS
