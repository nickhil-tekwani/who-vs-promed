UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, DEER - USA (PENNSYLVANIA)

State game officials are trying to figure out what has caused the
mysterious death of at least 30 deer in Greene County in what appears to be
an outbreak of an unknown disease.
The state Game Commission has confirmed the deaths in 2 locations and sent
2 of the dead animals last week for testing at the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA) laboratory in Harrisburg, said Rod Burns, a wildlife
conservation officer in Greene County.
"We don't know what it is," Burns said. "There's definitely a concern
there. It's not good."
The problem also is confirmed in West Virginia, Burns said. State officials
there also are trying to pinpoint the cause, he said.
Reports from West Virginia suggest the deer might be dying from hemorrhagic
disease. The ailment is similar to bluetongue disease, which is spread by
flies or gnats. If so, the spread should stop with colder weather, Burns said.
About 15 dead deer were found near the West Virginia border and another 15
near Waynesburg; both areas were confined to a square mile, he said. It is
not believed the problem could spread to humans, nor is it thought to be
West Nile virus, he said.
"Very few things that deer get could be spread to humans," Burns said.
Hemorrhagic disease was known as a southern disease and is not common in
southwestern Pennsylvania, Burns said.
Game officials have spotted more sick deer that appear lethargic, he
said. "The deer seem like they're healthy," he said. "They're not thin,
and they don't have external injuries. The deer look fine. They don't look
sick. You walk right up to them, and they just stand there."
The disease causes lesions in the mouth and throat. Infected deer often
seek out water sources, where they often die. That might explain why the
dead deer found in 2 confined locations of Greene County are not more
widespread.

[This sounds like Epizootic Hemorrhagic disease (EHD). It may be the
laboratory is just not looking for the disease, as this location is north
of where the disease typically occurs. A most excellent discussion of this
subject can be found in a previous ProMED posting, Epizootic hemorrhagic
disease, deer - USA 20020929.5428. Although there are some possible
similarities to EHD noted above, ProMED-mail would appreciate information
on the etiology of the illness described above once known. - Mod.TG]
