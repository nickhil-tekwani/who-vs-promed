Update on cryptosporidial infections, Majorca
---------------------------------------------
On 22 July 2003, the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health
(SCIEH) reported an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis to the Spanish National
Centre of Epidemiology (Centro Nacional de Epidemiolog√≠a, CNE) (1-3). This
outbreak occurred in a hotel in Majorca, in which about 2000 guests had
stayed during the epidemic period (nearly 100 per cent occupation). All the
guests at the hotel, which is used by only one tour operator, were British
tourists. The onset date of the first case was 5 July 2003. At present, CNE
is aware of 391 cases, 214 of which are known to be positive for
cryptosporidium. The latest numbers of cases reported to CNE by 13 August
are: 179 confirmed and suspected in England and Wales (75 confirmed and 104
suspected cases reported to the Health Protection Agency Communicable
Disease Surveillance Centre between 1 July and 5 August), 170 in Scotland
(112 confirmed and 58 suspected cases reported to SCIEH by 13 August) 42 in
Northern Ireland (27 confirmed and 15 suspected cases reported to
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre Northern Ireland by 13 August) No
case has been found either in the Spanish population of Alcudia or among
workers at the hotel. The main symptoms include diarrhoea, nausea,
vomiting, and fever. CNE is aware of 9 cases admitted to hospital.
The regional health authorities in Majorca have carried out an inspection
of the hotel and control measures have been taken. The hotel's swimming
pool is suspected to be the source of the infection. It was closed on 23
July, and water samples were taken.
Other control measures have been implemented to avoid transmission from ill
to healthy people (particularly transmission through babies' nappies) and
the hotel's day nurseries have been disinfected. No failures in the
infrastructure of the hotel's water supply have been found. Cryptosporidium
oocysts have been found in water from the swimming pool. The swimming pool
was emptied and disinfected, and its filters were changed. The local health
authorities have allowed the hotel's owners to refill it and use it again.
The epidemiological investigation and the control measures are continuing.
