A 10-year stand by state and local health officials against rabies on Cape
Cod broke down this week when an infected raccoon was found in Bourne.
State health officials confirmed the case yesterday, after testing [the
brain of] the battle-scarred raccoon captured by Michael Tarlow at his
residence on Monday. The barking of Tarlow's dogs did not scare off the
sickly looking raccoon. Normal raccoons would be deterred from a yard with
barking dogs.
Tarlow called the Bourne Department of Natural Resources, but the raccoon
was gone by the time anyone could respond.
When the raccoon returned Monday morning, more listless than before and
with discharge visible on the bridge of its nose, Tarlow dropped a plastic
recycling bin over it and called the town for help.
A natural resources officer picked up the animal and delivered it to Robert
Pritchard of Ace Wildlife Removal Services in Bourne.
The face of the captured raccoon, a 5-year-old male, was scratched and cut,
indications that it fought with another animal, Pritchard said.
The animal was euthanized and the body sent to a state lab in Jamaica
Plain, MA for testing.
Rabid raccoons have been lifted from the water of the Cape Cod Canal and
captured on the north side of the canal in recent years, but never before
on the Cape side.
"Nothing had breached the barrier until now," said Bourne Health Agent
Cynthia A. Coffin. "Bourne is the sentinel of the Cape."
No domestic animals or humans are believed to have been exposed to the
rabid raccoon, Coffin said. But she and other local health officials
acknowledged they do not know whether this is an isolated case or if other
rabid animals remain at large.
Rabies is a virus that affects the brain and the central nervous system of
mammals. It is fatal if not treated quickly. [Animals are not treated to
cure rabies, as there is no cure in animals. Animals believed to harbor the
disease are euthanized and the brains tested. Humans who have been exposed
may be given immunoglobulins, as a post exposure prophylaxis, which is not
actually a treatment. - Mod.TG]
County and state health officials are worried that if rabies encroaches
into animal populations on Cape Cod, it could pose a risk to domestic pets
and, eventually, people. [Hopefully, they are vaccinating domestic animals
against rabies on a regular basis. This would certainly decrease the risk
of spread in both animals and humans. - Mod.TG]
The issue also has "enormous" economic implications for town animal control
and health departments, since they will have to investigate, track, and
capture animals suspected of being infected, according to Dr. Steven
Rowell, hospital director at Tufts Veterinary School in Grafton. Rowell is
the director of the 10-year-old Cape Cod Oral Rabies Vaccination Program,
in which researchers have dropped vaccinated bait along both sides of the
Cape Cod Canal to try to keep the disease at bay. [It becomes an economic
issue because the Cape Cod area has tremendous tourism income. - Mod.TG]
It is recognized around the nation as a model prevention program, he said.
While there has never been a case of a land mammal with rabies on Cape Cod,
rabid bats have lived on or visited the Cape for years, according to Coffin.
Rabies in raccoons and skunks was first seen in Massachusetts in 1992.
Rabies in bats has been in the state for much longer.
Since 1992, 3893 animals have tested positive for the disease statewide.
Most were raccoons and skunks, followed by far fewer cases in cats, foxes,
and woodchucks.
There have been no reported cases of human infection during that time in
the state. One case was reported in 1983 in a person infected by a dog in
Africa. From 1992 to 2002, 32 cases of rabies in humans from 18 states were
reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This week's confirmed rabies case comes 9 months after state budget cuts
trimmed $40 000 from the $100 000 annual Cape Cod oral vaccination program.
State Sen. Robert O'Leary, D-Barnstable, yesterday called the cuts "penny
wise and pound foolish," and said the confirmed case proves the full
funding was necessary to keep rabies off Cape Cod.
The lab informed Bourne officials yesterday morning the raccoon had tested
positive for rabies, according to Dr. Bela Matyas, medical director of the
state health department's epidemiology program.
Rowell surmised the rabid raccoon walked across one of the bridges spanning
the canal, either foraging for food or because it was already sick and
disoriented.
Rowell yesterday said he was not about to concede the region to rabies
because of one animal. "I'm not ready to give up yet," he said. "My hope
is (other possibly infected animals) will come into contact with animals we
vaccinated last year and it will die out."
Even so, local officials are not taking any chances.
A contingency plan the county and the state have had in place ever since
the oral vaccination program began will be implemented. Possibly as early
as today, O'Brien, Rowell and a group of volunteers will toss from cars
3500 of the vaccinated 1-square-inch fish meal baits in the area where the
sick raccoon was found. If possible, they will go as far as Sandwich and
Falmouth, he said.
On Monday, health agents and animal control officers from the Cape's 15
towns will meet to coordinate a Cape-wide response.
Health officials urged residents to make sure their pets' rabies
vaccinations are current.

[Those involved in proceeding with a contingency plan are to be commended.
Although health officials are urging residents to be sure that pets are
vaccinated, one might wonder whether they should issue a general
alert. Residents may be more sensitized to vaccinating pets, and being on
the watch for animals with unusual behavior.
An excellent review of the protocol of human immunoglobulin post exposure
prophylaxis can be found in ProMED-mail archive 20010419.0770.
There are several strains of rabies. Often the strain is associated with
certain animals, for example raccoon rabies is the strain most often found
in raccoons, but it can also be passed to humans or other animals.- Mod.TG]
