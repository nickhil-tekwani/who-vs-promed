The total number of confirmed mumps cases at Wheaton College has now
reached 37, officials there said on Fri 20 Sep 2006.
The cases at Wheaton College have all been reported since 7 Sep 2006. Of
the 37 students with mumps and 3 additional suspected cases, 23 have
returned to class after completing the required 9-day isolation period. A
case of mumps was also reported at Benedictine University in Lisle this
month. The DuPage County Health Department said that [prevention measures
have been employed] vigilantly at both campuses.
Mumps has been on the decline since a vaccine was developed in the late
1960's. Federal health experts say that the mumps outbreak that began in
Iowa last December [2005] and spread to other Midwest states is considered
to be the largest in nearly 20 years.
It has not been determined if the DuPage County cases have a connection to
an outbreak in Iowa. More than 600 cases have been reported in Illinois
this year. Prior to 2006, Illinois averaged about10 mumps cases per year.
DuPage County averages from zero to 3 mumps cases per year over the past 5
years.
If a person is vaccinated against mumps, his or her risk of getting mumps
is very low. It is important, however, to be aware of the signs and
symptoms of mumps, because a person can still get mumps, regardless of age
or vaccination status. Symptoms of mumps [virus infection] include swollen
glands near the jaw, fever, headache or muscle aches.
Anyone who exhibits any of the symptoms of mumps should contact their
family physician for further evaluation. In Illinois, patients with mumps
must be isolated from day care, school, work, and public gatherings until
at least 9 days after the onset of symptoms. Complications of mumps
infection are rare, and can include deafness, meningitis/encephalitis, or
inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts. With the exception of
deafness, these complications are more common among adults than children.
Since mumps is primarily spread by direct contact with respiratory
droplets, persons may prevent contracting mumps with a few simple actions:
(1) Children and adults should be up to date with their immunizations.
Please discuss your family's vaccination history with your physician.
(2) Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and
throw the tissue away after use.
(3) Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough
or sneeze. If water is not near, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner.
(4) Do not share eating utensils or drinking containers.
(5) Refrain from close contact with individuals who are sick/experiencing
symptoms.
(6) Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. (Germs are often spread when a
person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches
his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.)

[An outbreak of mumps began in Iowa in December 2005 and involved at least
10 additional states by May 2006. As a consequence updated recommendations
of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Control
and Elimination of Mumps were published in June 2006 (see: MMWR Weekly
Release of 1 Jun 2006/55; 1-2). Sporadic outbreaks have continued up to the
present, the Wheaton College outbreak being an example.
The first cases in this multistate outbreak were detected on a college
campus in eastern Iowa in December 2005; the source of these initial cases
is unknown. Although the age group most affected (38 per cent of cases) has
been young adults aged 18 to 24 years, many of whom are college students,
the outbreak has spread to all age groups.
During the first 4 months of 2006, 11 states reported 2597 cases of mumps.
Eight states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania,
South Dakota, and Wisconsin) reported mumps outbreaks with ongoing local
transmission or clusters of cases; 3 states (Colorado, Minnesota, and
Mississippi) reported cases associated with travel from an outbreak state.
The majority of mumps cases (1487 [57 per cent]) were reported from Iowa;
states with the next highest case totals were Kansas (371), Illinois (224),
Nebraska (201), and Wisconsin (176). Twelve mumps viral isolates from 6
states were characterized; all were mumps genotype G. The genotype of the
mumps virus responsible for the outbreak at Wheaton College has yet to be
established.
Readers are referred to the account of this multistate outbreak of mumps
published in MMWR (reproduced in ProMED-mail as "Mumps - USA: multistate
(02) 20060520.1432") for discussion of the factors likely to be responsible
for the vulnerability of student populations to mumps virus infection. -
