[The Sverdlovsk region is located between the Central and
Northern Urals adjoining the Siberian plain. The total area
is 194 000 square kilometers, and the population is 4.4
million. Sverdlovsk is a city of 34 700 thousand
inhabitants. - ProMED-mail Russian correspondents.
Serous (or aseptic) meningitis is a term commonly used to
describe non-bacterial (viral) meningitis. Serous meningitis
is usually indicative of enteroviral infection, and the term
viral meningitis is now the norm. However, in the absence of
confirmation of viral infection, the direct Russian
translation is retained. Further information is awaited. -
