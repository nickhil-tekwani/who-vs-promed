Outbreak of Chagas disease in metropolitan Caracas
--------------------------------------------------
Venezuelan Health and Social Protection Minister
Luis Reyes confirmed 15 cases of Chagas disease
in the capital Caracas, following an outbreak in
the popular quarters of the city. However,
Minister Reyes flatly discarded the word "epidemic."

Health Ministry Epidemiology Director, Miriam
Morales, said 18 people had been under
observation and blood samples of 15 had been
found positive. All the people live in the same
area where the outbreak was discovered.

At the moment, 4 children are interned in Miguel
Perez Carreno Hospital. Morales maintained that
those suspected of Chagas disease will undergo 3
additional tests before a final diagnosis is
announced. The death of a baby in the same
neighbourhood 2 weeks ago is the subject of an
investigation, even though Morales is of the
opinion that the death is not related to Chagas.

Ministry Environmental Health Department
officials have been visiting the area where the
outbreak occurred and reported that the zone is
hilly and semi-urban, but have found no other persons with the symptoms.

Officials are combining the campaign to root out
the bugs that cause Chagas with anti-dengue
campaigns since both carriers -- the chipo bug
and mosquitoes -- thrive in garbage and moist areas of houses.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)
estimates that 1500 new cases of the illness are
recorded in Venezuela each year and a total of
769 people die of the disease [Chagas] every
year. Some people carry the parasite called
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ that causes Chagas disease without developing symptoms.

PAHO in its quantitative estimate of Chagas
disease in the Americas, updated as of 2005,
estimated that carriers of the disease with
visible symptoms amount to 350 000 people in
Venezuela. The insect that spreads the Chagas
disease, the chipo -- _Rhodnius prolixus_ or
"kissing bug" -- is the main mode of
transmission, said Ana Carvajal, of the Network
of Scientific Societies in Venezuela.

Experts believe that 101 488 square kilometres
[39 185 square miles] of the Venezuelan
territory, including 198 municipalities, are a
common habitat for chipo. Although the insect can
be found in the Capital District and 22
Venezuelan states, the states with most diagnosed
cases are Trujillo, Lara, Portuguesa and Barinas,
due to their geographical location at foot of
hills, near coffee plantations and houses made of
mud and straw that facilitate the survival of the vector.

However, in less than 2 and a half years, the
metropolitan area of Caracas has been affected by
3 massive outbreaks. A fruit juice was the
contamination factor both in the municipality of
Chacao and in the town of Chichiriviche de la Costa.

The symptoms of Chagas disease vary over the
course of an infection. In the early, acute
stage, symptoms are mild and usually produce no
more than local swelling at the site of
infection. After 4-8 weeks, infected individuals
enter the chronic phase of Chagas disease that is
asymptomatic for 60-80 percent of individuals.

The initial acute phase is responsive to
anti-parasitic treatments, with 60-90 percent
cure rates. These anti-parasitic treatments also
appear to delay or prevent the development of
disease symptoms during the chronic phase of the
disease, but 20-50 percent of infected
individuals will eventually develop
life-threatening heart and digestive system disorders.

The currently available anti-parasitic treatments
for Chagas disease are benznidazole and
nifurtimox, which can cause temporary side
effects in many patients including skin
disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system
irritation. Together with malaria and
schistosomiasis, Chagas is among the top 3 most
common parasite infection diseases and is closely
associated to different illness related to the heart.

The disease takes the name of the Brazilian
scientist who discovered the parasite and the
infecting insect, Dr. Carlos Chagas.

[This report states that the outbreak "occurred,"
but the source is still not known and the
outbreak may still be ongoing. Previous outbreaks
have been linked to consumption of food and
especially fruit juice contaminated with the
parasite. The fact that the current outbreak is
limited to a specific geographical area suggests
that consumption of food could again be the source. Â­ Mod.EP]
