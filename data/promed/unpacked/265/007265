Study: Wild birds spread a bird flu to Iowa hunter
--------------------------------------------------
A study of duck hunters in Iowa is believed to be the 1st to show
people can catch bird flu -- a non-threatening kind -- from wild
birds. Previous cases of people being infected with any form of bird
flu have involved domestic poultry, like chickens. The type of bird
flu seen in this study is not H5N1, the deadly form that emerged in
Asia which has sparked concerns of a potential worldwide flu
epidemic. Rather, it is H11N9, another form seen in ducks and other
waterfowl that has not been associated with human illness. In the
Iowa study, one hunter and 2 state environmental workers tested
positive for the virus, though none of the 3 men got sick, said Dr.
James Gill, the University of Iowa researcher who led the study.
Federal health officials say the finding is noteworthy. Domesticated
birds -- like chickens -- are an established source of bird flu
transmission to humans, but this is believed to be the 1st documented
case of a person getting such a virus from a wild bird.

"This study is evidence that transmission of avian influenza virus
from wild birds to humans can occur," said Tom Skinner, spokesman for
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However,
it's not clear from the paper whether the virus was spread through
blood, water or by other methods. "But we want to make clear this
type of influenza virus should not be confused with H5N1," he said
noting that domestic birds are a bigger worry when it comes to the
deadly bird flu.

The study is published in the August [2009] issue of a CDC journal,
Emerging Infectious Diseases. University of Iowa researchers went to
a state-managed duck hunting area in October 2004, and asked visiting
hunters to take part in the study. Blood from 39 hunters was tested
for antibodies that would reveal prior infection to any of about a
dozen types of bird-based influenza. Several hunters had antibodies
to H1, H2 and H3 forms of bird flu, which have adapted to humans and
are now routinely seen in people. But one hunter also tested positive
for H11N9, which is not seen in humans. The hunter, 39, was a healthy
Iowa man who had been hunting birds for 31 years and who kills or
handles hundreds of birds a year, Gill said. "So he has had a lot of
exposure," said Gill, zoonotic disease specialist at Iowa's Hygienic
Laboratory in Iowa City.

In addition, H11N9 antibodies were seen in 2 of 68 Iowa Department of
Natural Resources [DNR] workers who were studied. The men, ages 52
and 53, have placed leg bands on ducks for years. None of the hunters
or DNR workers infected had a history of working with domesticated
birds, Gill said.

The researchers took fecal swabs from ducks that were shot the day
the hunters were studied, but testing and typing of those samples is
not yet completed, Gill said. Gill advised hunters to wear gloves
while handling birds, and to disinfect their hands afterward with
hand sanitizers or soap and water.

[The research described in this report is titled "Avian Influenza
among Waterfowl Hunters and Wildlife Professionals", and the authors
are James S. Gill, Richard Webby, Mary J.R. Gilchrist,* and Gregory
C. Gray. It is published in Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 12, No.
8, August 2006
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no08/06-0492.htm>. The abstract
reads: "We report serologic evidence of avian influenza infection in
one duck hunter and 2 wildlife professionals with extensive histories
of wild waterfowl and game bird exposure. 2 laboratory methods showed
evidence of past infection with influenza A/H11N9, a less common
virus strain in wild ducks, in these 3 persons."

The authors point out that wild ducks, geese, and shorebirds are the
natural reservoir for influenza A virus, and all 16 hemagglutinin (H)
and 9 neuraminidase (N) subtypes of influenza A virus are found in
these wild birds. Recently, the rapid spread of influenza A/H5N1
virus to new geographic regions, possibly by migrating waterfowl, has
caused concern among public health officials who fear an influenza
pandemic. Until now, serologic studies of the transmission of subtype
H5N1 and other highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza have
focused on humans who have contact with infected domestic poultry. In
this cross- sectional seroprevalence study, we provide evidence of
past influenza A/H11 infection in persons who were routinely, heavily
exposed to wild ducks and geese through recreational activities (duck
hunting) or through their employment (bird banding). This study is
the 1st to show direct transmission of influenza A viruses from wild
birds to humans [and evidence of H11N9 infection in humans ?].

In their conclusions the authors state that "the relative lack of
antibody response in the study population, who had substantial
exposures to waterfowl with influenza A infections, suggests that
avian influenza infections in humans exposed to wild waterfowl may
occur more commonly than we are able to detect with current methods.
Although the sample size of our study was relatively small, our
results suggest that handling wild waterfowl, especially ducks, is a
risk factor for direct transmission of avian influenza virus to humans."

The route of transmission (e.g., via contaminated water or by direct
contact with infected bird) has not been determined and the survival
of H11N9 virus virus in the exposed individuals has not been
confirmed. - Mod.CP]
