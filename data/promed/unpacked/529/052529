Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus -- update
------------------------------------------------------------
The National Health and Family Planning Commission, China, notified WHO of a new laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The patient is a 67 year old man from Zhejiang Province. He is a farmer, and has had contact with live poultry. He became ill on 16 Oct 2013, was admitted to a local township hospital on 18 Oct 2013, and was transferred to another hospital on 21 Oct 2013 as his condition deteriorated. He is currently in a critical condition.

To date [24 Oct 2013], WHO has been informed of a total of 137 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection including 45 deaths. Currently, 4 patients are hospitalized and 88 have been discharged. So far, there is no evidence of sustainable human-to-human transmission.

The Chinese government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:
- strengthening of epidemic surveillance and analysis;
- deployment of medical treatment;
- conducting public risk communication and information dissemination;
- strengthening international cooperation and exchanges; and
- is continuing to carry out scientific research.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

[This is the official WHO confirmation of the 137th human case of laboratory-confirmed avian influenza H7N9 virus infection, and the 48th in Zhejiang province.

Information from a Xinhua News Agency source (via machine translation of http://www.zj.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/headlines/2013-10/24/c_117845520.htm, in Chinese) states that that there is a high proportion (70 per cent) of farmers and retirees among these patients. At present, Zhejiang province has reported 48 cases of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza, comprising 30 cases in Hangzhou, 12 cases in Huzhou, 3 cases in Jiaxing, 2 cases in Wenzhou, and one case in Shaoxing. Of these 48 patients, the largest proportion are farmers -- a total of 19 people, accounting for 40 per cent of the patients; followed by retirees, a total of 15 cases, accounting for 31 per cent of all cases. Three cases were company employees and the occupations of the others included a cook, a pigeon breeder, a driver, and a street cleaner, with the remainder self-employed or unemployed. The age composition was the following: 26 patients (54 per cent) were aged 60 or over, 13 patients were aged 40-60 years (27 per cent); and 9 under 40 years of age.

It is clear that close contact with poultry and advancing years are risk factors for contracting H7N9 avian influenza virus infection. - Mods.AS/CP
