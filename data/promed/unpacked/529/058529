The South Africa National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) reported recently an increase in pertussis, or whooping cough, in the 1st 9 months of 2022.

Very few pertussis cases were reported through the notifiable medical conditions (NMC) surveillance system in 2020 (n=169) and 2021 (n=27) in South Africa, likely as a result of decreased transmission related to non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

From the beginning of 2022 to 15 Sep 2022, 147 pertussis cases were notified, with a steady increase in the number of cases reported since May and a sharp increase from July (n= 23 cases) through August (n = 33) and September (n = 53).

Of the 147 cases, 77% were children less than 5 years of age (113/147) of which 89 (79%) were children less than 3 months. The majority of cases 42%, (62/147) were from the Western Cape. In July and August 2022, the cases reported were evenly distributed across provinces and in keeping with numbers reported before COVID-19, while in September 2022, the majority of cases, 79% (38/48) were reported from Western Cape and numbers higher than those reported from this province pre-COVID-19.

Of the 38 cases reported from the Western Cape in September, 89% (34/38) of cases were observed from children less than 5 years of which 74% (25/34) were children less than 3 months. Of the 34 children less than 5 years of age, only 26 have vaccination statuses, of which 65% (17/26) were up to date with their vaccinations.

Pertussis, commonly known as 'whooping cough' is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ and is a notifiable medical condition according to the National Health Act, 2003 (ACT NO. 61 of 2003). Immunity following vaccination is thought to last for 5-6 years. Episodic increases in pertussis cases occur in vaccinated populations every 3-5 years.

[Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable infection. In South Africa, as elsewhere, DTaP, and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization. (Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lowercase "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)

The highest burden of pertussis in Africa is among infants, who are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, pertussis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322245/). Specifically, in South Africa, almost half the deaths from pertussis in children occur in the very young, that is, during the neonatal period (the 1st 4 weeks of a child's life) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021000311). In fact, the news article above reports that 79% of pertussis cases in children under 5 years of age were less than 3 months old. However, because infants that age are too young to be fully vaccinated, the 1st DTaP vaccination is not given until about 2 months of age. In South Africa, DTaP is given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks and 18 months of age.

Maternal immunization with Tdap has been used to not only protect pregnant women but also their newborn children from pertussis because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination between the 27th and 36th week of pregnancy. South Africa recommends immunization against pertussis with Tdap be given to the expectant mother during this time (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021000311).

It would be helpful to know what percentage of pregnant women in South Africa are immunized during each of their pregnancies. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
