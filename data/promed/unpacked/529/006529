Montana's cool, wet spring conditions have led to a fungus in cereal
crops and grasses that can lead to livestock poisonings, says a
Montana State University (MSU) plant pathologist. The fungus is ergot
and can poison any livestock, but reports are a bit more frequent
when horses or young calves are involved, said MSU's Barry Jacobsen.
As little as 0.1 percent ergot in rations can have adverse effects on
livestock health and performance.
While MSU has had some reports of infections already, most ergot
infections won't be reported for a few more weeks when grasses and
cereal grains have headed. "With the conditions we've got, we're
going to find it everywhere that it has been wet, and there are only
a few places in Montana that have not been wet," Jacobsen said.
While ergot is most common in rye and triticale, it also occurs on
wheat and occasionally on barley. It is relatively uncommon in oats,
Jacobsen said. Grasses commonly infected include quackgrass, brome
grass, red top, feather grass, foxtail, rye grass, orchard grass,
crested wheat grass, and timothy. In many cases, ergot produced in
native grasses is the major source of infection for wheat and other
cereal crops. Jacobsen said pastures should be checked for ergot
infections. If ergot is widespread, the grass heads should be cut and
left to dry several weeks before grazing.
The ergot fungus, _Claviceps purpurea_, forms hard purple to black
masses that replace individual grains or seeds. These "sclerotia"
vary from 1 inch [2.5 cm] long on rye, to less than a quarter-inch on
some grasses. In most cases, the sclerotia will be similar or
slightly larger than healthy seeds. Soon after infection, a
yellowish-white or orange sticky fluid exudes from infected flowers.
This is the "honey-dew" stage of the disease. The sticky fluid
contains spores of the ergot fungus, which are spread by insects or
rain splash to other grass flowers. Infections can take place as long
as pollination is occurring. Warm to hot dry weather is unfavorable
for infection.
The only treatment for ergot poisoning of animals is to remove the
contaminated feeds or remove animals from contaminated pasture. If
advanced symptoms are present, a veterinarian should be consulted
about supplemental therapy.

[2] Stripe rust, wheat

Stripe rust has been confirmed in Gallatin County on susceptible hard
white winter wheat varieties. "Conditions have been extremely
favorable for stripe rust development, and if it remains cool and
wet, we may see this disease blow up very quickly," said Mary
Burrows, Montana State University (MSU) Extension plant pathologist.
Germination of the spores is best between 41 and 59 deg F [5 - 15 deg
C]. Fungicide application is appropriate through flowering, but once
the crop is in the grain-filling stage, fungicides are unlikely to be
economically reasonable, Burrows said.
Wheat growers who have planted a variety known to be susceptible to
stripe rust need to scout their fields and look for the yellow
pustules that occur in stripes, she said. To some extent, the
symptoms vary with wheat variety. Symptoms generally are more severe
in the bottom of the plant canopy where there is more moisture.
The fungus can affect both winter and spring wheat. A range of wheat
varieties is available with different degrees of resistance to stripe
rust. A resistant to moderately resistant variety can develop lesions
but generally does not have to be sprayed. Moderately susceptible
varieties may experience yield losses under severe disease.
If symptoms are seen, and the stand is a susceptible variety with
yield potential high enough to justify the cost, fungicide should be
sprayed at the 1st appearance of symptoms, Burrows advised. Most
registered products have a 45-day waiting period between application
and harvest, so grain growers need to consider the interval to crop
maturity.
Stripe rust symptoms can be confused with leaf rust, which also is
very prevalent in the Great Plains this summer [2007], though no
reports have been received of it in Montana.

[The parasitic ergot fungus _Claviceps purpurea_ inhabits northern
temperate regions, but it can be found also in subtropical regions.
It has a wide host range of grasses (_Graminaea_) with rye being the
most frequently affected crop. The species has variable morphology
and can be separated into 3 discrete groups based on host species and
toxins produced. Sclerotia ("ergots") left behind in the field serve
as sources of infection of the next season's crop. Infection reduces
grain yield and the fungus produces mycotoxins contaminating the
harvested crop.
A number of important medical discoveries have come from the study of
ergot. Generally, ergot produces vasoconstriction and psychoactive
effects. One of the psychoactive components of ergot fungus is the
alkaloid ergine (d-lysergic acid amide), better known as natural LSD.
Historically, ergot has been used to control hemorrhage during
childbirth, and in 1935 the alkaloid ergonovine was identified and
associated with this effect. The alkaloid ergotamine has been used
extensively to relieve migraine headaches. Ergot for use in various
prescription drugs is grown commercially.
Ergot poisoning ('ergotism') of humans has been implicated in
epidemics causing thousands of fatalities in the Middle Ages.
Ergot-induced gangrene is called St. Anthony's Fire. One of the
reasons for the Salem witch trials is thought to have been abnormal
behaviour caused by ergot. It has also been said that the Russian
army lost a major battle due to large scale poisoning by rye bread
containing ergot while their Turkish opponents were eating
uncontaminated wheat.
Animals may be affected by eating small amounts of ergot over a long
period of time, or eating greater quantities in a short period of
time. Chronic toxicity by field exposure is the most common scenario
with symptoms showing within several weeks of ergot consumption.
Ergot may also cause spontaneous abortions in animals.
A related fungus, _C. africana_, causes ergot of sorghum.
Wheat stripe rust, also called yellow rust, is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly
in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants, and reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield
losses may vary from 40 up to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some
barley varieties, triticale, and a number of grass species. Spores
are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. The
fungus needs living plants to survive between seasons, it cannot
survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer plants may generate a
"green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops.
Leaf rust, also called brown rust, of wheat is caused by the related
fungus _P. triticina_.
