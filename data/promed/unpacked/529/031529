The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has completed an
analysis of the disease risks posed by the importation of unprocessed wool.
Unprocessed wool has been imported from a limited number of countries but
in response to requests to broaden trade and analysis was made of the risk
that wool could serve to introduce diseases of livestock. The analysis
noted at the outset that the scientific literature contains no reports of
imported fibre having been shown to be responsible for the introduction of
disease agents into animal populations.
The risk analysis considered three forms of fibre; namely greasy fibre for
scouring and further processing, fleeces for home spinning and fibre for
laboratory testing. The analysis considered risks to animal health, and any
disease risks to persons handling imported fibre. The diseases considered
were predominantly those of sheep and goats which are listed in OIE Lists A
and B. Exotic mites and ticks were also considered.
The hazard identification consisted of a consideration of the epidemiology
of each disease, particularly the survival of the agent in the environment
and route of transmission. It concluded that 11 exotic diseases might
conceivably be carried in fibre of sheep and goats. Any disease which is
likely to survive on fibre for a less than a week was not considered to be
a potential hazard.
The risk assessment considered in turn each of the diseases identified.
This was done in several steps :
* The release assessment examined the treatments involved in scouring and
further processing of fibre, to assess which of the identified disease
agents would be able to survive through processing. The assessment
concluded that scouring could not be relied on to inactivate all diseases
of potential concern, and that waste products from scouring might also
contain disease agents.
* The exposure assessment considered possible routes by which disease
agents in imported fibre might result in disease establishment in New
Zealand livestock. It concluded that the likelihood of imported fibre
coming into contact with livestock is extremely small.
* The consequence assessment considered the effects of the introduction and
establishment in New Zealand for each disease.
* The risk estimation summarised the overall risk, and came to a conclusion
as to whether or not safeguards are warranted.
Risk management measures were recommended for the each of the three forms
of the commodity under consideration, for the following diseases:
Foot and mouth disease
Sheep pox and goat pox
Anthrax
Q fever
Caprine and ovine brucellosis (_B. melitensis_)
Contagious agalactia
Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia
Enzootic abortion of ewes
Salmonellosis (_S. abortus ovis_)
Sheep scab
Exotic ticks within the family Ixodidae
During the risk analysis process MAF consulted widely with recognised
international experts to ensure that the conclusions are technically sound
and the safeguards appropriate.
