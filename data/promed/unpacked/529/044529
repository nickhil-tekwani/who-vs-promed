More horses fall to mystery illness at Kooralbyn
------------------------------------------------
Just one horse is still standing on a southeast Queensland property
crippled by a mystery illness which has killed 21 quarter horses.

David Barry, who is caring for 4 surviving horses at the property at
Kooralbyn, 90 km [56 mi] west of the Gold Coast, said 3 of them were
sick on the ground today [11 Oct 2011].

"When I got to them a few minutes ago I found 3 of them down," Mr
Barry said. "One of them got back up but I still have 2 down at the
moment. I've alerted Biosecurity Queensland and we're just going to
give the horses a bit of a rest, monitor them, and see how they pull
up later today." Results from a new round of autopsies are expected
tomorrow afternoon [12 Oct 2011], with analysis being widened to
include tests for botulism.

"The problem with that is that there's no longer any anti-serum for
botulism," Mr Barry said.

"The last batch was used 15 years ago on the Gold Coast, and I've been
told if the tests come back positive for botulism nothing can be done
to save the last of the horses."

Mr Barry said botulism spores can remain dormant in a horse's gut for
up to 12 months.

"The trigger could be some form of toxic weed, paralysis ticks or bad
water," he said.

"I've been talking to vets all over Queensland and they're saying the
signs are spot-on for botulism, which can get into dam water from dead
cattle, but it's just crazy watching all these horses go down.

"I've got onto a man who makes herbal remedies and he made up some
doses for botulism last night and we got that into the remaining
horses, just because there's nothing else I can do and something is
better than nothing. If the tests come back positive for botulism
tomorrow then at least I've already started the treatment, and if it's
not, it won't do them any harm anyway."

Authorities confirmed a new case of Hendra disease in a horse at
Beachmere, north of Brisbane, today [11 Oct 2011], but the virus has
been ruled out as the cause of death in the Kooralbyn quarter horses.

Their owner of the horses has expressed concern that his animals, bred
for sprint events, may have been deliberately poisoned by an opponent
of racing. The RSPCA has ruled out animal cruelty in the deaths.

[The statement that the botulism spores can live in the animal's
intestines and then be triggered by something is not quite right. What
the caretaker is referring to is a situation involving foals, not
horses the size of the ones that have died.

Horses are the most sensitive of the domesticated animals to botulism.
Botulism is a disease that occurs when toxins produced by the
bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ enter the horse's body causing
weakness which may progress to paralysis. The botulism bacterium is a
spore-forming, anaerobic bacteria (grows in the absence of oxygen)
which is found worldwide. It is commonly present in soil and in
decaying animal carcasses.

When the bacterium grows, it produces one or more toxins. These toxins
block the connection between the nerves and muscles. As a result,
affected horses often exhibit signs varying from muscle weakness to
paralysis.
Affected horses:
- usually have muscle tremors,
- may be so weak that they cannot stand up,
- lose control of their tongue so it may hang from their mouth,
- can't eat and they drool because they can't swallow,
- may walk stiffly with a short stride or they may be weak and
stumble. Their tail may lose its tone.

Eventually they die because their respiratory muscles become paralysed
or because they get other health problems from being down. These
clinical signs can occur within several hours or up to 7-10 days post
ingestion of the contaminated feed.

Horses can get botulism in any of 3 ways. In foals up to 8 months of
age, botulism can occur if the bacterium grows in the foal's
intestines. Foals that are growing well and are being fed grain are
most likely to get into trouble. These foals are called "shaker foals"
because the muscle weakness from the toxin makes them tremble.

Occasionally a wound can become infected with the bacterium and cause
botulism in adults. Fortunately, this is rare. Far more commonly,
botulism occurs when horses eat feed or water which contains preformed
toxin. Clostridia grow on substrates (food sources) which are above a
pH of 4.5 and are in an anaerobic (non oxygen) environment. Here they
produce toxins.

Improperly preserved haylage can be an ideal environment for
clostridial growth. Water and feed can also be contaminated with the
carcass of a dead animal. When several horses develop botulism, toxin
in feed or water is usually the reason.

Seven distinct serotypes of botulinum toxin have been isolated. They
are designated types A through G. There appears to be a geographical
distribution of the various serotypes as well as association with
different feed sources. The following indicates the serotype and the
typical species involved in a poisoning:
- types A, B, and C have been seen in cattle;
- type A botulinum toxin has been incriminated in several outbreaks in
horses in the northwestern United States (Washington, Idaho, Montana,
Oregon);
- type B predominates and is referred to as forage botulism because of
its association with contaminated forage;
- type C is referred to as carrion botulism because of the association
with the ingestion of feed containing a decomposing carcass (such as,
rodent, cat, dog, bird) or from eating the bones of dead animals;
- types C and D are found in poultry and poultry manures, mink, and
wild ducks;
- type E occurs in fish or in association with the consumption of fish
products.

The clinical signs of botulism are similar to other causes of central
nervous signs, including rabies, the equine viral encephalitis
diseases such as Eastern, Western, or West Nile encephalitis and the
nervous form of equine viral rhinopneumonitis. Botulism is diagnosed
by eliminating other causes of central nervous disease and associating
a point source such as the feeding of haylage.

Rarely is it possible to detect botulinum toxin in the serum of
affected animals or in suspect feed. The mouse toxin assay is the gold
standard for toxin detection and typing. However, it may take up to 4
days to complete the test. Although a positive test confirms the
presence of the toxin, a negative test does not mean that an animal is
not affected by the disease.

Botulism is difficult to treat. There is a polyvalent (A-E) anti-toxin
available from Dr Bob Whitlock at New Bolton Center, University of
Pennsylvania. However, it costs about USD 3000 per horse. Other plasma
products (Veterinary Dynamics) contain type B antitoxin. The
University of Guelph and some other teaching hospitals maintain a
supply of antitoxin. The antitoxin is most beneficial if used when
animals are first seen to be sick. With supportive care, horses can
recover but, if they are exposed to a large amount of toxin, most will
die despite treatment.

An inactivated toxoid is used to vaccinate against botulism. A toxoid
is a toxin which has been treated to destroy its toxicity but retains
its ability to generate an immune response when injected into an
animal. Neogen Biologics, Michigan, USA, manufactures Bot Tox-B. It is
available in Canada from some suppliers. It protects against type B
only. A 3-initial-dose vaccination program is recommended followed by
a single annual vaccination.
