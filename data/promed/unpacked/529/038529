North Carolina: state stops testing dead birds for West Nile virus
-----------------------------------------------
State health officials will stop testing dead birds for West Nile virus
infection based on the assumption that it is present across North Carolina.
Instead, officials will concentrate their efforts on controlling the
mosquitoes that [transmit] the virus by feeding on infected birds and then
biting other animals or humans.
West Nile virus is common in Africa and the Middle East. It 1st appeared in
the United States in 1999 -- when human cases were discovered in New York
-- and has slowly spread across the country. The 1st cases in North
Carolina were reported in birds in 2000. North Carolina's 1st human case
was reported in a Vance County man in Sep 2002. During 2003, the virus was
identified in birds, horses, or humans in 92 counties. 22 North Carolinians
contracted the infection in the state in 2003, and 2 people died.

[This situation illustrates a potential weakness of epidemiologic analyses
based on statistics compiled from state records. - Mod.CP]
[One wonders if assuming that bird-die offs are due to WNV before
documenting the virus is present in a geographic area might not lead to a
delay in identification of a new disease or other diseases that might be
more prominent in a given year. - Mod.MPP]

California: crows test West Nile virus-positive in Los Angeles county
----------------------------------------------
Los Angeles health officials, on Thu 22 Apr 2004, warned people to take
precautions against mosquitos after crows in the county tested positive for
West Nile virus. "These findings are a clear warning that the virus is
continuing to circulate and amplify in the environment. Now is the time to
take precautions," said Steve West of the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and
Vector Control District.
The virus is carried by birds and transmitted to people by mosquitoes. The
1st likely case of human West Nile infection in the United States this year
was reported in Ohio last week [ending Sun 18 Apr 2004]. In 2003, almost 10
000 people nationwide were infected, and some 260 people died from West
Nile virus infection.
Health experts say that the best protection is to avoid mosquito bites by
staying indoors from dusk to dawn and by wearing long sleeves and trousers
when outside.
