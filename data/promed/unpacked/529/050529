Lumpy skin disease: Balkans outbreak-free in 2018
----------------------------------------------------------
Vaccination and other control measures have succeeded in halting the epidemic of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the Balkans, new data suggest.

EFSA's latest report on the status of the disease in southeastern Europe shows that there were no new outbreaks in 2018. The number of outbreaks had declined dramatically in 2017, down to 385 from 7483 in 2016, and the latest data indicate that the disease is now absent from the region.

More than 2.5 million cattle were vaccinated in 2018, maintaining coverage above 70% across the region. LSD is, however, still present in Russia, Turkey, and Georgia, where there were 63, 46, and 6 outbreaks, respectively, in 2018.

Due to the continuing threat of reintroduction from LSD-affected countries, the report [https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2019.5638] recommends that the vaccination programme be continued in 2019 in high-risk areas of the Balkans such as Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Kosovo, and the southern part of Serbia.

In addition, any country lifting its vaccination programme is expected to demonstrate that it is disease-free by setting up a surveillance scheme along the lines indicated by the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE). Croatia successfully implemented such a scheme last year [2018].

[From the full EFSA report, published on 21 Mar 2019 in EFSA Journal 17 (3) e05638, we hereby reproduce, for subscribers' convenience, the summary and recommendations chapters:

1. Summary
-------
"European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) continued the reporting on the lumpy skin disease (LSD) epidemic and the data collection from affected and at‐risk countries in South‐Eastern Europe about LSD outbreaks and vaccination. Monitoring of the LSD epidemics in the region is part of the long‐term objective of the LSD vaccination exit strategy in South‐Eastern, which is to restore the LSD‐free status in the region.

"The present report is referred to the situation up to the end of 2018 and provides a description of the epidemiological situation of LSD and the vaccination campaign in place in Europe and in neighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Russian Federation. In addition, the basic reproduction number [BRN, or the number of cases one case generates on average over the course of its infectious period in an otherwise uninfected population] of the within‐village LSD spread (as a proxy of within‐herd spread) was estimated with the outbreak data for Albania in 2016. The BRN can be used to assess the level of vaccination required to control an outbreak (i.e., to reduce BRN below one).

"In 2018, no outbreaks of LSD were reported in the Balkan region after a decline in the number of outbreaks reported in 2017 (385) compared to 2016 (7483). This confirms the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign based on the LSD homologous strain and the coordinated control measures put in place in the region. The halt of the LSD epidemic achieved in the Balkans in 2018 is in agreement with the long‐term strategic objective of the LSD vaccination exit strategy in the South‐Eastern Europe, which is to restore the LSD‐free status situation as it was before the occurrence of the LSD epidemics and to stop the LSD vaccination in the region.

"In 2018, LSD outbreaks were only reported in Russia (63 outbreaks), Turkey (46 outbreaks), and Georgia (6 outbreaks) in the period between April and November [2018], thus confirming the seasonal pattern of LSD. Compared to 2017, the LSD epidemics in the Russian Federation expanded northward and eastward along the border with Kazakhstan, while in Turkey, most outbreaks were reported in the Eastern regions. The outbreaks in Turkey represent a threat for the neighbouring EU countries, especially Greece and Bulgaria, which can be at risk of new incursion.

"Since 2013, the presence of LSD has been constantly reported in Turkey, with active outbreaks reported until the end of 2018. This was despite vaccination campaigns based on heterologous vaccine (SGPV vaccine) performed since 2014 with apparently high levels of vaccination coverage of Turkish cattle population. This might support the hypothesis of insufficient levels of protection conferred by heterologous vaccines, especially when doses less than 10 times those recommended for sheep are used. Therefore, the use of the homologous LSD vaccine in Turkey, at least in the Thrace region, should be encouraged in order to better protect cattle and prevent from further spread of LSD to the EU.

"The current epidemiological situation indicates that LSD is still present in some countries neighbouring the EU, thus supporting the recommendations provided by the Standing Group of Experts on LSD in South‐Eastern Europe under the Global Framework for the progressive control of Transboundary Diseases (GF‐TADs) umbrella of continuing the vaccination campaign in 2019, at least in Albania (due to most recent outbreaks reported in autumn 2017), Bulgaria (all or part of), Greece, Kosovo,* Montenegro, Serbia (the southern part), North Macedonia, and Turkey.

"The vaccination against LSD based on homologous vaccine in South‐Eastern Europe continued throughout 2018 when over 2.5 million cattle were vaccinated, keeping the vaccination coverage above 70% in the whole region in terms of proportion of immunised animals, indicating a very good level of immunity throughout the year and good implementation of the vaccination campaign. At the end of 2018, the lowest value was recorded in Albania (around 22%), then 58% in Kosovo,* 71% in Greece, 80% in Montenegro and over 90% in Bulgaria, Serbia and North Macedonia.

"Concerning vaccine safety, given the large size (over 2 million doses administered yearly) of the vaccination campaign against LSD based on a live‐attenuated homologous strain put in place in the Balkan region since 2015, the number of reports from the field suggests a very limited number of side effects.

"Nevertheless, from published literature, it can be concluded that local (at the injection site) or even systemic side effects may occur in some animals after vaccination. However, since the reports are based on case series without proper controls, it is not possible to adequately estimate the production losses (milk yield, mortality, morbidity, etc.) from these studies. Therefore, there is no consensus on the proportion of animals experiencing such effects and on the real consequences of the side effects on production. To quantify production losses due to vaccination, a (retrospective) observational study should be designed using, e.g., milk yield as outcome variable while considering confounding factors and bias. This requires, however, an in‐depth study of a well‐structured database in the naive cattle population in a country where the disease has not been detected, but vaccination has been implemented such as Croatia and/or Bosnia and Herzegovina.

"The transmission rate and BRN for spread of LSD virus within a village were estimated from outbreak data for Albania in 2016. There was variation amongst villages in BRN estimates; across all villages, the posterior median for BRN varied from 0.03 to 3.58, with a median of 0.87. In addition, the posterior median for BRN exceeded one (meaning the disease would spread further) in 35.0% of villages, while 9.9% of villages had an estimate for BRN significantly below one (meaning disease would fade out). There was a significant decline in BRN during the epidemic, which is likely to be a consequence of seasonality in the transmission rate, potentially related to changes in vector abundance. Based on the 95th percentile for BRN in each village in Albania and assuming a vaccine effectiveness of 62.5%, the level of vaccine coverage (95% credible interval) required to control an outbreak varies from 7.3% to 91.7%, with a median of 52.5%."

2. Recommendations:
-------------------
"- Although, in the Balkan region, a steady decline of outbreaks was already registered in 2017 and no outbreaks at all were reported in 2018, LSD is still present in some countries neighbouring the EU, such as Turkey, thus the recommendation by the GF TADs to continue the vaccination campaign in 2019 in Albania, Bulgaria (all or part of), Kosovo, Greece, Montenegro, Serbia (southern part), North Macedonia, and Turkey is valid.

"- Due to the outbreak reported in Turkish Thrace in 2018, the use of the homologous LSD vaccine in Turkey, at least in the Thrace region, should be encouraged in order to better protect cattle and prevent from further spread to EU.

"- As considered in the OIE's TAHC, the lift of the vaccination from a country should be replaced by a surveillance scheme based on clinical, virological, and serological surveillance as, for example, implemented in Croatia in 2018, where it could be demonstrated that there is no LSD virus circulation, and thus, the freedom status can be reacquired and the restrictions in relation to LSD vaccination can be lifted.

"- To quantify production losses due to vaccination, a (retrospective) observational study should be designed using milk yield as outcome variable while taking into account confounding factors and bias. This requires, however, an in-depth study of a well-structured database in the naive cattle population in country where the disease has not been detected, but vaccination has been implemented such as Croatia and/or Bosnia and Herzegovina."
