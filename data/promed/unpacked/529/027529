[Earlier this year (2014), Poland reported an African swine fever event in the Podlaskie region, where 2 outbreaks in wild boar were identified. The event was reported resolved in March 2014 (see ProMED-mail posts 20140218.2285021 and 20140225.2299975). An update and map for this event are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015045_20140331_144006.pdf

The following information was obtained from the European Commission on African swine fever website at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/asf_en.htm:

"The European Union has laid down prevention and control measures to be applied where African swine fever [ASF] is suspected or confirmed either in holdings or in wild boars. These include information measures and measures to prevent and eradicate the disease. The overarching piece of legislation providing the tool for the control of African swine fever in the EU is Council Directive 2002/60/EC, see http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:02002L0060-20080903 of 27 Jun 2002.

In this framework, new specific regionalisation measures have been taken with respect to evolution of the ASF situation in the EU: Commission Implementing Decision of 27 Mar 2014 (2014/178/EU) concerning animal health control measures relating to ASF in certain Member States (see document at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014D0178&from=EN).

A map summarising the current regionalisation applied in Lithuania and Poland is provided; see http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/poland_lithuania_asf_regionalization_en.pdf.

Document SANCO/7138/2013 (http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/sanco_7138_2013_asf_wb_en.pdf contains Guidelines on surveillance and control of ASF in feral pigs and preventive measures for pig holdings. The aim of this document is to provide Member States guidance for controlling ASF when the disease is suspected or confirmed in feral pigs.

These guidelines are based on:
- the provisions of Council Directive 2002/60/EC, and in particular of Articles 15 and 16;
- chapter IV(H) of the Annex to Commission Decision 2003/422/EC;
- the EFSA Scientific Opinion of the Panel on AHAW [Animal Health and Welfare] on the control and eradication of classic swine fever in wild boar;
- the EFSA Scientific Opinion of the Panel on AHAW on African swine fever.

The EU legislation referenced above is fully in line with OIE international standards. Nevertheless, in order to ensure a higher level of animal health protection, the EU goes beyond the OIE requirements and applies stricter standards. In the current application of regionalisation in Lithuania and Poland, for example, no pigs, their semen, embryos, or ova are allowed to be moved from the infected area." - Mod.CRD
