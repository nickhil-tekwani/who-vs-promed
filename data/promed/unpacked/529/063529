Officials keep eye on ostrich parasite
--------------------
Department of Conservation (DoC) staff say they are leaving it up to
agriculture officials to decide how to handle an ostrich parasite which
poses a potential threat to kiwi.
Any attempt to eradicate it would require stringent controls for a long
time, DoC's acting chief technical officer, Allan Ross, said. "We're
confident ... the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Maf) has a
systematic approach to investigating the issue and consulting us
regularly. If we get to a point where we feel kiwi are at risk, we will
certainly be pushing Maf to take a precautionary approach."
But DoC did not think that eradication was required. "We're not confident
at this point that it is a feasible thing to ask for or that it is
necessary," Mr Ross said.
Maf staff have found wireworm, an internal parasite which can kill young
ostriches, on farms at Reporoa and Hastings, and South Island farmers have
reported the parasite as well. The nematode causes a disease known as
"vrotmaag" or rotten stomach in South Africa's farmed ostriches, killing up
to 50 percent of juvenile birds.
Mr Ross said parasite eggs in ostrich faeces were unlikely to be taken up
by kiwi, even though the eggs could survive for 30 months in
pasture. "There are very few places where ostrich farms overlap with kiwi
habitat," he said. There were some overlaps in Northland and Westland.
Mr Ross discounted the potential for parasite eggs to be carried to kiwi
habitat on boots or vehicles that had been to ostrich farms, because it was
unlikely kiwis would eat the parasite's larvae on grass. "Kiwi probe
underground with their bill - they don't eat grass," he said. "We think it
unlikely that kiwi would be susceptible."
DoC had, as a last resort, the power to declare the parasite an "unwanted
organism", but was a long way from such a move.
Maf's programme co-ordinator for exotic disease response, Dorothy Gaele,
said it was working with DoC to identify and investigate potential areas of
overlap between kiwis and ostriches. It was a precautionary approach. The
parasite had been in Australia for about 100 years and had not affected
emus or cassowaries, which were closer relations to the ostrich.
The New Zealand Ostrich Association will meet Maf staff at Christchurch
today to discuss the wireworm outbreak.
Ostriches have not been imported into New Zealand since 1996, suggesting
the wireworm parasite has been in the country for at least 8 years and is
probably widespread.

[The ostriches in Africa -- and likely elsewhere -- have a variety of
gastrointestinal helminths, of which the "wireworm" or _Libyostrongylus
douglassii_, may be the most pathogenic.
This article implies that the kiwi has not yet encountered this helminth.
However, as it could be more devastating to the kiwi, precautions now would
seem to be in order. - Mod.TG]
