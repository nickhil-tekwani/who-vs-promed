Four ducks found dead in a pond in eastern France have tested
positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, officials said Tuesday [14
Aug 2007].
The 4 ducks were found on 8 Aug 2007 in an area known as Diane
Capelle, in the Moselle region, the regional prefecture said in a
statement. [Map at:

Since late June 2007, 5 dead swans found in the region also have
tested positive for the deadly strain of the virus. Two of them were
found in the Diane Capelle area, while the other 3 were found about
15 km (9 miles) from the site.
On Tuesday [14 Aug 2007], Moselle's prefecture extended measures to
protect domestic fowl from wild birds that had been put in place
after the 1st case of swan deaths, the statement said.
Bird flu is believed to spread along bird migration routes, and the
H5N1 strain has been found in poultry farms in 3 other EU countries
this year [2007]: Hungary, Britain and the Czech Republic, the
European Commission has said.
France experienced a bird flu scare after an outbreak of the lethal
disease in February 2006 in the eastern Ain region. It was quickly
contained, and a vaccination campaign of fowl was launched. However,
dozens of countries briefly suspended imports of fowl and luxury
items like foie gras from France.

[The Moselle area, where infected swans were detected earlier this
year [2007], can be seen in the WHO map on H5N1 AI in poultry and
wild birds, status as of 6 Aug 2007 (latest available update),
available at
<http://gamapserver.who.int/mapLibrary/Files/Maps/Global_SubNat_H5N1inAnimalConfirmed_2007_SEMESTER2_20070806.png>.
When an official notification is published, it will hopefully include
the scientific name of the affected birds by genus and species. -

Viet Nam has detected a bird flu outbreak in the northern province of
Cao Bang bordering China, the country's 2nd infection among poultry
so far this month, the Agriculture Ministry said on Wednesday [15 Aug
2007].
89 chickens and ducks died at a farm last Saturday [11 Aug 2007], and
tests in Hanoi have confirmed they were infected by the H5N1 virus,
the ministry's Animal Health Department said in a report.
The infected farm is in Thach An district, about 70 km (43 miles)
south of the border with China's province of Guangxi.
The previous poultry outbreak was detected on 2 Aug 2007 in the
northwestern province of Dien Bien, which -- along with Cao Bang and
the southern province of Dong Thap -- remains on the government's
watch list for bird flu infection.
Bird flu has infected 7 people in Viet Nam so far this year [2007], 4
of whom have died, bringing the death toll from 100 confirmed
infections since late 2003 to 46, the Health Ministry said.
Early this month [August 2007], a 15-year-old boy from the northern
province of Thanh Hoa died from bird flu while en route to a Hanoi
hospital.
Globally, the H5N1 virus has killed 193 people out of 320 known
cases, according to a tally of the World Health Organization.
Hundreds of millions of birds have died or been slaughtered.
