PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2008 (04)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

[With the continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail) in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED mail reports to include
other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases from any part of the
world are now included in these updates where appropriate, and other
forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

[1] UK: National CJD Surveillance Unit - monthly statistics
Date: Mon 3 Mar 2008
Source: UK National CJD Surveillance Unit, monthly statistics [edited]
<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>


Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of 3 Mar 2008
-----------------------------------------------
These following figures show the number of suspect cases of CJD
referred to the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number of
deaths of definite and probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).

Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 3 Mar 2008
-----------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
--------------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 115
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 48
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 163

Summary of vCJD cases - alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 3

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166

These data indicate that there have been no new cases diagnosed
during the past month, and the number of patients alive is unchanged.

These data are still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak
in the UK is in decline (although the incidence curve may be
developing a tail). The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year
2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, and so far none in 2008

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
-----------------------------------------------
As of 3 Mar 2008 in the UK, so far there have been 20 referrals, 8
deaths from sporadic CJD, one death from iatrogenic CJD, none from
familial CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

[2] UK: vCJD death linked to eye operation
Date: Thu 14 Feb 2009

A businessman has died from the human form of mad cow disease just
months before he was set to marry his sweetheart. The man, aged 53,
had the rare killer disease -- [variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] --
which his family believe could have been triggered by an eye
operation years earlier. The degenerative brain disorder is
incurable, and the victim, from near Sudbury in Suffolk, died just 10
weeks after he was diagnosed and 8 months before he was due to marry
his fiancee. His fiancee, who acted as a 24-hour care giver for the
man during his final days, said they were able to have their
relationship blessed before he died on 28 Jan 2008.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is believed to be a human
form of mad cow disease [bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)] and
only affects a handful of people in the UK each year. The man's
family believe a cornea graft operation he had 7 years ago at West
Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, might have brought on its
development. His fiancee said he had the operation in 2001, and his
family said it appeared to have been a success. But she noticed last
August [2007] he had started having problems with his memory and
balance, and on 13 Nov 2007, doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital
[Cambridge] diagnosed vCJD.

His fiancee said: "It is still such a shock that he contracted CJD.
We think it must have been related to the eye operation, as there is
nothing else it could have been. It was a few years ago, but then he
suddenly started showing symptoms in August [2007]. We are told the
main signs are staggering, a loss of short-term memory and a sweet
tooth, and he had all 3 but never had any anger or was upset by what
had happened. If it had been me, I would have been absolutely
furious, but he never had any complaints." A medical secretary at
Long Melford, said his medical cause of death was CJD and hypo-static
pneumonia.

The man's heartbroken mother said he had fought the deadly disease
with "great dignity and politeness. He was a wonderful son and very
popular. He had more than 100 people at his funeral. We couldn't get
any more in the church," she said. "He was wonderfully diverse and
fairly outgoing, though not exuberant. It is something that never
should have happened, but there is absolutely no cure for CJD. His
death was very sudden; the shock of him having basically mad cow
disease in human form was terrible. He was due to get married; it was
all planned, and it is so tragic."

A spokesman for West Suffolk Hospitals NHS Trust said: "We would like
to offer our heartfelt sympathy to the family for their loss. We are
happy to discuss any concerns the family may have. We have checked
our records and have received no complaints from the family in the
last 7 years. Cases of CJD are extremely rare in the UK. Generally
speaking, people diagnosed with AIDS, cancer or CJD are not able to
be donors, which reduces the risk of another person getting such
diseases through a transplant."

A spokesman for the Health Protection Agency, which aims to protect
people from infectious disease, said most cases of CJD have no known
cause and that the iatrogenic strain, occurring accidentally through
medical or surgical procedures, is very rare. He said: "When any case
of CJD is reported, the local health protection unit works closely
with the National CJD Surveillance Unit, which coordinates and
decides on any further investigation of the circumstances of any
possible cause of the patient's illness."

[It is not clear whether this case should be classified simply as a
case of iatrogenic CJD rather than as a case of vCJD. The vCJD
diagnosis is attributed to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge,
whereas Long Melford Hospital gave the cause of death as CJD and
hypostatic pneumonia. No information is provided concerning the
medical history of the corneal tissue donor nor whether the diagnosis
of vCJD has been confirmed by characterisation of the prion involved.
Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
