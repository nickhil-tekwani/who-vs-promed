In Guadeloupe, 2 new cases of chikungunya were confirmed on 30 Dec 2013 by the National Reference Center (IRBA) in Marseille among the 20 suspected cases identified to date. These patients had both co-dengue and chikungunya [virus] infections. These patients, who are at home, are recovering well now.

The Health Agency for Guadeloupe, St Martin and St Barthelemy, and CIRE [French] Antilles Guyane have reinforced epidemiological surveillance around these cases and [mosquito] control activities in the municipalities concerned (Le Moule, Capesterre, Belle Eau, and Goyave). These locations, which are quite far apart, confirm the beginning of active virus circulation throughout our territory.

A communication campaign [to draw attention to the disease] in the print media will be enhanced by a wide dissemination of radio spots, posters and a brochure.

Interestingly, but not surprisingly, dengue and chikungunya viruses are co-circulating on Guadeloupe island. Both are transmitted by the same mosquito vector (_Aedes aegypti_), and dengue virus is endemic in the Caribbean region.

[ProMED thanks Roland Hubner for submitting this report.

The chikungunya virus infection case is now officially confirmed on the St Maarten (Dutch) side of the island.

It is not surprising that chikungunya virus has found its way to the Dutch side of the island. The epidemiological surveillance collaboration between health authorities on both sides of the island is commendable.

In St Barthelemy, 8 cases of chikungunya virus infection have been confirmed, but "no serious case" was detected, it was announced in a press release by the Prefect of St Barthelemy and St Martin and the Regional Health Agency (ARS).

The Management Committee, in its meeting of 23 Dec 2013, currently wrote in a joint statement: "In light of epidemics of dengue and chikungunya that affect the Island of Saint Martin, it remains imperative to pursue epidemiological and entomological surveillance actions and control against the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, the single vector of these viruses."

Spraying is routinely organized by ARS and in the coming days will be intensified.

Cases of chikungunya virus infections identified in December [2013] in the Caribbean are due to an "Asian strain" virus, and there is an "extremely high risk" of transmission in the United States, a French specialist said on Friday [27 Dec 2013].

[The chikungunya virus infections on St Barthelemy have now been officially confirmed in the above report. The risk of spread is not limited to the USA, but includes all areas in the Americas where the vector mosquitoes occur and dengue viruses are being transmitted.
