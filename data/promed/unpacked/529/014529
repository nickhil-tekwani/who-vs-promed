On Tuesday [8 Apr 2008], the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment received results of water sampling in Alamosa performed
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results
showed the presence of _Giardia_ and _Cryptosporidium_, 2 protozoa
that also can cause diarrheal illness. These samples were drawn by
CDC before the water system was flushed and disinfected.

More sampling is needed to confirm that the parasites have been
eliminated. New water samples were taken Wednesday [9 Apr 2008] by
the state's Water Quality Control Division. Once testing shows the
water is suitable for drinking, the state's boil order will be
lifted. But lab results are not expected on the latest samples until
some time this weekend [12-13 Apr 2008] at the earliest.

As of Tuesday afternoon [8 Apr 2008], there were 389 total cases of
salmonella, with 107 of these culture-confirmed and 16 hospitalized.

[As previously stated in the earlier parts of the thread of this
outbreak, it would be expected that more than a single pathogen ought
to be found if the municipal water supply was contaminated with
sewage. Since the last posting, the total number of suspected cases
has increased from 315 to 389. - Mod.LL]
