From: John Hayman <hayman@netcore.com.au>

The report on _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ infection in the Kakamoeka
district, Kouilou region, south Congo (reference above) states that
the illness is very contagious and infection occurs with contacts with
the patient. This has not been our experience with the disease in
Australia; one of the most remarkable features of the disease is how
relatives sharing the same home, even sharing the same bed as the
patient, remain free of clinical infection while the patient may be
shedding the mycobacterium for weeks or months. If infection is
occurring in members of the same household or village, this probably
represents infection from the same environmental source rather than
case-to-case spread.
Most cases in Australia present as a papule or pimple, often thought
to be a spider or insect bite, which represents cutaneous infection.
In Africa most cases present as a nodule (subcutaneous infection) or
combined papule and nodule. Surgical excision at this pre-ulcerative
stage is simple and usually curative; systemic antibiotics alone are
generally ineffective once there is an established lesion such as an
ulcer or palpable nodule. If cases in this outbreak are occurring as
simple papules it would be a useful opportunity to determine if
topical therapy in the form of chlorhexidine / cetrimide cream or
topical antimicrobial antibiotic is effective in preventing
progression of the early cutaneous form of the illness.

[Disease rates in some villages of Cote d'Ivoire have been reported to
be as high as 22 percent, suggesting that the disease in Africa may be
more highly infectious than is apparent from the Australian
experience. However, this does not speak to the question of
person-to-person transmission raised by Dr. Hayman. Additional
comments would be welcome. - Mod.ES
