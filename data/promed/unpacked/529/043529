Bluetongue, Spain: an update, 6 Jan 2005
----------------------------------------
1. Epidemiological situation
The following information has been extracted from Spain's Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) (Accessed 6 Jan 2005)
<http://rasve.mapya.es/Publica/Noticias/LenguaAzul/Focos_LenguaAzul.asp>
The last update published on the web on 20 Dec 2004 registers a total
[accumulated] number of 308 outbreaks, an increase of 10 infected premises
since the last published figures of 15 Dec 2004 [see 20041215.3315, from
the period when the number was 298. - Mod.AS]
One outbreak has been reported in Andalucia and the other 9 have been
detected on the southwest of Extremadura, around the localities of Olivenza
and Badajoz. Both areas are bordering Portugal.
2. Weather situation.
According to the data of the Spanish Institute of Meteorology (INM), the
recorded lowest temperatures for most of Spain have been, during the last 3
weeks, close to or below 0 Centigrade, with exception of the southern areas
of Cadiz in Andalucia, where average lowest registered temperatures were
around 10 C. [Leading to decreased or negligible activity of the
_culicoides_ vectors. - Mod.AS]
3. Vaccination.
The following data are derived from a report, updated 7 Dec 2004, published
20 Dec 2004 (which also includes information on restriction zones and
virus/vector surveillance; see further).
<http://rasve.mapya.es/Publica/Noticias/Ficheros/Informe%20LA%20Diciembre.pdf>
3 different vaccination strategies in sheep are being implemented, 2 in
Extremadura and a 3rd one in Andalucia.
A vaccination ring 5 km wide is being applied within a radius of 20 km
around Almoharin in central Extremadura. In the southwest area of the
region, the vaccination area comprises a zone that stretches along appx 50
km from North to South, parallel to the Portuguese border. So far, the
number of vaccinated animals reached a total of 299 588, out of a
population of 700 000.
In Andalucia, all animals will be vaccinated in an area of 20km around the
infected premises. In this region a total of 127 763 sheep have been
vaccinated prior to publication of the report, out of a total of 390 000.
There are plans for the use of 6 million doses of vaccine against BTV
serotype 4. One million doses have already been received from Teramo, Italy
(probably from the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del
Molise "G. Caporale").
Finally, the Spanish web-site Agrodigital reported on 20 Dec 2004 the
confirmation by the Portuguese authorities of a BT outbreak at
Idanha-a-Nova, municipality of Castelo Branco, 80km to the west of the
previous 6 confirmed cases in Portugal.

[The information included in this posting seems to cover the period ending
20 Dec 2004. It also seems that no official updates have been provided by
Spain since 10 Dec 2004, when the 5th follow-up report on the BT situation
there was sent to the OIE. The reports did not include vaccination within
the specified applied control measures, which were: control of arthropods;
modified stamping out; processing of dead animals in authorised plants in
accordance with the standards in force; movement control inside the
country; and zoning. Updated official information on the situation in
Spain, including 1st-hand data on the vaccination program and its
performance, could be helpful.
Portugal reported to the OIE 2 new outbreaks in its follow-up report No 3,
sent 21 Dec 2004 (see <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_13.HTM#Sec1>. The
following control measures have been reported to be applied: quarantine;
ban on the movement of animals of susceptible species in the area
surrounding the infected farms; restriction zones being set up; insect
traps being used for vector monitoring.
EU's Animal Disease and Notification System (ADNS) published a map showing
the regions where outbreaks of bluetongue have been reported by Spain and
Portugal; see
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/animal/diseases/adns/map_adns.htm>.
It may be assumed that this vector-borne disease will soon disappear and
remain absent during the winter months, as it does in other Mediterranean
countries. The crucial question is -- will the virus overwinter in
Spain/Portugal? -- or, in other words, what is going to happen next
summer?! Applying mass vaccination might be interpreted as an indication of
a pessimistic -- or is it realistic? -- approach by the Spanish
authorities. - Mod.AS]
