Monkeypox rising in wake of smallpox eradication
------------------------------------------------
Some 30 years after authorities doled out the
last dose of smallpox vaccine, the world faces
another multiplying menace: monkeypox. A new
study suggests that the monkeypox virus, which
the smallpox vaccine also grants immunity
against, is now at least 20 times as common as it
was shortly after victory over smallpox had been declared.

"The eradication of smallpox was one of the
greatest achievements known to man," lead
researcher Anne Rimoin of the University of
California, Los Angeles School of Public Health
told Reuters Health. "But a consequence of
ceasing smallpox vaccinations is that now the
world's population is vulnerable to other (related viruses) such as monkeypox."

While the infection is somewhat less serious than
smallpox, it can still scar and even kill its
victims. And in contrast to its cousin, monkeypox
is not only able to jump between humans, but can
infect through contact with small animals that
harbor the virus. As a result, its control could
be all the more challenging, warned Rimoin.

Converging political, social, economic and
environmental factors make African nations -- in
particular, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
-- especially vulnerable to the infection, she
explained. The virus's favorite animal hosts such
as squirrels and monkeys are endemic [abundant]
there, and civil war has forced many people to
rely heavily on hunting wildlife for sustenance.
Some have even migrated deep into the animals'
forest habitats to seek refuge from the violence.

"The virus has probably been on the rise for
years, but the country lacked surveillance,"
Rimoin noted. "To find disease, you have to look
for it." So she and her colleagues, who included
many local Congolese, did just that. Using
Chinese bicycles like pack mules to transport
supplies, and with funding from the U.S. National
Institutes of Health, they surveyed 9 local
health zones for signs of monkeypox between
November 2005 and November 2007. They identified
760 cases of laboratory-confirmed monkeypox.

Compared to similar surveillance conducted in the
1980s, Rimoin's team found a 20-fold increase in
monkeypox cases -- far more than they ever
expected to find. In a single health zone, the
average number of yearly cases rose from less
than 1 to roughly 14 per 10 000 people.

Most of the victims were born after smallpox
vaccination was officially discontinued in 1980.
Vaccinated individuals were more than 5 times
less likely to become infected with monkeypox
compared to those without the vaccine's
protection, the researchers report in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Abstract reproduced below].

"What we're seeing is a harbinger of things to
come," said Rimoin. She warned that the virus
could grow more widespread with further
deforestation, continued movement of people from
rural to urban areas, bushmeat trafficking and
importation of exotic pets. "And every new
infection provides the virus with the opportunity
to evolve into a more serious or transmissible virus," she added.

It's already clear that the Democratic Republic
of the Congo isn't the only home for the virus.
The Republic of the Congo and Sudan also reported
cases in recent years. And in 2003, monkeypox
arrived in the U.S. Midwest with imported African
rodents, before spreading among prairie dogs and
sickening 90 people. Experts fear an even more
virulent and efficient virus could return to the western world.

"The higher the rate of new infections, the
greater the chance that travelers from the U.S.
will be exposed, and that the disease will be
imported into the U.S. -- possibly establishing
itself in U.S. rodent populations," Dr. Dan
DiGiulio of Stanford University School of
Medicine in California, who was not involved in
the study, noted in an e-mail message to Reuters Health.

So what can be done to keep the virus at bay?
Rimoin suggested that behavioral interventions
may be the most effective strategy at this point,
including teaching people at risk of infection
what animals may be most likely to carry
monkeypox and how to handle them to avoid
infection, as well as isolating infected
individuals. Continued active surveillance is
also important to better identify the animal
reservoirs and rates of animal-to-human versus
human-to-human transmission. "Once we understand
more about this virus and what it may mean for
us," she said, "we may be able to consider
specific interventions, perhaps vaccinating
groups that are at significant risk of
infection." DiGiulio added the need for animal
importation policies, and research into effective
antiviral treatments and vaccine development.

"Three decades after the eradication of smallpox,
pox viruses still deserve our close attention,"
said Rimoin. "And we shouldn't only worry about
its accidental introduction but also as a deliberate terrorist release."

Title: Major increase in human monkeypox
incidence 30 years after smallpox vaccination
campaigns cease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Authors: Anne W. Rimoina and 18 others.
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
2010; DOI:10.1073/pnas.1005769107, online edition.

Abstract: "Studies on the burden of human
monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) were last conducted from 1981 to 1986.
Since then, the population that is
immunologically naive to orthopoxviruses has
increased significantly due to cessation of mass
smallpox vaccination campaigns.

To assess the current risk of infection, we
analyzed human monkeypox incidence trends in a
monkeypox-enzootic region. Active,
population-based surveillance was conducted in 9
health zones in central DRC. Epidemiologic data
and biological samples were obtained from
suspected cases. Cumulative incidence (per 10 000
population) and major determinants of infection
were compared with data from active surveillance
in similar regions from 1981 to 1986.

Between November 2005 and November 2007, 760
laboratory-confirmed human monkeypox cases were
identified in participating health zones. The
average annual cumulative incidence across zones
was 5.53 per 10 000 (2.18­14.42). Factors
associated with increased risk of infection
included: living in forested areas, male gender,
age <15, and no prior smallpox vaccination.
Vaccinated persons had a 5.2-fold lower risk of
monkeypox than unvaccinated persons (0.78 vs. 4.05 per 10,000).

Comparison of active surveillance data in the
same health zone from the 1980s (0.72 per 10 000)
and 2006­07 (14.42 per 10 000) suggests a 20-fold
increase in human monkeypox incidence. 30 years
after mass smallpox vaccination campaigns ceased,
human monkeypox incidence has dramatically
increased in rural DRC. Improved surveillance and
epidemiological analysis is needed to better
assess the public health burden and develop
strategies for reducing the risk of wider spread of infection."

The virus species _Monkeypox virus_ is a member
of the genus _Orthopoxvirus_. Monkeypox virus can
causes a disease in humans that is clinically
similar to smallpox and outbreaks in central
Africa have been associated with significant
mortality, although none occurred in the outbreak
in the USA in 2003 associated with introduced African rodents.

An important difference between monkeypox virus
and smallpox virus (variola virus) is that
monkeypox virus has not transmitted from
person-to-person as efficiently as variola virus.
Indeed monkeypox virus is normally resident in
rodents and squirrels but can be transmitted to
other species as zoonoses. Phylogenetically the
species _Monkeypox virus_ is among the most
divergent viral species from the species _
Variola virus_. Indeed variola virus is more
closely related to camelpox virus than to monkeypox virus.

Consequently evolution of monkeypox virus into a
variola-like virus by mutation and selection is
improbable. Nonetheless it has potential to cause
significant disease in the human population and
may require in limited situations reuse of vaccinia virus vaccine.
