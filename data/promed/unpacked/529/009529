TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS - GERMANY

A ProMED-mail post

In addition to the postings on tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Sweden
and Austria [see below], I would also like to notify you about the
proven TBE figures for Germany as actually posted by the RKI (Robert
Koch Institute). Please be aware that the notification process takes
up to weeks (depending on the region), so we already know that the
real number is higher, and additional cases will be posted in the near
future.

Actually, the RKI posts 369 cases (as compared to 260 in the whole
year of 2010), which is a substantial increase. As with the other
countries, conditions in winter 2010/11, the weather in 2011 (starting
with a warm spring, leading to a moist summer and a beautiful warm
fall), as well as an increase of the tick population and personal
behaviour (increase of outdoor activities) in combination with a still
low vaccination rate (in some endemic areas of Germany not more than
30 percent) are likely to have contributed to this increase in
clinical cases.

By the way -- due to an obviously general increase in cases in 2011 --
I would like to sensitize ProMED-mail readers to TBE, not only in
"standard tourists" visiting the endemic areas of Europe and Asia, but
also those who participated in "event tourism" in general, and those
participating in or visiting [in Germany] the Women's Soccer World
Championship 2011 in particular. If somebody gets involved with a
person who is suffering from neurological disorders after a febrile
episode and this type of travel/visit, he/she is more than welcome to
touch base with me.

Basically, I'm convinced there are (far more) cases out there, and we
only detect the "tip of the iceberg."

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Haditsch for this update describing the current
tick-borne encephalitis situation in Germany. We hope that anyone
suffering travel-related neurological problems will respond to his
request. - Mod.CP]
