Outbreaks of Cyclospora from Salad Packages
-----------------------------------
Federal regulators are alerting consumers that raw basil and spring mix
salad may be linked to food poisoning outbreaks that reportedly sickened
more than 90 people in Illinois and Texas.
The Food and Drug Administration issued the alert late Friday. The agency
has been working with the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to determine the source of the outbreaks of cyclosporiasis, an
infection of the small intestine. Cyclosporiasis can cause flu-like
symptoms such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, muscle aches, and fever.
Signs of infection usually develop a week after a person eats contaminated
food.
The FDA urged consumers who experience those symptoms after eating basil or
spring mix salad products to tell their doctors and notify local health
officials. The agency says 57 people in Wheaton, Illinois reported getting
sick in February 2004 after eating food containing basil and mesclun, or
spring salad mix, at a restaurant. So far, lab tests have confirmed that 20
of those cases were cyclosporiasis. Also in February 2004, 38 people in
Irving, Texas, also reported that they got sick after eating basil and
mesclun at a local restaurant. Tests have confirmed that 16 of those were
cyclosporiasis, FDA says. The FDA is trying to determine where the
potentially contaminated food came from.

[Cyclospora is a new pathogen that is easily missed unless the stool is
examined after staining with a modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Infections
tend to occur in outbreaks, and the source is usually berries or vegetables
that may have been fertilized with manure. In 1996/1997 there were multiple
outbreaks of cyclosporiasis associated with raspberries imported from
Guatemala; this led to a ban on import of raspberries from Guatemala for
1998. Canada had another outbreak also associated with raspberries from
Guatemala in 1998. - Mod.EP]
