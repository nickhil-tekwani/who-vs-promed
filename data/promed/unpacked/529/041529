Guatemala: Increase in Number of Cases of Rotavirus Infection
-----------------------------------------------
A state of alert was declared because of an outbreak of rotavirus
infection that caused the deaths of 2 children in the last 2 months.
The Guatemalan Ministry of Health declared today [Fri 30 Dec 2005] a
state of alert because of the increase in the number of cases of
rotavirus infection, a disease that causes diarrhea in children less
than 5 years old and that, in the last 2 months, has affected at
least 1021 children and caused the deaths of 2 of them. "An alert was
issued to all health services, and we already have 2 deceased
children," said Dr. Edgar Santos, epidemiologist from the Ministry of
Health.
The community of Chimaltenango, located 50 km east of Guatemala City,
is the most severely affected region. In 2004, at least 60 children
died because of rotavirus infection, and there were more than 7000
cases of this infection.
There is no known cure for rotavirus infection, but if care is taken,
i.e. making sure that children are well hydrated, the disease is not
lethal. Rotavirus infection, as is the case with other
gastrointestinal diseases, can be easily prevented by taking
appropriate hygiene measures. However, with the lack of sanitation
infrastructure in Guatemala, where more than half of the population
live in poverty, diarrheal and respiratory diseases are the main
causes of death in young children.

[Rotavirus infection is the principal cause of severe gastroenteritis
in young children worldwide, leading to an estimated 600 000 deaths a
year. Efforts to develop an effective and safe vaccine resulted in
licensing in 1998 of a live oral vaccine (RotaShield) that was
withdrawn less than one year later, after 9 reports of
intussusception occurred within the 1st 7 months of vaccine use, more
than double the cases reported in the previous 7 years.
Intussusception occurs when the intestine telescopes into itself,
causing an obstruction of the bowel that may have to be repaired
surgically. An investigation of vaccinated infants confirmed that the
vaccine was indeed the cause of the complication. Most of these
infants had intussusception shortly after their vaccination. The risk
of intussusception was 10 times higher than normal, and within the
1st 7 days after vaccination, the risk was 14 times higher than
normal.
This experience with RotaShield has resulted in the development of
new candidate rotavirus vaccines that are currently in late phase III
clinical trials. One of these vaccines, GlaxoSmithKline's Rotarix,
was licensed in July 2004 to be used in Mexico. A review article in
Arch. Med Research 37 (1), 1-10, Jan-Feb 2006, by J. Perez-Vargas J.
et al., entitled "Rotavirus vaccine: early introduction in Latin
America -- risks and benefits," describes the general background for
rotavirus vaccine development, the different vaccine candidates that
have been tested or are currently being evaluated and discusses the
benefits and risks of the fast-track introduction of Rotarix in Latin
America, particularly in Mexico.
