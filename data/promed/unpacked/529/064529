3 more deaths due to dengue were reported in a period of 4 days since Sunday [29 Mar 2015], bringing the dengue death toll this year [2015] to 104.

Health Ministry Deputy Director-General Datuk Dr Lokman Hakim Sulaiman said the number of deaths caused by dengue increased by 76.3 percent as compared to the same period last year [2014] which only registered 59 cases [January 2014 until 2 Apr 2014].

"A total 890 new dengue cases were reported for the 4-day period [29 Mar-1 Apr 2015] since Sunday, making the total dengue cases [f]or this year until Thursday [2 Apr 2015] to rise to 33 425 cases, as compared to 24 510 cases during the same period last year [2014]," he told reporters after the launching of the Dengue Free Malaysia Movement (DFMM) here Saturday [4 Apr 2015].

Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah of Selangor is the patron of the movement initiated by the Country Heights Holding Berhad.

Dr Lokman Hakim said dengue cases in Malaysia were seasonal and cyclical, with the number of cases going up and down through the year.

Meanwhile, the Raja Muda of Selangor, Tengku Amir Shah Ibni Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah, in his speech at the launching of the movement said people must be in unison, change their mindset and muster efforts to fight the deadly _Aedes_ mosquito.

"My father Tuanku Sultan (Selangor) and I would like to urge Malaysians to start doing something against this enemy and practice a 1st line of defence to eliminate all possible breeding grounds" and kill the adult mosquitoes, he said.

Also present at the launching ceremony were Minister in Prime Minister's Department Tan Sri Joseph Kurup and Country Heights founder Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew.

[In 2004 the World Health Organization (WHO) devised a step-by-step guide for planning social mobilization and communication for dengue fever prevention and control.

It is worth noting that the 15 steps of the Communication-for-Behavioral-Impact (COMBI) planning for dengue prevention and control are to 1st assemble a multidisciplinary planning team, state preliminary behavioral objectives and then plan and conduct formative research. Among the remaining steps, establishing a monitoring system, writing a strategic implementation plan and finally conducting a pilot test and revising the plan are of utmost importance http://www.who.int/tdr/publications/documents/planning_dengue.pdf?ua=1.

Launching the Dengue Free Malaysia Movement could be considered as a model for community involvement in dengue prevention and control activities in Malaysia and elsewhere. Embedding them in local community structures will empower and sustain this type of long-term commitment.

Setting priority activities with measurable targets will pave the way for better monitoring and evaluation. The best performers of the agreed strategic implementation plan could be recognized and appreciated during local public forums.

[Usually, 8 imported cases would not be newsworthy. However, given the significant outbreak last year (2014), there is a risk that these imported cases could trigger another outbreak.

[This report raises questions about the etiological agent responsible for the cases that tested negative for dengue. The test used is not specified. Chikungunya virus is a possibility because the symptoms are compatible with those produced by that virus infection.
