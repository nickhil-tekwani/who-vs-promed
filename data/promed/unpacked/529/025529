The death toll due to aflatoxin poisoning has risen to 80 in the
Eastern province. It is expected that [it] may rise further.

Initial reports of aflatoxin poisoning were reported in 2 districts,
but more cases are reported from other districts in Eastern
Province.

[ProMED thanks Dr Sharif for this official communication.

Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mycotoxin produced by 2 types of
mold: _Aspergillus flavus_ and _Aspergillus parasiticus_. _A.
flavus_ is widespread in nature and is most often found when
certain grains are grown under stressful conditions such as
drought. The mold occurs in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and
grains undergoing microbiological deterioration and invades all
types of organic substrates whenever and wherever the conditions
are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions include high
moisture content and high temperature.

At least 13 different types of aflatoxin are produced in nature, with
aflatoxin B1 considered the most toxic. While the presence of _A.
flavus_ does not always indicate harmful levels of aflatoxin, it does
mean that the potential for aflatoxin production is present.

Aflatoxins are acutely toxic and have been shown to be
carcinogenic for some animals. Their toxicity varies between
different species, but data from a large outbreak of poisoning in
India in 1974 involving moldy maize and in which nearly 100 people
died, suggests that the toxicity of aflatoxin B1 for humans lies
somewhere between that for the dog and that for the rat. The
involvement of aflatoxins with human cancer is more complex and
remains to be defined.

Studies of aflatoxin poisoning in animals have shown that low-level
chronic intake may be more devastating than one-time high-level
intake. The situation described above may well be a case of chronic
low-level intoxication. In such cases, aflatoxicosis affects a number
of different body systems, most notably the liver. Various
parameters of the liver may be affected, including clotting factors
when the levels of toxin is very high. Chronic low-level intake is
often associated with diarrhea, gastric upset and vomiting, lethargy,
dehydration, and as the liver fails, other organs fail also.
Consequently kidneys often fail, and the complications associated
with both failing liver and failing kidneys may have been seen.

Treatment is generally considered to be supportive and include
some liver supportive therapies. In the event of internal bleeding
due to clotting failure, vitamin K1 has been shown to be helpful in
some animal studies, although the rationale is not well understood. -
