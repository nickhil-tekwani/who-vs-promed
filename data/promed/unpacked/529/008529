Abra provincial health experts are now investigating why 10 farmers in Langilang town were taken ill. "Suspecting anthrax as the culprit, government physicians with the help of the Abra provincial veterinary office are examining the farmers, who exhibited skin lesions," said Serafin Alzate from the Office of Gov. Eustaquio Bersamin. Experts suspected that the farmers ate anthrax-infected carabao meat.

Blood samples were taken from the farmers and were brought for verification and detection. Results will be out in a week. Health and veterinary officials of the province are closely monitoring the situation, added Alzate.

In May 2010, at least 41 were infected with anthrax in Villaviciosa town after they ate meat from 2 dead carabaos that died from the illness. None of them died.

[Carelessly eating dead carabao (buffalo) is, unfortunately, a very common cause for human anthrax in the Philippines. Livestock anthrax in the country is much more frequent than the official reports reveal, especially in the north, Luzon, which includes Abra.
