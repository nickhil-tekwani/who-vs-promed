This year [2015] alone, Penang has recorded 1303 dengue cases, including 5 deaths to date [21 Mar 2015]. This is a significant increase from 850 dengue cases recorded last year [2014], including 3 fatalities.

28 cases alone erupted from Perkampungan Valdor, in mainland Seberang Perai, which is currently the hotspot for the dengue epidemic in the state. Other areas like Jalan Lim Lean Teng, Flat Sri Bayu, and Bandar Baru Teluk Kumbar have also been identified as uncontrolled active spots. Meanwhile, Jalan Samak, Jay Series Condominium, Taman Manggis, Apartment Lavinia, Apartment Melati, Lintang Bukit Kecil, Taman Bagan Baru, Taman Chuan Liew, Taman Permatang Tinggi, and Kampung Penanti were deemed as controlled active spots.

State executive councillor Dr Afif Bahardin said the state government would implement programmes to prevent and control the dengue epidemic, including organising the "Healthy Penang" gotong-royong (community cleanliness) programme. He said the programme would be held simultaneously at 40 mosquito breeding spots while extra fogging efforts would be conducted in dengue hot spots.

He added that the health authorities would also supply mosquito larvae-killing drugs at clinics and health centres, carry out periodic fogging, and provide prompt treatment to the public.

"We will do our best to counter the dengue problem. All safety measures will be taken to control the epidemic," said Afif, who is in charge of the agriculture, agro-based industry, rural development, and health portfolios.

[Community participation in dengue breeding site eradication is of utmost importance and could be integrated in local development programs such as model healthy villages or similar long-term community endeavors.

Assuming there is no major change in sensitivity on dengue or other notifiable diseases in this case, achieving a lowest attainable case fatality rate should be aimed at by ensuring timely referral and appropriate case management by well trained and experienced health care workers, both at front line and referral health facilities.

Rapid tests are being developed to rapidly identify dengue whose original symptoms lend to confusion with other prevailing diseases.
"Dengue is diagnosed by isolation of the virus, by serology, or by molecular diagnostic methods. Although several commercial kits for the diagnosis of dengue are available, concerns have arisen with respect to the performance characteristics of these kits. In theory, it should be possible to establish a diagnosis of on-going or recent dengue infection during the acute or early convalescent stages of the disease. When such tests require the identification of the virus or the viral genome, they are expensive and require specialized laboratories.

Affordable commercial kits of adequate sensitivity and specificity that are able to diagnose dengue infection during the acute stage have not been developed. It is also possible that virological or physiological tests applied during the acute stage of the illness might be capable of predicting the severity of dengue virus infection."
