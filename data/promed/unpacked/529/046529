Yellow fever in Sierra Leone - update
-------------------------
As of 29 September 2003, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation has reported
a total of 90 cases from 8 districts (Tonkolili, Bombali, Kenema,
Koinadugu, Porto Loko, Kambia and Kono) in the country -- see previous
report <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_08_19/en/>.
Of the 90 cases, there are 4 laboratory confirmed cases, all from Tonkolili
district, and 10 deaths. The Ministry of Health and Sanitation conducted a
mass immunization campaign (100 000 doses) from 22-31 Aug 2003 in 4 out of
11 chiefdoms in the Tonkolili district. Most of the suspected cases and all
of the laboratory confirmed cases come from these chiefdoms.
Last week, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) for Vaccine Provision
for Yellow Fever provided the Ministry with 150 000 doses of yellow fever
vaccine to implement a mass immunization campaign in the 7 remaining
chiefdoms of Tonkolili district. This campaign is planned to start in the
first week of October.
The WHO West Africa sub-regional team is helping to strengthen surveillance
in the affected areas and to coordinate the response. Additional samples
from surrounding districts are also being collected for testing.
