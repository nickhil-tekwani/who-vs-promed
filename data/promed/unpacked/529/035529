WHO study shows uptick in global measles incidence
--------------------------------------------------
Global measles incidence increased from 2013 through 2018, and while reasons for the rise are multifactorial and vary by country, inadequate immunization is a key factor, researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO) reported yesterday [Thu 5 Mar 2020] in the J Infec Dis [see below].

The analysis of case-based measles surveillance data reported to the WHO, World Bank country income status, and estimates of national immunization coverage found that a total of 1 495 559 suspected measles cases were reported from 2013 through 2018, and 899 800 were eventually classified as measles. Global annual incidence for 2018 was 46 cases per million persons, the highest annual incidence in the study period. Of the 899 800 measles patients, 45% never received the measles vaccine, 12% received 1 dose, and 30% had an unknown vaccination history.

Lower- and middle-income countries accounted for 66% of cases, with 70% coming from Nigeria, India, Philippines, Ukraine, and Pakistan. A total of 77% of patients were under the age of 15, with the incidence highest in those under the age of 1. The median age of patients increased by country income status, and in high-income countries with historically stronger vaccination programs, patients had higher median ages.

The analysis also found that high-income countries have many cases in people 15 and older who were unvaccinated or undervaccinated. That's a shift from the prevaccine era, when 95% were immune by age 15, the authors of the study note, and a finding that could help guide measles elimination efforts in those countries.

"To achieve elimination, immunization programs and primary care services must be strengthened, and strategies targeting those outside the age of most routine immunization services also need to be undertaken in some countries to close remaining immunity gaps," the authors wrote. They also urged countries to improve case-based surveillance.

Abstract
--------
Background. Measles incidence and mortality rates have significantly decreased since vaccine introduction. Despite this progress, however, there has been a global resurgence of measles. To understand the current global epidemiology, we analyzed measles surveillance data.

Methods. We analyzed data on measles cases from 2013-2018 reported to the World Health Organization. Univariate analysis was undertaken based on age, vaccination history, onset year, World Health Organization region, and World Bank income status for the country where the case was reported, and a surrogate indicator of the historical strength of the country's immunization program. Annual incidence and a 2013-2018 mean country incidence per million were calculated.

Results. From 2013 through 2018, there were 899 800 reported measles cases, of which 57% occurred in unvaccinated or undervaccinated persons, with an unknown vaccination history in another 30%. Lower-middle-income countries accounted for 66% of cases, 23% occurred in persons over or of 15 years of age. In countries with stronger historical vaccination programs and higher country income, case patients had higher median ages.

Conclusions. Although most measles case patients are under 15 years of age, an age shift is seen in countries with a higher income or a stronger historical vaccination program. Countries must strengthen immunization programs to achieve high vaccination coverage; some must undertake strategies to reach persons over or of 15 years of age and close immunity gaps.]

[It would be great if the realization of watching a highly infectious virus spread through the community because of lack of a vaccine as with SARS-CoV-2 [COVID-19], makes skeptics of vaccination reconsider life without another vaccine, i.e., measles, which is even more infectious. - Mod.LK]

[2] WHO Disease outbreak news Measles - Central African Republic
Date: Wed 4 Mar 2020

The Central African Republic (CAR) has experienced an upsurge in measles cases as a result of outbreaks since 2019. The 1st case of measles was recorded in week 5 of 2019 (week commencing 28 Jan 2019) and the outbreak has continued through to week 7 of 2020 (week commencing 10 Feb 2020), with 18 health districts affected including 12 newly affected in 2020 (Bimbo, Begoua, Bangui I, Bangui II and Bangui III in the urban area, Bossembele, Bouar, Bozoum, Baboua-Abba, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, and Ouango-Gambo in the rural area).

From 1 Jan 2019 through 16 Feb 2020, a total of 7626 suspected cases including 83 deaths (case fatality rate 1.08%) were reported. A large proportion of cases (72%) were below 5 years old and 18% of cases were between 5 and 10 years old. A total of 1167 samples from suspected cases were tested at the reference laboratory of the Institut Pasteur in Bangui, of which 180 were positive for measles using Immunoglobulin M (IgM).

The low vaccination coverage for routine measles vaccine over the past 5 years (below 60% for the 1st dose at 9 months), the absence of a 2nd measles vaccine dose in the national immunization schedule, and inadequate follow-up campaigns resulted in a high proportion of people susceptible to measles, contributing to the ongoing epidemic. All 35 health districts are at risk of a measles outbreak, and without adequate response, the epidemic could spread through the entire country. The number of districts affected by the measles outbreak is increasing, and as of 1 Mar 2020, 15 health districts have been affected: Alindao, Alindao-Mingala, Baboua-Abba, Bambari, Bangui I, Bangui II, Bangui III, Begoua, Bimbo, Bococaranga-Koui, Bossembele, Bouar, Bozoum, Haute-Kotto, Nangha-Boguila, Ngaoundaye, and Ouango-Gambo.

In December 2019, outbreaks affected 8 health districts, and the country organized local measles vaccination campaigns that targeted children aged 6 -- 59 months in 7 districts (Bambari, Batangafo, Bocaranga-Koui, Grimari-Kouango, Kemo, Ngaoundaye, and Nana-Gribizi). Despite vaccination coverage of more than 95%, as confirmed by the vaccination coverage survey, new cases are being recorded in these districts and neighboring health districts in children aged from 5 -- 15 years old. Based on the age distribution of cases as indicated by epidemiological investigations, the proposed vaccination strategy is to target the risk group from 6 months -- 10 years to help stop transmission.

Public health response
----------------------
Since the official declaration of the outbreak by Ministry of Health on 24 Jan 2020, the following public health actions have been conducted:
- COUSP (Center for Emergency Operations in Public Health) and the Local Crisis Committee have been activated to coordinate the response.
- The Ministry of Health with support from WHO and other partners are developing a comprehensive response plan, which includes the vaccination campaigns.
- Epidemiological surveillance in the affected areas has been strengthened.
- Referral system of severe measles cases to the district health hospital has been set up with free care being offered to measles cases.
- Distribution of drugs and medical supplies to support provision of free medical care is ongoing.
- Isolation units have been established at the district hospital.
- The routine immunization program is being strengthened.
- Health promotion and risk communication activities are ongoing.
- Efforts are underway to mobilize resources to respond to the outbreak.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
WHO estimates the overall risk for the CAR from the current measles outbreak to be "high" due to the following reasons:
- The geographic expansion of the epidemic into new health districts.
- The large number of districts with high risk for measles outbreaks, due to low vaccination coverage.
- An increase in the number of cases reported in 2019 compared to 2018.
- The security context of the country which limits access to set up rapid response measures in affected health districts.
- The lack of infrastructure, inputs and resources to ensure free health care.
- The lack of trained staff available for the clinical management of complications of measles.
- Suboptimal measles-containing-vaccine first-dose (MCV1) vaccination coverage of 49% for the past 5 years according to joint WHO / UNICEF estimates, and administrative coverage of 71% in 2019.
- Large population movements between vaccinated and unvaccinated localities.
- Risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate given the large cross border movements of populations to and from neighboring countries including Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon, both for security reasons and commercial activities.

The risk is considered low at the global level. ...-more

[3] Liberia: 73 cases, 2 deaths in measles outbreak
Date: Mon 2 Mar 2020
Source: Journal du Cameroun [abridged, edited]
https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/liberia-records-73-cases-2-deaths-in-measles-outbreak/


The National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) has confirmed a measles outbreak in Grand Kru County in southeastern Liberia that has affected 73 people with 2 deaths recorded so far, reports said on Mon [2 Mar 2020]. According to Dr. Masoka Fallah, the dead are a 1-year-old boy and an 11-month old baby girl.

Dr. Fallah quoted Grand Kru County health authorities as saying the outbreak is concentrated in the districts of Forpoh, Dorbor, Jloh and Barclayville.

The NPHIL Director General said a massive awareness campaign has been launched, including consultations with citizens, the business community, other government ministries and agencies, and the county leadership on measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

The county health team has also commenced community level awareness to discourage discrimination of persons suspected of the disease.
