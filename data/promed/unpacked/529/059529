If you look at the map of reported/confirmed PPR outbreaks, there are
several gaps to date. It seems unlikely that the countries where it
hasn't been confirmed & reported, [and which are in between those where
it has been, are in fact free of [the disease.
So I would agree that it can be easily overlooked at the official level.
But I would also suggest (from the cases I have seen) that it is quite
easy to diagnose clinically. If a goat has respiratory signs and/or
diarrhoea and/or lesions on the mucosal border of the vulva at the same
time, it should be considered as PPR until proven otherwise. In Nepal it
was until recently confused with other diseases such as Contagious
Caprine Pleuropneumonia (which I haven't seen here in over a year and
don't think exists here).
A more controversial issue is, where did PPR originate? It is thought of
as a West African sub-Saharan disease, but my experience in Nepal is
that case fatality is lower (20 to 40%) than in Africa, which suggests a
longer association between goats (&/or sheep) and the virus than in
Africa, where 60-80% case fatality rates are quoted (though many other
things may influence this). PPR was first recognised in West Africa, but
has since been found in many other countries. Is it possible that we
still haven't recognised the real source? Given that rinderpest is now
recognised as an Asian virus, although having its greatest effect in
Europe and Africa, might the same be true of Asia and PPR?
Any thoughts from those who know more than I do?
