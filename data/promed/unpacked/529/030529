Following up with the reports of veterinary experts, wildlife authority in Tripura has suspended the entry of tourists in Sepahijala zoo in West Tripura for a week apprehending the presence of anthrax infection among the animals residing there.

According to report, a deer recently died in the zoo on [19 Feb 2019] and the carcass was sent to the laboratory of veterinary College. The [necropsy] report of the dead animal has been suspected of being contaminated with anthrax virus [sic] in the zoo, which prompted the authority to close the zoo down for public entry.

"The necessary sanitization work has been going on to prevent any further spread of the infection," said a zoo official adding that there is no health hazard inside and in the surrounding localities of the zoo due to the spread of infection.

Anthrax is an infectious bacterial disease of animals, caused by the spore-forming bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_. It can affect humans and a wide range of animals.

[Tripura is in eastern India and south of Bangladesh. For a description of West Tripura District in Tripura State, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tripura_district . Sepahijala zoo is briefly described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sipahijola_Wildlife_Sanctuary. There are maps in both. It is comparable in size -- 18.5 sq.km or 7.2 sq.mi -- with some of the larger deer ranches I know in West Texas and therefore offers plenty of space for natural lives of uncaged species, including deer.

The actual description is brief and not very clear as to whether there was just one deer or just one deer referred for diagnosis, and the extent of the sanitization, just one carcass to be burnt (should not take more than 3-4 hours), or multiple carcasses, plus areas to match of disinfection. Is this a public relations response or social problems of the aesthetics of carcass burning? Being able to see carcasses being burnt would demonstrate the public & veterinary health responsibility of the sanctuary administration.

How this outbreak occurred appears to be low in their priorities, and ignored in a previous zoological outbreak in Tripura; see 12 Dec 2014 Anthrax - India (15): (TR) zoo rhinoceros 20141212.3030459. As it is woodland, there will be plenty tabanid biting flies so this dead deer may be just an observed case. As deer differ in their specific ecological niches, some prefer open grazing, others scrub, this indicates a primary, secondary, or even tertiary spread. If anthrax is truly new to this zoo it might have originated in livestock in a neighboring farm, and flown in. Zoological park outbreaks are more commonly seen in carnivores fed on carcasses of dead livestock cheaply bought to feed them. We look forward to receiving clarification. - Mod.MHJ
