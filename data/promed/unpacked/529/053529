There is a growing number of dengue cases in New Delhi, about 130 so
far. Officials of the Delhi government's health department and the MCD
blame this year's heavy rainfall for the spurt in dengue cases. In 1996,
over 10 000 people were affected by dengue and 423 of them succumbed to the
epidemic. This year, one person has died, but the number of cases so far is
almost thrice that of last year [2002].
Health minister A K Walia said that almost 40 percent of the dengue cases
reported so far have been from outside the city. "In these cases, the
patients were infected outside the city but they underwent treatment
here,"he said. "Just about 15 dengue patients are in hospital at any given
point of time. There is no need for separate wards yet," said municipal
health officer K N Tiwari.
Explaining the increase in the number of dengue cases, Walia said that the
months of September and October are conducive to mosquito breeding."The
Aedes mosquitoes that cause dengue, breeds in stagnant water collected in
coolers, water tanks and other objects like unused broken wares and tyres,"
he said. The minister also said that the creation of breeding conditions
for mosquitoes is an offense under municipal laws and is liable to
prosecution and fine up to Rs 500. He claimed that over 59 lakh [590 000]
houses have been visited this year. "23 110 houses were found guilty [of
harboring Aedes mosquitoes]. As many as 17 248 persons have been served
legal notices while 6111 persons have been prosecuted," he said.

The Pune municipal corporation on Thursday appealed to all the citizens
take necessary precautions against dengue, caused by mosquito bite.
Apart from 3 deaths in the city (including one patient from Bhor in Pune
district), 14 other victims of dengue fever were reported to be in serious
condition in the city hospitals.
In an appeal to the people through the media, PMC health officer Pramod
Dhaygude, said people should immediately take all precautionary measures in
the backdrop of dengue cases in the city. "This is the time when the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito that carries the dengue virus, breeds [in] stagnant
water," he said, appealing to the people to also contact the corporation
officials in case of any suspected cases. He said corporation officials
along with the state health department are carrying out surveillance and
fogging operations in different parts of the city. Dhaygude also appealed
to all the hospitals to immediately report any suspected or confirmed case
of dengue admitted to the corporation.

From January up to September this year [2003], 14 people have died of
dengue fever in North Sumatra, a provincial health official said [an
increase of 2 since 20 Sep 2003 - Mod.JW].
Head of the North Sumatra Health Office, Dr. Hj. Fatni Sulani, told the
press here Wednesday the ill-fated victims were part of a total of 344
people affected by the [sometimes] fatal disease during the period. In
Medan city alone, 220 people contracted the disease, Dr. Fatni Sulani said.
However, compared to the situation in other provinces, the number of
dengue-fever victims in North Sumatra during the period was low, Fatni
said. She said, in North Sumatra, dengue fever tended to spread at the
beginning of the rainy season, namely between August and December. Dengue
fever was also rife in certain parts of the towns of Binjai, Deli Serdang
and Langkat, Fatni said.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever in Piedecuesta (Santander)
----------------------------------------------------
Last week, an 8-year-old girl died in the Hospital Integrado San Juan de
Dios. According to hospital employees, the patient had evident symptoms of
dengue hemorrhagic fever. Autopsy results are expected this week. The
number of cases is growing and the hospital expects a worsening of the
situation [during the remainder of 2003] because of the cyclic [seasonal]
nature of the disease.
13 confirmed and 52 suspected cases of DHF and 135 cases of classic dengue
fever [have been reported so far in 2003]. During 2002, 82 cases of DHF and
64 cases of classic dengue fever were reported. In September 2002 only 3
cases of DHF were diagnosed, but so far this month, 10 cases have already
been reported.
