One person has tested positive for Ebola in Manyi sub county, Mityana district, in the Central Region of Uganda.

The female patient fell sick hardly a week after the death of her mother inside a shrine, who was later buried in Madudu sub county, Mubende district. The patient's child also died at Manyi health center, which raised suspicion among the community members.

Dennis Mono, the district surveillance and Ebola focal point person, confirmed the Ebola case. He said that the patient was evacuated from Mityana hospital on Mon 17 Oct 2022 and taken to Mubende Hospital. The health workers who attended to the patient and her child have been isolated.

Mono says that the district team with other health officials have embarked on tracing the patient's contacts to curb the spread of the virus.

The resident district commissioner Mityana, Afrikano Aharikundira, says that they have activated all the task force teams from the village to the district level as well as village health teams (VHTs).

On Sat 15 Oct 2022 evening, President Museveni announced 21 days of lockdown in Mubende and Kassanda districts restricting movements in and out, as a measure to mitigate the spread of Ebola virus disease. Museveni directed that public transport, private transport, and boda-bodas are not permitted to move in Mubende and Kassanda districts.

The restrictions also affected seasonal markets, worship places, and social places like bars and gyms while all burials shall be conducted by the safe burial teams.

[This location -- Manyi sub county, Mityana district, in the Central Region of Uganda -- is a new location where cases are being identified in Uganda, indicating virus spread from the epicenter in Mubende and Kassanda districts. Contact tracing and community awareness of proper protocols, especially burials, are critical to control spread. The country seems to be taking the right steps in this direction.

"Irene Nakasiita, a spokesperson for the Ugandan Red Cross, said the organization had been 'drawing lessons from the 1st Ebola outbreak.'

"A community-based approach has allowed the Red Cross to trace confirmed cases and their contacts quickly and effectively, she said. The organization uses a tool called 'Kobo,' she said, whereby 300 volunteers send alerts of any cases.

'For suspicious cases, we have to run to the ground quickly,' she said. The team is then able to deploy ambulances and correspond with the Health Ministry as needed.

'If you're telling people they're going to be isolated, they're going to be waiting, potentially not getting treatment for something else,' [obstetrician Benjamin] Black said in a telephone interview. 'It could be malaria or even typhoid. That has a huge impact on the bed space.'

'Health workers are going door to door, educating residents of the risks of the virus and the importance of hand hygiene. Red Cross volunteers clad in hazmat suits also provide for dignified burials, without family members of deceased patients present.

'We need to educate them so that they don't turn out to be rowdy, wondering why we are not allowing them to bury their people,' said Nakasiita, adding that funerals can become superspreader events since people can be exposed to the deceased patient's bodily fluids." - Mod.LK

[2] Kampala: hospitalized cases

Three people in an isolation unit of Uganda's main hospital have tested positive for Ebola, the country's health minister said on Saturday [22 Oct 2022].

"Yesterday ... 3 individuals from among the 60 in our Mulago isolation facility tested positive for Ebola," Jane Ruth Aceng said on Twitter. "They will be transferred to the Entebbe isolation unit for treatment since the Mulago unit still has 58 contacts under quarantine," she said, referring to a 2nd facility 41 km [25.5 mi] away.

Mulago is in Uganda's capital Kampala. Friday's [21 Oct 2022] confirmed cases would be the 1st known transmission of the virus in the city, coming on the same day the information ministry said the country's Ebola outbreak was coming under control and was expected to be over by the end of the year [2022].

A government statement on Friday [21 Oct 2022] evening said the outbreak had infected 65 people and killed 27. It was not clear if the numbers included the 3 new Kampala cases.

The government has introduced a 3-week lockdown around the Mubende and Kassanda districts in central Uganda, the epicentre of the outbreak of the Sudan variant of the Ebola virus. The measures include an overnight curfew, restrictions on movement, and the closure of places of worship and entertainment.

Aceng said the 3 infected people had been in contact with a patient from Kassanda who had died in Mulago.

[These cases plus the new cases in item [1] are discouraging as they demonstrate the virus is spreading, just when the information ministry said "the country's Ebola outbreak was coming under control and was expected to be over by the end of the year." The situation remains serious. - Mod.LK

[3] Situation evolving
Date: Thu 20 Oct 2022

Uganda's Ebola outbreak is "rapidly evolving" a month after the disease was reported in the country, a top World Health Organization official said Thursday [20 Oct 2022], describing a difficult situation for health workers.

"The Ministry of Health of Uganda has shown remarkable resilience and effectiveness and (is) constantly fine-tuning a response to what is a challenging situation," Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the UN health agency's regional director for Africa, told reporters. "A better understanding of the chains of transmission is helping those on the ground respond more effectively."

Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola on 20 Sep [2022], several days after the contagious disease began spreading in a rural farming community. Ebola has since infected 64 people and killed 24, although official figures do not include people who likely died of Ebola before the outbreak was confirmed.

At least 3 of the confirmed patients traveled from the virus hot spot in central Uganda to the capital, Kampala, about 150 km (93 mi) away, according to Moeti. Fears that Ebola could spread far from the outbreak's epicenter caused authorities to impose a lockdown, including nighttime curfews, on 2 of the 5 districts reporting Ebola cases.

Ebola "numbers that we are seeing do pose a risk for spread within the country and its neighbors," Dr. Ahmed Ogwell, the acting head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a separate briefing Thursday [20 Oct 2022].

While the risk of cross-border contamination is there, "it's a manageable risk," Ogwell said, adding that the outbreak does not yet necessitate going into what he called "full emergency mode."

There is no proven vaccine for the Sudan strain of Ebola that's circulating in Uganda. A WHO official in Uganda told the AP on Wednesday [19 Oct 2022] that plans are underway to deploy 2 experimental vaccines in a study targeting health workers and contacts of Ebola patients.

Ugandan officials have documented more than 1800 Ebola contacts, 747 of whom have completed 21 days of monitoring for possible signs of the disease that manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever, Ogwell said.

Scientists don't know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the 1st person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ugandan officials are still investigating the source of the current outbreak.

Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed more than 200 people. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11 000 people, the disease's largest death toll.

Ebola was discovered in 1976 in 2 simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.
