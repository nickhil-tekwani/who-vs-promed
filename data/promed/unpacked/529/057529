The etiologies for at least 60 percent of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases in Assam are still undiagnosed, according to an ongoing research project.

According to an expert involved with the project, around 30 percent of AES cases are likely to be those suffering from Japanese encephalitis (JE).

Nearly 178 people, of the 2077 diagnosed with AES in Assam in 2017, died.

Assam has reported 60 AES cases this year till 30 Apr [2018] but no casualties so far.

The project was started in 2016 in collaboration with US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) so that AES cases can be treated or diagnosed effectively. "We are trying to diagnose AES cases with the help of this project at Gauhati Medical College Hospital and Assam Medical College Hospital [AMCH]," the expert said.

The main symptoms of AES are acute onset of fever, confusion, disorientation, inability to talk and seizures. Other clinical symptoms may include an increase in irritability, somnolence or abnormal behaviour.

After the 1st outbreak of encephalitis in Assam in 1978, virus isolation from brain tissue was done at AMCH in Dibrugarh. It was only in the early '80s that health experts learnt about JE.

A pilot project on JE diagnosis was carried out at a primary health centre at Gogamukh in Lakhimpur in the late '80s.

"In 2008, we took up the JE/immunoglobulin (IgM) diagnostic programme when IgM diagnosis and testing facilities became available. Under the ongoing project, all AES cases need to be reported and studied. We need to strengthen our AES surveillance system," the expert said.

Blood samples of some undiagnosed AES cases in 2017 were sent to Atlanta-based CDC for 3rd generation genome testing to find the presence of unknown virus. The genome testing is part of an ongoing project on AES between CDC, Nimhans, Bangalore, and the Assam government.

"These are blood samples which have not yet been diagnosed for any disease. The samples will need further exploration," the expert said.

[The number of AES cases are increasing, with cases in Assam from 30 Apr [2018]. As is often the case, a minority of AES cases are due to JEV infections. The etiology of AES has been unclear but debated in the past decade.

A recent publication of investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 AES outbreaks indicated that scrub typhus, caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, was the etiology in about 60 percent of those AES cases. In the report above, there is no mention of scrub typhus.

As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption and scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_). One hopes that the prospective studies on collaboration with the USA CDC as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children progresses will provide additional information about the etiology of AES. The JE and AES season is now underway in northeastern India, and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018).
