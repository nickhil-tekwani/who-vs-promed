Even with 3 vaccines now, CDC head warns of possible 4th COVID surge
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the weekend [27-28 Feb 2021] both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gave the green light to Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, making it the 1st one-dose option available to Americans. The newly approved vaccine is expected to arrive in arms as soon as tomorrow. A total of 4 million doses will be administered across the United States by the end of the week, Reuters reported. Johnson & Johnson previously said it aims to have 20 million doses delivered to Americans by the end of the month [March 2021], and 100 million doses by June [2021]

Biden administration officials warned that availability of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be sporadic and limited, most likely until April [2021].

'Very real threat' of variants
------------------------------
The welcomed news of a 3rd COVID-19 vaccine was tempered today [1 Mar 2021] by warnings from CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, who said during a White House press briefing that recent declines in case counts are stalling. "The most recent 7-day average of cases, approximately 67 200, represents an increase of a little over 2% compared to the prior 7 days," said Walensky. "Please hear me clearly -- at this level of cases with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained. These variants are a very real threat to our people and our progress."

Walensky said the country cannot settle for 70 000 cases and 2000 deaths per day due to the virus. She also said if states lift mitigation mandates, like mask-wearing, too quickly, the nation could see a 4th wave of virus activity before enough Americans are vaccinated.

Yesterday [28 Feb 2021] the United States reported 51 204 new COVID-19 cases, and 1097 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total, the country has 28 648 156 cases, including 514 216 deaths.

The latest CDC tracking on variants shows confirmed 2400 B.1.1.7 cases in 46 states, 53 B.1.351 cases in 16 states, and 10 P1 cases in 5 states.

Vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans
---------------------------------------
New data from Rand Corporation shows Black Americans, including healthcare workers, report high levels of vaccine hesitancy.

Only 40% of Black Americans polled (out of 207) said they would definitely get a vaccine. Further, 1/3 of all survey participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would not get a COVID-19 vaccine, and an additional 25% said they did not know if they would get vaccinated.

Black Americans have been among the hardest-hit US groups during the pandemic, but government distrust and vaccine hesitancy remain a lingering problem.

Yesterday [28 Feb 2021], Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said all Americans should get whatever vaccine is made available to them as soon as possible, stressing that efficacy rates among the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are not comparable.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was 100% effective in preventing deaths, was less effective in preventing mild to moderate illness when compared with the mRNA vaccines but was tested when more variant strains were spreading, Fauci said yesterday on "Meet the Press."

"It's not the weaker vaccine. They are all 3 really good vaccines," Fauci said.

In other US news, the New York Times reports that, nationwide, COVID-19 testing is down by 30%, likely owing to fewer exposures, less travel after the holidays, the vaccine rollout, and pandemic fatigue.

"The emerging variants CDC is closely monitoring have mutations in the virus genome that alter the characteristics and cause the virus to act differently in ways that are significant to public health (for example, causes more severe disease, spreads more easily between humans, requires different treatments, changes the effectiveness of current vaccines). It's important to understand that genetic mutations are expected, and some variants can spread and become predominant while others subside."

- The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/01/world/covid-19-coronavirus)
"From a high of nearly 14 million tests a week in early January [2021], the pace fell to fewer than 10 million -- a level not seen since October [2020] -- in the week ended [24 Feb 2021], according to the Covid Tracking Project.

"Some areas report even sharper declines.

"Experts cited a number of factors that could be contributing to the slump:
- Fewer exposures. Since daily tallies of new coronavirus infections have fallen sharply, fewer people may be having contacts that would prompt them to seek a test.
- Less travel. The holiday rush is over, reducing the need for people to get tested before or after trips.
- Bad weather. The severe storms and Arctic temperatures that battered much of the country, from Texas to the Northeast, caused many testing sites to close temporarily.
- The vaccine rollout. Some states have shifted their limited public health resources, and their public messaging, toward vaccination efforts at the expense of testing.
- Pandemic fatigue. Some experts worry the decline may be yet another symptom of public exhaustion and frustration with pandemic precautions and safety measures."

It is important to the understanding of virus evolution and dynamics that testing continue. But the decrease is not surprising and probably is a result of a combination of the factors listed. - Mod.LK]

Original publication date: [19 Feb 2021]

Abstract
--------
Uncertainty remains about how long the protective immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 persists, and suspected reinfection in recovered patients has been reported. We describe a case of reinfection from distinct virus lineages in Brazil harboring the E484K mutation, a variant associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies.

-------
A 45-year-old woman residing in Salvador (Bahia State, northeast Brazil) with no underlying conditions had symptoms of viral infection on 2 occasions (26 May 2020 and 26 Oct 2020). In the 1st episode, the patient had diarrhea, myalgia, asthenia, and odynophagia for approximately 7 days. She took 40 mg prednisone for 5 days and returned to normal activities 21 days later, after resolution of symptoms without sequelae or complaints. In the 2nd episode, which was symptomatically more severe in terms of intensity and duration, the patient had headache, malaise, diarrhea, cough, and sore throat that evolved to myalgia and ageusia, muscle fatigue, insomnia, mild dyspnea on exertion, and shortness of breath. In both episodes, however, disease was classified as mild, and she was treated at home, not requiring hospitalization.

Comparison of the phylogenetic profiles of the 2 new sequences with contemporaneous sequences from Brazil (Appendix Table, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/27/5/21-0191-App1.xlsx) clearly demonstrated that the 2 COVID-19 episodes, separated by a 147-day interval, were indeed caused by different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, confirming reinfection.

This reinfection case aligns with another reinfection recently described in Brazil in which a 1st infection with the B.1.1.33 lineage was followed by a 2nd one with the P.2 lineage (Resende PC et al, unpub. data, https://virological.org/t/spike-e484k-mutation-in-the-first-sars-cov-2-reinfection-case-confirmed-in-brazil-2020/584). The E484K mutation, located in the viral receptor binding domain, has been emerging independently in several SARS-CoV-2 variants, and its monitoring is of pivotal importance in the current stage of the pandemic.

Our report of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with a E484K variant corroborates in vitro and in silico studies that estimated the potential of lineages carrying this mutation to escape from neutralizing antibodies and highlights the importance of genomic surveillance to detect and monitor the emergence of new viral linages with possible implications for public health policies and immunization strategies.

"The coronavirus is very likely here to stay, even after the pandemic officially ends. The virus will continue to have opportunities to evolve; in its myriad forms, it will cross paths with many of us again and again. "Reinfections are probably something we're going to have to get used to," [Brianne Barker, an immunologist at Drew University] said. But virus and human will grow accustomed to each other, reaching something of a détente; immunity will, over time, build like a seawall."

[A] Weekly epidemiological update
Date: Tue 2 Mar 2021

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [28 Feb 2021], 10 am CET

Global overview
---------------
Over 2.6 million new cases were reported last week, a 7% increase compared to the previous week, following 6 consecutive weeks of declining numbers (Figure 1). The global case increase was driven by increases in the Eastern Mediterranean (14%), South East Asia (9%), Europe (9%), and the Americas (6%). Possible reasons for this increase include the continued spread of more transmissible variants of concern (VOCs), relaxation of public health and social measures (PHSM), and fatigue around adhering to PHSM measures. Basic public health measures remain the foundation of the response. For public health authorities, that means testing, contact tracing, isolation, supported quarantine and quality care. For individuals, it means avoiding crowds, physical distancing, hand hygiene, masks and ventilation. Furthermore, immunity conferred by vaccination takes weeks at the individual level, and it may take longer to observe impacts at the population-level.

The number of global new deaths continues to decrease, with over 63 000 new deaths reported last week [week of 22 Feb 2021], a 6% decrease as compared to the previous week. New deaths decreased in 4 regions, Europe, Africa, the Western Pacific, and the Americas (by 15%, 19%, 35% and 1%, respectively), and increased by 47% in the South East Asia Region, partly due to retrospective reporting of deaths from Nepal. The Americas reported over 1.1 million new cases and nearly 34 000 deaths, which accounted for 42% of global cases and 53% of global deaths.

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of new cases were the United States of America (472 904 new cases, a 2% decrease), Brazil (373 954 new cases, an 18% increase), France (149 959 new cases, a 14% increase), Italy (112 029 new cases, a 32% increase), and India (105 080 new cases, a 21% increase).

Special focus: COVID-19 and international trade, travel, and points of entry
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is having, a substantial impact on international trade and travel. In 2020, world passenger traffic fell by 2.7 billion passengers, or by 60% compared to 2019, causing a USD 371 billion loss of gross passenger operating revenues of airlines /1. In addition to the economic loss, travel restrictions are also having a direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of transport workers, most notably in the maritime sector. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimates that around 400 000 seafarers have been stranded on board commercial vessels, long past the expiry of their contracts and unable to be repatriated. A similar number of seafarers urgently need to join ships to replace these individuals. /2

WHO has been engaging with and supporting stakeholders in the travel sector across all points of entry (airports, ports, and ground crossings) since the start of the pandemic, and produced its 1st travel-related guidance in March 2020. All guidance documents can be found [at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance-publications].

Managing the safe and effective recovery of international travel through a risk-based approach
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2020, WHO published guidance for national authorities on a step-by-step approach to decision-making for calibrating public health risk mitigation measures for international travel in the context of COVID-19 [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Risk-based-international-travel-2020.1]. It is divided into 3 main sections: risk assessment, risk mitigation and risk communication. Key points include:
- during the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel should always be prioritized for emergencies and humanitarian actions, travel of essential personnel, repatriations, and cargo transport for essential supplies such as food, medicines, and fuel;
- as countries gradually resume international travel, introduction of risk mitigation measures aiming to reduce travel associated exportation, importation, and onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should not unnecessarily interfere with international traffic and should be based on a thorough risk assessment that is conducted systematically and routinely;
- decision-makers in Member States can conduct risk assessments through a mixed-method approach (explained in the guidance and the accompanying risk assessment tool) to calculate the additional burden presented by possible importation of COVID-19 cases and decide policies on the basis of whether they have the capacity to cope with this burden;
- international travellers should not be considered by nature as suspected COVID-19 cases or contacts. Therefore, WHO does not recommend travellers as a priority group for testing;
- the use of "immunity certificates" for international travel in the context of COVID-19 is not currently supported by scientific evidence and is therefore not recommended by WHO; and
- the overall health and well-being of communities should be at the forefront of considerations when deciding on and implementing international travel-related measures.

Special focus: the importance of fit, filtration and breathability of non-medical (fabric) masks in the context of COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since January 2020, WHO has recommended the use of masks as part of a comprehensive set of interventions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. There are many commercial non-medical (also called fabric or cloth) masks available; however, the multitude of voluntary international standards together with the absence of regulatory oversight has made it difficult for people to know if their masks are effective barriers.

When implemented with other public health and social measures, a mask can serve as an effective barrier to prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, provided that it fits well, has good filtration, and the wearer can easily breathe through it (Figure 3). When any of these 3 parameters are not optimized, the mask may be an ineffective barrier and/or uncomfortable to wear.

Good fit means the mask fully covers the nose, mouth, and chin. There should be no leaks around the edges of the mask. The exhaled breath should be filtered through the surface of the mask.

Good filtration means the mask has the right fabric or combination of fabrics that filter droplets present in exhaled air.

Good breathability means the wearer can easily breathe through the material of the mask. Since masks are often rated in terms of their filtration, it is equally important to maximize breathability to ensure the wearer's comfort.

WHO first issued guidance on the composition of non-medical or fabric masks in June 2020 providing specific recommendations about the number of layers, their composition and performance, and the importance of fit. Where possible, to ensure adequate wearer comfort, the design and combination of textiles used in manufacturing the fabric masks should be independently tested for adequate fit, filtration and breathability. This is especially important for masks used for an extended period of time and/or in humid environments.

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
-------------------------------------------------------
WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions, and researchers, continues to monitor the public health events associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants and provides updates as new information becomes available. Further information on the background of the variants of concern (VOC) is available from previously published Disease Outbreak News and recent publications of the Weekly Epidemiological Update [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports]. Here we provide an update on the geographical distribution of 3 VOCs as reported by countries, territories, and areas (hereafter countries) as of [2 Mar 2021] (Table 2, Annex 2). This information should be interpreted with due consideration of limitations of ongoing surveillance, including but not limited to differences between countries in sequencing capacity and which samples are prioritized for sequencing. WHO continues to advocate for strengthening surveillance and sequencing capacity, and a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of variant transmission. New potential variants of interest (VOIs) or VOCs are currently under review and may be added to future updates.

Although many countries worldwide are currently experiencing a decline in overall SARS-CoV-2 infections likely as a result of the public health and social measures (PHSM) implemented and various vaccination programme implementations, there has been an increased number of reports of variants which are of concern. Many countries across all 6 WHO regions have started to report increases in new cases of COVID-19 in the past month [February 2021]. While it is difficult to ascertain the exact proportion of all new cases which may be attributable to VOIs and VOCs, summaries on the past week's updates on VOC 202012/01, 501Y.V2, and P.1 variants of concern are outlined below.

Table 2: Key characteristics of circulating variants of concern (as of [1 Mar2021)]. Annex 2: List of countries/territories/areas reporting variants of concern as of [2 Mar 2021].

Proposed working definitions for SARS-CoV-2 VOIs and VOCs [see source URL above]

1. Variant VOC 202012/01
Since our last update on [23 Feb 2021], VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 5 additional countries. As of [2 Mar 2021], a total of 106 countries across all 6 WHO regions have reported cases of this variant (Figure 4). Community transmission has been reported in at least 42 countries across 4 WHO regions, noting that transmission classification is currently incomplete for 35 (33%) countries reporting this variant.

Figure 4: Countries, territories, and areas reporting VOC 202012/01, as of [2 Mar 2021].

2. Variant 501Y.V2
Since the last update on [23 Feb 2021], 501Y.V2 has been reported from 5 additional countries -- now totalling 56 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 5). Community transmission of 501Y.V2 has been reported in 8 countries across 3 WHO regions, noting the transmission classification is currently incomplete for 42 (75%) countries reporting this variant.

Figure 5: Countries, territories, and areas reporting 501Y.V2, as of [2 Mar 2021].

3. Variant P.1
Since our last update, one country has corrected their reporting, and reporting from another amounted to one additional country. To date, this variant is reported in 29 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 6). Community transmission of P.1 has been reported in at least 3 countries in one WHO region, noting the transmission classification is currently incomplete for 9 (31%) countries reporting this variant.

[In the past 24 hours, Brazil (58 237), the USA (56 451), and France (22 857) reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9522 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 1 Mar 2021 to late 2 Mar 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include Brazil, USA, France, Italy (17 063), India (15 704), Czech Republic (12 191), Turkey (11 837), Sweden (11 804), and Russia (10 565). A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 45 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and none from the African region. Spain has made some alterations in the daily case count so that today's (2 Mar 2021) total is 74 347 fewer than yesterday's (1 Mar 2021). Noteworthy is that Brazil reported more cases than the USA.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 1.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.6%. Given the decline in reported cases from Spain today (2 Mar 2021), I deleted Spain from the 7-day newly confirmed case count and the comparative 7-day change is an increase of 4.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 8.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 14.2% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases totaled over 295 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 115.28 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.55 million reported deaths. The marked revision of reported case counts in Spain over the past 24 hours, combined with the recognized aberrant decrease in testing leading to lower reported cases in the USA makes one raise an eyebrow, but conclude that advances in slowing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 are fading and transmission is increasing. - Mod.MPP]
