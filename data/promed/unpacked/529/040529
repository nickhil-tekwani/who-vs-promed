African swine fever in the Caucasus (update, selected passages)
-----------------------------------------------
GEORGIA
Although ASF was not reported to the OIE until 5 Jun 2007, the 1st
clinical cases were seen before May 2007 in the area surrounding the
port of Poti, on the eastern shore of the Black Sea. All evidence so
far indicates that the virus was probably introduced into Georgia by
improperly disposed waste from international ships carrying
contaminated pork or pork products. Since most pigs in Georgia are
traditionally kept on a free range scavenging system, access to
dumped port waste is likely. Afterwards, the disease spread eastwards
and north following the main transportation routes. This was the 1st
official report of ASF occurrence in the Caucasus region. Sequence
analysis of the Georgian ASF virus isolate revealed a close
relationship to virus strains from Southeast Africa (Mozambique,
Madagascar and Zambia).

Early detection was based mainly on clinical findings, and only a
small proportion of these outbreaks were confirmed by laboratory
investigations. Delayed recognition and response to the new disease
appears to have allowed infection to become widespread. By the 2nd
week of June 2007, 52 out of 65 districts were suspected to be
affected, more than 30 000 pigs had died, and a total of 3900 pigs
had been culled. However, it was reported that only clinically ill
animals within an infected herd had been culled, which may have
contributed to ASF persisting and becoming endemic in the country
[The above statement on ASF being endemic does not conform with
Georgia's official report to the OIE; see in commentary. - Mod.AS].
Most pigs affected were on open grazed fields or in free range
systems. During January 2008, active infection was reported from 3 regions.

ARMENIA
Armenia 1st reported ASF on 6 Aug 2007 in the northern districts
bordering Georgia. The source of the ASF virus entry into Armenia was
probably the ASF epidemic in Georgia. It may have entered Armenia
through legal or illegal movements of pigs and pig products or from
the movement of free-ranging pigs or wild boar across the border.

To date, however, there is insufficient information to identify the
exact route of virus entry. Potential transmission routes include
persons who had visited affected premises in Georgia, swill feeding,
meat scraps at picnic sites, contact with infected pigs or
contaminated fomites.

By 25 Nov 2007, the number of suspected ASF cases [or rather
"outbreaks"/"foci"?! - Mod.AS] in the 2 northern districts of Armenia
had risen to 41. In total, around 3600 pigs died of ASF, and 4300
were culled. During November 2007, new outbreaks occurred in Yerevan
and Ararat districts. However, further spread is almost certain to
occur within and beyond the currently affected areas. During January
[2008], no outbreaks were reported, but one case was diagnosed in
February 2008.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION
On 4 Dec 2007, the Russia Federation reported to the OIE its 1st ASF
outbreak since the 1970s. The report stated that 5 wild boar in the
Republic of Chechnya, bordering Georgia, were positive.

Although the precise method of introduction into the country is
unknown, it is likely to have been related to the outbreaks in
neighbouring Georgia. If wild boar become infected, the virus could
potentially become endemic in the region, as occurred on the Iberian
Peninsula and occurs in Sardinia today. So far, the competency of
possible _Ornithodoros_ tick vectors in the affected regions is unknown.

AZERBAIJAN
ASF was officially confirmed in Azerbaijan on 28 Jan 2008 in the
village of Nic, Gabala District (northwest of the country, about 180
km east of the Georgian border). The majority of the inhabitants of
Nic are Christian, explaining the relatively high number of pigs
(4600) in the village compared to other villages. The pigs were
typically kept in backyard holdings and temporarily left outside
during the day on pasture/communal land. In Azerbaijan, pigs are kept
mainly for family consumption or small-scale local trade.

The local veterinary services believe that the ASF virus was
introduced into Nic either by contaminated pork (or pork products)
from Georgia or by infected wild boar at the beginning of January
[2008]. However, the wild boar hypothesis is questionable since no
infected wild boar have been found so far in Azerbaijan or Georgia.
The hypothesis of virus introduction via infected pork or pork
products from Georgia is thought to be more likely.

Nagorno-Karabakh has been experiencing ASF outbreaks since November 2007.

Main challenges in the area and the risk for the region
---------------------------------------
The spread of ASF within the region was facilitated by late detection
of the disease and limited ability of the veterinary services to
control swine movement or marketing practices. As a result, the
chance of ASF becoming endemic is high. Even with a late aggressive
response, finding all free-ranging pigs and eliminating the disease
in this population will be difficult. If not contained, ASF could
easily spread to other countries in the region and would have a
protracted direct effect on the productivity of the livestock
industry, and indirectly on the food supply, and thus, food security.
As shown in Figure 2 [see map at the above URL], the countries to the
south and east of the Caucasus region (Turkey and Iran), are
predominantly Muslim with negligible pig populations other than in
some isolated Christian communities. [In other words: though the
considerable wild boar populations in both countries may become
infected, the farming industry may be spared due to the scarcity of
domestic pig farms. - Mod.AS]. Therefore, the main risk of ASF spread
is to the north and east (Russian Federation and Ukraine).

Infection in the wild boar population would complicate short and long
term control. Wild boar might contribute to the spread of the virus
since movement of wild boar between regions and countries cannot be
controlled. Although wild boar usually do not migrate, they will move
great distances if pressed to do so (for example, by extreme weather
conditions). There are few reliable data on wild boar populations and
densities in the Caucasus area. However, wild boar distribution is
closely linked to the forested areas they inhabit (Figure 3; [see the
above URL]). Little is known about the potential role of wild boar in
the spread and persistence of ASF, since this type of scenario has
only been observed in Sardinia and Spain. However, for a disease with
a lethality as high as that observed for ASF, it is reasonable to
assume that a relatively high wild boar density is needed to maintain
the infection, which appears not to be the case in the Caucasus
region. In addition to the above difficulties, potential vectors
(_Ornithodoros_ ticks) may be present in the Caucasus region. Should
competent vectors be identified, additional efforts would be needed
to change household and commercial practices, further complicating
the control of infection, since infection in these arthropod hosts
may persist for several years or even decades. The presence of these
vectors in and around pig pens, their biting habits, and vector
competence must be investigated.

On 16 Jan 2008, Georgia submitted its 6th follow-up report to the
OIE, titled "final," which included the following statement: "The
event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted;" for the said
follow-up report 6 (final), see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6686>.
This statement differs from the above FAO opinion on ASF becoming
endemic in Georgia.

The following explanation may help subscribers in interpreting the
current disease notification system to the OIE (WAHID interface):

Immediate and follow-up reports include the (last) passage "Future reporting."

As long as the outbreak is regarded by the reporting country to be
continuing, the following text will appear under the title "Future
reporting:" "The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will
be submitted."

When the follow-up report becomes final, the "Future reporting"
passage may include one of the 2 following texts:

1. The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

Or:

2. The event is now considered to be endemic. No more follow-up
reports will be made; information about this disease will be included
in the future 6-monthly reports.

The fate of an outbreak can also be retrieved from the page "Event
summary," available in WAHID. Event summaries include the following 9
articles/subjects:

Start of event; Confirmation; Report date; Submission date; Reason;
This event pertains to; Number of outbreaks; Date resolved;
Epidemiological comments.

The 8th article, "Date resolved," may present one of the following 3 texts:

1. "Continuing." This means that the current summary is temporary, to
be updated when the next follow-up report is received.

2. A date (in green). This means that the outbreak has ended and that
the current summary is the final one (it is titled as "final report"
when one opens the report).

3. "Endemic disease" followed by a date (in red). This means that the
reported disease has been decided by the reporting country to have
become endemic and that the current summary is the final one since
further information on the disease will be provided by the country in
its 6-monthly reports and not anymore through weekly follow-up
reports. - Mod.AS]
