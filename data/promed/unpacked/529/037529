The following background material on Lassa fever appears in GIDEON
<http://www.cyinfo.com>:
Lassa fever is thought to occur in all of West Africa, from Nigeria to
Senegal. As many as 500 000 cases may occur yearly according to some
estimates. Disease rates peak during January to April (i.e., the dry season).
Twelve cases of Lassa fever were imported into Europe and North America
during 1970 to 2000, with no secondary cases among medical staff or patients.
The disease is transmitted to humans from wild rodents (the multimammate
rat, _Mastomys natalensis_). Lassa infection in rodents persists and the
virus is shed throughout the life of the animal. Disease transmission is
primarily through direct or indirect contact with excreta of infected
rodents deposited on surfaces such as floors, beds or in food or water. All
age groups are susceptible to Lassa infection. Person-to-person and
laboratory infections occur, especially in the hospital environment, by
direct contact with blood (including inoculation with contaminated
needles), pharyngeal secretions or urine, or by sexual contact.
Person-to-person spread may occur during the acute phase of fever when the
virus is present in the throat. The virus may be excreted in the urine of
patients for three to nine weeks from the onset of illness. The virus can
be transmitted via semen for up to three months. Nosocomial outbreaks have
been described in Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The onset of symptoms is gradual, with fever, malaise, headache, sore
throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia and chest and
abdominal pain. The fever may be either constant or intermittent with
spikes. Inflammation of the throat and eyes is commonly observed. In
severe cases, hypotension or shock, pleural effusion, hemorrhage, seizures,
encephalopathy and swelling of the face and neck are frequent.
Approximately 15% of hospitalised cases die. The disease is more severe in
pregnancy, and fetal loss occurs in greater than 80% of cases. Hair loss
and loss of coordination may occur in convalescence. Sensorineural
deafness occurs in 29%, making this the most common cause of deafness in
West Africa.
The clinical syndrome of Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from
severe malaria, septicaemia, yellow fever and other viral haemorrhagic
fevers (e.g., Ebola). Inflammation of the throat with white tonsillar
patches is an important distinguishing feature. Definitive diagnosis
requires testing that is available only in highly-specialised laboratories.
Laboratory specimens may be hazardous and must be handled with extreme care
at the highest level of biosafety containment.
