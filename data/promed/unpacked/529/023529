Final report

Follow-up report No. 2
Translation of a communication received on 19 February 1998 from Dr L.
Hallet, Counsellor General, Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture,
Brussels:
End of previous report period: 27 January 1998 (see Disease Information, 11
[5, 17).
End of this report period: 16 February 1998.
No extension of the disease from the affected farm has been detected.
Vertical transmission and foodborne transmission were ruled out following
epidemiological investigations. The hypothesis of a sporadic case has been
confirmed.
Epidemiological surveillance has been strengthened and more precisely
targeted. From 31 October to 31 December 1997, a total of 58 bovine brains
were examined for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, with negative results.
Conclusion: Belgium can therefore once more be considered free from bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.

[If the Belgium authorities are scientifically correct that this was an
instance of a true sporadic case, this must be one of the very few ever
reported. One hopes that they will ensure that it is written up for
publication in a peer reviewed veterinary journal. Also, that the relevant
brain tissue is available for comparison with BSE-UK as there might be the
possibility that it is not identical. If so, it would be invaluable. -
