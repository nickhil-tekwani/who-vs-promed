A comment on vaccination recommendation
---------------------------------------
[Dr Rob Parker of the Fraser Health Authority has sent the following
explanatory note in response to the moderator's comment appended to Avian
influenza A (H7) virus, human - Canada (BC) (03) 20040406.0935, that: "The
administration of normal human influenza vaccine (containing H3N2, H1N1,
and B viruses) to poultry workers and others exposed to high concentrations
of the British Columbian strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
A (H7) may have little purpose if the neuraminidase type is indeed N3." -
Mod.CP]
We still are awaiting confirmation of the N component from the 2 human
cases virus isolates as being N3, which is the expected result. The current
winter's human influenza vaccine (containing: influenza A/Panama/2007/99
(H3N2); A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1); and B/Hong Kong/330/2001) is being
given to poultry workers and those involved in culling activities. This is
not being done in the belief that it will provide them any protection
against avian influenza H7N3, which it won't.
Rather, it is being given in the belief that it may provide some protection
against the still circulating predominant human influenza virus in western
Canada and British Columbia this winter, A/H3N2/Fujian (though we are aware
of the limited protectiveness of this winter's human vaccine against
A/Fujian). This is to guard against the unlikely but highly undesirable
possibility of a poultry worker becoming co-infected at the same time with
both the A/Fujian virus and the avian H7 virus. Such a situation could
allow for genetic re-assortment, and the triggering of a new novel
influenza A strain with pandemic potential -- that is, that was
transmissible human-to-human and with more pathogencity to humans.
While the peak of the A/Fujian activity this winter occurred in BC in the
week between Christmas and New Year's day, we still are finding some
activity. We just lab confirmed an influenza A outbreak in a seniors'
nursing home in our region on Friday April 2 2004, that was PCR confirmed
on April 4 as being due to H3 (assumedly A/Fujian) virus.
