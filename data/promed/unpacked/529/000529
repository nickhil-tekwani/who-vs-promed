A new strain of flu discovered in China has the potential to become another pandemic, and humans would be extremely vulnerable to it.

Scientists have identified a strain of influenza that has recently emerged among pigs called G4 EA H1N1. It's similar to the swine flu of 2009, and researchers say it's one to keep an eye on even as the world struggles to bring the current COVID-19 pandemic under control.

They have discovered evidence of it infecting people working in abattoirs and other swine facilities in China. The virus can grow and multiply in the cells lining the human airways, new research indicates. There are concerns that the strain could mutate further and become more infectious, spreading easily from person to person and potentially triggering a global outbreak.

Professor Kin-Chow Chang and his colleagues say G4 EA H1N1 has "all the hallmarks" of a pandemic in the making and must be monitored closely to control its spread among pigs, they wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.

Because the virus is so new, humans likely have little or no immunity to it, making it more dangerous. Current flu vaccines don't seem to protect against it, although they could be adapted to do so should it become necessary.

"Right now, we are distracted with coronavirus, and rightly so," Prof Chang of Nottingham University told the BBC. "But we must not lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses." While G4 EA H1N1 isn't presenting an immediate problem, we "should not ignore it," he said.

Public health experts are constantly on the lookout for new strains of influenza that could trigger a mass outbreak among humans. During the 2009 pandemic, swine flu proved to be less deadly than expected, because many older people turned out to have some level of immunity to it, likely because it was similar to other flu viruses from previous years.

A new strain of flu that has the potential to become a pandemic has been identified in China by scientists, BBC reports. It emerged recently and is carried by pigs, but can infect humans, they say.

The researchers are concerned that it could mutate further so that it can spread easily from person to person and trigger a global outbreak. While it is not an immediate problem, they say, it has "all the hallmarks" of being highly adapted to infect humans and needs close monitoring. As the virus is new, people could have little or no immunity to it.

The scientists write in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that measures to control the virus in pigs, and the close monitoring of swine industry workers, should be swiftly implemented.

[Influenza A viruses are found in a range of hosts including humans and a wide range of mammalian and avian species. Reassortment of influenza viruses is a major mechanism to generate novel viruses with unique antigenic and biological characteristics, which may have potential to cause human epidemics and pandemics.

Historically, pandemic influenza A viruses from 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 were all reassortants derived from animal influenza viruses that caused major global pandemics and either disappeared or became adapted to humans, causing annual epidemics. Pigs, being susceptible to avian, swine, and human influenza A viruses, are regarded as "mixing vessels" in the generation of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. The emergence of the 2009 pandemic (pdm/09) H1N1 virus was the latest example of such a novel emergence leading to a global pandemic.

This virus was described in a recent publication on influenza virus surveillance of pigs from 2011 to 2018 in China and identified as a recently emerged genotype 4 (G4) reassortant Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 virus, which bears 2009 pandemic (pdm/09) and triple-reassortant (TR)-derived internal genes and has been predominant in swine populations since 2016. The virus, described by the researchers as "G4 EA H1N1" is able to grow and multiply in the cells that line the human airways. The full publication can be accessed at https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2020/06/23/1921186117.full.pdf. The paper was published at the end of April 2020. The immense impact of COVID-19 on health systems has shifted a lot of focus from influenza surveillance, and the article reminds us of other serious contenders for the pandemic slots.

The researchers found evidence of recent infection in people who worked in abattoirs and the swine industry in China when they looked at data from 2011 to 2018. "Further serological surveillance among occupational exposure population showed that 10.4% (35/338) of swine workers were positive for G4 EA H1N1 virus, especially for participants 18-35 years old, who had 20.5% (9/44) seropositive rates, indicating that the predominant G4 EA H1N1 virus has acquired increased human infectivity."

Therefore, continuous surveillance of swine influenza viruses in pigs and assessment of their zoonotic potential are essential for the preparedness of human pandemics. - Mod.UBA

The G4 EA H1N1 virus addressed in the PNAS paper has not affected the health of the sampled pigs; this virus is NOT pathogenic for pigs. Pigs do suffer an OIE-listed disease "influenza A virus of swine (IAV-S)," a highly contagious viral infection of pigs that can have significant clinical and economic impact on an affected herd. The subtypes of IAV-S that are most frequently identified in such outbreaks are presented in chapter 3.8.7 of OIE's terrestrial manual at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.08.07_INF_A_SWINE.pdf. This disease is not zoonotic.

The chances of human influenza A viruses undergoing genetic reassortment in pigs are higher when interactions and contact between humans, pigs, and birds are intensive. The speedy, extensive spread of African swine fever, a lethal viral disease, throughout China since summer 2018 has been partially attributed to the difficulty in controlling biosanitary requirements in the large number of small holdings in the country. This led the national pig industry to try reducing the number of small pig holders while encouraging the establishment and operation of mega-farms.

The following information, relevant to the above, is based upon recent Chinese reports scanned by ProMED-mail's rapporteur Dan Silver who is gratefully acknowledged:
"13 publicly-listed pork producers... in 2018 had a combined slaughter of 50.34 million heads, accounting for 7.26% of national hog slaughter. In 2019, [these companies'] combined pig slaughter was 47.34 million heads, accounting for 8.70% of national pig slaughter. Compared to 2018, there was increasing concentration [of production]." (see https://www.dxumu.com/22886.html).

Most of the A-share [publicly-listed companies on China's stock exchanges] pig companies adopt the "farmer + company" light breeding model; that is, the company provides farmers with piglets, feed, vaccines, and medicines; entrusts the farmers to raise [the piglets]; and waits for the piglets to grow to the threshold for slaughter. Then they buy the pig back, according to a certain custody fee." (see https://www.huxiu.com/article/366000.html)."

Most likely, there are numerous not-registered backyard small-holders as well (in December 2019, China's SINA news agency quoted figures according to which "China has 26 million pig farms. Of these, 99% are small and midsize farms slaughtering less than 500 heads a year;" available at https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2019-12-18/doc-iihnzahi8262303.shtml. Confirmation or otherwise will be helpful.)

In conclusion, a very large number of small pig farms is maintained in China, preserving the intensive man-animal contact: a system that is undesirable from a zoonotic point of view, as chances of genetic reassortment are maintained. Similar hazards also relate to live-animal-markets conditions. - Mod.AS
