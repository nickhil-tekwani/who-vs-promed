Avian influenza A (H7) Virus Human Infections in Canada
-------------------------------------------------------
The first human case of avian influenza A (H7) virus infection in British
Columbia arose in a person who was involved in the culling of infected
birds on 13-14 Mar 2004. On 13 Mar 2004, he may have been accidentally
exposed in the eye. On 16 Mar, he reported conjunctivitis and nasal
discharge. Treatment with oseltamivir -- an antiviral drug active against
influenza A viruses -- began on 18 Mar. On 30 Mar, Health Canada concluded
that this case was caused by avian influenza A (H7) virus and informed WHO
on 31 Mar. The patient has recovered fully.
On 2 Apr 2004, WHO was informed by Health Canada of a second poultry worker
in British Columbia infected with avian influenza A (H7) virus infection.
This worker developed conjunctivitis on 25 Mar after close contact with
infected birds. He was treated with oseltamivir on 25 Mar, and his symptoms
resolved.
Based on this epidemiological information provided by Health Canada, WHO
today raised the global pandemic preparedness level from 0.1 to 0.2 for the
Canadian outbreak. Global pandemic preparedness levels are dictated by the
epidemiological situation for each local event. Level 0.2 means that more
than one human case caused by a new subtype of influenza virus has been
identified in the local event.
In Asia, another avian influenza virus, A (H5N1), has been responsible for
34 reported human illnesses and 23 deaths. The existing global preparedness
level of 0.2 for the avian influenza in Asia remains unchanged.
Preparedness levels have been organized into a matrix established by WHO in
1999 (WHO Influenza Pandemic Preparedness plan). When a preparedness level
is raised to 0.2, affected countries are advised to step up their
surveillance in people exposed to affected poultry, to organize special
investigations to better understand the new virus, to advise people at risk
to wear protected clothing, and to consider the use of antivirals and
normal human influenza vaccine.
WHO has been informed that Canada has taken all required actions in
response to the current avian influenza A (H7) outbreak in British
Columbia. The new pandemic preparedness level for avian influenza A (H7)
also means that WHO will begin a series of activities to obtain the virus,
characterize it, and assess the needs for diagnostics and vaccine development.

[Early reports of the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus
in poultry in British Columbia indicated that the antigenic type of the
virus was H7N3. In recent reports, the neuraminidase (N) type is not
stated, and it does not appear to have been determined in the case of the 2
human isolates. The administration of normal human influenza vaccine
(containing H3N2, H1N1, and B viruses) to poultry workers and others
exposed to high concentrations of the British Columbian strain of highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus A (H7) may have little purpose if the
neuraminidase type is indeed N3. - Mod.CP]
