Grapevine leafroll is one of the most important viral diseases in
grapevine and occurs wherever grapevines are grown. At least 9
different Grapevine leafroll associated viruses (GLRaVs) belonging to
different genera within the _Closteroviridae_ family have been
reported. Typical leafroll symptoms include downward rolling and
interveinal reddening or yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit size,
sugar content, and yield.
[STA Laboratories in California] has detected the presence of GLRaV-7
in many grapevine cuttings collected in California vineyards. During
the 2005-2006 fall/winter testing season, symptomatic and
asymptomatic grapevine varieties collected from different vineyards
in California were tested for the detection of economically important
viruses and processed for [reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction] (RT)-PCR and ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]. The
RT-PCR assays using primers specifically designed for the detection
of GLRaV-7 (C. Turturo et al., 13th ICVG [Abstr.], 2000) amplified a
single band of approximately 200 bp in samples from selections of
Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc cultivars. The
same samples showed low or no reactivity to GLRaV-7 specific
antibodies (BIOREBA AG, Reinach, Switzerland). The variability of
detection by ELISA can be due to the lower sensitivity of ELISA as
compared with RT-PCR and the uneven distribution of GLRaVs in grapevines (1).
To confirm that the amplified DNA was GLRaV-7 specific, different
isolates were sequenced and compared with the nucleotide and derived
amino acid sequences obtained by Turturo et al. (13th ICVG [Abstr.],
2000). The California isolates showed 81 to 98 percent similarity
with the Italian isolates.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of GLRaV-7 in California and
the United States. Our initial testing data indicates that GLRaV-7 is
widespread in California vineyards. Further studies will allow us to
determine the potential effect of this virus in grapevines grown in California.

[GLRaVs 1 and 3 appear to be established in US vineyards, GLRaVs 2,
4, and 5 have also been detected in imported vines. GLRaV 3 is
transmitted by a mealy bug, while the natural vectors for the other
GLRaVs are unknown. All of the GLRaVs are spread by grafting and have
been widely distributed and accumulated in their long-lived host over
time by human activities.
Symptoms of viral leaf roll disease vary on different grape varieties
resulting in very serious disease in some varieties and no symptoms
at all in others. These latter 'latent' infections are a particular
threat as a source of diseased grafting material. Generic molecular
diagnostic methods for _Closterovirus_ have been developed and can be
used to ensure virus-free rootstocks and budwood.
