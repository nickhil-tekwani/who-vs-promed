Tasmania leads cherry virus national response
---------------------------------------------
Confirmation of the little cherry virus [LChV-2 - see link below] in one orchard in Tasmania has triggered a process to limit the disease's spread [and] define the distribution of the infection in Tasmania and interstate.

Andrew Bishop, Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment [DPIPWE], says [they are] the lead agency in a national response to the little cherry disease.

"The testing that we do is using molecular techniques to diagnose the disease quite specifically. One of the important things is that we [Australia] don't have the insect that spreads it. Effectively what we're looking at is [that] the original root stocks are infected, or that infection has come in through grafts. So we explore the history of the plants and look back to try to determine the most likely source.

"This virus hasn't been recorded in Australia before and there are national processes to address that. It also includes the national industry. This is a national emergency plant pest response [with] the possibility of owner reimbursements. Those are decisions that need to be made nationally."

[Little cherry disease (LCD) is a serious problem for sweet and sour cherry producers in parts of northern Europe and North America. It can be caused by 2 viruses of the family _Closteroviridae_, _Little cherry virus 1_ (LChV-1, not yet assigned to a genus) and LChV-2 (genus _Ampelovirus_), in single or mixed infections.

Symptoms vary with host cultivars, but may include reduced size and quality of fruit, premature leaf reddening, stunting of seedlings, and some loss of tree vigour. All commercial cherry cultivars are susceptible, and ornamental flowering cherries can be asymptomatic reservoirs of LChV-1.

LChV-2 is transmitted by at least one species of mealybugs, which can be spread by wind and with packing material in their nymph stages. An insect vector for LChV-1 is not known. Both viruses can be spread by both shoot and root grafting and with infected plant material. Disease management for LCD includes use of certified clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum (removal of infected trees), and vector control for LChV-2.

The report above refers to the absence in Australia of the apple mealybug (_Phenacoccus aceris_), which is considered the main vector for LChV-2. However, possible spread of LChV-2 by other mealybug species has also been suggested (for example, grape mealybug; see links below). If indeed no insect vectors are involved in Australia, the disease will be easier to control by phytosanitation and increased standards of certification for virus-freedom of _Prunus_ propagation material.
