This concerns the comments about the supposed extreme mutability of the
Ebola virus genomes and the concern that they could somehow acquire new
means of transmission as a result of some radical antigenic change.
The equation between the error-prone nature of RNA virus polymerases
and the supposed inherent genetic instability of RNA virus genomes in
nature is widely misunderstood. We have two observations that seem
quite at odds. First, there is much reason to suppose that the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of Ebola viruses are quite error prone,
based upon the precedent set by many other RNA viruses. Second, we have
the clear and uncontested data from Zairean outbreaks separated by 19
years and many hundred kilometers that show clearly that Ebola Zaire
has gone virtually unchanged genetically over that interval. How can we
reconcile these differences?
First we can note that these observations are in no way unprecedented.
In a situation in which a virus has achieved a stable ecological niche
and has not recently switched hosts, there are a number of examples
where RNA viruses have exhibited similar genetic stability over time.
We have, I believe, taken the lentivirus model too much to heart in our
thinking, since HIV and many of its relatives are not in a stable
ecological niche at present. The theoretical explanations for the
apparent stability of many RNA virus genomes in nature are beyond the
scope of a ProMED-mail discussion, but there is much
more to acquiring a new predominant genotype, let alone phenotype, than
the occurrence of the occasional random polymerase error. The
probability that a polymerase error will result in a fixed change in a
viral population is strongly related to the fitness of the viruses
bearing the change relative to the parental virus.
The fact that there are multiple viruses that happen to be called
"Ebola virus" is irrelevant to this discussion, since we are still
quite unable to consider their relationship to their natural hosts
(whatever those are) or to one another. The common ancestor of the
various Ebola viruses may be quite ancient, for all we know. It is
important in and of itself that Ebola-Zaire has exhibited remarkable
stability between 1976 and 1995.
The notion that widely-divergent Ebola-Zaire strains from nature may have
been subject to some intense convergent evolution upon passage in humans in
1976 and 1995 seems very far fetched.
