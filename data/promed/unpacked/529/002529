The summer's third reported case of anthrax in livestock has killed more
than a dozen cattle in Butte County, according to the South Dakota Animal
Industry Board.
The outbreak doesn't pose a significant danger to humans, said state
veterinarian Sam Holland.
In August 2002, 13 cattle from a herd in Butte County died of what later
was confirmed to be anthrax. Several more cattle have died since, Holland
said Fri 6 Sep 2002.
Holland said anthrax spores live in contaminated soil indefinitely and that
much of South Dakota has the potential for an outbreak. With this summer's
hot, windy weather, "conditions are right for anthrax," Holland said.
The state's other reported cases of anthrax involved a cow and a buffalo
that died in Jerauld County.
