A dead oriental magpie robin, which was found in Cheung Chau, has tested positive for the H5 bird flu virus in preliminary checks, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said yesterday [29 Feb 2012].

This is the 2nd bird of the species found with the H5 virus on the island within 2 days this month [February 2012].

In the latest incident, the robin, which is common to Hong Kong, was found and collected at Hok Loo Lane. The department is now conducting further confirmatory tests to check whether the virus is the deadly H5N1.

A dead oriental magpie robin was found on the rooftop of a building on Hing Lung Back Street in Cheung Chau on Saturday [25 Feb 2012].

Testing also revealed H5, and confirmatory test results are pending.

"It is not a huge surprise that the 2 birds of the same species were found dead in Cheung Chau within 2 days, especially in winter," said Billy Hau Chi-hang, University of Hong Kong assistant professor in biodiversity and conservation. "One bird may come in contact with another which has already contracted the H5 avian influenza virus."

The department also announced on Tuesday [28 Feb 2012] that a crested goshawk, which is not common to Hong Kong, also tested positive for H5. It was found at Diocesan Boys' School in Argyle Street, Mong Kok, on Friday [2 Mar 2012].

Seven dead birds were confirmed with H5N1 bird flu in January and February this year [2012]. The department has stepped up disinfection and cleansing work.

A dead house crow found in Hong Kong's Shek Kip Mei area has tested positive for the H5 avian influenza virus, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government said Saturday [17 Mar 2012].

The dead bird was found and collected at a planter next to a petrol filling station, outside Tai Hang Tung Recreation Ground, on 15 Mar [2012].

The AFCD said further confirmatory tests are being conducted, and cleansing and disinfection have been stepped up at the venue, adding that there are no poultry farms within 3 km of where the dead bird was found.

In view of the case, the AFCD has phoned poultry farmers to remind them to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza. Letters have been issued to farmers, pet bird shop owners, and license holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons reminding them that proper precautions must be taken.
