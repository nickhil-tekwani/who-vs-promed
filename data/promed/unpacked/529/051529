The New Jersey Department of Health has issued cease-and-desist orders to Udder Milk, a home delivery company that has illegally sold unpasteurized milk in New Jersey.

State and federal officials are investigating to determine from which farms Udder Milk acquired its raw milk, after a North Jersey woman became ill with a rare bacterial infection, the department said.

"It is illegal in New Jersey to sell or distribute raw milk or products made from raw milk, such as yogurt, soft cheese and ice cream," State Epidemiologist Dr. Tina Tan said. "People should know that, in general, unpasteurized milk may contain dangerous bacteria, and those who have become ill after consuming raw milk products should immediately consult a medical professional. Pasteurized milk and dairy products bought commercially are considered safe for consumption, because they are heated to a high temperature that kills harmful bacteria."

The United States Department of Agriculture, the CDC, and the Department's Public Health and Food Protection Program, with the cooperation of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, are investigating to determine the suppliers. DOH was notified on 23 Oct 2017 that a North Jersey woman tested positive for _Brucella_ RB51 infection, and she has since recovered. It marked the 2nd [reported] case associated with raw milk consumption confirmed in the United States in 2017. The Texas Department of State Health Services, with assistance from CDC, is investigating _Brucella abortus_ RB51 exposures and illnesses connected to a dairy company in Paradise, Texas that also sells raw milk products.

_Brucella_ bacteria are primarily passed among infected animals. While rare, people can become infected by eating or drinking contaminated raw milk products. A brucellosis infection can cause a range of symptoms including fever, sweats, chills, weight loss, headache, fatigue and muscle and joint pain. Symptoms may appear up to 6 months after exposure. In severe cases, infections of the central nervous system or lining of the heart may occur.

People who may have consumed contaminated milk should see a doctor right away. _Brucella_ RB51 cannot be diagnosed through tests commonly used to diagnose the disease, and this strain is resistant to one of the antimicrobials commonly used to treat brucellosis in people.

From 1993 through 2012, 127 outbreaks linked to raw milk were reported to CDC, resulting in 1909 illnesses and 144 hospitalizations. Between 2012 and 2016, only 3 New Jersey cases were reported.

All suspected and confirmed cases of brucellosis are immediately reportable to the local health department where the patient resides.

[Related to the previous Texas case related to unpasteurized milk contaminated from _B. abortus_ strain RB51, CDC and Texas health officials had received reports about people who drank K-Bar milk or have symptoms consistent with brucellosis caused by RB51 in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Ohio, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas, but not New Jersey. This may be a separate case.

RB51 is a weakened strain of _Brucella_ used to vaccinate young female cattle against infection with more pathogenic strains of _Brucella_. Vaccinating cows with the RB51 vaccine helps prevent abortions in cows and reduces the risk of people coming into contact with cows infected with more severe strains of _Brucella_. However, in rare cases, vaccinated cows can shed RB51 in their milk.

ProMED would appreciate more information about this case and any others in New Jersey and whether they are related to the Texas case. - Mod.LL
