On July 2nd at the index-school 160 of 391 children are reported to have
had measles in the last two weeks (30 cases notified as clinical measles by
the GP's, 12 cases laboratory confirmed). Two other schools (same
religious background) have reported two cases of measles each (not yet
confirmed), one school in an adjacent village, one at the opposite side of
the river Rhine a few kilometers away. No cases of measles reported so far
(in spite active surveillance by the regional public health services)
outside this religious group - that is not vaccinating their children. The
virus is typed by the RIVM (National Public health Laboratory) as the most
common type circulating in Europe at present (Rob van Binnendijk).
