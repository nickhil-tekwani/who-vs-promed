Technical working groups will be created to make progress in the control and eradication of African swine fever (ASF) in the Dominican Republic and Haiti and thus reduce the risk of spread to other countries in the Americas.

Mexico's secretariat of agriculture and rural development made available to the region the technical expertise of the National Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality Service (Senasica) to strengthen the veterinary services of the affected countries.

Technical working groups led by specialists from Mexico and the United States will be created to strengthen veterinary services in these Caribbean nations, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In a virtual meeting with his US, Dominican, and Haitian counterparts, the head of the federal agency, Víctor Villalobos Arámbula, presented the proposal in which experts from Senasica will share their experience in animal health intelligence, counter-epidemic measures, and strengthening inspection services at ports, airports, and borders.

To strengthen the actions of the technical groups, the work carried out in recent years by international bodies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the International Regional Organization for Plant and Animal Health (OIRSA) will be added.

[Interestingly, the OIE reported ASF in the Dominican Republic and Haiti in May 2022. Prior to May [2022], the 1st outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in the Dominican Republic and Haiti started on 10 Apr 2021 and 26 Aug 2021, respectively. There is no treatment or vaccine available for this disease. The only way to stop this disease is to depopulate all affected or exposed swine herds.

Given the proximity of these countries to the USA, it seems some of these plans could have moved faster as this is already early September 2022. However, supposedly the swine from the 2021 cases were depopulated.

According to the USDA and APHIS, "USDA is working closely with other federal and state agencies, the swine industry, and producers to take the necessary actions to protect our nation's pigs and keep this disease out. This group is also actively preparing to respond if ASF were ever detected in the US." - Mod.TG
