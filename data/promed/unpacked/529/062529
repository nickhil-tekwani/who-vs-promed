As many as 30 new cases of anthrax infection have been detected in 2
districts of the country, Kushtia and Tangail, raising the number of
infected patients to 193, an official said Wednesday [1 Sep 2010].

Despite the government's claim that anthrax is under control, the
disease is steadily making its way through the country. On Wednesday
[1 Sep 2010], 16 new anthrax infected people were detected in
Kushtia's Dharmadaha village under Doulatpur Upazila, and another
infection case of 14 victims were reported on Tuesday [31 Aug 2010]
in a village of Tangail district.

A health ministry official who requested anonymity confirmed the
news, adding that the new cases were detected after at least 127
people had been infected by the disease in Sirajganj and Pabna late
[last] month [August 2010] [But see the next report for a larger
number. - Mod.MHJ].

Upazila health and family planning officer in Kushtia Saleh Ahmed
confirmed the report. The incidents have been observed for 2-3 days,
and on Wednesday [1 Sep 2010] morning, a team of physicians visited
the village, he said. "Treatment is being administered to the
afflicted, and our workers are in place. The relevant authorities
have been informed to help detect further infection," said Ahmed.

Sharif Uddin, former chairman of Doulatpur Adabaira Union and a
resident of Dharmadaha village said that 20 to 25 goats became ill a
few days ago, some of which were slaughtered and the mutton sold.
"Five to 6 people became sick after consuming the meat; skin lesions
were found on their body," he added.

However, infection of the villagers of Tangail has caused wound-like
lesions in the body. The villagers were infected as they were
involved in processing and distribution of meat of an ailing cow,
which has been found to be infected with anthrax, the official said.

Anthrax is a highly contagious disease, usually transmitted to people
through contact with meat, blood or skin of infected animals.
Infection in humans most often involves the skin, the
gastrointestinal tract or the lungs.

The number of cutaneous anthrax patients keeps rising in Bangladesh,
with 21 more people found to have contracted the infectious disease
on Thursday [2 Sep 2010] morning, pushing the total count to 254.

Mahmudur Rahman, chief of Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology,
Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) under the country's Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare, told Xinhua Thursday [2 Sep 2010] the
disease has so far spread to 4 out of the country's 64 districts.
With 21 new cases detected on Thursday morning, he said, "records of
the IEDCR till today [2 Sep 2010] (Thursday) morning confirmed 254
infected people." They are all infected with cutaneous anthrax,
Rahman further said.

The anthrax outbreak 1st started in Bangladesh's Sirajganj district,
some 134 km northwest of the capital Dhaka, in late August 2010, and
later it spread to the neighboring Pabna district. At the latest, the
disease has spread to 2 more of Sirajganj's neighboring districts --
Tangail and Kushtia -- this week.

Rahman said most of the previously anthrax-infected people have
almost recovered from the disease, which has caused wound-like black
lesions on the skin. He, however, confirmed nobody died of the disease.

But an official from the Live Stock Department control room said 28
cows and 5 goats have died of anthrax in Sirajganj and Pabna since
the outbreak of the disease. Apart from this, the control room's duty
officer Md. Ataur Rahman said 34 animals were also anthrax infected
in the districts.

The official said a total of 137 343 animals including 118 795 cows
and 15 254 goats have so far been vaccinated in Sirajganj and Pabna
districts since the outbreak of anthrax. But the official claimed the
disease has remained under control in the districts, as there are no
fresh reports of outbreaks.

Regarding the measures in Tangail and Kushtia districts, he said
steps are underway also to contain the outbreak of the disease in
these districts. "Till now, there is no information in our hands on
whether any animal has been infected or died of the disease in the
districts. We'll very soon get information, as local officials are
conducting a survey," the official said. He said officials concerned
across the country have already been asked to strengthen monitoring
so that no farm or domestic animal can be slaughtered before proper testing.

[254 human cases and all cutaneous and with no deaths; I am amazed!
There should, from the repeated descriptions, have been large numbers
of gastro-enteric cases of anthrax, anything from 10 to 35 cases per
infected carcass butchered and the meat sold; a puzzle. The simplest
explanation, other than severe over-cooking, is that the diagnostic
report sheets have only one anthrax item to tick off or code:
"cutaneous anthrax." - Mod.MHJ]
