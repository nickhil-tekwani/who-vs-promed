Indonesia (03): (Bali)"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the decree from the Bali Governor to control a potential
canine rabies outbreak on that island by mass culling of stray dogs,
it is critical to understand that this method of disease control does
not work. Similar mass culling strategies have been used without
success on isolated islands and on land where canine rabies exists.

Many excellent examples of failed attempts at controlling canine
rabies through mass culling processes exist, for example officials on
Flores Island tried to eliminate a canine rabies outbreak 8 years ago
by killing over 500 000 dogs and yet rabies is still present on that
island. Similarly, when canine rabies spread to the region of
Sulawesi in Indonesia approximately 5 years later, mass culling of
dogs was again attempted without successfully eliminating rabies.

On the other hand, mass vaccination of dogs against rabies does work.
There are also many countrywide examples proving that when the WHO
recommendation of vaccinating 70 percent of the dog population
against rabies is applied, the spread of rabies throughout the dog
population is stopped. Excellent examples of successful programs
exist in Latin America where the Pan American Health Organization
spearheaded mass canine vaccination programs throughout the continent
resulting in a dramatic reduction in the prevalence of both canine
rabies and human rabies.

Similar success stories have been reported in Africa, for example in
Tanzania where mass canine rabies vaccination cleared rabies from the
community dog population surrounding the Serengeti region resulting
in the protection of endangered species of wildlife within the park.
When it comes to rabies, the tools to prevent the existence and
spread of this disease in dogs already exist and have been proven to
work; they only need to be utilized.

Late in the 1990's I was asked to go to Flores Island, Indonesia, on
a WHO mission to look at a disastrous rabies outbreak on this
previously rabies-free island. Fisherman had imported 3 dogs and with
them rabies. Within one year, over 100 humans died on this island
with around 1 million population. A South African veterinary
colleague and I went to all districts discussing human post-exposure
treatment and dog vaccination. I also reviewed as many of the clinic
charts of human victims as possible. Diagnoses were sound but made on
clinical grounds only.

Several dogs brains were sent to a lab in Sulawesi and diagnosed as
rabies by FAT. A local decision was made to cull as many dogs as
possible. Some 500 000 were then said to have been clubbed to death
by teams of hired workers and owners. I did witness a few such
gruesome events. Some 300 000 remained but were not all vaccinated.
Today, some 8 years later, there is still rabies on Flores; a rather
small and isolated island close to Timor with an overwhelming
Catholic population that keeps dogs for food.

A repeat performance took place some 4-5 years later in the Sulawesi
region of Indonesia. I did meet with a health official in Bali on my
way back to Bangkok and he expressed great anxiety of some similar
event happening on Bali.

His fear was justified. Culling alone does not work!

[The W.H.O. coordinated, in previous years, several projects
addressing dog ecology and dog population management; e.g., in
Ecuador, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. Other ecological studies were
conducted in South America and Asia. Some of the projects became,
reportedly, successful (mainly in Latin America).

Subscribers are referred to the following references:

1. Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control, 2008,
National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc.
"Part I: Rabies Prevention and Control" of the compendium includes
the following statements, relevant to strays:
- Stray dogs, cats, and ferrets should be removed from the
community. Local health departments and animal-control officials can
enforce the removal of strays more effectively if owned animals have
identification and are confined or kept on leash.
- Local governments should initiate and maintain effective programs
to ensure vaccination of all dogs, cats, and ferrets and to remove
strays and unwanted animals.
- All local jurisdictions should incorporate stray animal control.
The current issue of the compendium has been published by CDC in the
MMRW of 18 Apr 2008, Vol. 57, No. RR-2, available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5702.pdf>.

2. The Rabies Web site of the W.H.O includes the following
guidelines titled "Controlling rabies in dogs: what to do - what to
avoid doing?", based upon the recommendations of the Expert
Consultation on Rabies held in Geneva, October 2004:
- "Dog destruction alone is not effective in rabies control. There
is no evidence that removal of dogs alone has ever had a significant
impact on dog population densities or the spread of rabies. In
addition, dog removal may be unacceptable to local communities.
However, the targeted and humane removal of unvaccinated, ownerless
dogs may be effective when used as a supplementary measure to mass
vaccination.
- Mass canine vaccination campaigns have been the most effective
measure for controlling canine rabies. High vaccination coverage (70
percent or higher) can be attained through comprehensive strategies
consisting among others of well-designed educational campaigns,
intersectoral cooperation, community participation, local commitment
in planning and execution.
- Surveillance of rabies is the basis for any programme of rabies
control. Veterinary surveillance of rabies and laboratory submission
of reports of suspected animal cases is also essential for management
of potential human exposures and for veterinarians to adopt
appropriate measures towards animals in contact with a suspected
animal case.
- Efforts should be made to fully incorporate rabies control
activities in all levels of the health services, aligning them with
other public health programmes such as the Expanded programme on
immunization and those for tuberculosis and vector-borne diseases. In
this manner, synergies between programmes improve logistical use of
human, material and financial resources." See at
<http://www.who.int/rabies/animal/dogs/en/index.html>.

Indeed "culling alone does not work," but it is not clear to the
undersigned if an emergency rabies situation such as the one
encountered in Bali (and during 2000 in Flores, as described by Prof
Wilde; see also referenced postings) can be addressed without
(controlled) culling, within a given geographic terraine and during
the acute phase of the outbreak, namely when the number (and,
obviously, the identity) of exposed, incubating dogs in not known --
with the potential consequences to human life. This, on top of the
other prescribed efforts, including vaccinations, leashing etc.

The advice by the W.H.O. experts group in 2004, saying that "data
collection needs to be continued in other areas and in countries with
different social and ecological conditions," is still valid. - Mod.AS]
