More than 3700 patients stricken with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have
visited Boston's emergency rooms during the past 6 weeks in a wave of
gastrointestinal illness that has swept cities across North America.
Federal health authorities are so concerned that they will conduct a
telephone conference call this week with disease trackers from across the
nation to gauge the impact of an outbreak attributed to norovirus
infection. [Noroviruses are] intestinal [viruses] that travel easily from
person to person.
Dr Marc-Alain Widdowson, a norovirus specialist at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, said the current outbreak of illness
appears to be the worst since 2002-2003. "But the bottom line is we don't
really know why," said Widdowson, who speculated that the virus currently
circulating may be a different strain, one that is more easily transmitted
or one that spawns more severe symptoms.
For Dr Anita Barry, Boston's director of communicable disease control, any
lingering doubts about the breadth and severity of the outbreak were erased
when she saw figures delineating ER visits on Christmas [day] -- a day when
patients do almost anything to avoid a trip to the hospital. On that day,
73 patients with gastrointestinal woes turned up in Boston's 10 emergency
rooms. "If people are coming to the emergency room on Christmas Day," Barry
said, "that suggests to me this illness is more severe than your routine
gastrointestinal illness."
Day by day, the Boston Public Health Commission has been tracking the march
of the intestinal infection, using a surveillance network that monitors
patients' ailments in emergency rooms. It creates something akin to a daily
Dow Jones of disease, showing trends in infectious illnesses and other
medical conditions. The network, activated shortly before the Democratic
National Convention in 2004, acts as an early-warning system that gives
health authorities a potentially decisive edge in their battle with
microscopic foes. The system does not provide an actual diagnosis, but it
can identify clusters of patients with similar symptoms.
"This gives us a clue earlier on that something may be up," Barry said. By
the middle of December [2006], Barry knew that the increase in ER patients
with their hands clutching their stomachs was no fluke. And while the
volume fluctuated, it was generally increasing. Health Commission
specialists know more than just how many people are coming to the ER: They
also know patients' ages and their ZIP codes. While certain neighborhoods
were hit harder than others -- Roxbury had the highest concentration of
gastrointestinal illness -- no community escaped the virus.
That was another major clue for disease specialists, and it showed them
that they needed to direct their efforts to the whole city, not just
individual communities. City health authorities said they do not know for
sure why certain neighborhoods generated more ER visits, but speculated it
could reflect everything from patients lacking primary care physicians to
some neighborhoods having greater population density, allowing the virus to
spread more swiftly.
Sophisticated, real-time disease-tracking systems had been in the works for
years, but the terrorist attacks of 11 Sep 2001, as well as the arrival of
anthrax-laden letters a month later, caused researchers to expedite
development of the networks. Initially, the tracking systems, known as
syndromic surveillance networks, were trumpeted for their potential to
detect bioterror attacks. But since dozens of public and private health
agencies activated the networks, specialists have increasingly recognized
that the first-generation systems now in operation may be better suited for
identifying large outbreaks of gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses.
"Diseases that tend to have explosive onset with a large number of cases
early on do show up quite nicely," said Dr James Nordin, a clinical
investigator at HealthPartners Research Foundation in Minnesota, which runs
a tracking system in the Twin Cities. Norovirus [infection] is one of those
diseases. And the consequences are seen in hospitals like Boston Medical
Center, where ER doctors have treated a steady stream of patients. "We have
seen a large number of cases of what appears to be a sudden onset and
intense, short-lived diarrhea, nausea, and some abdominal pain," said Dr
Jonathan Olshaker , Boston Medical's emergency department chief. "Although
if you're going through it, it doesn't seem short-lived."

[The tracking of the norovirus outbreak in Boston illustrates the potential
of the syndromic approach to detection and surveillance of certain
outbreaks of infectious disease. Readers are referred to comments posted
previously on ProMED-mail (Norovirus - USA (multistate)(02) 20070113.0183)
by a correspondent indicating that the increased norovirus activity
observed in several parts of the northern hemisphere may be associated with
emergence of a new variant of norovirus genotype GGII4 -- the genotype
responsible for most institutional outbreaks, that is evolving quite
rapidly. - Mod.CP]
