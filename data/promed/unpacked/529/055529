Fatal trypanosomiais in a Dutch patient infected in Tanzania
---------------------------------------------------------
As promised the details on the 3rd Dutch patient (which I received
from my colleague Dr C.Richter, Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem).
It concerns a female patient (born 1948) who made a trip with her
husband in a group of 18 people through Africa. They went to West &
Central Africa, could not pass through DR Congo and flew to Nairobi.
Then by truck to Serengeti (29 Jan 2001, Tsetse flies +++), Lake
Manyara, Ngorongoro crater, again Serengeti 1&2 Mar 2001). On 10 Mar
2001 she got fever, headache and difficulty in sleeping at night. On
12 Mar 2001 she saw a doctor in North Malawi and got anti-malaria
treatment. As she kept on being ill, she visited a Dutch private
practitioner in Lilongwe (Central Malawi), who made the diagnosis of
trypanosomiasis. She then was flown to South Africa (Pretoria), where
the diagnosis was confirmed.
Treatment with Suramin was started with initially good response. On 20
Mar 2001, a LP was done, which showed Trypanosomes, and treatment with
melarsoprol was started (which first had to come from CDC). Three
courses (3 doses with 4 day interval) were given, with [good
results. After 1 week (7 May 2001) ill again (nausea, vomiting,
headache; LP showed signs of ongoing trypanosomiasis); 2 other courses
of melarsoprol were administered. Then neurological deterioration
began and on 24 May 2001, 5 days after the last course, she became
completely paralysed, went into coma and had to be ventilated
artificially. Repatriated by medevac on 11 Jun 2001 to the main
hospital of her hometown [in the Nethelands, she died on 21 Jun 2001.
MRI's in South Africa and here (twice, on admission and day before
death) were done; results to follow.
So, she developed East African trypanosomiasis, most likely in the
Serengeti.
