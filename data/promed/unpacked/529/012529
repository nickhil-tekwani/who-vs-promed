Canadian health officials today [4 Dec 2014] confirmed highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu in 2 of the 4 H5-related poultry outbreaks in British Columbia's Fraser Valley near Vancouver, one of several evolving stories on avian flu outbreaks around the world.

Harpreet Kochhar, DVM, PhD, Canada's chief veterinary officer, said in a press briefing today [4 Dec 2014] that test results on turkeys at a farm in Abbotsford and on chickens at a farm in Chilliwack confirmed highly pathogenic H5N2. 2 other farms, also in Abbotsford and Chilliwack, that received chickens from the 1st Chilliwack farm have birds that tested positive for H5; they await confirmatory testing on the exact strain.

"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's [CFIA's] testing at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases has confirmed the strain causing the avian influenza outbreak on 2 farms in the Fraser Valley as a highly pathogenic H5N2 virus," Kochhar said.

Authorities in the Netherlands, meanwhile, have reported a 5th outbreak of H5N8 in domestic birds, while India is combatting a 3rd outbreak of H5N1 in poultry.

Confirmatory tests awaited for 2 farms
--------------------------------------
"The Province of British Columbia has informed the CFIA that preliminary test results from the 2 additional farms that were quarantined yesterday [3 Dec 2014] are presumptive positive for H5 avian influenza," Kochhar noted. "The CFIA will conduct further confirmatory testing."

The CFIA yesterday [3 Dec 2014] placed the 3rd and 4th farms under quarantine and said the agency in the coming days will cull and dispose of all birds on the affected farms. A news release yesterday from the CFIA said it will compensate farmers for lost poultry, paying CAD 20 [about USD 17.50] for a non-breeding chicken, CAD 1200 [about USD 1052.50] for a breeding chicken, CAD 70 [about USD 61.40] for a turkey, and CAD 1050 [about USD 921] for a breeding turkey.

The agency said other compensation might also be available. All farms are within about 5 miles [8 km] of each other.

Jane Pritchard, DVM, chief veterinary officer with British Columbia's Ministry of Agriculture, said at the press conference that the H5 findings in the additional farms were not surprising. "These results were expected based on the tracing of bird movement from one of the original farms," she said.

"It was great work on the ground that predicted the likelihood that these farms would be positive and led to the precautionary quarantine on farms 3 and 4. Through due diligence we were ahead of the game on this."

She added that officials have not detected other unusual losses of poultry on other Fraser Valley farms or signs of avian flu in birds. CFIA and British Columbia authorities are going from farm to farm to monitor for further outbreaks.

Pritchard said the disease is unlikely to go undetected because of its impact on birds. "We think that it's about a 3- to 5-day incubation period. And we also know that if it hits, the [poultry] producer isn't going to miss it."

In a report posted by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) yesterday [3 Dec 2014 -- see ProMED-mail archive no 20141204.3011429], officials specified that the outbreak at the initially affected farm in Chilliwack was restricted to 1 of 3 barns. In the affected barn, all 700 of the 24-week-old chickens died from H5N2.

One adjacent unaffected barn contains 47-week-old chickens, while the other contains 1-week-old pullets. The farm housed 7000 poultry before the outbreak.

Pritchard said that at the Abbotsford turkey farm, the "vast majority" of 11 000 turkeys died from H5N2. The remainder in the barn will be culled, as will flocks of about 3000 and 14 000 in other barns, she added.

Signs of mutation
-----------------
Canada has experienced low-pathogenic H5N2 outbreaks in British Columbia in 2005 and 2009 and in Manitoba in 2010, but this appears to be the 1st outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N2 in the country.

In response to a question, Kochhar said the change "is reflective that these viruses are actively mutating." He said the high-path designation means the virus is both highly contagious and produces high mortality in domestic birds.

When asked if the outbreak is showing signs of being contained, Kochhar said it's still in its early stages. Pritchard added, "Our intention is to come out of this quickly and get back to normal as soon as possible."
