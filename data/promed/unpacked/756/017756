Resurgence of Trypanosomiasis in Africa and lack of effective treatment
---------------------------------------------------------
Human African trypanosomiasis, the fatal neurological disease better known
as sleeping sickness, was thought to be nearly eradicated by 1965 as a
result of a sophisticated multinational diagnosis and treatment effort
undertaken over a period of decades. But because of population
displacement, political instability and collapse of health systems caused
by civil wars, there has been a resurgence of this disease. The current
epidemic affects people living in 36 Sub-Saharan countries, 22 of which are
among the poorest in the world, including southern Sudan, northern Uganda,
the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola. Of the 60 million people
currently at risk for contracting sleeping sickness, only four million have
access to diagnosis and treatment.
The alarming resurgence of sleeping sickness - 300,000 new cases each year
according to the WHO - and rising levels of resistance to older treatments,
demand a quick reaction from the international community. The market has
failed in the case of sleeping sickness, and solutions will not likely come
from private industry.
As international efforts are expanding to address this rising epidemic,
there is a serious limiting factor: the lack of accessible, effective
medicines. Older drugs that have been used for decades have become less
effective because of growing resistance or have been abandoned by their
producers because they are not profitable. The newer treatments are either
priced beyond the means of patients or are not available because their
producers have not found them profitable and have abandoned their production.
Supply of first-line treatment
--------------------------------
Suramine sodium, used for the treatment of early stage of _Trypanosoma
brucei rhodesiense_ (one of the two forms of sleeping sickness) has been on
the verge of being abandoned by its producer on several occasions. Each
time the international health community has been forced to intervene and
assure the producer of minimum sales. Long-term production is still uncertain.
The price of pentamidine, a treatment that is used for early stage
_Trypanosoma brucei gambiense_ rose by ten-fold when it was reformulated
for use against the AIDS infection _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia (PCP).
The WHO negotiated a donation with the producer, under condition it would
be used only for sleeping sickness patients. But the agreement has recently
been revised and the price will be going up in phases from zero to the
market rate by the end of a four year period.
Second-line treatment; fatal combination of factors
---------------------------------------------------
Melarsoprol (Arsobal®), an arsenic derivative developed in 1949, is still
the medicine used to treat advanced stage disease. The sustained production
of this drug is uncertain for commercial reasons. Melarsoprol can produce
serious side-effects, such as encephalopathy, which leads to death. Various
studies indicate that between 3 and 10% of patients treated with this drug
die from side-effects.
More significantly, melarsoprol treatment failures, due to resistance, have
been increasing in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo Sudan and
Uganda. According to an MSF Ugandan study with 428 patients, melarsoprol
treatment failure rates are as high as 26.9% .
Currently the only proven alternative for _T. brucei gambiense_ patients
that fail melarsoprol is eflornithine or DFMO (Ornidyl®). This drug, which
has fewer side-effects than melarsoprol, received regulatory approval in
1990 but was abandoned by its producer, Hoechst Marion Roussel (now
Aventis), in the mid-nineties due to low profitability. In the last few
years use of this drug has had to be rationed; stocks were reserved for the
most difficult cases and in the summer of 1999 the last stock of
eflornithine expired.
Aventis, the WHO and MSF have arranged for the last batch of unprocessed
eflornithine material to be readied for use. 10 000 vials of drug have been
available since the beginning of Jun 2000. This is the last batch that
Aventis will be directly involved in processing. Thus it remains imperative
that a long-term supplier be found.

[Sleeping sickness, African trypanosomiasis, is a serious protozoan
infection of the central nervous system transmitted by the tsetse fly. The
report by MSF shows the well known fact that control of infectious diseases
breaks down in areas with war and civil unrest, and it is not surprising
that sleeping sickness increases in places like Northern Uganda, DR Congo,
and Angola. Of more concern is the emergence of highly resistant
trypanosomiasis and the unavailability of drugs for treatment. - Mod.EP
