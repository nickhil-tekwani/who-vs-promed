Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has claimed more lives and infected more people over the current [Iranian calendar] year (began on 21 Mar 2022), compared to the past 2 years.

Over the past 7 months, 78 people have been diagnosed with the disease, 9 of whom lost their lives, IRNA [Islamic Republic News Agency] quoted Behzad Amiri, director of the zoonotic diseases management office at the Ministry of Health, as saying on Tuesday [15 Nov 2022].

This year [2022], the number of deaths and cases increased in the country compared to the last 2 years, he further lamented.

Last year [March 2021-March 2022], 13 persons were diagnosed with Crimean-Congo fever in the country, of whom 2 died, and a year before that, Crimean-Congo fever infected 40 people and claimed 5 lives.

According to the World Health Organization, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks.

The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

CCHF outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40 percent. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, West Asia, and East Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

From the study by Nili et al (https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09989-4): "CCHF is now endemic in Africa, Central Asia, Russia, China, and the Balkans; and its incidence is rising rapidly in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Iran is one of the endemic countries and has a high incidence of CCHF."

The study showed that "the incidence of CCHF in Iran follows a seasonal pattern and its incidence is related to some meteorological variables," which in turn impact the tick populations that serve as CCHF vectors. "Changes in agricultural land and landscape alteration following climate change may also influence the survival and reproduction of ticks and may trigger disease outbreaks.

"According to ecological models ran by the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMR), increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall will expand the suitable habitat for _Hyalomma_ ticks and will subsequently increase CCHF."

The increased number of CCHF cases and deaths reported in 2022 indicates that the incidence of the disease could be on the increase due to some of these factors.

"Human cases of CCHF are mainly treated with general supportive care. The antiviral drug ribavirin, both oral and intravenous formulations, has been used to treat CCHF infection. However, no evidence from randomized clinical trials has demonstrated the effectiveness of ribavirin for treating CCHF. There is currently no vaccine available for either people or animals."
