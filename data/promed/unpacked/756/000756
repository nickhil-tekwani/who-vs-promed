1 person has died and at least 20 others were hospitalized after an outbreak of botulism following a potluck dinner at a church in central Ohio. All of the patients attended a potluck on Sunday, 19 Apr 2015, at Cross Pointe Free Will Baptist Church in Lancaster, about 30 miles south east of Columbus. Up to 60 people ate at the event. 5 patients are in critical condition and 10 were taken to hospitals in Columbus, according to Fairfield Medical Center in Lancaster.

Antitoxin is on the way from the CDC in Atlanta. "It is being sent in as quickly as we can get it," said Dr Andrew Murry with the medical center.

Botulism can be fatal, with symptoms typically beginning within 36 hours of consuming contaminated food. The infection can result in paralysis, double vision, difficulty swallowing and respiratory failure, "In this day and age botulism from food is fairly rare; generally it's canned foods," Murry said. "The fatality rate is usually fairly low."

And it is not contagious. "It is not a threat to our patients, visitors or staff or the community at large," Murry said.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding this relatively large outbreak. In a potluck dinner where everyone brings a different dish, there will be lots of potential reservoirs to investigate. Home-canned foods should be high on the list. With a case attack rate of more than 30 per cent, a food diary could be useful in knowing which foods the affected individuals consumed. - Mod.LL
