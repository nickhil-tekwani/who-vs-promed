The Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) [Pennsylvania] today [19 Nov 2014] reported a significant increase in syphilis this year in Allegheny County, with 98 cases reported as [of 10 Nov 2014], compared to 56 at the same time in 2013, representing a 75 percent increase in early syphilis (primary, secondary and early latent). 90 percent of the syphilis infections have occurred among men, the majority of whom are men who have sex with other men (MSM). Among the men with syphilis, 39 percent were HIV-positive.

"There has been a resurgence of syphilis in the United States since 2011, with increases noted particularly among MSM. While infections nationwide and in Allegheny County are primarily occurring among MSM, anyone engaging in risky sexual behavior is at risk," said Health Director Dr. Karen Hacker.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the bacteria _Treponema pallidum_, which is passed from person to person through direct contact during vaginal, anal or oral sex. In the early phases, infected persons may experience a sore on their genitalia or in the mouth or a rash, often on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Syphilis can also be associated with very mild symptoms or none at all. Syphilis is treatable and curable with antibiotics, and early diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications. Untreated, it can lead to long-term health complications. Syphilis may increase a person's chance of acquiring HIV. In pregnant women, syphilis can cause stillbirths, neonatal deaths and congenital malformations.

To reduce the risk of syphilis, the Health Department is urging all sexually active men and women to follow safer sexual practices -- reduce the number of sex partners, use latex condoms, and have a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has negative test results for STDs. Avoiding risky sexual behavior will reduce one's risk of becoming infected with syphilis and other STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV. Individuals who are at risk -- those having multiple sexual partners, anonymous sexual activity, and MSM -- should be screened for syphilis, HIV and other STDs.

Free screening and treatment for syphilis and other STDs are available at the Health Department's STD Clinic at 3441 Forbes Avenue, Oakland [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. For more information, call the STD Program at 412-578-8081.

[The news release above reports a 75 percent increase in early syphilis (primary, secondary and early latent) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 90 percent of which has occurred among men, the majority of whom are men who have sex with other men (MSM), and 39 percent were HIV-positive.

ProMED-mail has posted reports of the recent increases in the incidence of syphilis in many localities in the USA and in many other countries that is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and is characterized by high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf. However, we are not told of the characteristics of the outbreak in Allegheny County other than it is occurring mainly among MSM and is associated with a high incidence of HIV-coinfection.

A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV infected MSM (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

Allegheny County, with a population of approximately 1.2 million, is in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania). The city of Pittsburgh is the seat of Allegheny County and with a population of 305 841 is the 2nd-largest city in Pennsylvania (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh). The state of Pennsylvania can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2980517,3520.
