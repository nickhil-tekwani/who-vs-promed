_Allium cepa_ in New Zealand. BSPP New Disease Reports, vol. 17]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During a disease survey of _Allium_ crops in New Zealand in 2007,
characteristic diamond-shaped lesions, suggestive of _Iris yellow
spot virus_ (IYSV; genus _Tospovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_)
infection, were observed on a few brown onion seed plants in the
Blenheim area of the South Island (Fig. 1).

The plants with symptoms tested positive for IYSV using a DAS-ELISA
[double antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]. Total
RNA was extracted from the scape lesions and tested by RT-PCR
[reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction]. Amplicons of the
expected size were cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparisons showed
98-100 percent nucleotide identity with other IYSV N [nucleocapsid]
gene sequences in GenBank [database]. A phylogenetic analysis of the
deduced amino acid sequences of the N gene showed that the New
Zealand isolate of IYSV grouped most closely with isolates from
California and Texas, USA (Fig. 2).

Samples from a further 28 _Allium_ crops (100 plants per crop) and 4
ornamental _Allium_ species (one plant of each: _A. senescens_, _A.
murryanum_, _A. caesium_ and _A. moly_), collected around New
Zealand, were tested for IYSV by ELISA. The results showed that IYSV
was widespread in onion (10 of 12 crops) and shallot (3 out of 3
crops), in both the North and South Islands. However, all 13 garlic
crops tested negative. The infected crops showed a significant amount
of thrips damage, but most plants had no IYSV symptoms. Two of the
ornamental _Allium_ species (_A. senescens_ and _A. murryanum_),
which were also without symptoms, tested positive for IYSV by ELISA.
Unfortunately attempts to amplify the viral genome by RT-PCR for
sequencing were unsuccessful.

Reports of new IYSV outbreaks continue to be made from different
parts of the world and the virus is a major production constraint to
onion bulb and seed production in some countries. This is the 1st
report of IYSV in onion and shallot in New Zealand and its economic
impact on these crops in New Zealand is still to be determined.

[Ref: A Bulajic et al: First report of _Iris yellow spot virus_ on
onion (_Allium cepa_) in Serbia. Plant Dis 2008; 92(8): 1247; DOI:
10.1094/PDIS-92-8-1247A]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Iris yellow spot virus_ (IYSV; genus _Tospovirus_, family
_Bunyaviridae_) is established in several European countries (France,
Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and the UK) and its
distribution in the EU region has increased since 2002. In July 2007,
symptoms resembling those of IYSV were observed in an onion (_Allium
cepa_) seed crop in the Sirig locality in Serbia. Onion plants
exhibited characteristic symptoms of chlorotic or necrotic spindle
and diamond-shaped lesions on the leaves and scapes. Symptomatic
plants were found throughout the field and disease incidence was
estimated at 80 percent.

Leaf and scape samples were tested for the presence of IYSV and 2
other tospoviruses, _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV) and _Impatiens
necrotic spot virus_ (INSV), using commercial double-antibody
sandwich (DAS)-ELISA diagnostic kits. All samples tested negative for
TSWV and INSV. IYSV was detected serologically in 26 of 34 onion
samples. To determine an experimental host range, samples of
IYSV-infected onion plants were homogenized and host plants were
inoculated with the sap. Mechanical transmission of the virus
occurred rarely. All inoculated test plants were assayed by DAS-ELISA
and only 4 species tested positive for IYSV, but not in all
replications. Inoculated _Chenopodium quinoa_ developed local
chlorotic lesions, _Nicotiana tabacum_ cvs. Samsun and Prilep showed
mild mosaic, while infected _N. benthamiana_ were symptomless
[symptom development on these species is used as a biological assay
for virus identification - Mod.DHA]

For further confirmation of IYSV, conventional reverse transcription
(RT)-PCR was performed on extracts made from symptomatic onion leaf
material and from the ELISA-positive symptomless leaves of _N.
benthamiana_. A product of the correct predicted size (896 basepairs)
was obtained from each of the plants assayed, and one isolate was
sequenced. Analyses revealed 86 to 97 percent sequence identity with
the corresponding gene from all other IYSV [isolates]. The highest
identity (97 percent) was with leek and onion isolates from Spain.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of IYSV infection of onion
seed crop in Serbia. Thorough inspections and subsequent testing
would be needed to establish the distribution and incidence of IYSV
in Serbia.

[IYSV has only recently been confirmed as a member of the genus
_Tospovirus_ by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV). It has been included in the Alert List of the
European Plant Pathology Organisation (EPPO). Known hosts include
onion, leek, iris, amaryllis, lisianthus, and weeds including wild
relatives of onion (_Allium_ species). IYSV has been reported from a
number of locations in the Americas, Europe, Asia, South Africa, and
Australia. The economic impact is low in some areas, but up to 100
percent loss has been observed in onion crops, for example, in Brazil.

The virus is transmitted by the onion thrips, _Thrips tabaci_. Spread
of IYSV occurs with infected plant material and viruliferous
[virus-carrying] vectors.

Ornamentals and weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs since thrips
may also feed on them. The virus appears not to be seed transmitted.
_Tospovirus_ epidemiology is complex and natural resistance appears
to be rare amongst their plant hosts. Management of IYSV and its
vector includes the use of clean propagative material, cultural
practices, and pesticides.

_Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV) and _Impatiens necrotic spot
virus_ (INSV) also belong to the genus _Tospovirus_. This is an
extremely important group of plant viruses affecting a large range of
crops, and new members are being discovered frequently.
