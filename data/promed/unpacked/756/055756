A pig farm in Seelong, about 20 km from Johor Baru [in the southernmost
state of Johor has been under quarantine since Wednesday after one animal
was tested positive for the Nipah virus. Police personnel have been
mobilised to seal the farm since the infection was detected.
State executive councillor Dr Chua Soi Lek confirmed that a pig in the
4,000-animal farm was tested positive for the virus. The health and
veterinary authorities were carrying out further tests, and took 30 samples
yesterday, he added. Results are expected by Tuesday.
The quarantine was imposed after a worker fell into a coma recently, and
who is now in the intensive-care unit of the Sultanah Aminah Hospital.
The owner of the farm said several of his pigs had died earlier and he
disposed the carcasses by burning them. There are five other farms within a
10 km radius.
Johor is the fourth state to have Nipah-infested [infected pigs. The
deadly virus, which is spread to human beings through contact with infected
pigs, is believed to be responsible for the majority of the 100 human
fatalities in Negri Sembilan, Perak and Selangor.
In Kuala Lumpur, Foong Pek Yee reports that Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui
Meng had confirmed to an MP [Member of Parliament from Johor that some of
the pigs there had tested positive for Nipah [virus.
The Government has been conducting tests on pigs nationwide for the
presence of Nipah virus since April 20. Pigs in any farm would be culled
even if one animal is tested positive for the Nipah virus.
