A young woman died of septicemic meningococcal meningitis in Christchurch
Hospital, New Zealand, on 20 June 1997. The health authorities issued an
urgent warning to treat any case of fever with rash as potentially
meningitis. Symptoms of meningitis include fever, stiff neck, headache,
rash and vomiting.
This follows press reports of:
- one case of "meningitis," unspecified whether bacterial or viral, in
Canterbury the week ending 7 March 1997,
- the death of a New Zealand decathlon athlete from the disease on 17 March
1997, and the recovery of another young athlete admitted the day before that,
- a case in a female university student admitted to Wellington Hospital in
the first week of April 1997,
- a case in 10-year-old New Plymouth boy admitted to Taranaki Base Hospital
in early
April 1997
- two cases of meningococcal meningitis in Southland, Invercargill, the
week of 6 June 1997. One, a 2-year-old boy, died but it was not clear
whether meningitis was the cause of death.
In 1996, 37 people in Christchurch were reported to have suffered from the
disease, a large increase from 22 the year before. The rate of
meningococcal meningitis in New Zealand appears to be much higher than in
other developed countries, and 7 times the rate in Australia.
