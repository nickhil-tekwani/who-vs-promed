Avian influenza weekly update 735
---------------------------------
Between 27 Mar and 2 Apr 2020, one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus was reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. The case is a 3-year-old female from Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, who had a history of environmental exposure to domestic poultry before the onset of symptoms. She had mild illness and no symptoms have been detected in her contacts.

In 2020, there are 3 cases reported so far, 2 from China and one from India. A total of 30 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015.

[This is the 3rd human case of avian influenza A/H9N2 reported from China in 2020, with earlier cases reported from Hong Kong SAR and India.

H9N2 viruses are avian influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV, "low pathogenic avian influenza virus"), a subtype found worldwide in wild birds while becoming endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa.

Human H9N2 infections are generally mild and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods where other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory-confirmed human H9N2 infections with over half of those being recorded since 2015. The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children and the median age of infection was 4 years (https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/7/620/htm).

It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people be fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories.

WHO guidelines, entitled "Protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases", are available at https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275657/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2018.2-eng.pdf. - Mod.UBA]

[LPAI H9N2 viruses are found worldwide in wild birds while becoming endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa. In distinction to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, they are not OIE-notifiable. Consequently, infected countries are not liable to OIE's restrictive requirements for international trade. Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2, many countries, including China, have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry. The most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines.

Recent evidence, summarised in Ref 1, suggests LPAI H9N2 could potentially have a role in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic, either directly as an H9N2 subtype virus, or through the donation of internal genes to a pandemic virus.
