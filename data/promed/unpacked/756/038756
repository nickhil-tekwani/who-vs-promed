[There have been 5 recent human cases in Athens including hospitalizations -- see West Nile virus - Eurasia: Greece 20120714.1202042.

The location of this subclinical outbreak in horses is far from Athens, near the border with Bulgaria and located on an island. Furthermore, it is a subclinical infection but given that we now have evidence of virus activity first in humans and now in horses, careful observation and surveillance is important to track the spread and pattern of disease in Greece and the region.

Greece has reported this disease in horses on a consistent basis over the last couple of years with 27 cases reported in 2010 and 17 cases reported in 2011. Also, nearby countries such as Bulgaria, Albania, Cyprus and Macedonia have also reported West Nile over the past few years. - Mod.PC
