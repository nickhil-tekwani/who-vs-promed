[As mentioned in the previous polio update, as can be seen from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative update statistics, this year (2012) has seen wild poliovirus (WPV) activity almost exclusively in the 3 remaining countries endemic for WPV -- Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The only other documented WPV activity was seen in Chad, where there were 5 WPV type 1 cases reported, with the most recent date of onset being 14 Jun 2012.

In the update above from the Polio Eradication Initiative, there is mention about security concerns in Nigeria and Pakistan. Since the last update, there was a report of a Ghanaian doctor and his driver working on the polio eradication effort who were shot in Pakistan in mid-July [2012], followed by the fatal shooting of a health worker in the same area in greater Karachi (see http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/17/4106659/doctor-with-anti-polio-program.html and http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/9423120/Pakistan-police-to-force-polio-drops-on-children.html). This has led to temporary closure of vaccination efforts in parts of Karachi where the shootings occurred (see http://india.nydailynews.com/newsarticle/501c104fc3d4caa44c000003/world-health-organization-suspends-polio-vaccinations-in-karachi).

There were also newswire reports mentioning the identification of WPV in sewage samples taken in Karachi, suggesting there was continued circulation of WPV in the Karachi area -- this, combined with the security situation in Karachi, does not bode well for the eradication effort in the area. (see http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/08/06/polio-virus-found-karachi-sewage.html and http://tribune.com.pk/story/418085/karachi-back-to-being-a-reservoir-for-polio-as-who-discovers-virus-in-sewage-in-gadap/.)
