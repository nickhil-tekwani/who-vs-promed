The following announcement appears in the just-issued March issue (No
20) of the MAFF BSE Enforcement Bulletin.

SIX NEW MEMBERS JOIN BSE ADVISORY COMMITTEE
Six new members have joined the independent committee that advises the
Government on BSE.
A review of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC),
published in August 1997, recommended that its membership should be
widened to include an expert from the Institute for Animal Health and
a representative of the public interest. The new members were
announced jointly by Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham, Secretary
of State for Health Frank Dobson, and the Secretaries of State for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on 24 February 1998.
The new members are:
Professor Adriano Aguzzi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Professor Aguzzi is acting head of the Institute of Neuropathology at
the University of Zurich; a clinician who now specialises in
neurodegenerative disease research, including prion diseases.
Professor Roy Anderson FRS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Professor Anderson is Head of Zoology at the University of Oxford. He
has been involved in epidemiological studies of the BSE epidemic for
some years and has served on both epidemiology sub-groups of SEAC
(1996-7 and 1997-8).
Professor Anne Ferguson
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Professor Ferguson works at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh.
She advised SEAC in March 1996 on issues related to children and other
special interest groups after the announcement of a probable link
between BSE and new variant CJD. She has been President of the
Society for Mucosal Immunology since 1996 and was a member of the
Committee on Toxicity, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines and
the Scottish Biomedical Research committee. She is currently a member
of the Committee on Food Intolerance.
Dr Peter Goodfellow FRS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dr Goodfellow is a Senior Vice-President, Biopharmaceutical Research &
Development, at SmithKline-Beecham Pharmaceuticals. He was previously
Professor of Genetics at Cambridge University. He was a member of the
first SEAC epidemiology sub-group.
Mrs Harriet Kimbell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Representative of the public interest)
Mrs Kimbell is a Principal Lecturer at the Guildford College of Law
specialising in consumer law, civil litigation, personal injury,
medical negligence and legal ethics. She is a Deputy Chairman of the
Consumers' Association and their nominee on MAFF's Consumer Panel.
Mrs Kimbell was a member of the Polkinghorne Committee on the Ethics
of Genetic Modification and Food Use and the Banner Committee on the
Ethics of Novel Breeding Techniques and Farm Animals.
Dr Christopher Bostock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Representative of the Institute for Animal health)
Doctor Bostock is the recently appointed Director of the Institute.
He has led the ISE research work of the IAH for many years and has
advised SEAC in the past,
Dr Cunningham also announced that Professor Sir John Pattison's
Chairmanship of SEAC was being extended by a further three years, and
that Dr Robert Will has been asked to remain Deputy Chairman for a
similar term.
The other existing members of SEAC are
Professor Jeffrey W Almond - Virologist and Professor of Microbiology
at the University of Reading.
Mr Ray Bradley CBE - Veterinary Pathologist and Chairman of the BSE
sub-group of the EC Scientific Veterinary Committee.
Professor Fred Brown FRS - Virologist and Chemist - Formerly Deputy
Director (Scientific) of the Animal Virus Research Institute (now
known as the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,
Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright). Currently employed by the
United States Department of Agriculture.
Professor John Collinge - Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics,
Neurogenetics Unit incorporating the Prion Disease Group, Imperial
College School of Medicine; Honorary Consultant Neurologist at St.
Mary's Hospital and the National Hospital for Neurology and
Neurosurgery, London.
Professor William D Hueston - Veterinary Epidemiologist and Professor
of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Maryland, USA.
Dr Richard H Kimberlin OBE - Independent Consultant on Scrapie and
Related Diseases; Former Director of the Institute for Animal Health,
Neuropathogenesis Unit, Edinburgh.
Dr Michael Painter - Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, City
of Manchester.
Dr David B Pepper - Private Veterinary Surgeon.
Professor Peter G Smith - Epidemiologist, Head of Department of
Communicable and Tropical Disease Epidemiology, London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Dr William A Watson - Former Director of the Central Veterinary
Laboratory.
The review recommended that SEAC meetings should also be attended by:
A technical adviser from the Central Veterinary Laboratory of MAFF's
Veterinary Laboratories Agency;
An observer from the Health and Safety Executive; and
An observer from the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE)
Research and Development Funders' Co-ordination Group, which
represents the major funders of TSE research.
Other recommendations include:
Membership of the Committee should be kept under review to ensure it
includes expertise in relevant fields.
Appointments to the Committee should be made on a fixed term basis,
usually for three years, with Members normally being asked to serve a
maximum of two terms. All the new appointments have been made on this
basis.
Appointments to the Committee made before December 1995 were not time
limited. It was recommended that existing Members not already on
fixed term appointments should be formally appointed on a fixed term
basis, with the possibility of extension in individual cases. This has
been done.
SEAC's annual report will be published later this year. Details of
how SEAC will work with the new Food Standards Agency will be
announced in due course.
