Wet weather brings on macadamia disease
---------------------------------------
A fungal disease is threatening Queensland's macadamia plants. Husk
spot causes nuts to fall off the tree prematurely costing the
Australian macadamia industry about AUD 8 million [about USD 8.5
million] every year.

Agronomist Jack Milbank says the extremely wet conditions earlier this
year [2011] have lead to the outbreak.

"The condition is exacerbated by extensive wet weather and a hang over
of spores," he said. "If not controlled appropriately, they can have a
very significant impact on the marketable yield."

[Husk spot of macadamia is caused by the fungus _Pseudocercospora
macadamiae_, which was first described in 2003 from commercially grown
_Macadamia integrifolia_ in Queensland. So far, it has only been
reported from Australia where it is considered the most important
disease affecting the macadamia industry. Symptoms include necrotic
spots and scarifications on husks, premature nut drop, poor kernel
quality, and heavy yield losses of up to 40 percent. Disease
susceptibility of the host is increased by humid conditions.

The fungus is likely to be spread via infected plant material (as
mentioned above), mechanical means (including human and insect
activities), wind, and rain. Disease management may include fungicide
applications from early fruit set onwards as well as cultural
techniques to reduce inoculum (orchard sanitation) and risk of spread
(for example during harvest). Commercial crop varieties with reduced
susceptibility have been developed.

Other species in the genus cause leaf spot diseases on a range of
hosts, for example avocado, olive, and grapevine.
