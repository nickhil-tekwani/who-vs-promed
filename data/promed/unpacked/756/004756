BSE screening in Japan, Re: BSE - Japan 20030119.0181
--------------------------------------------------
The following information is derived from the table "Screening of BSE -
Weekly Report", covering the period 8 Oct 2001 - 11 Jan 2003, published by
the Inspection and Safety Division, Department of Food Safety,
Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau at the Ministry of Health, Labour,
and Welfare (MHLW): <http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/0110/h1018-6.html>
Additional comments are based upon other publications of MHLW, namely the
Manual of the screening test:
<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/0110/dl/h1016-6a.pdf> and
<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/2001/0112/tp1213-1a.html>
(with illustrating photographs).
(All the said documents are in Japanese).
1. The initial screening by ELISA tests (Bio-Rad) is carried out at each of
the 47 prefectures in Japan, in one or few Food Safety Inspection
facilities. Positives are followed by a second similar test. Samples found
positive on the second screening test are forwarded to central laboratories
for final confirmation.
2. The table includes 4 columns (groups):
a. Suspect cases -- cattle over 24 months old that showed, on initial
inspection at abattoirs, motor, sensory, reflex, or consciousness defect or
whole body symptoms.
b. Over 30 months -- the EU terminology is "Healthy animals".
c. Others -- younger animals.
d. Total.
3. The results in each of the said columns are divided into 3 categories:
positive, negative, and pending.
4. The total results for the said categories in each group, for the entire
reviewed/reported period, are as follows:
a. Suspect cases: 4022, of which 2 cases (in May and August 2002) were
positive.
b. Over 30 months: 633 297, of which 39 were found positive on the initial
screening ; from those, 2 cases have been finally confirmed as positive,
both in November 2001.
c. Others: 892 408, of which 58 have been found positive on initial
screening, but none confirmed on the final test.
d. Total: 1 529 727, of which 99 found positive within the initial
screening tests, but only 4 finally confirmed.
No pending cases are reported in any of the groups at the time of reporting.

[ProMED-mail is most grateful to Dr Jun-ichi Ohnishi for his efforts in
obtaining and translating these data, which were requested in our previous
posting. He has also kindly extended his help by obtaining the following
data from the website of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries (MAFF) summarizing the BSE-surveillance measures undertaken under
the guidance of MAFF from 2 April 2001 to 20 Dec 2002, with a total number
of 3752 animals examined throughout the said period:
<http://www.maff.go.jp/work/20020405press_x2.pdf>
MAFF began an initial surveillance to check for BSE in Japan on 2 April
2001; from that date until 17 Oct 2001, 391 animals were examined,
including the first positive case in Japan (a downer cow, slaughtered 18
Aug 2001, confirmed 10 Sep 2001).
Following the confirmation of the first BSE case, a second phase was
initiated on 18 Oct 2001. Until 20 Dec 2002, MAFF tested 3361 cases. They
are classified into the following 4 animal categories:
1). "BSE eradication" (cohorts and offspring of positive cases):
a. Animals which lived during their first year on the same farm with a
BSE-positive case.
b. Animals born on the same farm within 24 months of the birth of the
positive case.
c. Offsprings of the positive cases.
The said animals were quarantined, killed (emergency cull), and examined.
Total number for the said period: 253.
2. Suspect animals (declined at the abattoirs or showed symptoms on farms).
Total number for the said period: 11 (all declined at the abattoirs).
3. Fallen animals in the farms or culled ones older than 24 months. Total
number for the said period: 2956, of which 398 showed CNS symptoms [in
farms] and 34 "were picked up at abattoirs (other than BSE suspect)".
4. Others (detail not given): 141.
Obviously, the Japanese authorities have demonstrated a major effort in
their BSE surveillance and control activities since its initial detection
in Japan. The figures regarding animals tested at the abattoirs are
impressive, compared to EU figures; it seems that the main target of the
Japanese programme was to reassure the consumer about the safety of beef.
This might explain the unusual inclusion of large numbers (almost 60
percent of all animals tested in slaughterhouses!) of young animals in the
testing programme, in spite of the fact that European experience has shown
that no BSE cases are expected in such animals. On the other hand, the
number of tests in "Risk animals" (dead-on-farm and emergency-slaughtered
animals), seems to be insufficient. In the 15 EU countries, during 2002, a
total of 7.5 million "healthy animals" (older than 30 months) were tested,
demonstrating a BSE-incidence rate of 1:32 000, compared to 1.03 million
tested "risk animals" with a BSE-incidence rate of 1:1100. Readers may
refer to Dr Ozawa's remark on this issue in item [3] "BSE in Japan - a year
after first case", BSE update (10), September 2002. - Mod.AS]
