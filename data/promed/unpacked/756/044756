The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed on Sunday [22 Apr 2012] that 3 poultry workers and officials working in animal quarantine have tested positive for antibodies for the H5N2 strain of avian influenza. However, all 3 people are healthy and none has developed any flu symptoms, CDC deputy director general Chou Jih-haw said, adding that there is no public health risk of human-to-human transmission.

Chou noted that they might be in contact with the H5N2 strain of the virus but he said the antibodies could also be a result of cross-reactivity because all 3 received flu vaccinations last year [2011] and all had received H5N1 vaccination in March or April [2012].

Taiwan confirmed the 1st outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza on 3 Mar 2012 after chicken farms in Changhua and Nantou counties, as well as in Tainan, reported avian flu outbreaks. Over 75 000 chickens have been culled as a result of the outbreaks.

CDC confirms positive test for H5N2 antibodies
----------------------------------------------
Three poultry workers tested positive for H5N2 antibodies; workers did not have flu-like symptoms; cross reaction following H5N1 influenza vaccination could not be excluded.

Following the recent H5N2 avian influenza outbreak in 5 poultry farms, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) tested 141 poultry workers and animal quarantine personnel. All 141 persons' throat swabs were negative for viruses, but 3 persons tested positive for antibodies. Investigations showed that, to date, none had influenza-like symptoms.

All 3 persons testing positive for [H5N2] antibodies received seasonal influenza vaccine last year (2011) and 2 doses of a human avian influenza H5N1 vaccine in March and April 2012. Therefore, these 3 asymptomatic healthy persons with positive antibodies might have cross reactivity caused by seasonal [human] or avian influenza vaccination.

South Africa and Japan investigated poultry contacts following outbreaks in 2004 and 2005-2006, respectively. They also found that some people had antibodies to H5N2. None of these people had influenza-like symptoms. Furthermore, literature review did show that seasonal and avian influenza H5N1 vaccinations may result in positive tests of H5N2 antibodies.

Taiwan CDC urges poultry workers to use personal protective gear to prevent being infected by avian influenza. The public should avoid unnecessary contact with poultry, wash hands, and eat fully cooked poultry and egg products.

[Since these poultry workers had been vaccinated with a human H5N1 influenza virus vaccine and the 2011 seasonal human influenza virus vaccine it is not surprising that they tested positive to influenza virus H5 and N2 antibodies. Qualitative data alone are not sufficient to discriminate between cross-infection from diseased poultry and immune responses to human vaccine components. However, these data are consistent with similar investigations in Bangladesh and mainland China, reported by ProMED-mail, that none of the putatively avian virus (H5N1 or H5N2) infected poultry workers developed symptoms of influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP
