197 cases of cholera reported in Delhi in 2 months
-----------------------------------------------
While meningococcemia is on the way out, cholera is making its presence
felt in the capital, with as many as 197 cases reported in the capital in
the last 2 months. According to statistics provided by the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (MCD), 197 cases of cholera have been reported between
4 Apr and 28 May 2005. While the total number of cholera cases this year so
far stands at 211, no deaths have been reported due to the disease.
However, the number of cholera cases in 2005 is very low compared to the
same time in 2004. As many as 640 cases of cholera were reported in 2004 in
the 2 months of April and May. The total number of cholera cases in 2004
was 1784. In 2003, 1528 cases of cholera were reported. MCD officials,
meanwhile, said they have taken a number of steps to prevent cholera, which
include testing of water samples by the Health Department to check the
amount of chlorine and distributing chlorine tablets in areas where Delhi
Jal Board is not supplying water.

Cholera turns drug resistant?
-----------------------------
A new drug-resistant variety of cholera has possibly surfaced this year
[2005], say doctors at the Infectious Diseases Hospital. "More and more
cases are being caused by a particular strain known as _Vibrio cholerae_
O139. This strain is tougher to beat [more resistant to antimicrobials -
Mod.LL] than _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, which we are more used to dealing with,"
said Dr. P. Maitra, the principal. To learn more about the bacterial
strain, the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases is
conducting its research in collaboration with ID Hospital.
"NICED is analyzing samples from nearly every 5th diarrhea patient admitted
here," said Maitra. With the summer at its peak, diarrhea is on the rise in
many parts of the city. On an average, about 60 cases are treated daily at
ID Hospital. The authorities are keeping an eye on certain areas identified
as susceptible to the disease. "We keep track of the number of cases
reported from Tiljala, Benia Pukur, Narkeldanga, Beliaghata, Phoolbagan and
Metiabruz. These are the areas where the disease is most prevalent," said
Maitra. According to the superintendent, Dr. Behera: "While on an average,
we get about 60 cases of diarrhea every day, the number goes up sharply on
many days. On 23 May 2005, we treated 92 patients from Rajarhat who fell
ill after partaking of some prasad." Diarrhea is caused either by a
temporary infection, or a chronic problem like an intestinal disease. The
usual culprits are bacteria, like Salmonella, _Escherichia coli_, Shigella
and Campylobacter, or viruses like Rotavirus and Norwalk virus.

Water Plant Strike Sparks Cholera Outbreak
-------------
A strike at a water-purification facility in eastern Congo has caused an
outbreak of cholera, resulting in hundreds of infections that have killed
at least 4 people, a health official said. The outbreak in this lakeside
town occurred after 55 employees at a government-run purification plant in
Goma went on strike because they had not been paid on more than a year,
said Dr. Guy Mutombo Ndongala, chief epidemiologist of the North Kivu
province. The strike shutdown the plant, forcing many of Goma's 500 000
people to draw drinking water from Lake Kivu, a source of waterborne diseases.
The cholera outbreak has killed 4 people in the past two weeks and infected
over 200, he said Thursday [2 Jun 2005]. The water company said it had not
paid the workers because it had gone broke after most of its facilities
were destroyed in the aftermath of a volcanic eruption in January
2002. Eastern Congo has been ravaged by war for nearly a decade, after
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda invaded the country in 1996 and 1998. A
transitional government was set up in 2003 at the end of the war, but it
has had little influence over the lawless east.
