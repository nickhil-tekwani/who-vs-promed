Summary
An outbreak of pharyngoconjunctival fever affecting 59 children was
detected in a municipality of northern Spain in July 2008. The
outbreak was related to insufficient doses of water disinfectant in
the municipal swimming pool. Adenovirus was detected in the
pharyngeal swabs of 5 of 6 affected children, and the 4 strains that
were sequenced were all adenovirus type 4.

Introduction
Pharyngoconjunctival fever can be caused by both picornaviruses and
adenoviruses. The latter are divided into 6 species (A-F) with 51
known serotypes to date [1]. Humans are the reservoir for this virus,
and although frequently asymptomatic, adenovirus infections can
affect the upper and lower respiratory tract and the eye and can also
cause gastroenteritis and cystitis. In addition, adenoviruses are
excreted in the respiratory and intestinal mucosa, in the latter
sometimes for prolonged periods of time. The incubation time varies
from 2 to 14 days, and transmission occurs through respiratory
secretions, person-to-person contact, aerosolised viruses and
fomites, as well as the fecal-oral route.

Although the 1st recorded outbreaks of pharyngoconjunctival fever
associated with adenovirus transmission in a swimming pool were
reported more than 50 years ago [2], this type of outbreak has been
reported only rarely in the past few decades [3-5]. On 3 Jul 2008,
the Epidemiological Surveillance Service of Gipuzkoa was notified of
an unusually high number of children with fever, pharyngitis and/or
conjunctivitis who had consulted the pediatrician at the health
centre of a municipality in the Goierri region. The present study
describes the epidemiological, environmental and virological
investigations that were performed to study this outbreak and the
control measures established.

Methods
Cases were defined as all individuals under the age of 15 years
consulting the health centre of the affected town between 15 Jun and
11 Aug 2008 with conjunctivitis and/or pharyngitis with enlarged
cervical lymph nodes. According to the census from 2006, the town had
9141 inhabitants of whom 1347 were under 15 years old. The possible
occurrence of cases of pharyngoconjunctival fever in the neighbouring
towns and a referral hospital was monitored. Affected patients were
interviewed in order to record the following variables: place of
residence, age, sex, date of symptom onset, symptoms, presence of
complications, swimming pool use and other potential exposures. For
each clinical picture, (pharyngoconjunctivitis, pharyngitis without
conjunctivitis, and conjunctivitis without pharyngitis), 2 cases were
studied in order to identify viral etiology, using pharyngeal swabs
with viral transport medium (ViralPack, Biomedics, Spain). For
adenovirus detection, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
method was used that amplified a fragment of the hexon gene [6], and
the amplicons obtained were sequenced to characterise the adenovirus
type. The pH value and the concentration of disinfectant in the water
of the 4 basins of the public swimming pool were determined (Test
Cloro and pH 1.11174.0001, Merck, Germany); the automatic pH
regulation and disinfectant dosing pump system was inspected, and the
incident log book was reviewed. Disinfection was performed through
bromination in the small inner children's pool and through
chlorination in the remaining pools.

Results
Between 16 Jun and 11 Aug 2008, 59 children were diagnosed with
pharyngoconjunctival fever and met the case definition. 43 of the
children (73 percent) had recently used the municipal swimming pool,
which was considered the source of infection (primary cases). 15 (25
percent) of the children had been in close contact with a primary
case (secondary cases). The very 1st case that occurred had not
visited the swimming pool and was therefore considered sporadic. The
epidemic curve confirmed an outbreak with an epidemic pattern
characterised by an accumulation of primary cases, consistent with
the hypothesis of a persistent common source, and more isolated
secondary cases, resulting from person-to-person transmission mainly
in a family environment.

All affected infants and children lived in the area where the
swimming pool is situated. They were 34 (58 percent) boys and 25 (42
percent) girls. Ten percent of affected individuals were under the
age of one year, 29 percent were between one and 4 years old, 59
percent between 5 and 13 years old and one case was 14 years old (2
percent). It must be noted that the case definition only included
children under the age of 15 years; an estimation of the secondary
attack rate among older children and adults in the families or
contacts was therefore not possible. 43 percent had fever,
pharyngitis and conjunctivitis; 29 percent had fever and pharyngitis,
and 28 percent had conjunctivitis with or without fever. All affected
children were diagnosed by pediatricians, and 3 required a
consultation with an ophthalmologist due to keratoconjunctivitis.
There were no hospitalisations, and all cases received symptomatic
treatment. Adenovirus was detected in 5 of the 6 pharyngeal swabs
collected (2 children with pharyngitis, one with conjunctivitis and 2
with pharyngitis and conjunctivitis), and the virus was identified as
adenovirus type 4 in the 4 amplicons that were sequenced.

After the swimming pool opened (on 7 Jun 2008) for the summer season,
there were numerous electrical system failures causing intermittent
failure of the water circulation and bromine dosing pumps. The
disinfectant concentrations registered on 3 Jul 2008 (the day the
outbreak was reported) were insufficient in the small children's pool
(0.45 mg/ l of total bromine) and were adequate in the remaining
pools. On the same day, swimming in the small pool was forbidden.
Once the disinfection system was repaired and normal disinfection
concentrations (bromine and pH) were confirmed, swimming was again
permitted.

Discussion
Swimming pool-related outbreaks of viral infection are highly
uncommon. The most frequently involved viruses are adenovirus,
norovirus, hepatitis A virus and echovirus, in this order [7]. The
outbreak reported in the present study was due to an adenovirus type
4, most probably transmitted through the water of the inner
children's pool. The abrupt onset of this outbreak generated a
certain alarm in the health sector and in the population, but after
the system breakdown was repaired and control measures were
established, the incidence of infection decreased sharply. Due to
logistic problems, no water samples were taken from the swimming pool
for virological analysis, which would have allowed the etiology of
the outbreak to be unequivocally confirmed.

Adenoviruses are non-enveloped viruses, unusually resistant to
physical and chemical agents, which gives them prolonged survival
capacity [1]. Recently, these viruses have been observed to be
prevalent in rivers, coastal water, swimming pools and water supplies
worldwide [8,9]. Adenoviruses have also been detected in swimming
pool water in the context of outbreaks of pharyngoconjunctival fever
[3,4,10]. Transmission of this virus can occur both through intake of
swimming pool water or through direct contact between the water and
the conjunctival mucosa or upper respiratory tract [9]. The clinical
presentation of cases in this outbreak was consistent with
pharyngoconjunctival fever, as reported in other swimming
pool-related outbreaks of non-enteric adenovirus infection
[2-5,10-12]. Adenovirus type 3 has been most frequently found in
these outbreaks [2,3,5,11,12], and to a lesser extent, type 7 [13,14]
and type 4 [10]. Adenovirus type 4, the only member of human
adenovirus species E, is one of the major causes of adenoviral
conjunctivitis and the type considered to be responsible for the
outbreak reported here. Clinical manifestation of this virus type
varies, ranging from pharyngoconjunctival fever to
keratoconjunctivitis, unlike conjunctivitis caused by serotypes 3 and
7, which tend to be milder [15].

It is obvious that the electrical problems at the swimming pool must
have affected the disinfectant regulation system severely. However,
the record books do not report any disinfection problem. We consider
it disputable whether the measurements between the start of the
electrical problems and the beginning of our in situ study were
performed correctly. We strongly believe that strict adherence to the
existing regulation would have avoided the outbreak.

The reports published to date would seem to indicate that swimming
pool-related outbreaks of adenovirus infection have become
exceptional in the last few decades. However, the outbreak reported
in the present study reveals that these infections continue to pose a
risk to swimming pool users when recommended control guidelines are
not strictly observed. Adequate standards of hygiene and disinfection
must be maintained in these installations to prevent transmission of
adenoviruses and other microorganisms, and early investigations could
decrease the number of cases.
