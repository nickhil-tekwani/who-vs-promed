NCDC records 74 cholera deaths, 2339 suspected cases
----------------------------------------------------
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said no fewer than 74 persons have been reportedly killed by cholera in 30 states in 2022. The latest cholera situation report by the NCDC also showed that there are a total of 2339 suspected cases of the infection as of 29 May 2022. The agency noted that of the suspected cases since the beginning of 2022, the age group 5 years is the most affected age group for males and females. It also said, of all suspected cases, 50% are males, and 50% are females.

The agency said 5 states -- Taraba (651 cases), Cross River (593 cases), Katsina (134 cases), Kano (124 cases) and Benue (100 cases) account for 68% of all cumulative cases, while 6 LGAs across 2 states --Cross River (3) and Taraba (3) reported more than 100 cases each in 2022. It added that 30 states have reported suspected cholera cases in 2022. These are Abia, Adamawa, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Borno, Cross River, Delta, Ekiti, Gombe, Imo, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Rivers, Sokoto, Taraba and Zamfara.

In the reporting month of May 2022, 8 states reported 137 suspected cases -- Anambra (2), Gombe (1), Imo (3), Kaduna (4), Kano (68), Niger (1), Plateau (22) and Taraba (36). There was a 60% decrease in the number of new suspected cases in May Epi week 18-21 (137) compared with April Epi week 13-17 (342).

In Nigeria, cholera is an endemic and seasonal disease, occurring annually mostly during the rainy season and more often in areas with poor sanitation, with the 1st series of cholera outbreaks reported between 1970 and 1990, the agency noted.

More cholera cases recorded in Bentiu IDP camp
----------------------------------------------
South Sudan and the WHO on Wednesday [22 Jun 2022], reported 34 new cases of cholera, which were confirmed in Bentiu Internally Displaced Persons Camp. The City Review confirmed this in a report titled "South Sudan Cholera Outbreak," which covered the Bentiu camp in Unity State. It partly read: "Zero new deaths reported, zero cases on admission in Bentiu IDP reported as of 19 Jun 2022; and that 212 cholera cases, including 1 death have been reported cumulatively.''

According to the weekly report, there were 34 positive cases, 15 of which were confirmed at the National Reference Laboratory in Juba. One of them died making the health authorities arrive at a 0.47% fatality rate.

According to health officials, current transmission is sporadic, but the risk of transmission in at-risk counties is very high due to population movements, the presence of IDPs, persistent flooding, and a lack of access to safe water and sanitation. "Since the sharp decrease in the number of cases during week 20, the weekly caseload has steadily increased, with 34 cases reported during week 24." The South Sudan Cholera Situation Report states that out of the total cases reported, 129 (61%) are females, while males account for 83 (39%).

"Among the female case-patients, 20-49 years is the most affected age group, accounting for 43 (33.3%), followed by 0-4 years with 32 (24. 8%). While among the male case-patients, 0-4 years is the most affected age group with 40 (48.2%) followed by 20-49 years with 14 (16.9%)."

"Overall, 72 (34.0%) of the 212 reported cases involved children aged 0 to 4 years, 177 (83.5%) of the cases are from Bentiu IDP Camp, while 35 (16.5%) are from 2 communities outside the IDP camps. Sector 5 is the most affected location, accounting for 69 (32.5%) of the reported cases," the report states.

The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization launched an oral cholera vaccination campaign earlier this month [June 2022] as part of a response strategy to avert cholera outbreaks in the designated hot spots. This comes on the heels of a recent cholera outbreak in Unity State, which has resulted in over 130 cases and 1 death. The majority of the cases reported in Unity State were confirmed inside IDP camps, which are known for overcrowding and poor hygiene. The national Ministry of Health stated the vaccination drive is part of the government's surveillance in the face of the outbreak in Unity State.

Nepal reported the 1st 2 (18- and 23-year-old females) laboratory-confirmed (stool culture) cases of _V. cholerae_ in residents of Kathmandu, who were admitted on 16 Jun 2022 to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa serotype has been isolated in an 18-year-old female patient. This isolate showed sensitivity to ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Both patients were members of the same family. Patients are undergoing treatment at this hospital. More probable (RDTs positive) cases are being admitted to this hospital, meaning more cases of _V. cholerae_ are expected in the capital, Kathmandu in the days to come.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Pun for this report. As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LL]

[4] Cholera - Pakistan (Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab)

WHO sees risk of spread of cholera from Sindh
---------------------------------------------
As the cases of cholera are on the rise in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab, the WHO has warned that the risk of its potential international spread from Sindh exists given that most affected districts are located in Karachi which is an industrial center as well as transport hub with airport and seaport.

Currently, there is no evidence of cross-border spread of the disease. However, the risk of potential international spread exists given that Pakistan has long land borders with significant cross-border movement and multiple major urban hubs, including Karachi city, with international transport hubs, WHO says in its advisory which was made available on Monday [20 Jun 2022].

In Balochistan, there is sub-optimal surveillance, limited access to safe drinking water, and limited access to health care, and affected areas are in proximity to regions with active cross-border movement with Afghanistan and Iran. In Punjab, although response activities are taking place, the province is still recording an increased number of suspected cholera cases, including in Lahore, the provincial capital and a large international commercial hub. Further spread to other provinces would worsen the situation given the frequent population movement.

Necessary control measures are being implemented by the national authorities with support from WHO and partners to contain the outbreak. However, there is a need to further strengthen surveillance by establishing systematic detection and laboratory confirmation of cholera to properly track the evolution of the outbreak and institute timely and appropriate interventions. WHO has advised the government to strengthen the disease surveillance system in the country. Surveillance for early case detection, confirmation, and response should be reinforced, according to the latest advisory.

As of 27 May 2022, 3 provinces -- Sindh, Balochistan, and Punjab -- have reported a total of 290 confirmed cases of cholera. A total of 109 samples have been tested from the public water sources (hydrants) and individual households in Karachi city as of 27 May 2022. Among these, results are available for 71 samples, of which 70% have shown presence of _Vibrio cholerae_.

In addition to Sindh province, 3 districts in Balochistan have reported 31 confirmed cases and 9 deaths while 2 districts in Punjab have reported 25 confirmed cases.

Thousands infected, 4 dead as cholera spreads in Iraqi Kurdistan
----------------------------------------------------------------
Cholera has spread across Iraq, severely hitting Sulaymaniyah province in the northern Kurdistan region, where nearly 5000 cholera cases have been recorded and at least 4 people died of the pandemic, Kurdish officials told The New Arab.

Dr Hersh Salim, deputy head of Sulaimaniyah health directorate told TNA during a brief phone call on Tuesday [21 Jun 2022], that infection cases in the province have reached "nearly 5 thousand cases, and so far 4 to 5 people died due to the outbreak."

"All over the world, cholera spreads through polluted water and unhealthy food. We have both factors, especially unhealthy mobile food providers or food delivery services that use vegetables. That's why a large number of people are affected by the disease. Currently, we have enough medical supplies to contain the outbreak," Dr Salim added.

On Sunday [19 Jun 2022], the Iraqi federal health ministry announced 13 cholera infections across Iraq, 1 case in Kirkuk, 2 cases in Muthana, and 10 cases in Sulaymaniyah. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) minister of health, Dr Saman Hussain Barzangy, on Monday [20 Jun 2022] visited Sulaimaniyah and met with the health officials.

The KRG health ministry said on its official Facebook page that the minister delivered 10 tons of medical supplies to the governorate and imposed strict health measures, including banning serving vegetables in restaurants and increasing their observation of the factories of bottled drinking water.

Authorities in Sulaimaniyah also have destroyed several vegetable farms which were irrigated with the city's sewage and also sealed off several drinking wells after tests showed their water was not drinkable. On the other hand, 4 cases of cholera have been recorded in Erbil, the capital city of the KRI.

A well-informed source told TNA on condition of anonymity that hundreds of cholera cases have been recorded among inmates in Sulaimaniyah Adult Reform Prison which is being run by the KRG ministry of labour and social affairs.

"One prisoner of Sulaimaniyah Adult Reform has died of cholera, but we do not have a specified number of infections inside our prisons, because the disease has generally spread in the Kurdistan region. The KRG Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs conducted a tour of Sulaimaniyah Adult Reform Prison and met with health officials to contain the further spread of the disease. The source of the infection is the drinking water provided by the KRG," Aryan Ahmed, the spokesperson of the KRG ministry of labour and social affairs, told TNA.

[6] Cholera, non-toxigenic - Spain (Madrid ex Toledo)
Date: Wed 22 Jun 2022

https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/ciencia/2022/06/22/detectado-toledo-primer-colera-autoctona-registrado-espana-43-anos/00031655903505890431881.htm


The Health Ministry has ruled out cholera as the contagion of a young woman who drank contaminated water in Toledo. The infection was caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_, the pathogen that causes cholera, but did not carry the toxin that triggers the disease. Technically and officially, the diagnosis is _Vibrio_ gastroenteritis, but this has not become the 1st case of autochthonous cholera to emerge in Spain for 43 years. This is the explanation offered yesterday by the Ministry after the General Director of Public Health of the Community of Madrid, Elena Andradas, announced that a 17-year-old girl from Madrid fell ill after drinking contaminated water from a well on a farm in Toledo.

"Within _Vibrio cholerae_ there are non-choleric causes of other types of illnesses that can range from mild diarrhea to other more serious complications. If we take _Vibrio cholerae_ into account, there are 2 serogroups, O1 and O139, which are the really problematic and virulent ones. They produce toxins that cause damage to the mucosa of the small intestine and this type of diarrhea", explains microbiologist Raúl Rivas.

The last outbreak of autochthonous cholera registered in Spain was in Malaga in 1979, which affected 264 people.

The infected person is a minor from the Community of Madrid, a 17-year-old girl, who had drunk water from a well located on a farm in the province of Toledo where she had attended a party. Days later, she was admitted to a hospital in Madrid after returning to her house because she presented symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea. It was at this center that she was diagnosed with the disease and the minor reported that days before she had drunk water from a plot of land in Toledo. The patient has already been discharged from hospital after being hospitalized for several days.

Now the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha is looking at the other wells on the farm to analyze their water and determine if they could be connected to each other. The farm has been sealed by the regional government, which has activated the health alert. "This is not a serious case, although the farm has been closed to ensure that there are no more risks for the population," according to health sources.

According to a report by the Carlos III Health Institute, the cases of cholera registered in Spain in recent years are imported from other countries. In 2017, Navarra reported the infection in a person from India while Cantabria reported another one in 2018.

[In almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not possess the genes for cholera toxin. Some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4). The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram-negative bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5). It has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for at least some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an animal model associated with small-bowel damage and production of proinflammatory cytokines (6). In addition, TTSS contributes to virulence even in the presence of cholera toxin and TCP [toxin coregulated pilus] (6).
