Have you bought shellfish products on line from a Port Hardy distributor lately? If you did, you better trash the stuff.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada [DFO] has issued a warning to the public not to consume various shellfish products from a private distributor in Port Hardy, due to the risk of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP or 'red tide') and botulism poisoning. Advertised products for sale include: Fresh whole butter clams and possibly other species in 40 Kg portions.

The products were for sale online through a Port Hardy Buy and Sell group page on Facebook, but may have also been distributed through other mechanisms. There is no identifying packaging or product code on these items. DFO does not know if any of the products are being made available through retail locations or restaurants.

Anyone who may have purchased or been given these products should not consume them, and discard them. Cooking will not destroy the toxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning or botulism.

The symptoms of paralytic shellfish poisoning include: tingling; numbness, spreading from lips and mouth to face, neck, and extremities; dizziness; arm and leg weakness; paralysis; respiratory failure; and possibly death. Symptoms start quickly, within 30 minutes to 3 hours. The progression and intensity of the symptoms will vary.

Botulism is a serious, often fatal form of food poisoning. The illness is due to a toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium that is found everywhere, but grows and produces botulinum toxin when foods are improperly canned. The symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness.

Constipation may occur. Symptoms generally begin 18-36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can occur as early as 6 hours or as late as 10 days afterward. Canadians have died from botulism, usually as a direct result of improper home canning.

The products were harvested from an area closed to shellfish harvesting, and were not processed at a government-approved facility. All bivalve shellfish sold in BC [British Columbia] must come from open shellfish harvesting areas and from sources that pass federal inspection. The clam products may not have been properly processed to control for botulinum toxin.

This alert is the result of an ongoing investigation by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) is currently working with DFO, Health Canada, the BC Ministry of Health, and regional health authorities to ensure the products are removed from distribution, as well as to investigate any possible cases of illness.

Currently, there have been no illnesses linked to these products. Anyone who has consumed these products and has become ill should report their illness to their local public health office and see a physician if symptoms persist or become severe. Call the 24-hour HealthLink BC Line at 8-1-1 for more information.

If you have any information, please contact the Port Hardy office at 250-949-6422, or the 24 hour toll free Observe, Record and Report (ORR) line at 1-800-465-4336.

Detailed bivalve shellfish closure information and maps are available at http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/psp and at local DFO offices. For more information contact a local DFO office, Elysha Gordon at 250-756-7192, or Jeffrey Radford at 250-756-7277.
