Chinese markets linked to some of the earliest Covid-19 cases were illegally selling a range of wildlife from which the coronavirus may have spread, according to a study published less than 2 weeks after U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a deeper probe into the pandemic's genesis.

Mink, masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, Siberian weasels, hog badgers and Chinese bamboo rats were among 38 animal species sold live at markets in Wuhan from May 2017 to November 2019, researchers said Monday [7 Jun 2021] in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports originally submitted last October [2020].

The hunt for Covid's origins has become increasingly political amid criticism that the Chinese government hasn't been open and transparent with key information, including activities in a Wuhan lab studying coronaviruses. The new findings support the conclusions of a World Health Organization-led research mission in early 2021 that concluded SARS-CoV-2 most likely spilled over to humans from animals, either directly from a bat or via another mammal, possibly one sold at the Huanan seafood and fresh produce market in central Wuhan.

"This report clearly places SARS-CoV-2 susceptible animals smack in the middle of Wuhan," said Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University in New Orleans, who wasn't involved in the research. It's "a major revelation," he said in an email.

Access to the detailed data in the study was serendipitous, the researchers said. The findings were based on routine monthly surveys of shops selling live wild animals as pets or for food across Wuhan in the years before Covid-19 emerged at the end of 2019, the authors said. That unrelated study was intended to identify the source of a tick-borne disease.

"While we caution against the mis-attribution of Covid-19's origins, the wild animals on sale in Wuhan suffered poor welfare and hygiene conditions, and we detail a range of other zoonotic infections they can potentially vector," lead author Xiao Xiao, from the Lab Animal Research Center at Hubei University of Chinese Medicine in Wuhan, and colleagues wrote.

Both wild-caught and farmed non-domesticated species were sold -- alive, caged, stacked, and in poor condition -- by 17 vendors, the researchers said. None posted an origin certificate or quarantine certificate, "so all wildlife trade was fundamentally illegal," they said.

The WHO-led research team reported that market authorities claimed all live and frozen animals sold in the Huanan market were acquired from farms officially licensed for breeding, and it found no verified reports of live mammals being sold around 2019. "This paper is affirmative evidence that there was obfuscation regarding which animals were being sold at the wet markets in Wuhan," Garry said.

China temporarily banned all wildlife trade on 26 Jan 2020, and permanently banned eating and trading terrestrial wild animals for food a month later.

Before the ban, most stores offered butchering services, done on site, with considerable implications for food hygiene and animal welfare.

Marmots, selling for more than USD 25 a kilogram (USD 11 per pound), were the most expensive, while raccoon dogs and badgers were priced at about USD 15-20 a kilogram, the researchers said.

"This group was able to learn a huge amount from vendors in these stalls, who were even willing to discuss openly that they were selling illegal wildlife," said Michael Worobey, head of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who wasn't involved in the study. "It is hard to imagine them being so transparent with government authorities or even the WHO. This serves as a reminder that less 'official' investigations can play a huge role."

While the prevailing theory among virologists is that Covid-19 originated in bats and made its way into humans via an intermediary animal, efforts to pin down the details or identify any infected animals have been unsuccessful for the past year and a half. In part because of that futile attempt, combined with restrictions from China in the effort to gather information, some scientists have started calling for a more detailed investigation into the lab-leak theory.

President Biden directed his intelligence agencies to delve deeper into the issue last month [May 2021], after he received a report on the origins earlier in May 2021 that detailed the scientific divide over whether SARS-CoV-2 arose naturally in animals or whether it was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, one of the world's foremost laboratories working on coronaviruses.

Biden asked for another update in 90 days.

Animal sales from Wuhan wet markets immediately prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Scientific Reports (Nature Poerfolio) (2021) 11:11898. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91470-2.

Its abstract follows:
"Here, we document 47 381 individuals from 38 species, including 31 protected species sold between May 2017 and November 2019 in Wuhan's markets. We note that no pangolins (or bats) were traded, supporting reformed opinion that pangolins were not likely the spillover host at the source of the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While we caution against the misattribution of COVID-19's origins, the wild animals on sale in Wuhan suffered poor welfare and hygiene conditions, and we detail a range of other zoonotic infections they can potentially vector. Nevertheless, in a precautionary response to COVID-19, China's ministries temporarily banned all wildlife trade on 26 Jan 2020 until the COVID-19 pandemic concludes, and permanently banned eating and trading terrestrial wild (non-livestock) animals for food on 24 Feb 2020. These interventions, intended to protect human health, redress previous trading and enforcement inconsistencies and will have collateral benefits for global biodiversity conservation and animal welfare."

The paper includes table 1, with the number and mean number of live animals sold per month and price. In reference to the inclusion of Raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) and American minks (_Neovison vison_ ) among the animal species sold on Wuhan's City markets during the said period (respectively, 30 and 27 individual animals per species), subscribers are referred to the following comment made by the German virologist Christian Drosten in a recent interview (communicated by Mary Marshall):

"There are no studies in the scientific literature -- none -- that shed light on the question of whether raccoon dog breeding herds or other carnivore breeding herds, mink, for example, carry this virus, SARS-CoV2, in China" (trans. from the German original at https://mobile.twitter.com/EckerleIsabella/status/1401103497957941248).

Notably, the Wuhan area has fur processing factories. The distance between the Fur City and Huanan Market/downtown Wuhan is about 50 km (map at http://tinyurl.com/68hd3brz). For an article describing the Huazhong Fur City, see https://www.mpcyxh.com/news_xiangxi.asp?dl=2&xl=7&id=7245. (Thanks go to ProMED-mail's Rapporteur Dan Silver for the above information derived from Chinese sources). This adds another issue yet to be investigated.

As a reminder: the scenario of intermediate animals, including fur animals, being the source of human COVID-19 infection, is one of the 4 hypotheses suggested by the WHO mission on 31 Mar 2021. According to WHO's DG: "All hypotheses remain on the table" (20210331.8279475). - Mod.AS
