On Sat 16 Jan 2016, we received a blood sample from an Holando Argentino cow from which _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated. This animal along with 2 cows and 2 heifers had suffered acute deaths. This outbreak was in the village of Emilio Bunge in the partido/county of General Villegas in the western part of Buenos Aires Province.

According to the estancia veterinarian, no one was exposed when the carcasses were covered with lime and a large pegged down tarpaulin ("el metodo de Tapado Controlado," a standard Pampas procedure for processing anthrax carcasses; after some 6-9 months, the hides and bones are recovered and burnt). The herd had not been vaccinated in spite of the obligatory vaccination order in the province for all animals 6 months old and older.

Unfortunately, this disease persists because of such owner negligence.

[As ever, our thanks to Ramon for this report.

They are in that hard last slog of getting ranchers to participate in the vaccination even though it is compulsory. When they do, the disease is not just controlled; it is eradicated. The good news is that it is past mid-summer in Argentina, and in a few months, hopefully just 3, the anthrax season will be over.
