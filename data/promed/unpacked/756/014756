Polio Strikes 7 Children in Burma [Myanmar]
--------------------
At least 7 children along Burma's [Myanmar's] border with Bangladesh
have confirmed cases of polio, but how they acquired the crippling
virus remains a mystery.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says 7 children in Maungdaw
township, Rakhine state, were found during medical examinations to
have spread the infection to one another. But the Burmese official
media say the virus entered the country through Bangladesh.
"We have even gone outside of Rakhine also, and the sample has been
taken, so we are waiting for the results. So we can say that this
outbreak is confined" to Rakhine state, said Nihal Singh, a medical
officer for infectious diseases at the WHO Rangoon office.
Unlike the single polio infection in Burma [Myanmar] in 2006, which
was caused by a polio vaccine, the current outbreak is highly
contagious, Singh said. "This is the virus which spreads like
anything, and our latest information is that this virus resembles the
virus circulating in Bangladesh," he said. Children can contract
polio from food, after which it spreads through the intestinal tract,
Singh added.
'A major concern'
-----------------
Chris Beyrer, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University
school of public health, called the polio outbreak a cause for
serious worry. "We're very far along in polio eradication globally,
so outbreaks of paralytic polio anywhere are a major concern," Beyrer
said, adding that Burmese health monitoring is weak, and "of course
there are large parts of the country that are not well surveyed at all."
"We always have to be cautious about statements about a lot of areas
but particularly in things such as infectious disease surveillance,"
he said, referring to the junta's claim in 2000 that Burma was
polio-free. "This junta has really grossly under-funded health care
for 2 decades now," Beyrer said.
WHO, along with the governments of Bangladesh and Burma, has sent
emergency teams to the region to administer vaccines and try to
contain the virus, he said. We have even gone outside of Rakhine
also, and the sample has been taken, so we are waiting for the
results. So we can say that this outbreak is confined.
Media blame Bangladesh
----------------------
The official Myanmar Times newspaper quoted a Burmese Health Ministry
official as saying that the polio strain found in Rakhine state had
never previously been detected in Burma. "This is a situation in
which the virus had been transmitted across the border from a
neighboring country," he was quoted as saying, referring to Bangladesh.
UNICEF and the Burmese Health Ministry plan to vaccinate more than
500 000 children under the age of five in 17 townships in western
Rakhine and Chin state, the newspaper said, with a 2nd round of
vaccinations in June [2007] to 2.5 million children in Rakhine and
Chin states, and in Magway, Ayeyarwaddy, and western Bago divisions.
A planned 3rd round will provide repeat vaccinations to children in
the same regions, the report said.
The Burmese [Myanmar] junta declared the country free of polio in
2000. Polio is spread when people, mainly children under 5, come into
contact with the feces of those with the virus, often through water.
The virus attacks the central nervous system, causing paralysis,
muscular atrophy and deformation and, in some cases, death.
Vaccines developed in 1955 [the orginal Francis Field trials were
conducted in 1954 - Mod.MPP] by Jonas Salk and in 1962 [field trials
were conducted in 1958/1959 - Mod.MPP] by Albert Sabin are credited
with reducing of the annual number of polio cases from many hundreds
of thousands to around 1000.

[2] Bangladesh vaccination activities

Bangladesh begins emergency polio vaccination campaign
----------------------
Bangladesh began immunizing 2 million children against polio Sunday
[20 May 2007] in an emergency vaccination drive in a southeastern
region close to Myanmar, officials said. The campaign follows
confirmation that a polio-infected child from Myanmar was brought to
the cities of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar for treatment in March [2007].
"The children will receive a 1st round of vaccinations on Sunday [20
May 2007] and the concluding 2nd round will take place on [1 Jul
2007]," a government health department official said. The drive is
taking place in the districts of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Bandarban.
Records at 2 Bangladesh hospitals, one in Chittagong and the other at
Cox's Bazar, revealed that a 2 1/2-year-old boy from Rakhine State in
Myanmar, had been treated there in March [2007]. Chittagong doctors
collected samples from the boy and sent them to the National Polio
Laboratory in Dhaka. By the time the laboratory had confirmed the
disease, the boy's guardians had transferred him to the Cox's Bazar
hospital and then had him released and taken back to Myanmar.
Fearing that the boy might have spread the virus during his stay,
Bangladeshi health officials ordered the emergency vaccination drive
in addition to an ongoing national campaign begun last year [2006].
Myanmar began its own vaccination campaign last week after 2
polio-infected children were detected in western Rakhine State, near
the Bangladeshi border. It was not immediately clear whether one of
those children was [the child treated in Bangladesh].
Polio, which mainly affects children under 5, can cause paralysis in
a matter of hours. Bangladesh and Myanmar declared themselves free of
the disease in 2000. But last year [2006], Dhaka started a campaign
to immunize all of the country's 24 million children after 17 cases
of a form of polio were detected in border areas.

[In the last posting (Poliomyelitis - worldwide (03): Myanmar, RFI
20070510.1497) there were 2 cases of polio confirmed in Myanmar, both
from western Rhakine (see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/burma_pol_96.jpg>
for a good map of Myanmar). The above newswire mentions 7 cases as of
15 May 2007. Checking the polio eradication website, the most recent
report on cases in Myanmar is dated 15 May 2007, and there were only
2 cases reported with most recent date of onset 29 Mar 2007:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>. One
suspects that the additional cases (? 5 additional cases) are still
pending laboratory confirmation. In the prior ProMED-mail posting
there was the following statement: "'The virus strain was found to be
type-1, the same as the one found in India. It is believed to have
migrated via Bangladesh,' he said."
Of note, according to a Bangladeshi newswire Narinjara:
<http://www.narinjara.com/details.asp?id=1269>, Bangladesh conducted
emergency vaccination activities on 20 May 2007 near the border with
Myanmar in response to the cases reported in Myanmar. In the 2nd
newswire above [2] there was mention that one of the cases from
Myanmar had been hospitalized in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar for
treatment in March 2007 and specimens collected then were found to be
positive for wild poliovirus (see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/bangladesh_pol96.jpg>
for a map of Bangladesh and location of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar) .
The newswire does mention that it is unclear if the polio case
treated in Bangladesh was the same as one of the 2 original reported
cases from Myanmar.
While Bangladesh is 'blaming' Myanmar, and Myanmar is 'blaming'
Bangladesh, the earlier ProMED-mail posting had information
suggesting the genetic analysis of the wild poliovirus isolate(s?) in
Myanmar were related to those circulating in India. Clarification of
the situation in both Myanmar and Bangladesh from knowledgeable
source(s) would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
