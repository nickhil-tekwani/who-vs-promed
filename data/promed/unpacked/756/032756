[1] Cholera - Zimbabwe

The World Health Organization says cholera has resurfaced in Zimbabwe
after a month-long lull in an outbreak that has so far killed 5 people
and infected nearly 150 others. The WHO said 7 new cholera cases were
reported Harare, Mwenezi, Mount Darwin, and Shamva districts since the
outbreak resurfaced on 4 Feb 2010.

One of the confirmed cases was from Kuwadzana Phase 3 in Harare while
3 others were Mwenezi in Masvingo province. One of the confirmed
Mwenezi cases was treated in Beitbridge. Shamva recorded 2 cholera
cases between 4 and 7 Feb 2010 while an unconfirmed case was reported
in Mount Darwin, also in Mashonaland Central province.

The case treated in Beitbridge was linked to a funeral at one of the
farms in Mwenezi district while another case was attributed to having
eaten unwashed mangoes in Beitbridge.

Zimbabwe's cholera outbreak had subsided since the 1st week of January
2010 when figures stood at 149 cumulative cases and 5 deaths. The
resurgent outbreak, which is concentrated in rural areas where 82
percent of the cases have so far been reported, raises fears of more
deaths particularly as the mango season is upon the country. Mangoes
and other fruits are regarded as dangerous transmitters of the cholera
bacteria since some people often ignore health precautions and eat the
fruits without washing them.

4228 lives from more than 98 000 cases over 10 months and spread to a
number of bordering nations.

A total of 16 people have been hospitalized following a cholera
outbreak in Chemyakow Village in Kositot sub-location of Pokot Central
district. Former Sighor [headquarters Pokot Central district] MP
Phillip Rotino is appealing to the Ministry of Public Health and
Sanitation, humanitarian organizations and other well-wishers to
assist residents of the remote village with clean water and medical
supplies.

Speaking to KBC on phone, Rotino expressed concern that the contagious
disease was likely to spread rapidly if urgent intervention measures
are not put in place. He urged residents to observe high hygiene and
sanitation standards by particularly by boiling drinking water and
washing their hands. Rotino noted that the only health facility in the
region, Oppollo Dispensary was already overwhelmed with cholera
patients.

[4] Cholera - Mozambique (Cabo Delgado)
Date: Wed 10 Feb 2010

[edited]

The director of health in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo
Delgado, Mussa Ibrahimo Agy, has expressed fears that cholera might
now be endemic in that part of the country. Cited in Wednesday's [10
Feb 2010] issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias", Agy noted that for the
past 3 years cholera has been constantly present in Cabo Delgado, at
any time of year, and that only the 3 districts on the Mueda plateau
(Mueda, Nangade, and most of Muidumbe) have been free of the disease.

Agy said that since 13 Jan 2010, cases of diarrhea have been reported
in the districts of Chire, Mecufi, and in Pemba city, and they were
later confirmed as cholera. Reporters learned that by 9 Feb 2010, the
disease, of which 966 cases have so far been diagnosed, had caused at
least 11 deaths.

Statistics from the health units show a daily increase in the number
of cholera patients seeking assistance, at a time when the authorities
admit that the financial resources allocated for those services are
insufficient.

[5] Cholera - Uganda (Manafwa)

A 56-year-old woman has died of cholera in Lwakhakha Town Council,
pushing the death toll to 4 since the epidemic broke out in Manafwa
district in January 2010. David Makanya, the district health
inspector, on Tuesday [9 Feb 2010] said the woman died on her way to
the treatment centre at Magale Health Centre IV.

"When we got to know of the circumstances surrounding the death, we
visited her home and took tests before she was buried," Makanya said,
adding that 5 people are admitted at Magale.

Makanya noted that whereas the outbreak had been contained in the
sub-counties of Bumbo and the newly created Bukhoko, it had spread to
Bumoni sub-county and Lwakhakha town council at the Uganda-Kenya
border, where 6 new cases had been registered. He attributed the
spread of the disease to the use of contaminated water from River
Lwakhakha, which runs along the border between the 2 countries.

A total of 42 cases have been registered since the disease broke out.
Makanya said district authorities had closed Kaboole Primary School in
Taaso village, to prevent the spread of the disease.

[6] Cholera - Somalia (Middle Jubba): WHO

Somalia health cluster bulletin no. 30 - December 2009 [page 3]
---------------------------------------------------------------
In epidemiological weeks 48-51 (28 Nov - 25 Dec 2009), 425 cases of
acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) were reported from Afmadow (54), Hagar
(66), Kismayo (128), and Badhaadhe (48) in Lower Jubba, and Bu'aale
(48), Sakoow (38), and Salalge (43) in Middle Jubba. The number of
reported cases remained stable compared to November 2009. The data was
not available from Jamaame (Lower Jubba)
and Jilib (Middle Jubba) in the reporting period due to security
reasons. Children under 5 years accounted for 76 percent (321) of all
consultations.

In follow-up to confirmation of cholera in mid-October 2009, WHO
conducted a field visit to Banadir Hospital (Mogadishu) on 26 and 27
Dec 2009. The number of AWD cases reported at Banadir Hospital is of
particular concern considering the large internally displaced
populations in the surrounding areas and the high-risk of transmission
of communicable diseases including water-borne diseases. Between weeks
42 and 51, a total of 696 cases were reported including
86 percent (594) children under the age of 5 years of which 84 percent
(499) were aged under 2 years. 17 deaths were reported of which 82
percent (14) were children under 2 years (case fatality rate of 2.44
percent). 7 stool samples were collected during the visit, 6 of them
from children under 1 year of age. 1 out of the 7 samples tested
positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ with SMART II rapid diagnostic testing.
