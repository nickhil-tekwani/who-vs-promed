Toronto's board of health wants Guatemalan raspberries banned following an
outbreak of [cyclosporiasis involving almost 300 people in southern
Ontario.
The board has asked the public health department to consider a ban on
importing the Guatemalan raspberries, deemed to be the common element in
the May outbreak. "All signs point towards Guatemalan raspberries," said
board chairman John Filion. "How many years in a row can you allow this?"
This is the third consecutive year there has been [an outbreak [of
cyclosporiasis in southern Ontario. In 1996, it was deemed to be
Guatemalan raspberries. In 1997, a survey was inconclusive.
Cyclospora is a single-cell parasite that infects the small intestine. It
can cause diarrhea, loss of appetite, cramps, fever and nausea. The
parasite is treated with antibiotics.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said the Guatemalan raspberry season is
over and are no longer available in Canada. The raspberries found in stores
now were grown in Canada or the United States.
