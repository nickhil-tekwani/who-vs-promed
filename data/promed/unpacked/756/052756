UNIDENTIFIED FATAL ILLNESS - ECUADOR
====================================
Date: Fri, 23 May 1997 10:20:46 -0700
From: Dave Coder <dcoder@u.washington.edu>
[from a report in El Comercio, Quito, Ecuador, 23 May 1997]
In the last eight days, three children (ages 2 to 4 years) have died from a
disease that appears to be malaria or yellow fever, according to Lt. Alberto
Lituma of the Ecuadorian Army. All three cases [were reported to have had]
high fever, delerium, and continuous diarrhea. Reportedly, all died within
24 hours after presenting with symptoms.
The deaths were in the village of Tiputini on the banks of Napo river in the
canton of Aguarico, in the state of Napo. The village of small landholders is
located 270 km northeast of Coca, about 35 minutes by canoe from the
international boundary with Peru. [Note: this location makes little sense;
270 km northeast of Coca is well within Colombia. DMC]
The only local medical care is in the Army clinic of the Montecristi
Battalion. The lack of medical care in the surrounding dense forest is of
concern because of the potential for infection of children of indigenous
tribes. Moreover, Lt. Lituma observed that indigenous populations "do not
want their children treated by medical doctors, [but] prefer traditional
healers." An army doctor observed that the only means of communication in the
area is by river, and it is impossible for doctors to arrive in time to aid
the sick.
During the winter (and last winter was particularly harsh), the river floods,
resulting in pools which become breeding areas for flies and mosquitoes. Lt.
Lituma observed that the Service of Eradication of Malaria had suspended its
efforts for the past two years due to lack of money and personnel. But this
year, Eduardo Ordez [?], in charge of the office for the northeast, located
in Nueva Loja, Sucumbos [?], confirmed that plans for the summer are to
fumigate households of about 40 riverside communities, in which live 15,000
to 20,000 inhabitants. Locally, the army initiated a program to combat
anopheline mosquitoes.

[Tiputini, Napo, Aguarico, and Coca are all names of rivers in northeastern
Ecuador, about on the equator, and close to southeastern Colombia, and more
than 500 km, as the crow flies, from the nearest part of Peruvian territory.
They may also be the names of small towns or villages in those areas. Dave
Coder is quite right; the location is certainly not clear but my guess is
that it is in northeastern Ecuador, near the Colombian border. There are
a number of oil fields in this area and considerable exploration for oil.
Why only children would be affected is certainly a question to be answered if
this is yellow fever. Certainly, laboratory confirmation of the clinical
observations should be done. This outbreak may not be due to yellow fever
virus or to other arthropod-transmitted infection and mosquito control might
make life a little more pleasant but would do nothing to ameliorate the
problem. If anyone knows anything of this outbreak (confirmed etiology,
total number of cases, age distribution, etc.), please let us know as soon as
possible. This area of northeastern Ecuador is very much isolated from
populated areas of Ecuador and Colombia. BTW, "35 minutes by canoe" is a
distance only relative to paddling speed. -- Mod CHC]
