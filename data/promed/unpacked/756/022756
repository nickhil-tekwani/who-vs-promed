1st Report of Black Sigatoka of Banana Caused by _Mycosphaerella
fijiensis_ on Grand Bahama Island.
R. C. Ploetz, University of Florida, Department of Plant Pathology,
IFAS, Tropical Research and Education Center, 18905 SW 280th Street,
Homestead 33031-3314. Plant Dis. 88:772, 2004; published on-line as
D-2004-0519-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication 14 May 2004.

Black Sigatoka, which is also known as black leaf streak, is caused
by _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ (anamorph _Pseudocercospora_ [formerly
_Paracercospora) fijiensis_] (Pf). It is the most important disease
of commercially produced banana (_Musa_ spp.) and also has a major
impact on production for local consumption.
Although the disease occurs throughout the humid tropics, it has been
reported in the Caribbean from only Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica
(1). In February 2004, black Sigatoka was observed at 2 isolated and
widely separated sites on Grand Bahama island (26.7 deg N, 78.5 deg W
and 26.7 deg N, 78 deg W) on cvs. Silk AAB and Williams AAA, and a
French Horn AAB plantain.
Symptoms included wet, dark brown streaks on the adaxial leaf
surface, 1 to 2 x 10 mm, with chlorotic haloes. Lesions enlarged to 5
x 20 mm and developed tan, necrotic centers; large, blackened,
water-soaked areas that resulted from the coalescence of streaks were
rare.
The disease was confirmed by observing the following characteristics
of _P. fijiensis_ in necrotic lesions on preserved leaf specimens:
simple conidiophores with a broadened base and one to several septa,
straight to variously bent cercosporoid conidia as much as 100
micrometers long with 2 to several septa, and a conspicuously
thickened scar at the base.
Both plantings were several years old, and new planting material that
could have been infested with the pathogen had not been introduced
since their establishment. Symptoms were not severe and were
distributed sporadically in both locations. The disease was not
observed at the only other large planting of banana on the island
(26.6 deg N, 78.6 deg W).
The sporadic and apparently new infestations of 2 of 3 banana
plantings on the island suggest that the pathogen may have arrived
recently via natural means, possibly from neighboring Florida (2). In
contrast, black Sigatoka appears to have spread to other islands in
the Caribbean via infested propagation materials (1).
To my knowledge, this is the 1st report of black Sigatoka in the
Bahamas, and with a previous report from Bhutan (1), represents the
northernmost spread of this important disease.

[Black sigatoka (a.k.a. black leaf streak) is the most damaging
disease of banana worldwide. It reduces leaf area, decreases yields
by more than 50 percent and causes premature ripening, which
downgrades marketability of fruit. Unable to reproduce sexually,
propagation depends upon cloning, using shoots from trees.
Consequently, all banana cultivars are almost identical and are
universally susceptible to the disease.
According to FAO data from 2003, bananas rank 4th behind rice, wheat,
and maize in worldwide production, measured in metric tons. Bananas
and plantains (cooking bananas) are staple food crops for millions of
people who produce the fruit in backyards and small plots in
developing countries.
The disease was 1st reported in Fiji in 1963 but was probably well
established in southeast Asia and the south Pacific before that time.
It was been reported in Honduras in 1972 and now is reported from
Mexico south to Bolivia and northwestern Brazil and in the Caribbean
region. In 1998 it was reported in southern Florida, probably by
introduction of infected suckers from elsewhere. Genetic engineering
may be a possible means of producing resistant planting stock for
disease control, but that will take some considerable time to effect.
