California officials investigate Bovine Tuberculosis
------------------------------------------------
State officials are investigating how a cow got bovine tuberculosis.
A federal meat inspector discovered a lesion on a carcass at Beef
Packers Inc. on 23 Sep 2002. Investigators are uncertain of where
the cow originated, said Steve Lyle, spokesman for the California
Department of Food and Agriculture. If the cow is traced back to a
California herd and if a second cow from the herd tests positive for
bovine TB, it would mean a second outbreak in California, causing
the state to lose its hard-earned status as being free of bovine TB.
It would force cattlemen to administer costly tests before shipping
cows out of state."It would be the beef industry that will be
jeopardized," said Benjamin Higgins, spokesman for the California
Cattlemen's Association. "A sizable portion of our cattle get shipped
to the Midwest." The association estimates it could cost the state's
cattlemen about $2 million a year to test animals.
California has a $6 billion beef and cattle industry. The meat
packing plant did not return a call Monday seeking comment, or a
second call Tuesday morning. Authorities say the risk to consumers
is low.
People can contract the disease by working closely with infected
cows, or by consuming raw milk or uncooked meat from infected
cows. But nearly all milk sold in California is pasteurized and meat is
inspected before being sold, state officials said. California had been
bovine TB-free since 1999. But in May 2002, a federal meat
inspector found traces of the disease at a Hanford meat packing
plant. It was linked to Friesian Dairy Farm in Tulare County, where
owner Nonning Leyendekker immediately slaughtered 90 cows that
tested positive.
Leyendekker recently slaughtered his entire 6400-cow herd to help
protect the state's bovine TB-free status after a second cow was
discovered with the disease.

[Detailed background data on Bovine tuberculosis have been
included in the moderator's comments to ProMED-mail's previous
posting on bovine-TB in California (see ref). The conditions required
from a country or a zone to be regarded as officially free from
Bovine tuberculosis are described in article 2.3.3.2. of the OIE
International Animal Health Code. The main requirements are:
1. 99.8 percent of the herds in the considered geographical area
have been officially free from bovine tuberculosis for at least the
past 3 years as disclosed by periodic testing of all cattle in the area
to determine the absence of bovine tuberculosis;
2. The periodic testing of all cattle is not required in an area where a
surveillance programme (which is described in detail in the Code)
reveals that at least 99.9 percent of the cattle have been in herds
officially free from tuberculosis for at least 6 years.
For further details see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/MCode/A_00057.htm>
Should more than 0.01 percent of the Californian cattle be in
infected herds, then the costly periodic testing by individual
tuberculination of cattle will be required. Each test requires at least 2
visits. - Mod.AS]
