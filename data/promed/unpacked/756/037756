Malaysian authorities suspect 4 New Zealand racehorses who travelled there via Singapore are behind an outbreak of equine influenza which has resulted in widespread movement restrictions.

More than 100 horses are understood to have come down with the highly contagious disease and race meetings have been cancelled across the country.

The deputy director-general of Malaysia's Department of Veterinary Services, Dr Kamarudin Md Isa, reportedly told a press conference: "The source of infection could have originated from 4 horses imported from New Zealand via Singapore on 31 Jul 2015."

However, given that New Zealand is among a handful of countries that are free of the disease, that could only be the case if one or more of the horses had picked up the disease in transit or in quarantine.

Kamarudin said the horses had not shown any signs of infection while undergoing a 14-day quarantine period at Kuala Lumpur International Airport's Animals Quarantine Station.

The disease was detected after the horses, 2 of which were transferred to the Selangor Turf Club and 1 each to Perak Turf Club and Penang Turf Club in mid-August [2015], showed influenza-like nasal discharge.

"Now more than 100 horses have been infected from the 4 imported horses but the situation is still under control," he said. "We are taking this problem seriously."

His department banned the transfer of horses from 28 Aug 2015 and racing clubs have been asked to tighten controls, ensuring that no equipment, as well as horses, left their facilities.

It is estimated the country has about 5000 horses, housed across around 100 stables.

Kamarudin said his department would also temporarily suspend any export or import of horses.

Testing carried out by the Veterinary Research Institute in Ipoh and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the equine influenza virus.

Kamarudin said he was confident the outbreak could be controlled within the next 6 weeks.

Malaysian Racing Association secretary Krishna Kumar confirmed to local media that all horse races scheduled this month [September 2015] had been cancelled.

The outbreak represents the 1st confirmed cases of equine flu in the country since 1977, when the racing industry in Malaysia faced disruption for about 2 months.

Equine influenza is rarely fatal, but the controls and quarantines required to contain outbreaks can be economically damaging.

Signs include lethargy, fever, coughing, and nasal discharge. Affected horses generally remain infectious for up to 10 days.

[As the story of equine influenza in Malaysia unfolds, there are several points that must be noted and considered.

ProMED-mail mail post 20150828.3608767 reports the following statement made by Malaysian authorities:
"The report quoted Selangor Turf Club chief veterinary surgeon Dr Shri Kanth, who said that the equine influenza has hit 33 out of more than 500 horses currently in the clubs. "However, the issue is that the disease is contagious and it passes from animal to animal quickly," he was quoted as saying. "While the animals are all responding to antibiotics well, we are treating them as potential carriers and so, all are quarantined. With luck, it will be contained within 2 weeks."

Equine influenza is a virus and will not respond to antibiotics. If the horses have a secondary bacterial infection then that particular infection, if treated with the correct antibiotic may respond. So this raises an immediate question of what disease the horses have.

In the next ProMED-mail post, 20150905.3626182, the moderator makes some clarifying remarks about this outbreak:
"The source of infection is in need of elucidation. According to New Zealand's last (2014) annual report to the OIE, equine influenza, a reportable disease, has never been recorded in that country. According to the 2014 annual reports of both Malaysia and (adjacent) Singapore, in both of them the last occurrence of the disease dates back to 1977. As reported in the previous posting of 28 Aug 2015, samples from the afflicted horses were to be sent to Singapore and the USA to determine where the disease originated."

Which now brings us to today's (6 Sep 2015) posting. The article has many qualifying words:
- "Malaysian authorities suspect 4 New Zealand racehorses..." That word 'suspect' means it is in question.
- "The source of infection could have originated from 4 horses imported from New Zealand via Singapore on 31 Jul 2015." The words "could have" means it remains speculation.
- Further down in the article, "Testing carried out by the Veterinary Research Institute in Ipoh and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the equine influenza virus." This sounds like they have a validated test.

So the questions remain:
1. Did the horses respond to antibiotics? And if so why would a virus respond to antibiotics?
2. New Zealand has not had a case of equine influenza since 1977 and has not released a statement regarding the disease having been found or diagnosed.
3. The horses never showed any sign of illness during 14 days of quarantine when coming from New Zealand.
4. This epidemiologic finding and the rapid elimination of the virus by the equine immune response suggest that infection can be avoided by preventing entry of the virus into an equine population (that is, by the quarantine of newly arriving horses for at least 14 days), and by appropriate vaccination before exposure. Therefore, if the imported horses showed no signs of illness until they reached their racing barn, then the disease may have been present already in the barn.
5. Is the test a validated test for equine influenza? Have samples been sent to a secondary lab for confirmation?
6. Is suggesting that the alleged virus arrived from New Zealand supposed to assuage the racing industry's ruffled feathers over cancelled races?
7. Since the horses went through Singapore, then if they picked up an infection, could it have [already been] there?

As one can see this investigation is clearly not complete. - Mod.TG

[This notification to the OIE officially confirms the report published in ProMED postings 20150828.3608767 and 20150905.3626182. However, the OIE report does generate additional questions. While the report mentions that the source of infection was due to the entry of live animals, it is not clear when such animals became infected, especially given that the animals were coming from a country where the disease has never been reported. These horses may very well have been in contact with horses from other areas where the disease may occur. The characterization of the serotype will be of great value for determining the origin of the infection.

There is mention of unofficial information (see report below) noting over 100 infected animals. So, it would be useful to know the total number of affected cases, and not only the number of initial cases.

As ProMED-mail moderator AS commented in posting 20150905.3626182, the source of infection needs to be clarified. We now have confirmation of the infection, so determining and clarifying the source would be helpful.
