A 2nd human case of tularemia was confirmed on Fri 5 Sep 2014. A Larimer County resident has been hospitalized. The unidentified resident is thought to have been infected with the potentially life-threatening bacteria while mowing tall grass in an area where infected rabbits were previously present, Larimer County Department of Health and Environment officials said.

The bacterium can be transmitted by handling of sick or dead animals infected with tularemia. Infection can also arise from the bite of infected insects (ticks and deer flies), by eating or drinking contaminated food or water and by the inhalation of airborne bacteria.

A rabbit in southeast Fort Collins tested positive for tularemia in July 2014, putting many on heightened alert, primarily in areas around Trilby Road between Timberline Road and Fossil Creek and the northwest section of Fossil Creek Wetlands natural area.

The 1st case of a Larimer County resident sickened by tularemia surfaced in early August 2014.

How to prevent tularemia:
- avoid handling dead animals;
- leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals;
- if a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it. Put on a repellent to protect yourself from its fleas or ticks, and use a shovel to scoop it up. Place it in a plastic bag and dispose in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands;
- when outdoors near places where rabbits or rodents are present, wear an insect repellent containing DEET;
- keep pets confined and away from dead animals;
- routinely use a tick and flea preventative on pets. Read the label and consult your veterinarian if you are unsure what to use.

[Acquiring _Francisella tularensis_ by lawn mowing usually causes pneumonia as the infection's manifestation. Skinning infected animals or acquiring the infection from a deer fly or tick bite will cause the ulceroglandular form. Oroglandular or oculoglandular forms can also occur depending on the site of exposure and a "typhoidal" form with bacteremia may occur. - Mod.LL]

An infant from Longmont is recovering at home after being released from the hospital where he was treated for what's known at "rabbit fever." The infant, just 10 weeks old, is the 1st human case of Tularemia in Boulder County. There have been at least 2 other cases in Broomfield and Larimer Counties. "We get to go home. It's been a long couple of weeks," said the infant's mother.

The infant was released from Children's Hospital 14 days after contracting a disease that could have killed him. He's believed to have been exposed to tularemia at a family picnic after he was bitten by a tick. He was taken to Children's Hospital with a high fever and put on antibiotics. "It [the temperature] got higher and higher so I took him in to the ER and once I got there they basically told me, 'Your baby's really sick and he's not leaving. He has to stay,'" said the mother.

"This case was very lucky, they weren't very ill, they caught it very early," said Bolder County Public Health spokeswoman Kylie Chilton.

One case of rabbit fever was confirmed in a dead vole in a popular field in Boulder County. There are usually only 4 cases a year in Colorado but that has quadrupled in 2014 because heavy rain has fueled vegetation and given rabbits more places to live. "As long as we continue to see warm temperatures and also these animals are around, then we may see that disease still," said Chilton.

The manifestations of tularemia are not specifically stated. Tularemia is not a very common infection in the USA and much less common in infants because they are usually not in circumstances where they would be exposed. Deer fly or tick-associated transmission is most likely in this infant. Although rashes, other than ulcers at the inoculation site, are not common, another report of tularemia in an infant described a vesicular rash (Byington CL, Bender JM, Ampofo K, et al: Tularemia with vesicular skin lesions may be mistaken for infection with herpes viruses. Clin Infect Dis 2008; 47(1): e4-e6; http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/1/e4.long). The authors point out that in Edward Francis' original description of the disease, he described a vesicular rash in one person and other studies have also reported rashes, including some with a vesicular component. - Mod.LL]
