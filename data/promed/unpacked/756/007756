[This report provides additional details on the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Ghana. A previous report indicated that the health services are intensifying vaccination campaign efforts in the affected areas to halt the outbreak. The YF vaccination campaign, increased surveillance and public information, all now under way, are essential to control this outbreak.

A previous report indicated that in the affected areas only 60% of the residents are reported to have been vaccinated. One hopes that this percentage will reach at least 80% in the coming days and bring this outbreak to a halt. If there are abundant populations of YF virus vector mosquitoes present in an area where a large proportion of the population is unvaccinated, YF can quickly get out of hand. - Mod.TY
