--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Sugarcane streak mosaic virus_ (SCSMV) is named for the pale green symptoms it causes on leaves of _Saccharum_ sp. (sugarcane). It occurs in several Asian countries but has not been reported outside that continent.

In 2016, streak mosaic was observed on the main sugarcane varieties [in Sassandra-Marahoue District, SM]. Symptoms were associated with a progressive decrease in sugar yield reaching 70% in 2017 in cv. R575. In October 2018 the symptoms were also found [in Savanes District, SV]. Symptoms were observed [in SV] on all 11 commercial varieties with 0-25% stalks affected per field [and] on 0-15% of plants per variety in nurseries, with only 2 varieties out of 16 showing no symptoms. [In SM] disease occurrence was higher than 95% in commercial fields and almost 100% in nurseries.

One leaf [each] from a symptomatic [and] a symptomless plant was collected [per] each of 12 varieties in the [SV] nursery. At a nursery in [SM], a symptomatic leaf from each of 6 varieties and one symptomless leaf from M2593/92, the only variety with symptomless plants, were sampled. Samples were screened for SCSMV, _Sugarcane mosaic virus_, and _Sorghum mosaic virus_ using RT-PCR. A product of the expected size (400 bp) was obtained from 18 symptomatic but not from the 13 symptomless plants. All samples tested negative for the other viruses. Thirteen of the 16 sequences had 99.7-100%, the 3 remaining sequences 99.1- 99.4% identity with SCSMV isolates from India.

Streak mosaic is an important emerging disease of sugarcane in CÃ´te d'Ivoire affecting a wide range of varieties [and] appears to impact cane and sugar yields. Screening for SCSMV tolerance has been initiated.

[_Sugarcane streak mosaic virus_ (SCSMV; genus _Poacevirus_, Potyviridae) affects hosts in the family Poaceae (grasses), including sugar cane, maize, and sorghum. Symptoms include chlorotic streaks on leaves leading to loss of photosynthetic ability and stunting of plants. Symptom severity and yield losses depend on host variety and viral strains. Some grasses can be asymptomatic hosts and serve as virus reservoirs for nearby crops. SCSMV is closely related to _Triticum mosaic virus_ which is of concern for wheat production in the US (for example, see ProMED post 20170526.5063886).

SCSMV is spread easily with infected cuttings to new areas, as well as by mechanical means (such as harvesting knives) within a field. Potential insect vectors are suspected, but so far none have been identified. Hot water treatment (used to eliminate some viruses and viroids from germplasm) does not appear to be effective in eliminating SCSMV from cane cuttings. Disease management may include phytosanitary measures (including removal of virus reservoirs, disinfecting tools) and use of certified clean planting material. Some resistant sugarcane varieties have been identified for certain areas.

Several other potyviruses (for example, _Sugarcane mosaic virus_, _Sorghum mosaic virus_, _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_) can cause similar symptoms in sugar cane. In different regions or even different fields, mosaic disease in crops may be caused by one or several strains of either of these viruses alone or in combination.
