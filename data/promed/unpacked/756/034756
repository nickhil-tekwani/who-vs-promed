Viet Nam: 1st H5N1 Virus Human Death in Ben Tre Province
--------------------------------------------------------
A 30-year-old man from southern Ben Tre Province, who died at the end
of last month [July 2005], has tested positive for the H5N1 virus, an
official of Ho Chi Minh City's Pasteur Institute has announced. The
man, from Tan Xuan Commune, died a day after he was admitted to
Nguyen Dinh Chieu Hospital with acute pneumonia. His is the 1st death
from avian influenza virus infection in Ben Tre [province].
An official from the Ben Tre preventive health center said that the
man ate sick fighting cocks after slaughtering them. He had believed,
as did many residents, that the birds were immune to the virus. The
surroundings of the victim's house have been sprayed with
disinfectant [which will have no effect on the virus. - Mod.JW].
The avian influenza epidemic shows signs of returning, warns the
Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry's Animal Health Department
deputy director Dau Ngoc Hao. The evidence was signs of a wider
distribution of the H5N1 virus in flocks, he told a conference
discussing the vaccination of birds in northern Viet Nam in Hanoi
yesterday [9 Aug 2005]. Assessing the danger to humans was still
difficult, although infections were less than last year [2004], he
said. The Department has required northern cities and provinces to
count their poultry flocks in preparation for a vaccination campaign
from 1-15 Sep 2005.

[The mounting human death toll from avian influenza virus infection
in Viet Nam continues to be associated with consumption of
virus-infected poultry and poultry products. There is still no
indication that the virus has acquired an ability to transmit from
human to human. - Mod.CP]
