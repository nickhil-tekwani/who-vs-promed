[Regarding the following quote from the above-referenced ProMED-mail
posting: "Urban epidemics have been reported during the rainy season
(April to August) since the 1970's."
GIDEON may be a useful and reliable tool for epidemiology, but not for
weather forecasts. The rainy season in [south Brazil is from
September-October to April-May.

[I second that. It has just started raining here in Rio after months
without a drop. And, yes, we get lepto cases here every rainy season.
The northern, Amazonian, part of Brazil is different; they say the
difference between the rainy and dry seasons there is that in the
rainy season it rains all day, while in the dry it only rains every
day. - Mod.JW
