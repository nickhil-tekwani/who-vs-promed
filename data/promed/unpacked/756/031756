A suspected avian influenza victim who is from the same area as
Indonesia's latest confirmed case died in hospital, a health official
said. The 9-year-old girl was from Cikelet in West Java's Garut
district, said Wijayanti, a doctor from Garut's main hospital. It is
the same area as a 17-year-old confirmed 2 days ago as infected with
H5N1 [see text below and ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza, human
(118): Indonesia 20060813.2270. - Mod.CP].
Wijayanti told Agence France Presse (AFP) that the girl, who was from
a different village from the teenager, was admitted to hospital on
Monday afternoon with pneumonia. "She was immediately taken to the
isolation unit, had samples taken and then received treatment, but
her condition was already failing at the time. She remained
unconscious until her death today," she said.
Senior health ministry official Nyoman Kandun told AFP that
laboratories in Jakarta had not released results of her tests yet.
Positive tests must be returned by 2 separate laboratories in Jakarta
before being listed by the World Health Organisation as a confirmed case.
A 17-year-old was listed as Indonesia's 57th confirmed [not yet by
WHO - Mod.JW] case of H5N1 on Sunday. Of the confirmed cases, 44 have
died, making the nation the world's worst-hit. Another health
official said on Tue 15 Aug 2006 that a cousin of the 17-year-old had
died showing symptoms of the virus more than a week ago. Iman
Firmanulah, the Head of the Contagious Disease Section of Garut's
health office, told AFP that the cousin died on 6 Aug 2006 exhibiting
bird flu-like symptoms but was buried before samples were taken, he
said. "We cannot positively say that he died of avian influenza but
he showed symptoms that were similar to those of bird flu patients," he said.
Firmanulah also urged Indonesia's Health Ministry to provide his
office and Garut Hospital with suitable equipment to treat patients.
"Health Minister (Siti Fadilah Supari) has appointed Garut hospital
as a designated center for bird flu treatment, but don't just give us
difficult tasks -- please also give us proper equipment," he said. He
said Garut hospital lacked ventilation and defibrillation equipment
and also needed vehicles for surveillance in isolated areas. It takes
4 hours by motorcycle to reach Cikelet, he said.

district of Garut where the most recent confirmed case (a
17-year-old) resides.
