Investigators uncovered a multistate outbreak of coccidioidomycosis, or valley fever, in people who had recently returned from community service trips in Mexico, where they were likely infected while working on the same house, according to a report published in MMWR [1].

The outbreak involved 8 patients from Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, and New York, including 5 high school students.

Valley fever is a fungal disease acquired primarily through inhaling airborne spores in dust or soil, Mitsuru Toda, PhD, MS, Epidemic Intelligence Service officer in the CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch, and colleagues noted. It is endemic in northern Mexico, parts of Central and South America, and in the southwestern United States.

In their report, Toda and colleagues explained that 40% of exposed individuals experience influenza-like symptoms 1 to 3 weeks after exposure, 5% to 10% develop serious pulmonary problems and 1% develop disseminated disease. "The severity of illness and delays in accurate diagnosis observed in this outbreak underscore the importance of obtaining a travel history and considering coccidioidomycosis in persons with respiratory symptoms, with or without rash, who have returned from northern Mexico or areas of the United States where the disease is endemic," they wrote.

According to the report, the investigation was initiated after the New York City health department alerted the CDC on [8 Aug 2018], to 2 high school students hospitalized with pneumonia from an unknown cause. Both patients had recently returned from construction-related service trips to Tijuana. When they did not improve after multiple antibiotic treatments, the students were diagnosed with valley fever.

Looking for more cases, investigators reached out to the school group and an organization that plans service trips and released notices over the CDC's Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) network, which connects federal, state and local health departments. By [15 Oct 2018], they had identified 8 patients who were diagnosed with valley fever after attending community service trips, including 4 who were hospitalized -- 1 in intensive care. All patients were male, 5 were in high school and 3 were adults.

According to Toda and colleagues, the patients had attended 7 different service trips from June to July 2018 that were organized by 2 different organizations. The investigators identified a single house in Tijuana that 7 of the 8 patients had done excavation or construction work on, making it the likely source of exposure for those patients, they said. No cases associated with the outbreak were reported in Mexico.

"Organizers of service or mission trips involving soil-disturbing activities in these areas should educate participants about the risk for valley fever," Toda and colleagues wrote. "Potential mitigation efforts could include soil wetting, employing professionals with appropriate occupational safety training for excavation, staying upwind of digging when possible, and using at minimum CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved or Food and Drug Administration-cleared N-95 respirators when performing dust-generating activities."

[Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as valley fever, is a fungal disease caused by inhalation of spores of _Coccidioides immitis_ or _C. posadasii_, dimorphic saprophytic fungi that grow in soil as a mycelium that break off into airborne spores. The spores, known as arthroconidia, become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. In the host organism, the inhaled arthrospores develop into spherules, which produce as many as 800 endospores; endospores, when released into tissues, can mature into new spherules.

Most patients who become infected following exposure are asymptomatic but have immunological evidence of coccidioidomycosis. Within some endemic communities in the central valley of California, nearly the entire population has serological evidence of prior infection. Infection generally imparts immunity to reinfection.

Risk factors for more severe pulmonary disease include diabetes, recent history of cigarette smoking, income of less than USD 15 000 per year, and older age (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11229838). Disseminated infection occurs more frequently in certain ethnic groups (persons of African, Filipino, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic descent), pregnancy, and immunodeficiency, such as that due to AIDS or immunosuppressive drugs.

Tijuana is the largest city in the Mexican state of Baja California, with a population of about 1.64 million (2015), and is situated on the US-Mexico border adjacent to the US city of San Diego, California (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana). It is estimated that more than 50 million people cross the border between these 2 cities every year. - Mod.ML
