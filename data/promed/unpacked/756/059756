[The minister of agriculture, Nick Brown, made a statement to the House
[of Commons today, Tue 27 Mar 2001, outlining the action taken by the
Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food so far to control the disease
and further action that will be necessary. This includes a ban on feeding
swill to pigs and a proposal to introduce a 20 day standstill period, after
movement, for sheep, goats. and cattle.
The minister set out the government's 3 key priorities for tackling FMD:
1. All susceptible animals on infected farms are to be culled within 24
hours of the infection report.
2. All susceptible animals on contiguous farms are then to be culled within
48 hours.
3. Efforts in northern Cumbria will concentrate on clearing all animals
identified for slaughter in Solway, and on creating a "firebreak" south of
the worst affected area.
The minister's statement also set out the latest position on the disease
and the additional resources being deployed to deal with it, explained that
the government is considering the possible use of vaccination as a
contingency measure, summarised the financial and other support available
to farmers, and explained the differences between the current outbreak and
that of 1967.
The minister went on to announce consultation on a ban on [the use of
pigswill [as feed and on a proposed 20 day standstill, after movement, for
sheep, goats and cattle, [The government is looking at ways of tightening
the rules on commercial and personal imports of meat [and at the operation
of the livestock markets. Clear guidance for the public on what to do and
what not to do when visiting the countryside during the foot and mouth
outbreak is being circulated to local authorities, tourist offices and is
now available. Further details are available on the Department of
Environment Transport and the Regions website (<http://www.detr.gov.uk/>).
This guidance draws on new advice from the chief veterinary officer.
