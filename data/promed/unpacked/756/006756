Scientists from Mikocheni Agricultural Research Institute (Mari) [Dar es Salaam, Tanzania] have called for urgent measures to contain a new disease that attacks citrus trees. [They] say the pest Asian psyllid whose existence in the country was reported for the 1st time in 2015, is responsible. The pest has been observed in Morogoro, Dar es Salaam, Coast Region, and Zanzibar.

The disease according to Dr Seguni, Mari, is not widespread in Tanzania and does not appear to be in Tanga Region, most probably [because of] the limited number of seedlings sourced from Morogoro.

The stakeholders agreed that an action plan should centre around creating awareness and conducting a countrywide survey to establish the presence of the disease for efficient control. The regional government would support experts and orange farmers in combating the disease.

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (Asian greening; huanglongbing, HLB), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel, and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. _Ca._ L. asiaticus and americanus are spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_). The main vector for _Ca._ L. africanus is the African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting of guava, is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018). In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of HLB outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

_Ca._ L. africanus has been reported in Tanzania previously (see links below). In Africa, _Ca._ L. asiaticus is so far only known to occur in Ethiopia and Mauritius. It is not entirely clear whether the report above warns of the Asian greening pathogen only because its vector has recently been detected in Tanzania, or if the actual _Ca._ L. asiaticus has been confirmed by molecular methods as well. In the latter case, this would be its first report in the country.
