Recently, farmers have undertaken capsicum cultivation in the area. However, leaf curling and wilting disease has suddenly affected the capsicum, [a] farmer said.

Farm scientists held the farmers responsible for the disease. They said [they] could prevent the disease by treatment of the soil, seeds and saplings before cultivation. [An] agriculture scientist of Krushi Vigyan Kendra [agricultural extension centre] visited farmers. He said [they] could use neem cake powder or _Trichoderma viride_ for soil treatment. Similarly, bavistin fungicide should be used for seed treatment. They should also apply thiamethoxam for treatment of saplings after 20-25 days of plantation [see comments below].

[An undiagnosed leaf blight of tomato has been reported only 2 weeks earlier from the same area in Jaipur (ProMED-mail post 20210303.8226550]. Since tomato and capsicum are closely related solanaceous crops and share many pathogens, both problems may well have the same cause(s).

The recommendations given to farmers, as reported above, are either unsuitable or, at the least, very unspecific:
- neem cake powder is a soil conditioner/fertiliser;
- _Trichoderma viride_ is a biocontrol agent used to suppress a number of fungal pathogens; however, it is by no means certain that the problems are due to fungi;
- bavistin is a broad spectrum systemic fungicide of the benzimidazole group; it will not have any effect if the problem is not due to fungi;
- thiamethoxam is a neonicotinoid insecticide which may control insect vectors of some viruses - if, indeed, an insect transmitted virus is involved.

A large number of pathogens causing diseases of solanaceous crops have been reported from the region (see also previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Leaf curling and wilting symptoms may be caused by a number of these. Reliable molecular diagnosis of any pathogen(s) involved is vital in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the farmers. The problems above may also be due to a combination of pathogens and/or other factors.
