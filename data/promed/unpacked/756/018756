Situation Overview
------------------
As of 24 Nov 2016, a total of 103 cases of cholera have been confirmed by laboratory testing in 31 districts from 12 governorates out of the total 495 samples tested. Additionally 6018 suspected cases (excluding the confirmed cases) reported in 86 districts. The cases are reported from Abyan, Aden, Al-Bayda, Al-Dhale'e, Amanat Al Asimah, Al Hudaydah, Amran, Hajjah, Ibb, Lahj, Sana'a, and Taiz governorates. Cumulatively, 8 cholera confirmed deaths have been reported from Aden, Hajjah, Sana'a, Ibb and Amran. A total of 76 cholera associated deaths (including the confirmed and suspected cases) were reported as of 24 Nov 2016, so the case fatality rate (CFR) for the cholera associated deaths is 1.2 percent.

UN official George Khoury: "So far we have 7700 suspected cases of cholera in 12 governorates in Yemen. We have an increase of 27 percent in the number of suspected cases as compared to last week, although the case fatality rate is declining and that is thanks to the response by the humanitarian partners."

[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. These 2 posts differ widely in both the total number of presumed cases and the number of deaths. Accurate statistics are clearly difficult to assess in Yemen at this point but numbers are likely to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman.

Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen. - Mod.LL
