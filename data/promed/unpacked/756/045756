[This is the 1st report of an HPAI H5N8 outbreak affecting the commercial poultry sector.

On [Thu 12 Jan 2017], Spain reported an event of HPAI subtype H5N8 in wildfowl. Since then, passive surveillance has detected 2 outbreaks. The 1st detection was in 2 wild water fowl (Greylag goose) that were found dead in La Nava de Fuentes Lake, in Palencia, Castilla and Leon.

On [Fri 20 Feb 2017], H5N8 virus was detected in a white stork (_Ciconia ciconia_) found dead at Castello d'Empuries, in the Natural Park of the Aiguamolls de l'Emporda, Girona, Catalonia. See follow-up report No 1 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22327

See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22327

This last case detected in wildlife is located in the same area where the current outbreak in poultry was reported.

"The majority of wild bird migration across Europe, Africa and Asia subsides in November for the winter season. While wintering locations of these migratory birds are often stable, additional movement within a region may be affected by local weather conditions, food resources, access to open water, etc.

Strategic wild-bird surveillance planning and enhanced messaging to poultry farmers to strengthen biosecurity practices before spring migration is warranted, especially if the virus persists over the winter in Europe, North America, and East Asia. Detections in indoor poultry farms where direct contact with wild birds has been considered negligible emphasizes indirect transmission to these production sectors from contaminated environments via fomites or by air, further highlighting the ability of these viruses to persist in the natural environment". http://www.offlu.net/fileadmin/home/en/resource-centre/pdf/H5N8_OFFLU_Statement.pdf. - Mod.CRD
