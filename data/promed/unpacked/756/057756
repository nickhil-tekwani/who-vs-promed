A top health official says a 7th doctor in Sierra Leone has died of Ebola. Dr. Moses Kargbo, who had been a retired medical officer in the Ministry of Health, died on Tue [16 Nov 2014] at the Hastings Ebola Treatment Center east of the capital, Freetown, where he had been receiving treatment. He had been volunteering to help fight the spread of the virus at a government hospital in the central Tonkolili district... - more

[2] Benin: Ebola discounted as cause of death of health workers

Questions and concern are evident in Benin after the deaths of several people in Tanguieta hospital, located in the northwest of the country. These deaths occurred in less than one month in health personnel.

Ebola tests are negative, and the Minister of Health held a press conference on Mon [17 Nov 2014] to reassure the public. Last week, the Ministry of Health was informed of the deaths of 3 members of the St John of God Hospital Tanguieta. Among them were 2 nurses in neonatology. On Fri [14 Nov 2014], a pediatrician died in Porto-Novo, where he had been transferred. The samples were sent to Lagos, Nigeria.

Ebola is not involved in these deaths, explained Dorothee Kinde Gazard, the Minister of Health: "I say and I repeat that these tests came back negative, so we have no case of Ebola virus in our country. We do not intend to hide anything if it is a serious illness that kills the staff."

[3] Mali: 577 contacts being traced

Mali said on Monday [17 Nov 2014] it had placed nearly 600 people who may have been exposed to Ebola under surveillance as the country battles to contain the spread of the deadly tropical virus. The West African nation has been scrambling to prevent a minor outbreak turning into a major crisis after the deaths of a Guinean imam and the Malian nurse who treated him in the capital Bamako. A friend who had visited the imam in the Pasteur clinic also died of probable Ebola, while a doctor at the clinic who contracted the disease was undergoing treatment. A 2-year-old child died of Ebola in an unconnected case in the western town of Kayes in October [2014].

President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, on a visit to the imam's home village of Kouremale on the Mali-Guinea border, urged locals to take all precautions in "the war" against Ebola. "I ask you to redouble your vigilance. We will not close the border, but don't let anyone enter Mali without having washed their hands or taken their temperature," the president told frontier medical workers...

Health Minister Ousmane Kone, who accompanied the president on the trip, said "577 people were under daily observation," up from Sunday's [16 Nov 2014] figure of 442 people who were being monitored for Ebola symptoms. A government official said on Fri [14 Nov 2014] that 2 people who died after exposure to the imam's body were "highly suspected" of having contracted the virus. They are not confirmed cases, however, and have not been counted among the official statistics.

Samba Sow, of the Ebola emergency operations centre, said on Sun [16 Nov 2014] that the western town of Kayes had not reported any new cases in the last 3 weeks and was now considered Ebola-free.

[Washed hands and non-febrile temperatures unfortunately do not guarantee a person is free of the virus, and as we have seen in the case of the Sierra Leonean doctor who died on Monday [17 Nov 2014], even a negative blood test early in the course of infection does not either. But what other measures are feasible other than trying to block as much cross-border traffic as possible, with inevitable repercussions on the supply of food, fuel and other essentials? - Mod.JW]

[4] Mali: Questions over Ebola response
Date: 18 Nov 2014

http://www.irinnews.org/report/100853/questions-over-mali-s-ebola-response


The failure of a top Malian hospital to detect probable cases of Ebola has raised questions about whether the country's health system is sufficiently prepared to tackle the disease...

In Kayes, where a 2-year-old girl tested positive for Ebola on 23 Oct [2014], the hospital was caught off-guard. Only 2 of its 160 workers had received training on how to detect and treat Ebola patients and how to protect themselves while doing so, said hospital director Toumani Konare. "The staff had the right protective gear, but they didn't know how to use it," he told IRIN.

Before the current outbreak in Mali, the World Health Organization (WHO) had categorized the country as at-risk, due to its long border and strong economic ties with Guinea, where the epidemic began. It was targeted as a country to receive technical assistance, including training on infection prevention, epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing. Sow said preparations started in April [2014]. However, those preparations were focused mostly on the 805 km border that Mali shares with Guinea.

The government started to send a few health workers to check travellers for fever and other signs of the virus among the chaos of trucks, buses, bush taxis and motorbikes at border checkpoints. The Ministry of Health says the Kouremale border checkpoint, where an imam who died of Ebola in Mali on 27 Oct [2014] had entered from Guinea, checks more than 1000 people and 150 vehicles per day...

Ibrahima Soce-Fall, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Mali, said the country has the capacity to tackle the disease. "You can't say Mali wasn't prepared; people were trained," Fall told IRIN, although he did not specify how many. The Malian authorities are working with international partners, among them WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control, UNICEF, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, NGO Alima, and Croix Rouge Mali to trace, isolate and monitor over 400 contacts [now nearly 600, see [3] above] of those who have died. Several WHO epidemiologists will soon join CNAM's rapid response team of doctors, nurses, social workers and laboratory technicians.

Oumar Ouologuem, a communications officer with the Ministry of Health, said the government is planning an isolation and treatment centre in Siby, 50 km southwest of the capital. "When we started making plans for a centre in town, the neighbours objected," said Ouologuem. "That's why we decided to find a location outside the capital." The authorities say the site will open if they have more cases but could not give a precise date.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has set up 2 treatment centres, one in Bamako and one in Kayes. For the moment, its treatment centre in Bamako is the only one there. Natalia Torrent, the Ebola response coordinator in Mali for MSF-Spain, told IRIN they have 6 beds for suspected cases and 6 for confirmed cases, adding: "We are working on enlarging the site and giving technical advice on how to set up the CNAM treatment centre."

In one area, at least, Mali's health system seems to be already up to speed. Mali's national laboratory, SEREFO, on one of the hills overlooking Bamako, boasts a level-3 biosafety laboratory, equipped by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), to handle the diagnosis of tuberculosis, HIV and Ebola. SEREFO director Ousmane Koita said their lab can get Ebola test results within a few hours. Even so, if the number of suspected cases continues to rise, it will have a hard time keeping up.
