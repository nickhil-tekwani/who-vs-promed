Latest Kenya anthrax test negative
----------------------------------
NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya's health minister says 2 letters sent to the
United Nations in Nairobi that were suspected to contain anthrax have
tested negative.
The announcement came a day after Kenyan health officials said preliminary
tests on another letter sent to a Nairobi businessman had tested positive
for anthrax. Health Minister Sam Ongeri said on Friday that 4 other
suspicious letters received in Kenya had been tested and found to be free
of anthrax, but results were still awaited on a further 2 suspect letters.
The letter that tested positive was mailed on September 8 from the U.S.
[Atlanta via Miami and was received in Nairobi on October 9. It was opened
on October 11.

[At this point one must wonder aloud as to whether this "anthrax" isolate
was checked to see whether they were of Sterne vaccine, i.e., pX02 -ve. If
it is, that parcel was a hoax. If not, its strain relationship to the
FL-NY-DC cultures will be very revealing. - Mod.MHJ
