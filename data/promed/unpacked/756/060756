Abstract
-------
Hugh-Jones and Blackburn and Turnbull's collective World Health Organization (WHO) report did literature reviews of the theories and the bases for causes of anthrax outbreaks. Both comment on an often-mentioned suspicion that, even though unproven, latent infections are likely involved. Hugh-Jones suggested Gainer do an updated review of our present-day knowledge of latent infections, which was the basis for Gainer's talk at the Biology of Anthrax Conference in Bari, Italy, 2019. At the conference, Gainer met Vergnaud, who presented anthrax genome studies that implied the disease might have spread throughout Asia and from Europe to North America in a short time span of 3 or 4 centuries. Vergnaud wondered if latent infections might have played a role in the process. Several other presenters at the conference also mentioned results that might suggest the existence of latent infections. Vergnaud subsequently looked into some of the old French literature about related observations, results, and discussions of early Pasteur vaccine usage (late 1800s) and found mentions of suspected latent infections. The 1st part of the paper is a focused summary and interpretation of Hugh-Jones and Blackburn's and Turnbull's reviews specifically looking for suggestions of latent infections, a few additional studies with slightly different approaches, and several mentions made of presentations and posters at the conference in Italy. In general, many different investigators in different areas and aspects of the anthrax study at the conference found reasons to suspect the existence of latent infections. The authors conclude that the affected species most studied, including _Homo sapiens_, provide circumstantial evidence of latent infections and modified host resistance. The last part of the review explores the research needed to prove or disprove the existence of latent infections.

[Latent _Bacillus anthracis_ infections have been known for a number of decades, but their true nature and frequency is uncertain. They allow an infection to last some 9+ months to the following summer, possibly longer, and with reduced innate resistance, thanks to the summer heat, to overwhelm the carrying animal. The latter dies and thus can initiate further cases. In retrospect, they most easily explain how the pathogen moved from the Spanish colonists' imported cattle in southern Texas and the missions into the mobs of plains bison filling the region and the extensive plains, and with the latter's seasonal migrations, moved carcass by carcass north to Alberta and the wood bison of the Northwest Territories. We see it today in acute cases in animals in pastures and meadows where cases have not been seen before or the wrong time of year. It is reflected in anomalies of time and space. Inflamed and infected mesenteric lymph nodes have been found, at slaughter inspection, in healthy pigs after the farm had suffered an anthrax outbreak due to contaminated pig feed some 6+ months earlier. Latent infections are there but hard to see and harder to prove after the animal(s) died.

Logically they should exist in the survivors of outbreaks as an incidental event. Until we look, we won't know their prevalence, and animals going to slaughter would be a place to start. Hypothetically, I suspect it might be how anthrax survives in the white tail deer of west Texas, where contaminated soil is very rarely found in relation to affected dead deer. I and others have sampled soils from under dead deer again and again and again and found nothing, though _B. anthracis_ were recovered from the deer. And latent infections would allow the pathogen to survive in regions with acid pH soils with little or no calcium. Checking deer carcasses and viscera at dressing stations in an area that had suffered anthrax cases in the deer the previous summer would be another place to start.

I know that latent _B. anthracis_ infections are out there and probably more common than we realise. Most probably come to nothing, other than a prolonged positive titre. But if they exist, they will have an epidemiological niche important for the survival of this organism. Seek and ye shall find. - Mod.MHJ]
