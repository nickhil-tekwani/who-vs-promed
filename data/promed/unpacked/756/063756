Oklahoma has experienced a 283% increase in the number of congenital syphilis cases in women since 2014. The Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) is already seeing a 92% increase in the number of cases from 2018 to 2019, and is urging health care providers to test patients during the 1st and 3rd trimesters.

Terrainia Harris, an administrative program manager for the OSDH Sexual Health and Harm Reduction (SHHR) Service, said it is important for women to be tested at the 1st prenatal visit or at the time pregnancy is confirmed, and again early in the 3rd trimester.

"The most effective method for getting ahead of this epidemic is early testing and treatment," Harris said. "The resurgence of syphilis cases in recent years highlights the fact that challenges remain and we are encouraging clinicians to get back to basics with syphilis prevention, testing, and treatment. We are asking them to assist us in focusing efforts to strengthen treatment administration and adherence, as well as improve case identification and reporting."

The OSDH is working to address the issue by collaborating with health care providers and community partners to engage in education, partnership, and planning. The SHHR Service is hosting a call to action for providers, [8 Nov 2019], at the Nicholson Conference Center on the University of Oklahoma Medical Center campus. To register for the event, providers can visit https://addressingcongenitalsyphilis.eventbrite.com.

Prenatal care is a key component to the overall health and wellness of a mother and her unborn child. The sooner a woman begins receiving medical care during pregnancy, the better the health outcomes for her and the unborn baby. Anyone wishing to be tested for syphilis or any other sexually transmitted infection should contact a health care provider or a local county health department. Information: (405) 271-4636.

[Congenital syphilis occurs when a fetus is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Increases in primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis among women are of particular concern because congenital syphilis cases tend to increase as the rates of P&S syphilis increase in women (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/figures/44.htm).

The following is extracted from the latest US CDC "Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2018", available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats18/STDSurveillance2018-full-report.pdf. Figures, Tables and References are available at this URL:

"Congenital syphilis [page 29]
------------------------------
"After decreasing from 10.5 to 8.4 reported congenital syphilis cases per 100 000 live births during 2008-2012, the rate of reported congenital syphilis has subsequently increased each year since 2012 (Table 1). In 2018, there were a total of 1306 reported cases of congenital syphilis, including 78 syphilitic stillbirths and 16 infant deaths, and a national rate of 33.1 cases per 100 000 live births. This rate represents a 39.7% increase relative to 2017 (23.7 cases per 100 000 live births) and a 185.3% increase relative to 2014 (11.6 cases per 100 000 live births).

"As has been observed historically, this increase in the congenital syphilis rate has paralleled increases in P&S syphilis among all women and reproductive-aged women during 2014-2018 (172.7% and 165.4% increases, respectively) (Figure 49, Table 28).

"During 2014-2018, the increase in reported congenital syphilis cases was primarily attributable to increases in the West and South. During this period, the congenital syphilis rate increased 278.9% in the West, 190.3% in the South, 84.8% in the Northeast, and 45.9% in the Midwest (Table 41). During 2017-2018, the congenital syphilis rate increased 49.5% in the South, 44.1% in the Northeast, 30.5% in the Midwest, and 29.3% in the West. In 2018, the highest congenital syphilis rates were reported from the West (48.5 cases per 100 000 live births), followed by the South (44.7 cases per 100 000 live births), Midwest (12.4 cases per 100 000 live births), and the Northeast (8.5 cases per 100 000 live births). In addition, rates were highest among Blacks (86.6 cases per 100 000 live births) and AI/AN [American Indians/Alaska Natives] (79.2 cases per 100 000 live births), followed by Hispanics (44.7 cases per 100 000 live births), Whites (13.5 cases per 100 000 live births), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births) (Table 42)."

"Congenital Syphilis [Special focus profiles - page 45]
-------------------------------------------------------
"Syphilis is an important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The consequences of untreated maternal infection can include fetal and infant death, preterm birth, and congenital infection in a proportion of surviving infants, resulting in both physical and mental developmental disabilities. Most cases of congenital syphilis are preventable if women are screened for syphilis and treated early during prenatal care.

"Trends in congenital syphilis usually mirror trends in primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis among reproductive-aged women. After plateauing at a relatively low rate (0.9 cases per 100,000 females) during 2011-2013, the rate of reported cases of P&S syphilis among all women has increased each year since then (Figure 49). During 2014-2018, the rate among women increased 172.7%, from 1.1 to 3.0 cases per 100 000 females (Table 28). During this same period, the rate among reproductive-aged women (women aged 15-44 years) increased 165.4%, from 2.6 to 6.9 cases per 100,000 females aged 15-44 years (Figure 49).

"Similarly, the rate of reported congenital syphilis cases has increased each year since 2012 (Table 1). In 2018, there were 1306 reported cases of congenital syphilis, with a rate of 33.1 cases per 100 000 live births, the highest rate reported since 1995. This increase in 2018 represents a 39.7% increase relative to 2017 and a 291.0% increase relative to 2012 (Table 41).

"In 2018, the highest rates of reported P&S syphilis cases among women
and the highest rates of reported congenital syphilis cases were observed in the West and in the South (Figures I and J, Tables 28 and 41). The rate of P&S syphilis among women increased in every region during 2017-2018. During 2017- 2018, the largest rate increase among women occurred in the West (41.2%), followed by the Northeast (40.0%), South (30.8%), and Midwest (30.8%) (Table 28). The congenital syphilis rate increased 49.5% in the South, 44.1% in the Northeast, 30.5% in the Midwest, and 29.3% in the West during 2017-2018 (Table 41).

"Although most cases of congenital syphilis occur among infants whose mothers have had some prenatal care, late or limited prenatal care has been associated with congenital syphilis. Failure of health care providers to adhere to prenatal syphilis screening recommendations, as well as acquisition of infection during pregnancy after the initial screening test, also contribute to the occurrence of congenital syphilis."
