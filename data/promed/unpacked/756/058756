Recent developments indicate that the cause of the outbreak was probably a
food display unit that aerosolised a thin mist containing _Legionella_ in
the area's Copthorne Hotel. This has not been directly confirmed as the
only source, however The Western Mail (a local newspaper)and a local TV
programme "the Ferret" indicated the food display unit as the probable cause.
