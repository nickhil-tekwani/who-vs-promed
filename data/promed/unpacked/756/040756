Rich Products Corporation, a Buffalo, NY firm, is recalling approximately 196 222 pounds of frozen chicken quesadilla and various other heat treated, not fully cooked frozen mini meals and snack items because they may be contaminated with _E. coli_ O121, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 28 Mar 2013.

The following products are subject to FSIS recall:
7.2-oz. cartons of Farm Rich mini pizza slices with cheese pepperoni and sauce in pizza dough, UPC code 041322376909 with a best by date of 15 or 16 May 2014.
22-oz. cartons of Farm Rich mini pizza slices with cheese pepperoni and sauce in pizza dough, UPC code 041322356437 with a best by date of 15 or 16 May 2014.
18-oz. bags of Farm Rich mini quesadillas with cheese, grilled white meat chicken in a crispy crust, UPC code 041322356352 with a best by date of 14 May 2014.
21-oz. bags of Farm Rich philly cheese steaks with cheese, beef & onions in a crispy crust, UPC code 041322356345 with a best by date of 13 May 2014.

In addition, the following products, which fall under FDA jurisdiction, are also being recalled. FSIS is issuing this news release to make the public aware that these products are also considered potentially adulterated and should be properly discarded or destroyed:

22-oz. cartons of Farm Rich mozzarella bites in a pizzeria style crust, UPC code 041322374431 with a best by date of 19 May 2014.
7-oz. cartons of Farm Rich mozzarella bites in a pizzeria style crust, UPC code 041322376916 with a best by date of 19 May 2014.
22-oz. bags of Market Day Mozzarella Bites, UPC code 041322804358 with a best by date of 12 May 2014.

Each product package above contains the establishment number "EST. 27232" or "P-27232" inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The products subject to recall were produced between 12 Nov 2012 and 19 Nov 2012 then distributed for retail sale nationwide. FSIS and the establishment are concerned that some product may be present in household freezers.

FSIS was notified of a multistate investigation of _E. coli_ O121 illnesses on 19 Mar 2013. Food samples were collected from an ill individual in New York as part of this investigation and tested by the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Laboratory. At present, the cluster includes 24 cases in 15 states. A sample of a Farm Rich frozen chicken mini quesadilla product from a New York case tested positive for the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O121. Eight cases in Michigan, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia report consuming Farm Rich products. FSIS is continuing to work with federal and state public health partners on this investigation, including the New York State Department of Health, New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls/Open_Federal_Cases/index.asp.

Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, such as serotypes O26, O103, O45, O111, O121 or O145, because they [can be] harder to identify. Infection with _E. coli_ O121 can result in dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2-8 days (3-4 days, on average) after exposure to the organism. While most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called HUS, hemolytic uremic syndrome. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. Symptoms of HUS may include fever, abdominal pain, pale skin tone, fatigue, small, unexplained bruises or bleeding from the nose and mouth, decreased urination, and swelling. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

[This outbreak once again underscores the relevance of non-O157 strains of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (1), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (2).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear. Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in EHEC infections treated with antimicrobials (3), antimicrobials should not used for known acute cases.
