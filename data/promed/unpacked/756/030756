[ProMED-mail is very pleased to have the official report of the
outbreak and especially information from an official source indicating
the avian influenza subtype, the quantitative scope of the outbreak
and location. It is to be noted that we have had previous reports this
year from unofficial sources in June and April [2011] indicating
outbreaks in poultry, rather than wild ducks. ProMED-mail is very
appreciative of having these previous reports so that we can provide a
complete global picture of this most important disease.

This is an example of excellent international scientific cooperation
in that results were confirmed at Ilaria Capua's OIE reference
laboratory in Padova as a comparison of the outbreak strain with other
strains in the world and that this outbreak strain can be put in
proper context with other global information. Any results in terms of
subtype, quantitative descriptions or geographic location from
previous outbreaks in poultry or any results from the current active
surveillance would also be most welcome. The location of the current
outbreak in wild ducks is in the same general region of the country
that our previous reports of outbreaks in poultry. For more details,
please see Mod.AS comments in the archives, listed below.

The location of the outbreak can be seen appended to the OIE report
reference above or at the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map
showing the location of Mazandaran, Iran:
