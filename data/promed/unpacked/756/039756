Congo virus has been detected in Booni Chitral district after a butcher of Afghan nationality has been tested positive. Two butcher shops in the area have been sealed and the butchers and family members asked to undergo testing for the virus. Of note, butchery and bread baking (Tandoor nan bai) jobs are taken up by Afghan nationals.

Residents of the area immediately expressed their fear and demanded from the government to send special medical teams to Booni to get the people tested for the virus and take preventive measures for its spread.

An Afghan national residing in Chitral, who tested positive for Congo virus, has been treated successfully at a Peshawar hospital.

A senior doctor in Chitral told Dawn that N.S., 60, was admitted to the district headquarters hospital, Chitral, for high fever and his condition deteriorated during the course of treatment due to which he was referred to a major hospital in Peshawar.

He said some of the symptoms of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were observed in him, including high fever, headache, vomiting and joint pains, but there was no facility of diagnosis in the hospital.

He said the blood sample of the patient was sent to Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, where the presence of the virus was established, and he was treated accordingly. He said the patient had completely recovered, adding the rate of recovery was only one among one million patients in CCHF fever.

According to the doctor, as a preventive measure and to forestall the virus in the area, it had been recommended in a meeting at the DC office that the blood samples of the family members of the Afghan national, who is a butcher, should be sent to laboratory for tests.

However, district health officer Dr. Iftikhar said that the expenses of the blood screening for the Congo virus cost Rs.6000 [approx. USD 43] per person and no funds were available for this purpose, so no test had been carried out.

Assistant commissioner, Mastuj, Inayatullah said the shop of the butcher was being sealed after fulfilling the legal formalities and he would be prevented from slaughtering animals any longer as he was a potential transmitter of the virus.

[The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.

Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.

According to the details in above news, the patient reported to a major hospital in Peshawar Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and CCHF diagnosis was confirmed. The last statement regarding the patient being a 'transmitter' of the virus is misleading as virus remains detectable in human blood for up to 2 weeks after the onset of illness, but once the patient has recovered and feel well and are no longer bleeding, they can be discharged from hospital. Although there has been no indication that virus continue to be excreted in body fluids, patients are recommended to refrain from intimate (sexual) contact with other people for 6 weeks after recovery from the disease as a precaution against spread of infection. After recovery, patients remain immune to further infection.

Therefore, the statement regarding sealing the butcher's shop would be appropriate if considered in context of exposure of other people to infected animal carcasses and meat, etc, but the patient can no longer transmit the virus once he has fully recovered. - Mod.UBA
