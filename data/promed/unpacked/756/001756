Two new suspected cases suggest the Ebola outbreak continues to spread
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MAKOKOU: Doctors confirmed on Sat 29 Dec 2001 that a 16 year old boy has
Ebola virus [fever? and another patient has similar symptoms, prompting
fears that the deadly disease is continuing to spread in Central Africa.
The boy was admitted last week at Makokou's hospital and tested for Ebola
virus, which already has killed 21 people in Gabon and neighboring Republic
of Congo, regional health director Prosper Abessolo Mengue said on
Saturday. [The other patient was admitted on Fri 28 Dec 2001 with symptoms
of the disease, including fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Neither patient is
known to have had contact with any of the previous victims, raising the
possibility of still more unidentified cases.
"This is very worrying," said Dr Julien Meyong, medical chief of the
hospital in Makokou, which is about 360 miles east of the capital,
Libreville. Medical officials have identified 18 Ebola cases in this remote
part of Gabon since the outbreak began in late October, according to
government figures. So far 15 of these patients have died. In addition 12
more suspected cases have been identified in neighboring Republic of Congo,
with 6 deaths. The affected region is one of the most thinly populated in
both countries. It is covered by vast forests with tiny villages inhabited
by Pygmies and other hunter tribes. A team of medical experts from the
World Health Organization and Gabon's Health Ministry arrived in December
and has been working with military doctors to trace victims, treat
patients, and educate people about the disease. The international aid
group, Medecins Sans Frontieres, also is helping. Medical experts currently
are monitoring 206 people, 91 in Gabon and 115 in Republic of Congo, who
may have had contact with those infected with Ebola virus. Everyone who has
had contact with the 2 new suspected cases described in this report, if
confirmed to have Ebola fever, would be added to that list.

[These two new suspected cases, with no apparent links to previous cases,
are an unwelcome development. However, the report is ambiguous with regard
to the basis for the diagnosis of Ebola fever, consequently assessment of
the future course of the outbreak should be withheld pending clarification.
