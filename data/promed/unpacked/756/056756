1st case of lymphogranuloma venereum in Switzerland
---------------------------------------------------
The 1st case of infectious lymphogranuloma venererum (LGV) was
discovered in the canton of Geneva. This presents a "worrisome event"
for the Federal Department of Health. The patient is a 31 year old
HIV negative homosexual man. BAG (Bundesamt fur Gesundheit or Federal
Department of Health) reported on Mon, 19 Jun 2005, that the
infection was contracted ostensibly while engaging in unprotected sex
in Germany.

LGV, also known as Nicolas-Favre disease, had almost disappeared in
industrialized nations. In certain regions of Asia, Africa, and South
America, it is found in localized areas. The 1st epidemic cases were
detected in several European countries within homosexual communities
in 2004. Though this infection is reportable by law, notification may
not occur.

It is likely according to the BAG that other cases have occurred, but
have not been reported. Retrospective analysis of all laboratory
specimens in the canton of Geneva since the beginning of 2004
revealed 2 other suspected cases. In each of these cases, homosexual
men were involved.
