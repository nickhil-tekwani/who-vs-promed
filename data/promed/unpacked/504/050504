Since 4 Sep 2006, a bluetongue-like disease has been observed in more
than 40 cattle farms situated along the eastern border of Israel,
concentrating in 80 km of the Jordan rift valley, from the Arava
valley in the south to the north of Galilee at the north.
The index case might have taken place at the end of Aug 2006.
There has been morbidity of 10 to 40 percent, with very low
mortality. No cases seen in adjacent sheep and goats farms.
Farm Type: Most Dairy, few Beef and Feedlot.
Breeds: mainly Holstein.
Age: from heifers and calves of 1 year onward.
Clinical signs:
General: Reduced milk production, anorexia, reduced rumination,
fever, weakness, dyspnea.
Oronasal symptoms: clear to purulent nasal discharge, salivation,
nasal and lips redness and scaling, tongue swelling and erosions.
Ocular lesions: conjunctival hyperemia, redness and oedema.
Gait symptoms: Stiff gait, lameness, muscle tremors, recumbency.
Different farmers and vets report different clinical signs; not all
the above clinical signs seen on the same farm.
Duration of clinical disease: Several to 14 days.
Of 6 samples, 2 from the field which were sent to Pirbright were
found positive to EHD [Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease]. All the
samples were negative to bluetongue.
More samples were sent for diagnosis to England. Other laboratory
investigations are in process.
The affected farms have been put under quarantine. Farmers were
instructed to spray the cattle and environment with certified
insecticides since it seems that the disease is spread by insects.
The treatment of affected cows is symptomatic.

[The pdf document at the above URL includes also 4 pictures of
clinical cases: buccal, nasal, ocular, and teat lesions. It also
includes a map, updated 19 Sep 2006, presenting the reported
outbreaks. A spread into the lower Galilee and Golan, respectively
west and east of the Lake of Tiberias, can be seen.
From reliable sources we noted occurrence of similar cases in the
Kingdom of Jordan, on the east side of the Jordan rift valley.
Information from other countries in the region on this emerging
disease will be appreciated.
Confirmation from IAH, Pirbright of the EHD virus (EHDV) involvement,
and results of its serotyping, are anticipated. It will be
interesting to be informed if there is similarity between the EHDV in
the Eastern Mediterranean and the one found involved in the emerging
cattle disease, recently notified to the OIE by Morocco (see 20060918.2660).
Interestingly, during 2004, an untyped EHDV was isolated at IAH,
Pirbright from blood of cattle exhibiting clinical symptoms in
Morocco, close to the Algerian border. The 14 sick cattle were
co-habitant with healthy sheep; 3 of them died. The isolate,
designated MOR2004/03, was identified in 12 of the investigated
cattle by virus species (serogroup) specific ELISA and RT-PCR. These
data are available in the table "Isolates of Epizootic hemorrhagic
disease virus (EHDV) in the dsRNA virus collection at IAH Pirbright,"
accessible at:
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/EHDV-isolates.htm>.
EHDV is an orbivirus, transmitted by culicoides -- similarly to
bluetongue and African Horse Sickness viruses. One of its 9 known
serotypes, EHDV-2, includes the Ibaraki virus (IBAV) which is the
causative agent of the (erosive, bluetongue-like) Ibaraki cattle
disease in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. See fact-sheet on "Diseases
Caused by the Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Serogroup" at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/epizootic_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf>.
