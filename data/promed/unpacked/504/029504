Dengue advisory - Cuba (Havana) 990517221502

From: Gustavo Kouri <GKouri@ipk.sld.cu>

I want to provide information about the press report of a journal from
Puerto Rico about dengue in Cuba [see archived reference above - Mod.CHC.
The last outbreak of dengue in Cuba was in one Municipality (Santiago
deCuba) in 1997. The last case was reported on Nov. 1997. SINCE THEN CUBA
IS AGAIN DENGUE FREE.
As [Jack Woodall mentioned, this information was probably related (I did
not see the mentioned TV programme) to _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites in
the city. Cuba is seriously involved in the very difficult task to
eradicate [this dengue virus vector in the island. 600 breeding sites in
a city of 2 millions inhabitants is an extremely low premise index, but
obviously indicates how carefully we are following this programme.
The TV programme probably focused the need of a higher involvement of the
community in the vector control activity, considering that for a
sustainable programme you need an active community participation. Most of
the municipalities in Cuba are now free from the vector there are still
some areas in which eradication has not been achieved. The human and
financial resources for this programme are available. We are convinced
that the only way to maintain [this country without dengue is to keep the
mosquito under a very tight control programme.
According to PAHO all the countries in Latin America, with the exception of
Uruguay and Chile, reported dengue in 1998, as did most of the Caribbean
islands.
This is what we can inform about this misinformation.
