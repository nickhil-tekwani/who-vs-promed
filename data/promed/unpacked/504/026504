Heavy losses worth hundreds of thousands of shekels (1 shekel = USD
0.263) have been incurred in Gaza as a result of the death of tens of
thousands of poultry by a strange and sudden disease. The affected
breeders obtained the hatching eggs from inside the Green line [from
the Israeli territory]. They demanded compensations from the
competent authorities for the losses and demanded punishment of the traders.

[A farmer] suffered a serious trauma and grief by the death of most
of his poultry, at the cost of about 20 000 shekels [USD 5260], after
29 days of raising the birds. During the said period everything went
well, to be suddenly hit by the disease. He immediately contacted a
doctor and the veterinarian vaccinated all the remaining chickens to
salvage them; in vain -- death continued at an accelerated pace. In
less than 48 hours, more than 1500 chickens died. "When the situation
got worse, I had to sell the rest of the [poultry on] farm at the
cheapest prices."

[ProMED-mail has noted, unofficially, that the cause of the described
losses was suspected to be infectious bronchitis and that it affected
egg-type chicks. Details on the vaccination scheme applied and the
vaccine(s) used will help. And, since chicken lines differ in genetic
disease susceptibility, information on the genetic line of the
affected flocks may also help in evaluating the background to the heavy losses.

The following information is derived from the preface to chapter
2.3.2 , "Avian infectious bronchitis," OIE's 'Manual of Diagnostic
Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals', 2009:

"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is caused by coronavirus infectious
bronchitis virus (IBV). The virus causes infections mainly in
chickens and is a significant pathogen of commercial meat and egg
type birds. IB is an acute, contagious disease characterised
primarily by respiratory signs in growing chickens. In hens,
decreased egg production and quality are often observed. Some strains
of the virus are nephropathogenic and produce interstitial nephritis
and mortality. The severity of IBV induced respiratory disease is
enhanced by the presence of bacterial pathogens leading to chronic
complicated airsacculitis. Diagnosis of IB requires virus isolation
or demonstration of viral nucleic acid from diseased flocks.
Demonstration of an ascending serum antibody response may also be
useful. The widespread use of live and inactivated vaccines may
complicate both the interpretation of virus isolation and serology
findings. The occurrence of antigenic variant strains may overcome
immunity induced by vaccination."
