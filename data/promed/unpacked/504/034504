Comment on the report of Leishmaniasis in Wajir district, Kenya
--------------------------------------------
I was interested to note that kala azar is affecting a population "already
in the middle of a devastating drought". As I commented previously, based
on work in the Sudan, it seems likely that the population is constantly
exposed to the bites of infected sandflies, but individuals do not become
acutely ill until stress degrades the immune system to the point that the
parasite can multiply unchecked. The source of stress easily could be
either famine, or HIV infections.

[Ellicott McConnell is absolutely right in emphasizing famine as a
contributing factor in outbreaks of leishmaniasis. The reason for
discussing HIV again and repeatedly asking for data on HIV in the area is
that leishmaniasis is one of the infections that are associated with
HIV/AIDS. With increasing HIV prevalence in many African countries
outbreaks of leishmaniasis can be expected, but to my knowledge have not
been reported so far. - Mod.EP
