The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that a total of 1459 cholera cases, including 31 deaths, have been reported in South Sudan by [Sat 7 Jun 2014], UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on [Mon 9 Jun 2014]. "The outbreak is spreading to Yei and Kajo Keji in Central Equatoria State," Dujarric said at a daily news briefing.

WHO reported that 7 cases have been confirmed in the Juba Protection of Civilians areas as of [Sun 8 Jun 2014], with additional suspected cases under investigation.

Since the outbreak of cholera in the capital Juba in mid-May 2014, the reported cholera caseload has doubled every day, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said. After the 1st case was confirmed in Juba on 15 May 2014, more than 130 additional cases were treated, UNICEF said on 19 May 2014.

Since January 2014, UNICEF has warned of the threat of cholera, due to the desperate overcrowding of camps following continued violence, and now the rainy season. In May 2014, UNICEF said that unless nutrition treatment is scaled up immediately, up to 50 000 children under the age of 5 are likely to die.

In response to the cholera outbreak, UNICEF has helped establish a cholera treatment center (CTC) at the Juba Teaching Hospital. It also provided life-saving supplies, including medicines, protective gear, and equipment, and is expanding preventive measures to halt further spread across the country.

On the protection of civilians sites, OCHA said that the relocation of 13 500 internally displaced persons from Tomping is expected to start on 16 Jun 2014.

In Malakal, Upper Nile State, the UN secretary-general's special representative for South Sudan, Hilde F Johnson, on [Mon 9 Jun 2014] inaugurated a new protection of civilians site, Dujarric said. "The new facility can accommodate between 8000 and 9000 internally displaced persons."

"The relocations have already started in Malakal," he said. " As of 7 Jun 2014, some 3100 had moved to the new site."
