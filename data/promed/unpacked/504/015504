The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) for Polio Eradication on [Thu 27 Jun 2019] confirmed that 5 more polio cases had been detected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. 2 cases had been found in Bannu, 2 from Torkhar, and 1 from North Waziristan, Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio Babar Bin Atta said in a statement.

He said that a fake drama was created against polio vaccine in Peshawar and advised the parents to avoid considering any such propaganda against polio vaccine and vaccinate their children to protect them from polio virus.

He said that due to this fake drama, some parents of far-flung areas were reluctant to vaccinate their children. He urged polio workers and provincial health officials to pay special focus on far-flung areas of KP and asked the province to utilize all resources to eradicate polio.

He said despite the significant achievements of the programme, the cunning poliovirus was still surviving and find a way for its survival, therefore special immunization campaign was planned in all core reservoirs to kill the wild polio virus forever.

He said that the government was committed and striving to hit the virus hard through this special immunization campaign. This was top priority to focus on reaching still missed children in core reservoir through continued improvement of operations and capacitating frontline polio workers to reach and protect every missed child with the vital polio vaccine.

He stressed that parents should protect their children from virus through repeated vaccinations as each time drops were offered by dedicated polio workers during the campaign.

He said polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of 5. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death.

He added while there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Each time a child under the age of 5 is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased.

He said that repeated immunizations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio free.

Pakistan's struggles to eradicate the poliovirus were further compounded as 5 new cases were confirmed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) on [Thu 27 Jun 2019].

In a video message, Babar bin Atta, the prime minister's focal person on polio eradication, said 2 cases were traced in Torghar, 2 in Bannu, and 1 in North Waziristan.

He said the emergence of these new cases was evidence of the disastrous effect of a recent propaganda campaign against the polio vaccine. Babar urged parents to recognise that such propaganda campaigns were simply aimed at disrupting Pakistan's polio eradication efforts.

"Due to the drama recently staged in Peshawar, people living in remote areas of K-P are now more hesitant to have their children vaccinated. These areas now require our special attention if Pakistan is to eliminate polio any time soon," he said.

Earlier this year [2019], public hospitals of Peshawar were filled to capacity with over 25 000 children brought by their parents for check-ups after fake news spread that children were falling sick after taking anti-polio drops.

The new cases raised the total number of polio cases in Pakistan this year to 32, following the 3 cases reported in K-P on [20 Jun 2019].

The greatest number of cases -- 19 -- have been reported in K-P, followed by 7 in K-P's tribal districts, 3 in Punjab, and 3 in Sindh.

With 6 months still remaining, this year's [2019] tally is already the highest since 2016, when a total of 20 cases were reported throughout Pakistan. Moreover, the number of cases confirmed by mid-June 2019 is [4] times 2017's total of 8, which was the lowest figure in the country since 2012.

Pakistan is 1 of just 3 countries in the world, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, that have endemic polio, a once-common childhood virus that can cause paralysis or death. The country's success follows an intense programme based around vaccinating vulnerable children.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), polio has been all but wiped out across the world following a sustained vaccination campaign, with only 22 cases reported in 2017 against more than 350 000 in 1988.

[According to the End Polio Pakistan website, the distribution of districts reporting cases in KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and KPTD (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts is presented below (in addition to the 3 cases reported from Punjab province and 3 cases reported from Sindh province.)

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (18 cases)
Bannu 11
Hangu 1
DI Khan 1
Shangla 1
Torghar 3
Lakki Marwat 1

KPTD (8 cases)
Bajour 1
Khyber 1
Miran Shah 2
Mir Ali 4

I was intrigued when I saw the comment that this year (2019) has more cases reported than the last major reporting year of 2016, noting the 3 year interval, reminiscent of the cyclical presentation of polio outbreaks in the earlier years following widespread use of the vaccines. Are we entering a background picture of cyclical "outbreaks" taking 3-5 years to build up a susceptible population to support epidemic cycles of polio among the pockets of unvaccinated individuals? Checking the WHO vaccine preventable surveillance data it is difficult to tease out such an association, but.... (see http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/countries?countrycriteria%5Bcountry%5D%5B%5D=PAK&commit=OK).

With respect to the global picture, with the addition of these 5 newly confirmed cases in Pakistan, and the 1 newly confirmed case from Afghanistan (see Poliomyelitis update (53): Afghanistan (OZ) 20190626.6539747) the global number of confirmed cases of WPV1 associated polio reported since 1 Jan 2019 is now up to 42.
