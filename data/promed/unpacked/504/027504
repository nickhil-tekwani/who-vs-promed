HANTAVIRUS INFECTION - USA (NEVADA)
***********************************
Date: Wed, 23 Jul 1997 17:39:19 -0700
From: Hacsi Horvath <varmint@well.com> [ProMED-mail Special Correspondent]
According to news reports (San Francisco Examiner, July 20, 1997), a
California man fell ill on July 5 of a hantavirus infection. He had been
sweeping a dust and, presumably, mouse droppings, from an old camper that he
had stored in Washoe Valley, south of Reno, Nevada. He was admitted to
hospital on July 10 with respiratory failure, but is now recovering at home.

[A great proportion of hantavirus case patients appear to be surviving. This
is good but does anyone have an idea why this might be so? At least some of
the patients have not received antivirals. I have listed this under
"Nevada", although the case patient lives in California. -- Mod CHC]
