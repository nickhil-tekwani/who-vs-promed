Malaysian bat virus associated with acute respiratory disease in humans
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Kaw Bing Chua and colleagues report the isolation of a previously unknown
orthoreovirus of bat origin, which is associated with an acute respiratory
disease in humans.
Respiratory infections constitute the most widespread human infectious
disease, and a substantial proportion of them are caused by unknown
etiological agents. Reoviruses (respiratory enteric orphan viruses) are
double-stranded RNA viruses 1st isolated from humans in the early 1950s,
and so named because they were not associated with any known disease.
Chua et al now report identification of a previously unknown reovirus
(provisionally designated "Melaka virus") isolated from a 39 year old male
patient in Melaka, Malaysia, who was suffering from high fever and acute
respiratory disease at the time of virus isolation. Two of his family
members developed similar symptoms about one week later and had serological
evidence of infection with the same virus. Epidemiological tracing revealed
that the family was exposed to a bat in the house about one week before the
onset of the father's clinical symptoms.
Genome sequence analysis indicated a close genetic relationship between
Melaka virus and Pulau virus, a reovirus isolated in 1999 from fruit bats
in Tioman Island, Malaysia. Screening of sera collected from human
volunteers on the island revealed that 14 of 109 (13 per cent) were
positive for both Pulau and Melaka viruses. This is the 1st report of an
orthoreovirus in association with acute human respiratory diseases.
Melaka virus is serologically not related to the different types of
mammalian reoviruses that were known to infect humans asymptomatically.
These data indicate that batborne reoviruses can be transmitted to and
cause clinical diseases in humans.

be important to establish whether similar bat reoviruses associated with
human respiratory infection occur beyond Malaysia and whether the agent is
restricted to fruit bats. - Mod.CP
