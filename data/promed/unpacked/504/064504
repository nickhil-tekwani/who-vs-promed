Four more outbreaks of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been confirmed in the United States, as the epidemic continues. The outbreaks are added to the rising number of avian flu detections in the hardest-hit states of Minnesota and Iowa.

There have now been 174 detections of avian flu in the US since it was 1st found in December 2014, and the total number of birds affected now stands at 38 946 573.

The 4 new detections of the disease occurred on 2 commercial turkey farms, 1 commercial chicken farm and 1 backyard flock of mixed poultry. The latest outbreaks were confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

The locations of these confirmed avian flu cases are:

Minnesota, Kandiyohi county - 42 600 commercial turkeys;
Minnesota, Renville county - 625 500 commercial chickens;
Iowa, Sac county - 28 400 commercial turkeys;
Iowa, Sioux county - backyard mixed poultry, number pending.

These cases all occurred in the Mississippi flyway. The 2 latest outbreaks bring the number of detections in Iowa to 51, affecting 26 634 900 birds.

The Iowa State Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship has announced that they are also looking into several unconfirmed outbreaks of HPAI. The unconfirmed cases include commercial turkey and pullet farms as well as egg laying operations. They were found in Sioux, Buena Vista, Sac, and Calhoun counties. These additional detections are likely to take the tally [of outbreaks] in Iowa to 62. The department said they have quarantined the premises and once the presence of the disease is confirmed, all birds on the properties will be humanely euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease.

Minnesota has detected 84 outbreaks, affecting 5 116 260 birds. The latest outbreaks were found some days before confirmation, but the Minnesota state government said that it has not received any new reports of presumed avian flu cases for 5 straight days, as of 20 May 2015. The state government also stated that the 1st round of backyard flock surveillance, testing and observation in all control areas is complete, with nearly 4000 backyard flocks now tested for avian influenza or monitored for signs of the disease. However, to date, only 1 backyard flock has tested positive for HPAI in Minnesota.

Iowa agriculture officials say tests on 2 new turkey farms indicate presence of the bird flu, raising the number of cases to 62. The 6th turkey farm in Sac County and the 1st case in Calhoun County were added Wed 20 May 2015 to the state's list of contaminated farms on which all birds will be euthanized if the virus is confirmed. The number of turkeys on each farm was not immediately released.

Calhoun County becomes the 15th Iowa County to have bird flu cases reported. Samples will be sent to a US Department of Agriculture lab in Ames for confirmation of the H5N2 virus.

The USDA says confirmed outbreaks have claimed nearly 40 million birds in 15 states since early March 2015, mostly in Minnesota and Iowa.

[A recent article said that biosecurity at many of the poultry- and egg-producing areas was insufficient to stop this disease. Some contend that wild birds are still spreading this disease. It may be a combination of both. But one thing is for sure: this disease continues to spread. The practice of stamping out or euthanasia does not seem to be turning the tide. On the other hand, if infected birds were allowed to continue to shed virus particles, it might be a lot worse than it is currently.
