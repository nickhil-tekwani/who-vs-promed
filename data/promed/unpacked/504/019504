A total of 7 villagers of Kodandarama Puram in Karveti Nagaram mandal, 65 km [approx. 40 mi] from here, were diagnosed with having anthrax (_Bacillus anthracis_ infection) at the government hospital at Puttur on [Fri 26 Oct 2018]. A 50-year-old person, who slipped into coma following infection of the digestive tract, was shifted to SVRR Hospital in Tirupati, where his condition is serious.

Personnel of the Animal Husbandry Department confirmed that 18 cows and buffaloes and 6 sheep had died during the last fortnight. About 6 stray dogs that had contracted the bacteria were on the prowl in the village, they said. It all started when a group of youth had skinned the carcass of 2 cows found dead in the fields in the village a fortnight ago and shared the meat among their families, the officials said. They further said that 18 head of cattle had died between [10 and 26 Oct 2018], and the villagers consumed the meat of the dead animals. The villagers had also reportedly sent dried meat to their relatives at S.R. Puram, Vedurukuppam, Nagari, and Pallipattu (Tamil Nadu), the officials said.

When the 7 people, aged between 18 and 45 years, developed blisters on their bodies, they approached the Primary Health Centre located at Karveti Nagaram between [20 and 25 Oct 2018]. As the 2 medical officers at the PHC were not present as they had been deputed to undertake swine flu awareness drive elsewhere in the district, the villagers (all men) approached the Community Health Centre at Puttur, 15 km [approx. 9 mi] from the village.

Senior Medical Officer P. Ravi Raju, after conducting preliminary tests, confirmed the outbreak of anthrax at Kodandarama Puram. All the 7 people were diagnosed with anthrax, Dr. Raju added. Dr. Raju, who rushed to the village along with the paramedical staff, conducted a medical camp there and urged the villagers not to panic. He asked them to either bury or burn the stored meat. He also instructed them to bury the carcass in a pit after spraying bleaching powder in it.

In coordination with the MPDO staff and the Karveti Nagaram police, Dr. Raju searched the houses in the village and destroyed the meat stocks. Special parties had been dispatched in search of dried meat sent to the neighbouring villages. [Wise as this dried meat would be full of anthrax spores. - Mod.MHJ]

Anthrax was 1st detected in Karveti Nagaram mandal in the year 2000 following the death of 3 people. It resurfaced in 2003 when a few villagers of the mandal consumed the meat of animals after exhuming their carcass.

Meanwhile, district Collector P.S. Pradyumna spoke to DMHO Ramagiddiah and SVRR Hospital authorities and took stock of the situation. He also asked people to desist from consuming stored meat.

[Other reports from India failed to confirm that anthrax had been diagnosed in the human cases. Even that the severe human case was malaria. See:

Venkataraman, joint director of the animal husbandry in Chittoor district, said a [veterinary] camp was set up in Harijanawada, a hamlet of Kodandaramapuram, and a team from his department vaccinated the livestock 10 days ago [16 Oct 2018] as a precautionary measure after the death of several animals. We have yet to read of a veterinary confirmation of anthrax in the cattle, buffaloes, and sheep reported affected in the area. But for the moment I am assuming that this medical confirmation is correct. Livestock anthrax is a common and severe enzootic problem in this state. - Mod.MHJ
