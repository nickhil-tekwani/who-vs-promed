Update on H7N3 situation in Saskatchewan, Canada
------------------------------------------------
The information posted by ProMED, "Avian influenza, H7N3, poultry -
Canada (05): (SK)," on 2 Dec 2007 was extremely dated and did not
reflect the current situation accurately. The following information
is provided to accurately describe the current situation:

"On 30 Oct 2007, The Honourable Gerry Ritz, Minister of Agriculture
and Agri-Food Canada revoked the Ministerial Order that declared the
Province of Saskatchewan to be a Control Area for the purposes of
establishing movement controls and responding to a finding of H7N3
highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza (HPNAI). The virus was
not found on any other premises, although intensive surveillance was
carried out, as described below. Although the virus was an H7N3
subtype of influenza A, it did not have a close phylogenetic
relationship to the HPNAI H7N3 subtype found in British Columbia in
2004. A paper describing the homology with other H7N3 viruses is
currently being prepared for publication.

Consistent with the international approach to controlling and
eradicating highly pathogenic avian influenza, 3 and 10 km (2 and 6
mi) zones were established. There were a limited number of poultry
flocks in the 3 and 10 km zones. 6 small non-commercial flocks were
located in the 3 km zone and 8 small, non-commercial poultry flocks
only one commercial flock were found in the 10 km zone. A group of
commercial flocks was sampled in the control area beyond the 10 km
perimeter to establish freedom from NAI (notifiable avian influenza).
All flocks tested during intensive surveillance activities in the 3
and 10 m zones and in the remainder of the control area beyond the 10
km perimeter had negative results for NAI viruses.

Passive surveillance was enhanced by distribution of communication
materials from the Saskatchewan EOC (Emergency Operations Center) to
industry to increase producer awareness and encourage reporting.

Epidemiological investigations were conducted for possible contacts
with the infected premises during the 21-day period prior to the
onset of clinical signs of avian influenza. This would identify any
contact premises at risk of having acquired AI from the index
premises and any potential source of the virus. The information
available to date suggests a low pathogenicity H7N3 AI virus was
present on the premises for some undetermined period of time prior to
the emergence of the highly pathogenic strain.

Tracing activities were undertaken for vaccination crews, pullet
handling crews, the activities of the 8 farm employees, feed trucks
and the associated mill, the hatchery conveyances utilized for egg
pick-up at the index premises, reusable plastic trays, commercial
premises associated with the infected premises, and any poultry
extension personnel or service personnel who visited the infected farm.

In Canada, cleaning and disinfection (C&D) activities are the
responsibility of farm owners. However, these activities have to be
approved by and meet the standards set out by CFIA (Canadian Food
Inspection Agency) and the activities are under the supervision of
CFIA during completion. Cleaning and disinfection of the physical
structures on the index premises was initiated once manure and litter
removal had been completed. The completion of the C&D has been
delayed due to an inability to source sufficient manpower in
Saskatchewan to perform these labour intensive activities. It is
anticipated the C&D of the premises will be completed and approved by
CFIA early in 2008.

Public health measures were directed at preventing direct infection
of exposed individuals through prudent use of personal protective
equipment. Secondary preventive measures included oseltamivir
(Tamiflu AE) prophylaxis to reduce viral replication and influenza
vaccination to reduce the likelihood of influenza co-infections
(human and avian strains) and re-assortment.

Enhanced surveillance activities were conducted to 1) determine the
extent of human infection and/or clinical disease (if any) in exposed
individuals, 2) obtain further information on exposure history and
compliance with personal protective measures, 3) measure compliance
with influenza vaccination and oseltamivir prophylaxis, and 4)
document adverse events. A total of 7 individuals were identified
with ocular or influenza-like illness symptoms during the
investigation. All 7 individuals were negative for influenza by
direct fluorescent antibody, enzyme immunoassay, and PCR (polymerase
chain reaction).

All CFIA staff were provided with training sessions on proper
biosafety procedures and the requirements of Occupational Safety and
Health (OSH) guidelines as outlined in the Canada Labour Code, Part
II. A CFIA OSH advisor was on-site during the response activities.

Compliance with the proper use of personal protective equipment, safe
work, and hygiene practices and reporting accidents was monitored and
enforced. A more detailed report describing the circumstances and
actions taken by CFIA will be available on the CFIA website."
