A team of experts from the Department of Animal Husbandry is probing the death of about 100 cattle in 2 villages of Uttar Pradesh's Badaun district recorded in the past month. On the morning of 24 Dec [2021], residents of Bakarpur found some 20 dead cattle. The local residents of Bakarpur then reported the deaths to the district administration, after which Badaun's chief veterinary officer (CVO) Dr Arun Kumar and his team visited the villages. The team conducted autopsies of a few dead cattle on Sunday [26 Dec 2021], and the report is awaited. Most of the cattle that died were milch cows.

Officials suspect that the cattle died of foot and mouth disease (FMD) [see comment]. CVO Kumar, who visited the villages along with his team for inspection, said: 'The spread of FMD may be the cause of death. We have started vaccinating the livestock. Lack of timely treatment leads to the death of cattle. We have sent the samples to the lab for further tests, and we are trying to control the spread of this disease in the nearby villages.'

The health department, meanwhile, has advised the villagers to immediately bury the carcasses of the animals to ensure that infection, if any, does not spread among healthy animals. The [event] was reported from Bakarpur village and adjoining Barkhera village, under Wazirganj police circle area.

The villages have a population of about 1500, and the primary occupation is agriculture and dairy farming. In fact, almost every house has cattle.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the above submission.

The report does not include description of clinical signs, if such have been manifested at all by the affected/dying dairy cows.

In case the included photograph reflects reality, the dairy cows were/are kept housed, fed in their barns/sheds. Housed dairy cows are visited by their holders on a daily basis; finding a large number of dead (likely, adult) cattle in the morning, not preceded by a disease, is not likely to indicate FMD as a main diagnosis. FMD is a highly infectious disease that causes, particularly in dairy cattle, severe buccal and podal clinical signs. Adult cattle mostly recover from FMD, though economic losses occur due to affected production, long convalescence period, and complications.

Various etiological factors, infectious and otherwise, deserve to be taken into consideration. Details of disease signs, in case some have been seen, gross pathology findings, and results of the laboratory examinations are requested. - Mod.AS
