Mainland H7N9 patient dies in Taiwan
------------------------------------
TAIPEI: A H7N9 avian flu patient from the Chinese mainland died on Monday [20 Jan 2014] in Taipei, Taiwan's disease control authority said on Tuesday. The 86-year-old man from Changzhou City in east China's Jiangsu Province tested positive for the H7N9 virus during a trip to Taiwan in late December. This was the second confirmed case in which H7N9 had been imported into Taiwan.

None of the people who had close contacts with him, including his family members, tour guide, driver, medical worker and patients in the same ward, have tested positive for the virus, according to the local disease control authority.

China's National Health and Family Planning Commission said earlier this month that a large-scale H7N9 epidemic is unlikely, despite scores of cases reported nationwide this year. The current cases are scattered, and no mutation of the virus has been identified so far that could affect public health, according to the commission.

WHO: 23 more H7N9 cases in China as of 20 Jan 2014
---------------------------------------------
WHO reported Monday an additional 23 cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus, including one death. To date, there have been a total of 208 reported cases of H7N9 infection, resulting in 53 deaths.

The latest cases, aged 5 to 83 years, were reported from a number of locations in China, including Fujian province (5), Guangdong province (5), Guizhou province (1), Shanghai City (1) and Zhejiang province (11). Many of the patients had a history of exposure to poultry. The present conditions of the surviving patients range from stable to critical.

The fatal case was identified as a 38-year-old man from Guizhou province who was working in Wenzhou City in Zhejiang province. He returned to Guizhou province Jan. 3 and was hospitalized Jan. 8. He died the following day. Health officials currently are investigating where and when he became ill.

The source of the infection is still unknown, but there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions as a result of the outbreak.

[[Perhaps the most interesting aspect of these two reports is the repetition of the statement attributed to China's National Health and Family Planning Commission earlier this month that a large-scale H7N9 epidemic is unlikely, despite the numbers of cases reported nationwide this year. The current cases are scattered, and no mutation of the virus has been identified so far that could affect public health, according to the commission.

Indeed the number of cases recorded so far throughout south China is negligible in relation to the size of the population at risk. As yet the H7N9 virus has shown no propensity to evolve into a form able to be transmitted from-person-to-person. Mainly middle-aged to elderly people, often with underlying morbidities, have been victims developing serious illness often with fatal outcome. Hopefully this situation will not get worse throughout the current seasonal influenza period. The imminent New Year holiday period is likely test this prediction, however. - Mod.CP
