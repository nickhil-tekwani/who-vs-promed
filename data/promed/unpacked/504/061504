Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolation in New South Wales, Australia
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Routine sampling by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Health
Arbovirus Surveillance Program has detected Murray Valley
encephalitis virus (MVE) in mosquitoes trapped on 5 Feb 2008 at
Hanwood (approx. 5 km (3 mi) from Griffith) in NSW.

Scientists from the Medical Entomology and Arbovirus Emerging
Diseases laboratories at CIDMLS-ICPMR (Centre for Infectious Diseases
and Microbiology Laboratory Services-Institute of Clinical Pathology
and Medical Research) have confirmed the identity of the virus using
defined epitope blocking ELISAs (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
as a 1st-line screen with follow-up confirmation by direct
immunofluorescence using both flavivirus group reactive and MVE
(Murray Valley encephalitis) specific monoclonal antibodies.
Neutralisation tests are ongoing, the isolate is being sequenced to
further characterise it. The sequence data when available should
allow the aetiology of this particular isolate to be determined.

To date all chicken sentinels flocks in the NSW programme remain
antibody negative for MVE. In addition no virus activity has been
detected by the Victorian surveillance program. A chicken sentinel
flock has been moved to the site where the mosquitoes were trapped,
opportunistic sampling of chickens resident on the property where the
mosquitoes were trapped is underway.

The terrain around Hanwood is flat and prone to collect stagnant
water. Increased rain was noted in the area in December 2007 but
there has been little rainfall since. This area is not being affected
by the flooding in the far north of the state. Recently both ambient
temperatures and humidity have been high. Mosquito activity in the
area is reported as variable but overall mosquito numbers are down on
previous years. There is no evidence of increased bird migration into
the area nor is there evidence of increased bird breeding. Indeed the
combination of severe long standing drought and land management
practice has seen a decimation of the colonial nesting birds thought
to be the reservoir hosts of MVE.

The surveillance program has been in operation since 1979 using
chicken sentinels and was expanded in 1984 to include mosquito
trapping. MVE has been detected in NSW twice (2000/2001 and
2003/2004) prior to this episode by seroconversion in the sentinel
chicken flocks. The activity in 2000/2001 was widespread in the
Darling River system but was localised to the Menindee Lakes in
2003/2004. No human cases of disease were noted during these years.
However, this is the 1st time that MVE has been isolated from
mosquitoes in NSW.

NSW Health has issued appropriate public health warnings and
continues to monitor the situation.

[Murray Valley encephalitis is endemic in New Guinea and in parts of
Australia. The disease is carried by culicine mosquitoes. _Culex
annulirostris_ is a key vector in transmission to man, and other
species play a role in transmission among animal reservoirs. This is
the 1st report of the isolation of Murray Valley encephalitis virus
(MVEV) from mosquitoes in NSW. Infection with MVEV is often
subclinical and perhaps only one in 800-1000 or fewer of those
infected will go on to develop a clinically significant disease. For
others, the symptoms can range from mild to severe. The incubation
period is 7-28 days and symptoms almost invariably include fever;
headache nausea and vomiting are common. Of those who show clinically
significant disease, 25 percent have died and 25-50 percent show
permanent neurological damage. When encephalitis develops, brain
dysfunction may be experienced after a few days with lethargy,
irritability, drowsiness, confusion, convulsions, and fits; neck
stiffness can be expected, and both coma and death may ensue.

This finding is a warning that MVE virus is circulating in the NSW
area. Although no human cases have been found in NSW this century,
NSW was the site of one of the 1st 4 isolations of MVE virus in 1951.
MVE is thought to be the same as Australian X disease, which caused
an epidemic in NSW in 1918. In 1974, the 1st 8 cases of what became a
big epidemic were recorded from NSW, but no cases have been reported
from there since then.
