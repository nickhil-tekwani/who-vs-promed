Wildlife officials said 2 more cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) have
been found inside an elk ranch in south western Routt County.
The 2 infected mule deer were killed inside an 1800 acre hunting pen at the
Motherwell Ranch in January. But their brains were in a batch of about 90
deer heads sent to the University of Wyoming in Laramie for analysis.
The results returned last week bring the number of cases of the fatal brain
wasting disease on the Western Slope to 10. About 1000 deer were killed
inside the ranch's hunting pen and in a 5 mile radius around the facility
between January and April 2002. A total of 4 sick deer were found inside
the fence and 6 more deer were found outside -- all within a few miles of
the ranch. None of the 146 elk killed outside the facility tested positive.
Wes Adams, owner of the Motherwell hunting and fishing ranch, has refused
to allow the US Department of Agriculture to kill his herd of 103 elk to
see whether the animals are infected. USDA would pay up to $2850 per
animal. Adams said he spent much more for his trophy bulls and breeding
cows. "Our biggest concern right now is the need to depopulate that herd,"
said Denny Behrens of the Colorado Mule Deer Association. "We think the
facility is infected. It's a matter of how many."

Saskatchewan Environment officials suspect another case of CWD in the wild
-------------------------------------------------------
A sample taken from a 3year old mule deer buck was tested at Prairie
Diagnostic Services in Saskatoon and has been sent to a lab in Nepean,
Ontario, for confirmation.
Provincial CWD manager Kevin Omoth said the sample will be checked a third
time in the United States if it tests positive at the Ontario lab.
The buck was found in the Manito Sand Hills area near Lloydminster, where 2
other positive tests have been confirmed in the past year. It was among 185
samples taken from an estimated deer population of 400 in the area.
The department will again be asking for hunter and landowner cooperation
this fall, when they begin collecting deer and elk heads for testing. In
the past 4 years 5838 samples have been tested.

The [Wisconsin] State Natural Resources Board was told that 4 more deer
killed in a special hunt in March and April had a fatal brain disease and
one was found just outside an area where the state wants all deer killed.
As a result, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) will expand the 287
square mile eradication zone by about 65 square miles near Cross Plains and
Ridgeway, said Julie Langenberg, a DNR wildlife veterinarian.
In another development, the DNR said it was scaling back immediate plans to
kill all the deer in the eradication zone just west of Madison by limiting
hunting to one week each month during the summer.
Langenberg said a 4 years and 6 months old doe killed south east of
Ridgeway was among 4 deer that tested positive for chronic wasting disease
(CWD) when their lymph nodes were examined. The tests indicated all 4 had
early stages of the infection before it moves into the brain, she said. The
additional 4 deer bring to 18 the number of the animals confirmed. All were
killed in Dane and Iowa counties. The deer near Ridgeway was the first one
found south of Mount Horeb. The others have been mostly northwest of the
city. Natural Resources Board Chairman Trig Solberg said during the meeting
in Minocqua he was not surprised diseased deer were found on the fringes of
the eradication zone, forcing wildlife officials to expand it.

New test procedure finds 4 more CWD positive deer
-------------------------------------------------
MADISON, Wisconsin: Additional testing of tissues from a sample of 516 deer
shot in March and April 2002 and submitted for CWD testing has yielded 4
additional CWD positive deer from the sample area. The test uses lymph node
tissue and is still experimental, but seems to compare well to the accepted
test standard using brain stem tissue.
This brings the total number of CWD cases found in the 516 deer sample
taken from western Dane-eastern Iowa counties to 15. "Several research
facilities have been working at developing reliable alternate CWD tests
detecting CWD earlier in the disease cycle," said DNR's wildlife
veterinarian Julie Langenberg. "This test is an immunohistochemical
staining (IHC) process, similar to the IHC test currently used on the brain
stem."
"The brain stem test continues to be the currently accepted standard for
determining the presence of CWD in a wildlife population," said Langenberg,
"but working with research partners to use new tests to better diagnose CWD
will improve our chances of successfully eradicating the disease."
Wisconsin wildlife officials are confident enough of the lymph test results
to add them to the list of positive CWD diagnoses, noting that the
tell-tale staining indicating CWD under the microscope is a characteristic
and reliable indicator. Lymph tissue collected from the 11 deer previously
determined infected via the brain stem test also proved positive in the
additional testing.
The 4 deer announced as CWD positive today did not show up positive in the
earlier brain stem testing. One of the reasons for developing a lymph test,
according to animal health experts, is that it shows promise for detecting
the disease at an earlier stage, before there is sufficient build-up of the
disease-causing agent to be detected in the brain stem test. DNR wildlife
managers had informed landowners submitting deer for testing in March and
April 2002 that additional tests might be run on deer shot on their
properties, and the possibility existed for additional positive results.
One of the 4 new CWD finds is near the south western edge of the current
CWD eradication zone. Based on the state's CWD management plan, the zone
now will be modified to incorporate the new findings. The management plan
calls for extending the zone if a CWD positive deer is found near the edge
of the current boundary by including those sections within about 4 miles of
a section containing a CWD positive deer. This will add about 41 square
miles to the eradication zone bringing it to 328 square miles.
