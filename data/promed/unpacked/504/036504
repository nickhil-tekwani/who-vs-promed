Health officials in Bulgaria on Saturday [18 Jul 2015] launched a large-scale disinfection operation after a man died from anthrax after handling infected beef, local media reported. The man, identified by the Focus Information Agency as a 53-year-old from the Black Sea's Varna region, is said to have passed meat from the cow to an illegal meat processing factory before dumping the remains at a landfill site.

The infected meat was reportedly sold around Provadia, Karnobat and Varna, and the carcass was dumped in Mlada Gvardia, where disinfection was underway, Bulgarian National Radio reported. Health authorities in Varna have put 20 people in quarantine. Sheep and cattle in Mlada Gvardia are also under quarantine.

A large-scale disinfection is underway in the village of Mlada Gvardiya, municipality of Vetrino, district of Varna. The procedure is carried out in the area around the local landfill and is done by 2 vehicles of the Civil Protection Directorate. The mass disinfection is due to the remains of a dead cow believed to be infected with anthrax that was thrown away at the local landfill, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.

The authorities will disinfect the yards of the people who were in contact with the animal.

A local resident, the owner of the cow, died as well, and samples were sent to a lab to check on whether he was infected with anthrax. The man had handed meat from the cow to an illegal meat processing factory in another village, and the police are now searching for where it was sold. People who had contact with the deceased man were given antibiotics, the Ministry of Health announced.

[It would seem that this investigation followed upon the owner of this cow being diagnosed with anthrax at the time of his death, presumably in hospital with typical symptoms coincident with having butchered a cow with anthrax a few days previously. At some point, the history of having sold some meat to an illegal processor emerged, and family questioning would have revealed what happened to the remaining carcass and viscera vis a vis the village landfill, and probably familial exposure if not cutaneous lesions or fever. Unfortunately, such investigations are always behind the curve. It is telling that the probably exposed village sheep and cattle are merely "under quarantine" and have not been vaccinated.

This northeast region of Bulgaria is regularly afflicted with livestock anthrax outbreaks year after year. For a map of Bulgaria showing the oblasts and major towns, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/bulgaria.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
