Two of 17 people sent to hospital after eating puffer fish, or butete, were kept confined at an Ozamiz City hospital even as the 15 other poisoning victims had been discharged, according to a health official in this city.

Brixlyjun Go, disease surveillance officer of the Ozamiz City health office, said the 2 were kept in hospital because they were the worst hit by the poisoning.

They have been identified as AS Sr., 53, who was unconscious when brought to the Mayor HIlarion Ramiro Sr. Medical Center, and SM, 51, who had been paralyzed by the fish's toxins.

The 2 were already in stable condition, but Santander is being kept at the hospital's intensive care unit while SM was still suffering from nausea.

Go said AS had regained consciousness on Saturday (10 Aug 2019) and was recovering.

The 2 men were the most hit by puffer fish toxin, called tetrodotoxin, which is up to 1200 times more poisonous than cyanide, according to National Geographic. One puffer fish carries enough toxin to kill 30 adults, and there is no known antidote, the NatGeo web site said.

The poisoning victims were rushed to the hospital on Thursday (8 Aug 2019) after eating puffer fish cooked in coconut milk.

Go said one victim told him the people brought to hospital had eaten puffer fish before but didn't suffer from the poisoning symptoms: nausea, numbness, abdominal cramps and vomiting. The people were aware of puffer fish's poisonous character but mistakenly included the fish's internal organs during cooking.

"The puffer fish was pregnant," said Go. "So they included its internal organs when they cooked the dish. They already know before now, this should have been removed," he said.

Puffer fish is a delicacy in Japan, where trained chefs carefully prepare the fish for sushi or sashimi to serve diners looking for adventure. Some diners are believed to crave puffer fish if they want to feel the nonlethal effects of its poison.

[It is important to know that the distribution of toxin varies quite widely based on the species of puffer fish. This article does not tell us the specific species of puffer fish involved.

The puffer fish (sometimes called globefish, fugu, or blowfish) is highly prized in many Asian cultures and is consumed safely in some countries (such as in Japan). Consumption is safe, however, only with specialized training regarding which species to prepare and how to prepare them because the concentration and tissue distribution of toxin varies greatly among the more than 180 known species. Regulatory authorities in the USA do not provide this training, nor is tetrodotoxin testing routinely conducted; therefore, only the frozen meat, skin, and male gonad from one species of puffer fish (_Takifugu rubripes_) from Japan, processed according to Japanese safety guidelines, is permitted to be imported into the USA a limited number of times per year, pursuant to an FDA/Japanese government agreement established in 1988 (6). All other imported puffer fish products are prohibited (7). For domestic sources of puffer fish, only nontoxic species are recommended by FDA for consumption. FDA regulates domestically sourced puffer fish through the Seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points regulation (5). Selected states have established additional requirements for controls for puffer fish from certain areas because of potential toxicity (8).

_Lagocephalus lunaris_ is an Indo-Pacific species of puffer fish and is one of the only species known to contain high concentrations of tetrodotoxin naturally in the meat, making safe preparation of this product impossible (9). In its native region, it has been confused with similar looking, nontoxic species, resulting in numerous illnesses (10). This is the same species that was illegally imported and responsible for illnesses in California, Illinois, and New Jersey in 2007 (4).

Medical professionals who work in EDs or with persons from countries with a tradition of puffer fish consumption should be aware of this potential public health threat and collaborate with local poison centers and health departments to investigate any outbreaks of tetrodotoxin poisoning to determine the source of the product and block additional sales to prevent additional illnesses. FDA recently released materials, including instructions for the collection and submission of meal remnants, for several fish-related illnesses, including puffer fish poisoning.

The following was extracted from the US FDA Bad Bug Book
https://www.fda.gov/media/83271/download, previously known as the bad bug book, and some search engines may still find http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070842.htm:

Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order Tetraodontiformes is one of the most violent intoxications from marine species. The gonads, liver, intestines, and skin of puffer fish can contain levels of tetrodotoxin sufficient to produce rapid and violent death. The flesh of many puffer fish may not usually be dangerously toxic.

Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the genus _Atelopus_, the blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and xanthid crabs. The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent reports of the production of tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including strains of the family Vibrionaceae, _Pseudomonas_ spp, and _Photobacterium phosphoreum_, point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins. These are relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with marine animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some significance in toxicoses that have been more directly related to these bacterial species.

The 1st symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and tongue, appearing between 20 minutes to 3 hours after eating poisonous puffer fish. The next symptom is increasing paresthesia [sensation of burning, numbness, tingling, itching, or prickling] in the face and extremities, which may be followed by sensations of lightness or floating. Headache, epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting may occur. Occasionally, some reeling or difficulty in walking may occur. The 2nd stage of the intoxication is increasing paralysis. Many victims are unable to move; even sitting may be difficult. There is increasing respiratory distress. Speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea [shortness of breath], cyanosis [turns blue], and hypotension [drop in blood pressure]. Paralysis increases, and convulsions, mental impairment, and cardiac arrhythmia [alterations in heartbeat] may occur.

The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually occurs within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours.
