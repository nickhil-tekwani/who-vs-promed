Background data on Trichinella in Serbia
---------------------------------------
Until recent years, most cases were reported from Srem, Macva, and
Negotinska (Krajina); however, additional areas are increasingly involved.
555 cases of human infection were attributed to pork ingestion in 1999.
Although infection of horses has not been detected in Serbia, Serbian
horses have been implicated as a source for human infection in France and
Italy. 0.17 percent of slaughtered swine are infested (1999). 525 cases
were reported in 1995; 164 in 1996; 771 in 1997; 408 in 1998; 667 in 1999;
462 in 2000; 397 in 2001.
Rates per 100,000: 9.09 in 1995 (12.98 in Central Serbia); 2.80 in 1996
(21.36 in Central Serbia); 7.73 in 1997 (13.63 in Central Serbia); 4.09 in
1998 (3.07 in Central Serbia); 6.30 in 1999; 4.35 in 2000; 3.73 in 2001.
Notable outbreaks:
1998 - Horsemeat imported from Yugoslavia was responsible for 2 outbreaks
in France (128 cases, 79 confirmed). An additional outbreak in the same
region that year involved 404 cases (37 hospitalized), also from a horse
imported from Yugoslavia.
1999 - 8 cases were diagnosed among Yugoslavian immigrants in the United
Kingdom (west London and Hertfordshire) - ascribed to salami imported from
the town of Sombor (northern Serbia). 40 to 80 local residents of Sombor
were also infected during the outbreak.
2001 to 2002 - An outbreak (247 cases) centered in Zrenjanin (Vojvodina)
was ascribed to commercial sausage. 0.12 percent of slaughtered swine are
infested (1999).
