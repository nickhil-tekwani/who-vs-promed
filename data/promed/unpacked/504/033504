[Given the occurrence of this disease in the area (see ProMED-mail post 20150514.3361318 and 20150128.3125934), it should not be surprising that foot and mouth disease (FMD) has now been reported in Angola.

As indicated in the epidemiological comments section of the report, this FMD outbreak is located in a village near an area of the border with the Republic of Namibia, where there is a lot of movement of people.

Cuangar is a town in the Province of Kuando Kubango in Angola. The town lies on the Okavango River, opposite the town of Nkurenkuru, Namibia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuangar
