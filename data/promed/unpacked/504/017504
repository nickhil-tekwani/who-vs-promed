The Miyazaki prefectural government on Thursday [22 Jul 2010] started
having vets conduct visual checks on most of the roughly 940 000
livestock in the prefecture before it declares an end to a
months-long foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] epidemic.

The prefecture has slaughtered more than 289 000 pigs and cows to
contain the disease since it was discovered in April [2010]. It now
plans to have vets visit about 7700 farms in the prefecture to check
the health of livestock by 11 Aug 2010.

A big livestock farm hit by FMD in Kawaminami, Miyazaki Prefecture,
noticed several cows drooling 18 Apr 2010, 2 days before the
prefectural government announced the outbreak in the town of Tsuno,
the company operating the farm and others said Sunday [18 Jul 2010].

Several cows at the farm tested strongly positive for the disease,
suggesting they had been infected for more than 2 weeks. It is now
suspected the disease existed at the farm in Kawaminami by early
April [2010] at the latest.

The farm operator did not report the abnormalities to the livestock
hygiene service center until 24 Apr 2010, the sources said.

The operator said it thought the symptoms suggested the cows had a
cold [see comment] and administered antibiotics. It made a report to
the center 24 Apr 2010, 2 days after it found some of the cows had
developed tongue sores and their drooling worsened.

"We had suspected cold as the drooling was only slightly more than
usual," a company official said. "It would have been extremely
difficult to foresee the FMD (outbreak) before the 1st case was
reported, and we reported when the number of cows with tongue sores
rose."

While dozens of farms are suspected to have overlooked signs of
infection, a government team investigating the outbreak believes the
major farm, with more than 700 cows, holds the key to deciphering the
route of infection.

The prefectural government has already been found to have failed to
conduct proper tests to confirm the disease when a water buffalo in
Tsuno developed diarrhea at the end of March [2010]. More than 289
000 cows and pigs were slaughtered to contain the epidemic.

[Unfortunately, the report does not specify the sort of cattle
involved. Dairy cattle would have suffered, as a 1st sign of the
developing disease, a sharp drop in milk production, which cannot be
mistaken for a rather innocent "cold". This will soon be followed by
the typical oral and podal lesions. On the other hand, clinical signs
of FMD in beef cattle may at times be less easy to diagnose,
particularly during the early stages and certainly in an FMD-free
country where the disease has been absent for many years and is
unfamiliar to farmers and vets. "Cold", as a disease entity, is a
layman's term, probably related to suspected upper respiratory
infections (such as, parainfluenza virus type 3, respiratory
syncytial virus/RSV, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/IBR,
adenoviruses, etc). Excessive salivation is not one of the clinically
observable manifestations of such conditions but could be seen in
cases of IBR and bovine viral diarrhea/BVD.

It will be interesting to note if the alleged observation of "cold"
was made by a veterinary (farm animals) practitioner. Veterinarians
specialised in farm animal medicine are expected to be trained in the
clinical diagnosis of the main infectious diseases of such animals,
with FMD prioritised. - Mod.AS]
