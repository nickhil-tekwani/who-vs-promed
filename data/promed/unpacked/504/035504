Human drugs cure banana disease
----------------------------------------
Drugs developed to treat human diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS can also
be used to treat banana diseases, according to a study supported by the
government of Belgium and published in the latest issue of the journal
Antiviral Research.
"This is very significant," said Dr Emil Frison, Director-General of the
International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) and an author of
the paper, "because it means we can now make full use of the diversity of
bananas to create and distribute improved varieties."
400 million people in developing countries depend on bananas and plantains
as a staple food. Plant breeders need access to as much diversity as
possible in order to develop higher-yielding varieties with resistance to
pests and diseases. For bananas, the world's biggest collection is
maintained in trust for humanity at the Katholieke Universiteit in Leuven,
Belgium.
KUL sends plants to researchers worldwide through IPGRI's International
Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain (INIBAP). International
guidelines, however, allow only movement of disease-free plants, but
a substantial part of the collection has been blocked because it is
infected with banana streak virus (BSV).
Researchers from KUL and the Gembloux Faculty of Agriculture have already
developed several techniques for eliminating viruses from sterile cultures
in the banana collection. These techniques are effective against other
diseases, but BSV remained a problem. Knowing that BSV is quite closely
related to hepatitis B virus, and uses some of the same chemical
processes, the banana scientists got together with the Rega Institute for
Medical Research at KUL. This institute was responsible for developing
adefovir and tenofovir, antiviral compounds tested and approved for the
treatment of hepatatis B and AIDS.
The researchers grew infected banana cells in the presence of small doses
of the drugs for 6 months. Testing of whole plantlets produced from those
cells demonstrated that up to 90 percent of the plantlets showed no sign of
BSV.
Work is now proceeding to remove BSV from all samples in the collection at
KUL. "The production of virus-free stocks is a very important control
measure," said Dr Frison. "Not only does it mean the diversity collection
is healthier, it also enables us to distribute newly bred varieties to
[those] who need them."
The technique may also be useful in the treatment of other viral diseases
of economically important plants.

[Banana streak disease was first described in Morocco and the causal virus,
Banana streak badnavirus, was described in 1986. BSV has subsequently been
recorded in Africa, Europe (Canary Islands and Madeira), Asia, North
America (Florida), Central and South America, and the Pacific Islands.
Infection of _Musa_ by BSV limits development of new _Musa_ hybrids in
breeding programs worldwide. BSV has been transmitted experimentally by
mealybugs (_Planococcus citri_ and _Saccharicoccus sacchari_) [Ss] both of
which colonize banana. Results of surveys in Uganda show that _Dysmicoccus
brevipes_ [Db] and Ss were the most prevalent mealybugs, and the incidence
of banana streak was correlated with the presence of Db. Disease management
is complicated because infected plants may be symptomless; but use of PCR
and ISEM has facilitated rapid detection of BSV. - Mod.DH]
