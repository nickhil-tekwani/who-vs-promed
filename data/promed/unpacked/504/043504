Villagers with anthrax improve with treatment
-------------------------------------------
Two villagers of Ganyu county in Jiangsu province who were diagnosed with anthrax have improved after treatment, the Beijing Times reported on Friday.

According to a report released by the Ganyu Center for Disease Control on Aug 7, the source of infection (was) a cow from another province. About 10 villagers were involved in butchering the cow on July 25, which was dead before arriving at the village.

Two of them, [a man] and his son, were diagnosed with anthrax on July 30, while five other villagers showed symptoms and were put under medical observation. The other villagers involved in the butchering accepted preventive medication.

The province's Health Department has sent a group of experts to the village to help with epidemic prevention and controlling work.

[It is interesting how certain countries depend on human cases of anthrax for reactive control, instead of proactive surveillance of unexpected deaths in, say, cattle. The former is the most expensive and least cost effective way of controlling this disease and does little to protect humans from getting infected. If you control this disease in livestock, human cases usually totally disappear at a modest cost. Concentrating on human disease does little to prevent livestock cases. In medical terms it is emergency clinic medicine instead of primary health care. And as one would expect this disease is common in China in both livestock and humans. - Mod MHJ.
