The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services announced that the state is experiencing its largest syphilis outbreak in at least 40 years. A total of 75 cases of infectious syphilis were reported as of 22 Oct [2018] in patients aged 18 to 76 years -- most in Anchorage. According to the department, 66 infections occurred in men, including 55 in men who have sex with men (MSM). Also, 2 of the 9 women infected were pregnant at the time of diagnosis, and 8 were of childbearing age, the department said. In March [2018], an infant was diagnosed with a probable case of congenital syphilis.

The department said it has requested help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assist with outbreak response efforts. A response team is gathering information from healthcare providers, patients, patient records and community members.

The department provided a list of recommendations for physicians to follow to help contain the outbreak, including learning the number and gender of patients' sexual partners, reporting all cases of syphilis and testing for pregnancy in any woman of childbearing age who is diagnosed with syphilis. It asked that clinicians who care for patients with sexually transmitted infections in Alaska complete a brief anonymous survey at this link to help control the outbreak.

According to the CDC, if left untreated, syphilis can cause serious health problems, including blindness, dementia and paralysis. In addition to being sexually transmitted, it can also spread from an infected mother to a fetus.

To lower the risk for syphilis, the CDC recommends that sexually active MSM, patients with HIV, patients who are taking pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention and patients whose partners have syphilis get tested regularly. It also recommends that all pregnant women get tested at their 1st prenatal visit to prevent congenital syphilis.

Officials with the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH) say that they have detected an alarming increase in reported syphilis cases across Wyoming, especially in Fremont County. In a written statement, officials with the WDH say that there have been 34 Wyoming cases reported so far in 2018, which represents a 36% increase over last year's [2017] total for the entire year. With a reported 38% of this year's [2018] cases, Fremont County is an area of current concern. "Because of this increase, the department recently sent an alert to healthcare providers across the state encouraging them to promote testing and treatment with patients," said Courtney Smith, Communicable Disease Surveillance Program Manager with WDH.

Having multiple sex partners, sex without a condom, or anonymous sex partners are risks connected with this recent increase. Actions recommended by WDH include abstinence, limiting the number of sexual partners, correct and consistent condom use, and getting tested before starting a new sexual relationship. To learn more about the risk behaviors for syphilis infection, visit <www.knowyo.org> or contact a medical professional. The site provides voucher codes for no or low-cost syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV and hepatitis testing.

Genital sores caused by syphilis also make it easier to transmit and acquire HIV infection. "There is an estimated 2- to 5-fold increased risk of acquiring HIV if exposed when syphilis is present," Smith said. "Fortunately, the same steps you can take to decrease your risk of syphilis infection can also reduce your risk for HIV and other [sexually transmitted infections]."

[Primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis are the symptomatic, contagious, earliest stages of infection, and indicate newly acquired infection. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, the western region of the USA had the highest rate of reported P&S syphilis cases (13.2 cases per 100 000 population), followed by the South (9.7 cases per 100 000 population), the Northeast (8.0 cases per 100 000 population), and the Midwest (6.2 cases per 100 000 population) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/syphilis.htm). During 2016 to 2017, the P&S syphilis rate increased 16.8% in the West, 10.2% in the South, and 8.8% in the Midwest; the rate did not change in the Northeast.

In 2017, rates of reported P&S syphilis cases per 100 000 population ranged by state from 0.7 in Wyoming to 20.0 in Nevada; it was 40.4 in the District of Columbia and 1.8 in Alaska (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/syphilis.htm). During 2016 to 2017, P&S syphilis rates increased in 36 of 50 of states.

As observed in prior years, in 2017 the rate of reported P&S syphilis cases in men (16.9 cases per 100 000 males) was much higher than in women (2.3 cases per 100 000 females), and men accounted for a large majority (87.7%) of P&S syphilis cases (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/syphilis.htm). Among men, the rate of P&S syphilis has increased every year since 2000, and during 2016 to 2017, the rate among men increased 9.0%. In contrast, the P&S syphilis rate among women increased substantially (155.6%) since 2013.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) continued to account for the majority (57.9%) of P&S syphilis cases in 2017. During 2016 to 2017, the number of cases increased 8.6% among MSM, 17.8% among men who have sex with women (MSW), and 24.9% among women. Among 2017 P&S syphilis cases with known HIV status, 45.5% of cases among MSM were HIV-positive, compared with 8.8% of cases among MSW and 4.5% of cases among women.

Paralleling increases in P&S syphilis among women, the rate of reported congenital syphilis has increased each year since 2012. In 2017, there were 918 reported cases of congenital syphilis, including 64 syphilitic stillbirths and 13 infant deaths, and the national rate was 23.3 cases per 100 000 live births, a 153.3% increase relative to 2013 (9.2 cases per 100 000 live births).

The 1st news article above reports that the syphilis outbreak in the US state of Alaska is occurring mostly among MSM in Anchorage, a city with an estimated 301 826 residents in 2017; Anchorage is the most populous city in the state, located in the south-central portion of Alaska (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska). A map of Alaska showing the location of Anchorage can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anchorage,+AK.

The 2nd news article above reports that the syphilis outbreak in the US state of Wyoming is concentrated in Fremont County, which is located in the central-western portion of the state; the county, with a population of about 40 000 residents, is roughly the size of the US state of Vermont and is a gateway into Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_County,_Wyoming). The Wind River Reservation, which constitutes just over one-third of Fremont County's area, is home to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Native American tribes; American Indians constitute about 20% of the county's population (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_River_Indian_Reservation). A map that shows the location of Fremont County can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fremont+County,+WY. - Mod.ML
