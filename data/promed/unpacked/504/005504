Ontario has confirmed its 1st cases of white nose syndrome (WNS) for 2013. The infected bats were found in a district of the province where WNS had not previously been reported. This incident included reports of bats observed flying during the day, a strong indicator of WNS infection, and both scavenged and whole dead bats. The samples for WNS surveillance were collected and submitted as part of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources enhanced WNS surveillance program.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Wildlife Health Center has confirmed that a deadly disease in bats called white nose syndrome" (WNS) has been recently found in a little brown bat and a tri-colored bat from a public cave in Washington County. The USGS has also confirmed that WNS has been recently found in a little brown bat and a northern long-eared bat from 2 public caves in Franklin County. All 3 caves are closed to the public, and cave names are not being disclosed to prevent disturbance of remaining bats.

According to the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC), signs of the disease or the fungus have now been confirmed in 19 bats from caves in Crawford, Franklin, Lincoln, Perry, Pike, Shannon, and Washington counties since WNS was 1st found in Missouri in 2010.

"Bats with WNS exhibit unusual behavior, such as flying outside in daylight and clustering near entrances of caves and mines during the day in cold winter months when they should be hibernating," said MDC Bat Biologist Tony Elliott. "This activity uses up fat reserves needed to get the bats through the winter, making them more susceptible to freezing or starvation."

Elliott cautioned that people should not handle any bats and should contact their local MDC office or conservation agent if they find dead bats or see bats flying outside during the day in cold winter months when they typically would be roosting or hibernating.

Missouri is home to more than 6300 known caves with about 74 percent of them privately owned. Many contain bats.

Bats provide tremendous value as natural pest control for farms and forests and also play an essential role in helping to control insects that can spread disease to people. According to the USGS, the number of North American bats estimated to have died from WNS thus far had the capacity to consume up to 8000 tons of insects per year.

A deadly bat fungus has been spreading across the eastern and middle regions of the United States and parts of Canada. The mysterious fungus has killed millions of bats in recent years.

Approximately 6 million bats have died since a mysterious fungus was 1st observed in February 2006. The name of the fungus is _Geomyces destructans_. Digital Journal reported on this situation in January 2012.

The fungus has now been identified in 22 states and 5 Canadian provinces, reported Scientific American (courtesy of Mother Jones). Primarily, it has been found in the U.S. eastern states and portions of the midwest. Fatalities in bats have also been observed in northeastern Canada, going as far west as north of the Great Lakes.

Also referred to as white-nose syndrome (WNS), symptoms show in the form of a fuzzy white patch that appears on the nose, wings and hairless parts of a bat's body. Bats affected are hibernating; the fungus thrives in cold conditions. There is a 70 to 100 percent mortality rate.

A new case has been noted in South Carolina for the 1st time. "We have been expecting WNS in South Carolina," said Mary Bunch, wildlife biologist with the S.C. Department of Natural Resources (DNR) based in Clemson in a press release. "We have watched the roll call of states and counties and Canadian provinces grow each year since the 1st bat deaths were noted in New York in 2007."

There have not been any cases in humans or other animals, said the South Carolina Dept. of Natural Resources in its statement. It is said that humans could transport the fungus on clothing, shoes and gear, and authorities are asking cave explorers and miners to be careful. Experts say bats moving from cave to cave are primarily spreading the fungus, according to a New York Times report last month [February 2013].

Other effects of the fungus are the impact on the agricultural industry. Media reports indicate since the bats eat insects, studies suggest the loss of bats in North America could lead to a USD 3.7 billion loss per year in the industry.

"White nose syndrome is arguably the most devastating wildlife disease we've faced," Michael T. Rains, Director of the Forest Service's Northern Research Station, said in a recent press release. "Forest Service scientists are conducting research to halt this disease and save bats, which are so important to agriculture and forest ecosystems."
