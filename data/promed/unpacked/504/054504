Mali records new Ebola case, linked to dead nurse
-------------------------------------------------
Mali has recorded a new case of Ebola in the capital Bamako, after the friend of a nurse who died of the hemorrhagic fever earlier this month [November 2014] tested positive for the disease, health and medical officials said on Saturday [22 Nov 2015]. The nurse contracted the disease after treating an imam from neighboring Guinea, who died after being incorrectly diagnosed with kidney problems. This allowed Ebola to spread to 5 other people in the West African nation's 2nd outbreak.... 2 Malian medical officials, who asked not to be named, confirmed the relationship between the new case and the deceased nurse.... -- more

Ebola response roadmap -- Situation report update [as of end of 18 Nov 2014]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
A total of 15 351 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 6 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the United States of America) and 2 previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal) up to the end of 18 Nov 2014. There have been 5459 reported deaths.

[This is more than 100 new cases a day and 39 more deaths in only 2 days since the previous sitrep. - Mod.JW]

Following the WHO Ebola Response Roadmap structure [1], country reports fall into 2 categories:
1) those with widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); and
2) those with or that have had an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the United States of America).

A separate, unrelated outbreak of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has now been declared over.

1. Countries with Widespread and Intense Transmission
A total of 15 319 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 5444 deaths have been reported up to the end of the 18 Nov [2014] by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and 17 Nov [2014] by the Ministry of Health of Liberia (table 1).

A total of 588 health-care workers (HCWs) are known to have been infected with EVD: 94 in Guinea; 341 in Liberia; 2 in Mali; 11 in Nigeria; 136 in Sierra Leone; 1 in Spain; and 3 in the United States of America (2 [of the latter] were infected in the USA and 1 in Guinea). A total of 337 HCWs have died.

Table footnote: Data are based on official information reported by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone up to the end of 18 Nov [2014], and the Ministry of Health of Liberia up to the end of 17 Nov [2014]. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results.

[4] Sierra Leone: with schools closed, forced marriages on the rise

Forced marriages on the rise in the time of Ebola
-------------------------------------------------
My name is Christiana. I am 17 years old. I live in a small village in the Moyamba District in southern Sierra Leone. I lost my father when I was a baby and my mother is a petty trader. I have experienced issues affecting girls' rights to education because I was forced into marriage. I want to be a voice to tackle forced marriage in Sierra Leone and the world....

In my school, Plan Sierra Leone established a girls' club under the Girl Power Project. I was selected by my peers to be their president because of my goal to be an advocate for girls' education and against early marriage, teenage pregnancy and female genital mutilation.

Before the Ebola outbreak, we were having meetings as a group, doing peer education and visiting homes to promote girls' education and discourage early marriage which was prevalent in our community. I have often said: "If you plant a tree and allow it to grow, then expect a fresh fruit from it." Now it is impossible to meet as a group because schools are closed.... -- more
