When you hear the word norovirus, you may think of outbreaks associated with cruise ships or restaurants .... The highly contagious virus -- which causes vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms -- is known for its tendency to spread quickly in densely populated areas, as well as through contaminated food.

But an outbreak in Maine this month [July 2018] has brought to light another way this "stomach bug" can be passed from person to person: Scientists at the state's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that nearly 100 people became sick with norovirus after they visited a beach and swam in a lake in the town of Bridgton or had contact with others who had done so.

Catching a stomach virus at the beach sounds pretty scary -- but let's remember to look at this news in context: Swimming is an excellent way to get exercise and beat the oppressive summer heat, and spending time outdoors can provide a boost to both physical and mental health. It is important, however, to know the risks involved -- which of course include the potential for injury, drowning, and waterborne illness. Here's what you should know about this particular outbreak, and how to protect yourself and your family.

What happened in Maine this month [July 2018]?
The state's announcement about norovirus came [Fri 20 Jul 2018], 2 weeks after Maine's CDC received multiple reports of illnesses associated with Woods Pond Beach in Bridgton. The beach was closed from 6-10 Jul 2018 and reopened when testing showed that the lake contained trace but acceptable levels of contaminants.

"Specimens from humans submitted for testing confirmed that this was a norovirus outbreak," a spokesperson for the Maine Department of Health and Human Services told Health via email. "Our epidemiologic investigation found that people who put their heads under the water while swimming or swallowed water while swimming were at greater risk for infection."

Testing also showed that water from the bathroom sinks in the beach's public bathroom contained higher than acceptable levels of the bacterium _E. coli_ --another common cause of gastrointestinal illness. Although this finding is thought to be unrelated to the norovirus outbreak, health officials replaced those sinks with dispensers of hand sanitizer "as an additional precaution," according to NBC News.

What is norovirus, and how does it spread?
Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that's common throughout the United States. Symptoms -- which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramping -- usually begin 24-48 hours after ingesting the virus, although they can also begin sooner.

People can pick up norovirus by eating contaminated food, swallowing contaminated water, or touching a contaminated surface (like a doorknob or countertop) and then putting their fingers in their mouths, or by having direct contact with someone who's infected. Infected people can shed billions of microscopic norovirus particles, according to the US CDC, and exposure to just a few of those particles can make someone else sick.

The illness is not usually serious, "though people can feel very sick," the Maine Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said. There is no treatment, but most people get better within one to 2 days.

Although norovirus is often associated with cruises, college dorms, and restaurants, it's not unheard of in the context of public swimming spots. In 2015, the US CDC reported on a 70-person norovirus outbreak in Oregon, which is believed to have started after an infected swimmer vomited or had diarrhea in a lake and other swimmers swallowed the contaminated water.

In fact, norovirus was the 2nd-leading cause of outbreaks in untreated recreational water from 1978 to 2010, according to the CDC. Norovirus can live in water for several months or possibly even years, the agency said in a 2015 press release -- and lakes and ponds can pose a particular risk, since they're not treated with germ-killing chlorine.

As part of this month's [July 2018] outbreak in Maine, several people became ill after caring for someone who'd been at Woods Pond Beach and got sick -- even though they hadn't been to the beach themselves. That makes sense, say health officials, since norovirus can also spread through direct contact with infected people.

And while most people who swim at public beaches and lakes will never get a waterborne illness, the Portland Press Herald reported [Fri 20 Jul 2018] that the effects of climate change are causing bodies of water to be more populated in the summertime -- and more conducive to hosting viruses and bacteria.

"These problems could be more frequent in the future because the temperature is going to rise and people are going to seek the water in relief," Colin Holme, executive director of the Lakes Environmental Association, told the newspaper.

How to swim safely
People can decrease their chances of getting norovirus by washing their hands often with soap and water, washing fruits and vegetables, and thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting food prep, cooking, and eating surfaces, says Maine's CDC.

The US CDC also recommends that swimmers shower before they get into the water and advises people not to swim if they have diarrhea or have been vomiting. Children should come out of the water for bathroom breaks every hour, and diapers should be changed in bathrooms or specific diaper-changing areas to keep germs away from the water.

If you swim at a public pool or body of water, you can ask lifeguards or town officials what kind of testing is done on the water, and how often. And if you do get sick after swimming, report it to health officials so they can look for patterns.

Finally, Bridgton Town Manager Bob Peabody said in a statement, you can protect others by following proper hygiene precautions and being a considerate beachgoer: "I think the message is, if you're sick or your children are sick, don't go to the beach."

[The prospect that climate change may influence the current seasonality patterns of noroviruses is challenging. However, to understand completely the likely impact of climate change on norovirus epidemiology, we need to understand all of the factors that determine seasonality (that is, host behaviour and susceptibility, virus transmission, and virus fitness in its natural environment). Therefore, epidemiological surveillance of norovirus outbreaks should be tightly linked to climate monitoring. This will require multidisciplinary approaches involving virologists, climatologists, ecologists, and epidemiologists. (See Rohayem J. Norovirus seasonality and the potential impact of climate change. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2009; 15(6): 524-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02846.x; https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(14)60440-7/pdf).

As always, we need to maintain a strong surveillance program to protect public health. - Mod.LK

Sun-loving Britons are being urged to protect themselves or avoid the seaside after almost 100 people on a beach fell ill with the highly contagious norovirus.

In recent weeks, the UK has been hit with a spate of cases linked to the vomiting bug.

Now medical officials are urging people to reduce the risk of infection at popular beach resorts or to stay away altogether.

Reports of norovirus have emerged this summer [2018] in the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Devon, Cornwall, North Wales, and South Wales.

There is no direct cure for the illness.

Dr Peter Cowling, a microbiologist who deals with cases of norovirus in North Lincolnshire and Goole NHS hospitals, said: "The only way to avoid norovirus is to avoid everyday life. You run a risk of catching it wherever you go and if you come into contact with someone who is infected you are highly likely to catch it."

The virus can spread by close contact with people, through infected surfaces, objects or food.

There is also a risk of infection from swimming in open water. Public Health England has urged Britons to protect themselves when attending beaches and areas with large crowds.

A PHE spokesperson told Express.co.uk: "Sickness and diarrhoea can be caused by different stomach bugs, including norovirus, and can be avoided by practicing good hygiene.

"This includes thorough hand washing with soap and hot water after using the toilet and before eating or preparing foods. Anyone with vomiting and diarrhoea should not be preparing food for others."

They added: "Don't swallow water from the sea, beach streams, lakes, or ponds and avoid splashing water into your mouth.

"Before eating and drinking, remove sand and other debris from your hands and wash them using soap and water.

"Always follow safety advice and take notice of signs on the beach. When the signs indicate that the water in a location is "poor", bathing should be avoided and we advise people not to swim there."

[3] Summer outbreak

There has been a reported increase in the number of people complaining of vomiting and diarrhoea so far this summer [2018], meaning winter could be worse. An outbreak of norovirus this summer could spark a winter of hell with a vomiting bug crisis, an expert has warned.

There have been reports of localised cases of the nasty bug, but health officials have denied it's widespread.

The nasty infection, dubbed the winter vomiting bug, along with flu put the NHS under unprecedented pressure last winter [2017-18], as cases of the illness soared and hospitals struggled to keep up with the demand for beds. And this year could be worse, if a new strain circulates as the weather cools down, public health expert John Harris warned.

The last time there was an outbreak in the spring and summer, in 2002, it was followed by a new strain of the virus that wreaked havoc that winter, he wrote for The Conversation.

"The midsummer peak of 2002 was notable compared to the previous 6 years when there was a considerable decline in norovirus activity during the summer months," Mr Harris, who lectures at Liverpool University, wrote.

"Following the increased summer activity of 2002, there were more cases than usual reported in the following winter, higher than any of the preceding years. Now, 16 years later, are we on the cusp of a new viral strain? And will it mean a winter crisis for the NHS? At the moment, it's too early to say what is going on this summer and what will happen in the near future.

"What this does highlight, however, is the need to establish surveillance which considers various sources of reporting."
