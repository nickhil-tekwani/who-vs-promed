Bird flu recurs in northern province of Viet Nam
------------------------------------------------
Bird flu has re-emerged in the northern province of Dien Bien in Viet Nam,
according to a report from the Animal Health Department under Viet Nam's
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Monday [2 Nov 2009]. The
bird flu broke out in 9 local farms from 21 to 23 Oct 2009, killing
hundreds of poultry, said the report. Poultry samples tested by the
provincial animal health agency showed positive for the H5N1 virus, it said.

Local animal health authorities have been implementing measures to curb the
spread of the bird flu virus to nearby areas, including the culling of over
2200 remaining poultry, said the department.

Dien Bien currently is the only province of Viet Nam being re-hit by the
avian flu after it was confirmed of being free of the H5N1 virus for
several months this year [2009].

Viet Nam has reported 5 human cases of bird flu infection so far this year
[2009], 4 of which were fatal.

Viet Nam has been meticulously reporting HPAI H5N1 outbreaks since December
2006. Its most recent follow-up report, no. 32, was submitted to the OIE on
26 Jun 2009; it addressed an outbreak in the northern Quang Ninh province.
The notification, including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8230>.
A new follow-up report is expected.

Details on Viet Nam's AI prevention and control policy, including its
vaccination strategy and updates of surveillance activities, are available
at <http://www.fao.org.vn/en-US/Home/avian/situation_update.aspx>.
