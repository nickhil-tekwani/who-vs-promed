Marine officials are worried that they may be facing another
significant dolphin die-off in the Gulf of Mexico after 21 of the
marine mammals were found washed up on Texas beaches over 2 days.

The carcasses were discovered a year after about 70 dolphins washed
up in the same area over a 2-week period.

''We are concerned, especially because of what happened last year
[2007],'' said Blair Maise, the marine mammal stranding coordinator
for the national marine fisheries service. He added, ''there may be more.''

Researchers weren't able to determine a cause for last year's [2007]
significant die-off because the animals' carcasses were too
decomposed when they were discovered.

The bottlenosed dolphins found on Monday and Tuesday [3-4 Mar 2008]
on the Bolivar peninsula near Galveston, Texas were also badly
decomposed, but officials are hopeful they may still be able to
determine a cause.

''We're going to take a more proactive role this time in trying to do
aerial searches for fresher carcasses so we can get better
information on the cause,'' Maise said in a telephone interview.

Researchers have collected samples from the dolphin carcasses, which
will be studied to see whether signs of disease can be found.

They will also study satellite photos taken over the past 3 weeks to
see whether the dolphins could have been killed by a red tide, a
harmful algal bloom, which is becoming increasingly common in the Gulf.

''It's been around for hundreds and hundreds of years, the red tide,
but what's unusual are the areas where we're starting to see it more
and the impact on the marine life,'' Maise said.

[Hopefully, they will test whatever carcasses they find for domoic
acid as well as toxins associated with red tide. Aerial searches will
certainly help them spot potential areas of red tide and any
carcasses. - Mod.TG]
