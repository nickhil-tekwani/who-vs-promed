Fractional-Dose Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine Campaign - Sindh Province, Pakistan, 2016
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Wild poliovirus type 2 was declared eradicated in September 2015, prompting a synchronized switch from trivalent to bivalent (types 1 and 3) oral poliovirus vaccine in April 2016. Any subsequent isolation of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) following the switch represents a potential public health emergency for which response activities might be warranted. Vaccination options for these activities include the use of monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) and/or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for polio vaccination campaigns.

What is added by this report?
Because of the limited global stock of IPV, fractional-dose intradermal IPV (fIPV), which is one 5th of the full intramuscular dose, has been developed and is being used for polio vaccination activities. Several studies have indicated that fIPV is not inferior to full dose IPV, and it has been used successfully for polio response activities in India. In response to a VDPV2 isolate from sewage samples taken from Hyderabad, Pakistan, fIPV was used in a polio vaccination campaign targeting children aged 4-23 months in 4 districts of Sindh province, Pakistan. Although relatively high coverage (82 percent) was achieved, operational challenges related to the use of an intradermally injected vaccine were encountered during the campaign.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Given current recommendations in favor of mOPV2 use for VDPV2 response activities, countries should weigh the potential benefits of using fIPV against the operational challenges associated with its use. If countries determine that fIPV use is warranted, meticulous planning and preparation should precede such activities to ensure judicious use of the limited global stock of IPV.

Following the declaration of eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) type 2 in September 2015, trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) was withdrawn globally to reduce the risk for type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2) transmission; all countries implemented a synchronized switch to bivalent OPV (type 1 and 3) in April 2016 (1,2). Any isolation of VDPV2 after the switch is to be treated as a potential public health emergency and might indicate the need for supplementary immunization activities (3,4). On [9 Aug 2016], VDPV2 was isolated from a sewage sample taken from an environmental surveillance site in Hyderabad, Sindh province, Pakistan. Possible vaccination activities in response to VDPV2 isolation include the use of injectable inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which poses no risk for vaccine-derived poliovirus transmission. Fractional-dose, intradermal IPV (fIPV), one 5th of the standard intramuscular dose, has been developed to more efficiently manage limited IPV supplies. fIPV has been shown in some studies to be noninferior to full-dose IPV (5,6) and was used successfully in response to a similar detection of a single VDPV2 isolate from sewage in India (7). Injectable fIPV was used for response activities in Hyderabad and 3 neighboring districts. This report describes the findings of an assessment of preparatory activities and subsequent implementation of the fIPV campaign. Despite achieving high coverage (greater than 80 percent), several operational challenges were noted. The lessons learned from this campaign could help to guide the planning and implementation of future fIPV vaccination activities.

Campaign Preparations and Implementation
The fIPV campaign was conducted in 120 subdistricts, known as union councils, in Hyderabad and 3 neighboring districts (Jamshoro, Matyari, and Tando Allahyar) of Sindh province during [24 Oct 2016 - 1 Nov 2016] (Figure 1 [Location of fractional inactivated poliovirus vaccine campaign - Sindh Province, Pakistan, October-November 2016 available at source URL]). Areas with sewage drainage to the Tulsidas Pumping Station, from which the VDPV isolate was identified, and those within the potential zone of poliovirus circulation were chosen for campaign implementation. The target population for the campaign comprised 258 492 children aged 4-23 months (Table [Distribution of union councils, target populations, and vaccination sites during a fractional inactivated poliovirus vaccine campaign, by district - Sindh Province, Pakistan, October-November 2016 available at source URL]). In contrast to OPV campaigns, in which house-to-house visits constitute the primary strategy for vaccination activities, the fIPV campaign was conducted at fixed sites, such as hospitals and dispensaries, and through deployment of outreach teams to designated vaccination stations. This was to ensure cold chain maintenance and safe injection practices.

Vaccinators for the fIPV campaign were recruited mostly from among Pakistan's Lady Health Worker Programme* and staff members of the national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). A small proportion of vaccinators were recruited from among other community health workers, including dispensary staff members, clinical ward attendants, and, in one district, gardeners who had previous experience working in EPI. In addition to vaccinators, team assistants and social mobilizers were also recruited. A total of 995 vaccinators, 995 team assistants, and 1990 social mobilizers were recruited to support the campaign.

Vaccinators received a 2-day training and worked with teams of supervisors to develop microplans ahead of the campaigns. These microplans included details of the specific number of children within the target age group for each location as well as management of vaccine and cold chain supplies. Social mobilizers were recruited to promote awareness of the campaigns in the union councils where they were scheduled to take place. In addition, awareness of the campaign was promoted using posters and banners, radio and television, public announcements, and through engagement of religious and community leaders.

Over 9 days of the campaign, vaccination activities took place at designated locations during 8 a.m.-4 p.m. A team comprising at least one vaccinator, an assistant, and 2 social mobilizers staffed each vaccination site. Vaccinators administered a 0.1-mL dose of fIPV (one 5th of a full intramuscular dose of IPV, drawn from a vial containing 10 full intramuscular doses) intradermally in the upper left arm of each child, and assistants marked the left 5th finger of each vaccinated child with an indelible marker and entered records in a tally sheet.

Intracampaign Monitoring and Field Assessment
A team of 20 campaign assessors drawn from the Pakistan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program monitored the campaign in 21 union councils. The 21 union councils were randomly selected from the pool of 120 union councils that took part in the campaign, with probability of selection proportional to estimated size. Campaign assessors visited selected vaccination sites, fixed and outreach, where they assessed staffing patterns and vaccine delivery procedures, including the quality of intradermal injections, vaccine supply and cold chain management, and compliance with the open-vial policy† (8).

Among 726 (590 outreach and 136 fixed) vaccination sites visited (Table), 74 (10 percent) were either nonfunctional or experienced delays in commencing their activities. Of the 566 functional outreach vaccination sites, 32 percent were not at the locations indicated in the campaign microplan. Furthermore, vaccinators at 67 (12 percent) outreach stations were different from those listed in the microplan. All but one (134 of 135) of the vaccinators at fixed sites reported having previous experience with intradermal injections, compared with 90 percent of vaccinators at outreach stations. Nine percent of vaccinators stated that the training they received did not adequately prepare them for administering intradermal fIPV injections during the campaign.

All IPV vials were within their expiration dates, and 98 percent had valid vaccine vial monitors (VVMs), thermochromic labels that change color when the vaccine has not been maintained at the appropriate temperature. Although 95 percent of vaccinators were knowledgeable about the different stages of VVMs and their significance related to vaccine viability, 32 percent of vaccinators at outreach stations and 19 percent at fixed sites were observed to not review VVMs before administering the vaccine (Figure 2 [Knowledge of vaccine vial monitors and compliance with open vial policy among vaccinators during a fractional inactivated poliovirus vaccine campaign - Sindh Province, Pakistan, October-November 2016 available at source URL]). Each campaign assessor observed an average of 3 intradermal fIPV injections per vaccination station visited. Among 1960 injections observed, 96 percent were administered at the appropriate site; bleb formation, indicative of intradermal delivery of fIPV, was observed in 82 percent of injections. Blebs were more commonly observed among children vaccinated at fixed sites (92 percent) than at outreach stations (80 percent). There were no adverse event reporting forms at 119 (17 percent) of the stations visited, and 15 percent of vaccinators at outreach stations were not aware of procedures for reporting adverse events. There was also considerable confusion about the open-vial policy: 51 percent of outreach stations and 24 percent of fixed sites were not reusing open IPV vials the next day, even if the VVM was valid, there was no leakage from the vial septum, and the vaccine was within its expiration date (Figure 2 [available at the source URL).

To assess the level of campaign awareness, campaign assessors interviewed 1968 caregivers at vaccination sites. Up to 70 percent of caregivers were from rural union councils and 30 percent from urban union councils. Awareness of the campaign before its commencement was lower among caregivers from rural union councils (57 percent) than among those from urban union councils (83 percent). Of the 1273 (65 percent) caregivers who were aware of the campaign, 3/4 gained their awareness through a single information source. Among this group, the principal sources of information about the campaign were social mobilizers (75 percent) and vaccinators/health workers (15 percent). Mass media, such as radio and TV, accounted for less than 5 percent of caregiver campaign awareness. Despite the pivotal role of social mobilizers in creating awareness in the community, deficiencies were noted in their performance. Among 517 social mobilizers, 63 percent did not have a social mobilization plan with a route map and 17 percent did not have a checklist to mark off houses they had visited.

Postcampaign Coverage Assessment
A multistage cluster survey was used to assess the quality of the fIPV campaign. Up to 35 union councils were selected as primary sampling units from among 120 union councils that took part in the campaign, with probability of selection proportional to estimated size. Within each council, 6 neighborhood clusters were selected, from among which 10 households were randomly chosen. One eligible child in each of these households was checked for finger-marking as evidence of vaccination. Data on vaccination status based on parental recall was also collected. The post campaign assessment took place during [3-6 Nov 2016] and was undertaken by staff members of the Pakistan Polio Eradication Initiative.

Overall, 2100 children were assessed for vaccination during the campaign. Estimated coverage, accounting for the 1st stage clusters, was 82 percent (Wilson confidence interval = 78 - percent 85 percent) based on finger-marking and 90 percent (Wilson confidence interval = 88 - percent 92 percent) based on parental recall. Nearly half (49 percent) of 377 children reported as unvaccinated were classified as such based on the absence of finger-marking, despite claims by their parents that they were vaccinated. Among the remaining 191 children, refusals (27 percent), lack of awareness (24 percent), and absence of the child during the campaign (16 percent) were the main reasons for children not being vaccinated. Refusals were driven mostly by fear or illness of the child at the time of the campaign, but they only constituted approximately 2 percent of the 2100 children assessed during the survey.

Discussion
Although relatively high vaccination coverage (82 percent) was achieved during the fIPV campaign in response to the VDPV2 isolate in Hyderabad, the campaign highlighted several operational challenges associated with the use of an intradermally injected vaccine during a polio campaign. Many of these challenges are related to the fact that campaigns using injectable vaccines are better suited to fixed-site implementation, as opposed to the house-to-house strategy used for most polio campaigns, because of the operational complexities of safely administering injections and disposing of needles and syringes.

Many of the difficulties encountered in the fIPV campaign occurred more commonly at outreach stations. Compared with those at fixed sites, vaccinators at outreach stations were more likely to be inexperienced and to administer vaccines incorrectly. Collectively, vaccinators at both fixed sites and outreach stations could have benefited from better training and more rigorous precampaign planning. Further, all vaccinators need to be properly trained on procedures for reporting adverse events. Although social mobilizers were the principal drivers of awareness, the quality of mobilization activities before and during the campaign was suboptimal, especially in rural union councils. Detailed microplanning, including the creation and use of route maps, should be prioritized to facilitate social mobilization activities for future campaigns.

An earlier fIPV campaign in India demonstrated the operational feasibility of achieving high vaccination coverage with the vaccine in response to VDPV2 isolation from sewage (7). The fIPV campaign in Pakistan corroborates the feasibility of achieving high coverage, but it also highlights the operational challenges encountered during such campaigns. Current World Health Organization protocol recommends monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) as the appropriate response vaccine when circulation of VDPV2 is confirmed because of its effectiveness in interrupting poliovirus transmission (9). IPV use is not routinely recommended, largely because it might diminish the ability to achieve high quality rounds of mOPV2 vaccination that will stop poliovirus transmission and because IPV recipients, while protected against paralysis, can continue to transmit poliovirus in an ongoing outbreak. If, however, a country elects to respond to a single VDPV isolate with fIPV, meticulous planning and preparation is required to ensure judicious and effective use of the limited global IPV stock (1,10).

† The World Health Organization's open vial policy allows for the use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for up to 28 days after opening so long as the vaccine vial monitor is valid and the manufacturer's instructions stipulate that it can be used as such. The vaccine vial must be within its expiry date, there should be no evidence of leakage or contamination, and it must be stored under proper conditions between vaccination sessions.

[The use of a trivalent IPV (containing killed WPV1, WPV2 and WPV3), seems intuitively more forward thinking than the use of the monovalent OPV2 to interrupt circulation of vaccine derived polioviruses (VDPV) as continued seeding of the environment and population with the OPV2 virus, while immediately may interrupt circulation of the cVDPV2, there is still a chance of leaving residual OPV2 virus circulating among individuals not reached by the campaign, to ultimately create new cVDPV2. A somewhat circuitous argument, but mother nature has already taught us how cunning she is in attempting to keep polioviruses around. Hence, the importance of using the IPV, and in the face of shortages, the use of fractional doses of IPV (fIPV). In the past, arguments against the use of IPV included the higher cost of the vaccine, both in terms of actual cost per dose as well as the higher opportunity costs required more skilled workers to administer the vaccines, and as mentioned in the above article, the more challenged use of this vaccine in house-to-house vaccination campaigns.

The lessons learned from the use of the fIPV in Pakistan are valuable lessons moving forward with the goal of replacing the use of the OPV2 with the fIPV. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Unvaccinated children, Pakistan - media report
Date: Fri 1 Dec 2017

As officials involved in anti-polio campaigns struggle to prevent the spread of virus, some 69 389 children in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) remain unvaccinated even after the repeated campaigns launched during National Immunisation Drive (NID) across the province. The campaign was launched on [Mon 20 Nov 2017] where around 5.8 million children below the age of 5 were administered the polio vaccine, with 69 383 left unvaccinated. The figure was higher initially but dropped down to 69 383 by [Tue 28 Nov 2017].
"We have always been saying that the virus can be eliminated in a single campaign if all the children are vaccinated leaving not even a single one behind. Even if one child is left unvaccinated, it harms the entire programme," a senior health official said. An official, on the condition of anonymity, told The Express Tribune that despite repeated awareness campaigns launched across the province, some parents still refuse to get their children vaccinated which was the main problem the officials faced in carrying out the campaign successfully.

According to Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) report, out of the total of 69 389 children who remained unvaccinated, 63 270 were not available in their homes during the visit of the polio teams while the parents of 6119 children refused to get their children vaccinated. "We call them 'not available' when they are not at their homes but they are available somewhere else for instance in schools, grandparents' home, uncles' or anywhere else and may have received the vaccination. However, the main problem is when parents refuse polio workers to vaccinate their children," the official said.

"If you don't vaccinate 22 138 children, sitting right under your nose, you will not be able to root this virus out of the province," the official said. In Peshawar alone, some 18 324 children were not available at home during the polio teams' visit while parents of 3814 children refused to get their children inoculated. Peshawar was followed by Charsadda district where parents of 555 children refused polio vaccine for their children, while 1720 children were not available for vaccination. According to the official data, parents of some 497 from Nowshera, 381 from Lakki Marwat, 307 from Swabi, 289 from Bannu, 136 from Mardan and 42 each from Mansehra and Tank also refused polio vaccine.

Poliovirus cases have dropped sharply from 306 in 2014 to only 5 in 2017. Only one case each was confirmed from K-P, Sindh, Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan and Baluchistan in 2017. On the other hand, not even a single case surfaced from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) for over a year.

[This last article shows the challenges the vaccination programs are facing in Pakistan with children not available to the vaccinators to achieve the desired (and needed coverages). The irony here is seen in the last sentence that no cases have been reported from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) for over a year - an area theoretically harder to access and reach with services. So among questions that remain, what proportion of those unavailable to the vaccinators are just coincidentally away from the designated location on the vaccination day, vs. those the parents intentionally removed from the area without necessitating stating they refuse to vaccinate?

For those interested in the results of AFP surveillance in Pakistan, see http://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/pakistan/Week_47-Nov_25_2017.pdf for the most recent weekly report, and look at the final 3 pages of tables showing the as yet unclassified AFP cases more than 90 days after onset of symptoms that reported during 2017. It would be very interesting to see the final classifications of the cases, especially those who died and those who did not have stool specimens taken within a week of onset of paralysis. - Mod.MPP]
