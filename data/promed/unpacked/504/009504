An illness outbreak from a Wisconsin cheesemaker that was linked to one death and a miscarriage likely was caused by substantial sanitation deficiencies in the cheese-making process, a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says.

The listeriosis outbreak occurred last summer [2013] and was linked to contaminated soft cheeses from Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Co. of Waterloo. The death was in Minnesota, while illnesses from _Listeria monocytogenes_ were reported in Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

3 Crave Brothers pasteurized soft cheeses were the subject of a nationwide recall as a result of the outbreak: Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with truffles. All 3 had previously captured national and international awards for Crave, one of Wisconsin's most well-known cheesemakers.

"Inspection of the cheesemaking facility revealed that substantial sanitation deficiencies during the cheesemaking process itself, after the milk was pasteurized, likely led to contamination," CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted.

Pasteurization, a process in which milk is heated to a high temperature to destroy pathogens, eliminates listeria in milk. But contamination can occur after pasteurization, according to government regulators. "Cheese-making facilities should use strict sanitation and microbiologic monitoring, regardless of whether they use pasteurized milk," the CDC report said. Details of the contamination were not in the report, and Crave Brothers declined to comment.

The 5 people sickened told health department officials they had definitely or probably eaten 1 of 3 varieties of Crave soft-ripened cheese. 3 of the people had purchased the cheese at 3 different restaurants, and 2 had purchased it at 2 different grocery stores. The cheeses were shipped as intact wheels to the restaurants and stores, where they had been cut and served or cut and repackaged and sold to customers, according to the CDC report.

Laboratory tests conducted by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture on samples of the cheeses from 2 retail stores indicated the presence of the outbreak strain [of] _Listeria monocytogenes_.

Listeria infections are among the 3 most deadly foodborne bacteria after toxoplasmosis and salmonellosis.

Crave Brothers issued voluntary product recalls 2 days after it halted production of the 3 cheeses. On [11 Jul 2013], the company voluntarily halted production of all cheese products made in the plant, the report noted.

All 5 people sickened in the outbreak were hospitalized, including the pregnant woman who suffered a miscarriage. They ranged in age from 31 to 67 years old, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The company has not been fined, and checks of court records haven't revealed lawsuits. Cheesemakers could face criminal charges for shipping contaminated cheese into the marketplace, according to Bill Marler, a Seattle attorney who specializes in food safety cases. "But it's very rare that the FDA does anything with respect to fines or sanctions whatsoever in these cases," he said.

[The news report above refers to the CDC publication, which is abridged and edited below: Choi MJ, Jackson KA, Medus C, et al. Notes from the field: multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to soft-ripened cheese -- United States, 2013. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 4 Apr 2014; 63(13): 294-5; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6313a5.htm:

On [27 Jun 2013], the Minnesota Department of Health notified CDC of 2 patients with invasive _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections (listeriosis) whose clinical isolates had indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. A query of PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, identified clinical and environmental isolates from other states. On [28 Jun 2013], CDC learned from the Food and Drug Administration's Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network that environmental isolates indistinguishable from those of the 2 patients had been collected from Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese during 2010-2011.

As of [28 Jun 2014], 5 cases [who had isolation of _L. monocytogenes_ with the outbreak PFGE pattern from an anatomic site that is normally sterile (such as, blood or cerebrospinal fluid), or from a product of conception] were identified in 4 states (Minnesota, 2 cases; Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, one case each). Median age of the 5 patients was 58 years (range: 31-67 years). 4 patients were female, including one who was pregnant at the time of infection. All 5 were hospitalized. 1 death and 1 miscarriage were reported.

All 5 patients had definitely or probably eaten one of 3 varieties of Crave Brothers soft-ripened cheese (Les Freres, Petit Frere, or Petit Frere with truffles). 3 patients had purchased the cheese at 3 different restaurants, and 2 had purchased the cheese at 2 different grocery stores. The cheeses were shipped as intact wheels to the 3 restaurants and 2 grocery stores, where they had been cut and served or repackaged and sold to customers.

Testing at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture identified the outbreak pattern of _L. monocytogenes_ in 2 cheese wedges (Les Freres and Petit Frere with truffles) collected from 2 different grocery stores in Minnesota. Inspection of the cheese-making facility revealed that substantial sanitation deficiencies during the cheese-making process itself, after the milk was pasteurized, likely led to contamination. On [1 Jul 2013], Crave Brothers halted production of Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with truffles. On [3 Jul 2013], Crave Brothers issued a voluntary recall of these products with a production date of [1 Jul 2013], or earlier. On [11 Jul 2013], the company voluntarily halted production of all cheese products manufactured at the facility. After product recall, one additional case was identified in Texas through whole genome sequencing, bringing the total case count for the outbreak to 6.

This outbreak was linked to soft cheeses that were likely contaminated during the cheese-making process (2,3). Pasteurization eliminates _Listeria_ in milk. However, contamination can occur after pasteurization. Cheesemaking facilities should use strict sanitation and microbiologic monitoring, regardless of whether they use pasteurized milk.+

Persons at greater risk for listeriosis, including older adults, pregnant women, and those with immunocompromising conditions, should be aware that certain soft cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, or made under unsanitary conditions, regardless of whether the milk was pasteurized, have been shown to cause severe illness. These soft cheeses include fresh (unripened) cheeses, such as queso fresco (4), and soft-ripened cheeses, such as the cheeses implicated in this outbreak.
