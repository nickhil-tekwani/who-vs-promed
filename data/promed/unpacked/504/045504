Pennsylvania: hepatitis outbreak involves more restaurant patrons
---------------------------------------------------
26 more patrons of a Chi-Chi's restaurant in the Beaver Valley Mall in
Center have lab-confirmed cases of hepatitis A, bringing the total to 34,
as of yesterday [Tue 4 Nov 2003]. Since Saturday, 12 restaurant employees
and at least 10 customers had symptoms of the viral infection. By Monday,
the state Department of Health found that 8 people were infected.
The department advised people who had eaten at the Beaver County restaurant
between 22 Oct 2003 and Sun 2 Nov 2003 to get an injection of
immunoglobulin as a precaution. According to spokeswoman Jessica Seiders,
30 of the patients are from Pennsylvania, 3 are from Ohio, and one is from
West Virginia. So far, "none of the confirmed cases are employees," she
said. As more testing is done and the medical community becomes aware of
the outbreak, "we will probably see an increase in cases," Seiders added.
Some of the patients have been admitted to hospital.
Hepatitis A virus is shed in the stool of infected individuals. The disease
can spread to people who eat food that has been prepared by contaminated
hands. Salads, sandwiches, nachos, and other foods are riskier because the
ingredients are handled repeatedly and are not cooked. An infected person
could also inadvertently pass the virus on to household contacts.
Symptoms of hepatitis A infection include fever, fatigue, nausea and
vomiting, abdominal pain and jaundice. The disease can begin suddenly and
lasts for one to several weeks. Most patients recover without
complications. The health department advised people who have symptoms or
are at risk to contact their family doctors.
Immunoglobulin is effective if given within 14 days of exposure, thus
people who ate at the restaurant before 22 Oct 2003 will not benefit. The
health department is holding public immunization clinics. People who have
already had the disease or been vaccinated against hepatitis A are not at
risk for new infection.

[The absence of confirmed cases among restaurant employees (although the
first paragraph reports that initially more employees than customers had
symptoms) suggests that contaminated food or raw vegetables may be the
origin of the outbreak. Recently outbreaks of hepatitis A virus infection
affecting food outlets in several south eastern states of the USA were
traced to green onions, probably originating from a single supplier (see
references below). - Mod.CP]
