The Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks investigated a
number of deaths of white-tailed deer and California bighorn sheep
[wild in the South and Central Okanagan [Canada in September
and October 1999.
Ministry biologists report the wildlife deaths are the result a lethal
viral infection known as epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD). The
disease is not a threat to people, pets or domestic animal
populations.
In particular, hunters and guide outfitters are advised EHD does
not pose a danger. Normal hygiene and proper cooking of wild
meat will eliminate risks to public health. Hunting season closures
are not required.
Southern British Columbia (BC) appears to be on the margin of this
EHD outbreak. The epicenter was south of the international
boundary in Washington State. This outbreak should be concluded
with the onset of cold weather.
It is estimated less than 200 animals have died due to this viral
infection. These numbers are not expected to impact deer and
bighorn sheep population management in the Okanagan.
The EHD virus is neither treatable nor preventable. EHD is not
likely to occur again in southern BC for several years. The last
outbreak was documented in 1987.
Anyone with information pertaining to the unusual death of wildlife is
asked to contact the Penticton Office at (250) 490-8200 or call the
Observe, Record, Report line toll free at 1-800-663-WILD (9453).
