The agriculture ministry said on Wed [8 Jan 2020] that a classical swine fever [CSF] infection has been confirmed at a pig farm in the prefecture of Okinawa for the 1st time since the autumn of 1986.

The Okinawa Prefectural Government plans to cull more than 1800 pigs at the farm in the city of Uruma and at another farm where infection is suspected, in accordance with the law [see OIE's data in the commentary. - Mod.AS].

In September 2018, the 1st CSF outbreak in Japan in 26 years was identified at a pig farm in the central city of Gifu. Before the latest outbreak in Okinawa, CSF infections were confirmed in a total of 12 prefectures, mainly in the Chubu and Kanto regions, such as Aichi, Mie and Saitama. The virus is believed to have been transmitted through wild boars.

The ministry will carefully look into infection routes, as it is thought that pigs at the farm in Okinawa may have become infected via different routes to prior cases.

Officials in Okinawa's pork industry were shocked by the news and expressed fears over the spread of the disease and harmful rumors.

"After the outbreak in Gifu, we strengthened epidemic prevention measures. It is regretful that we are put in such a serious situation," said Seizo Inamine, 64, chairman of the prefecture's pig farming promotion council. "We are praying that vaccination will be conducted to prevent further spread of the disease."

Agriculture minister Taku Eto explained, at a meeting held at the ministry to cope with the latest outbreak, that the farm raises Agu, an Okinawan breed of pig. "We cannot deny the possibility that this will have a grave impact on Okinawa," Eto said. "We will make every effort to control the epidemic."

Pig raising has been conducted widely in Okinawa since the prefecture was independent and known as the Ryukyu Kingdom, from the 15th to the 19th century.

Although business declined sharply during World War II, it had recovered in recent years as the prefecture made efforts to promote Agu pork as a premium brand.

Shipment of pigs reached some 330 000 in fiscal 2018.

[The new CSF outbreaks (3 farms) in Uruma city, Okinawa have been reported to the OIE on 8 Jan 2020, in follow-up report No 43 (available, with an interactive map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=32842). The report includes the following epidemiological comments (with 2 notes):

"1. The 52nd affected farm [since the start of Japan's CSF event in 2018] (Uruma city in Okinawa): On 6 Jan 2020, some pigs were found to be dead and it was reported to the Local Hygiene Service Centre (LHSC). The official veterinarians of the LHSC immediately visited the farm to conduct clinical inspection and sampling. RT-PCR for CSFV was conducted at the LHSC and it was found to be positive on 7 Jan 2020. The amplified product was sent to National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) for sequencing and CSF was confirmed on 8 Jan 2020. The epidemiologically related farm was identified. Stamping out and disinfection of contaminated materials, tools and facilities were being carried out at the 52nd affected farm and the epidemiologically related farm.

"2. The 53rd affected farm (Uruma city in Okinawa): On 7 Jan 2020, official veterinarians of LHSC conducted on-site inspection and sampling on the farm located next to the 52nd affected farm. RT-PCR for CSFV was conducted at the LHSC. The result was found to be positive on 8 Jan 2020. Stamping out and disinfection of contaminated materials, tools and facilities were being carried out at the 53rd affected farm.

"Note 1: On 15 Oct 2019, Japan amended the Specific Infections Livestock Disease Control Guidelines for CSF to allow vaccination in domestic pigs in designated prefectures ("vaccination recommended areas"). The Vaccination in domestic pigs are practiced in the following prefectures, Gunma, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Gifu, Aichi, Mie, Shiga, Saitama, Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Kanagawa, Tokyo.

"Note 2: When CSF outbreaks happen, Japan implement movement restrictions in the Shipment Restriction Zone (SRZ), which is established within 3-10 km [1.9-6.2 mi] radius of the affected farm, and in the Movement Restriction Zone (MRZ), which is established within 3km [1.9 mi] radius of the affected farm. SRZ will be lifted when all the results of active surveillance program are negative, and 17 days have passed after the completion of full implementation of control measures (stamping out, disinfection etc.). MRZ will be lifted when all the results of active surveillance program are negative, and 28 days have passed after the completion of full implementation of control measures (stamping out, disinfection etc.)".

OIE's map presenting all 1605 outbreaks, in wild boar and domestic pigs, reported since the start of the event on 9 Sep 2018, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27871. Okinawa island is situated more than 1300 km [808 mi] south of the CSF cluster in central Japan.
