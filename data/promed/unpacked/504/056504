A second dead crow found in Massachusetts
---------------------------------------
A second dead crow was found in Massachusetts, in the town of Hopkinton [35
miles west of Boston, on 27 Jul 2000. To date, no mosquito pools have
produced a positive result for West Nile virus. Spraying has begun around
the Willow Pond area in Jamaica Plain. Also, there are reports that spraying
is to begin in the Hopkinton area.

Child from Jamaica Plain being tested for West Nile virus infection
-------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSTON: A Boston child was being tested in a hospital Thursday for West
Nile virus, hospital officials said, one day after state health officials
revealed they had discovered first signs of the virus in Massachusetts. An
unidentified 12-year-old child from Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood,
where a dead crow infected with West Nile was found last Saturday, was
tested for the virus after being admitted to Children's Hospital Wednesday,
spokeswoman Bess Andrews said Thursday. She said early indications suggested
he was suffering from encephalitis, but that it was not clear whether [West
Nile virus had caused it. Encephalitis is one of several conditions that
can be caused by the West Nile virus. "There is currently a patient in
serious condition from the area being evaluated for symptoms that could
relate to a number of different illnesses, including encephalitis," a
hospital statement said."Until the tests are complete and the results are
in, infectious disease specialists at Children's (Hospital) caution against
assuming there is any connection between this patient and the West Nile
virus."
The discovery of the dead crow last Saturday was the first time the virus
had been found in Massachusetts and Boston is the northernmost point the
virus has been found. So far this year, the virus has been found in
mosquitoes or birds in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. State health
officials were also testing mosquitoes from Massachusetts to see if they
were carrying the virus. Those test results were expected later on Thursday.

Texas Department of Health Adds West Nile Virus to Monitoring Efforts
--------------------------------------
Add a new name to the list of diseases mosquitoes potentially can carry to
humans - West Nile [virus infection. West Nile virus, closely related to
both St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) and dengue viruses, was first seen in the
United States last year. Although the outbreak affected people in the New
York City area [only, the virus could spread to other areas of the country.
The Texas Department of Health (TDH) is expanding it's mosquito monitoring
system to detect if West Nile virus is introduced to the state, said Julie
Rawlings of TDH's Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Surveillance Division.
To most people, mosquitoes are just an annoying pest with an irritating
bite. But these insects can carry serious, sometimes deadly organisms that
cause diseases such as SLE and West Nile infections along with both Western
and Eastern Equine Encephalitis and dengue fever. A large dengue outbreak
occurred last year in Texas, with 62 cases reported, including one death.
Wild birds are the principal reservoirs of mosquito-borne encephalitis
viruses. Mosquitoes feed on infected birds, then transmit the virus to
humans and animals.
To detect West Nile virus, TDH will concentrate on monitoring mosquito
species likely to feed on birds migrating from the northeastern United
States through the Gulf Coast. Areas involved in the expanded monitoring
system include Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Nueces, Kleberg, Kenedy,
Cameron and Hidalgo counties. Harris County will have its own monitoring
system. In addition, testing for West Nile virus will be included in the
long-established programs in Brazos, Dallas, El Paso, Jefferson, Orange,
Lubbock and Wichita counties. Also, city and county health departments,
public health regions, military installations, universities and other local
mosquito control programs send specimens to the TDH Lab. for identification,
Rawlings said.
About 82 varieties of the ever-present mosquito are found in Texas. However,
only about a dozen transmit serious diseases, said Paul Fournier, supervisor
of the TDH Bureau of Laboratories, Parasitology-Entomology Branch. The
common house mosquito (_Culex quinquefasciatus_), Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes
albopictus_) and _Aedes aegypti_ are the most common around Texas that carry
disease. These backyard biters are drawn to areas with a ready water supply
to reproduce.

Epidemiology and Surveillance, at 512-458-7228; Paul Fournier, TDH Bureau of
Laboratories Parasitology-Entomology Branch, at 512-458-7605; or Emily
Palmer, TDH Office of Communications, at 512-458-7400.

Over-wintering and amplifying host(s)
------------------------------------
The report [in West Nile virus surveillance - USA (08) of a West Nile
virus-positive crow from Boston and possibly a case in a child from the same
neighborhood where the bird was found), is both disturbing and extremely
interesting. The fact that West Nile virus activity recurred in the same
locations as last year would seem to suggest that the source at the
epicenter is still active. The pattern of spread (birds in last year's
locations, last year in Baltimore, now in Boston) seems to indicate the
important over-wintering and amplifying host(s) is/are perhaps a marine
species, or a brackish marsh dweller. The fact the virus does not seem to be
spreading as rapidly inland or further south, where vector conditions for
spread would have been favorable months ago, might also mean the species
involved are not migratory, or might not be birds at all.

West Nile Virus prevention: upstate NY
--------------------------------------
SARATOGA SPRINGS: Although no evidence exists that West Nile virus has
migrated upstate, Saratoga Race Course is considering expanding its seasonal
spraying for mosquitoes this year. Horse trainers are taking extra steps to
protect their investments as fears grow that West Nile virus might migrate
north with the nearly 1800 horses from Belmont Park. Although evidence of
the virus has not been found this far upstate, two dead crows infected with
the virus have been discovered recently in the Boston area, raising concern
about the potential spread of the virus.
