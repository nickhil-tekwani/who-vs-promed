[It is now 3 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report there are no new reports of locally transmitted infection. All 32 newly confirmed cases are imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 81 740 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3331 deaths, representing an increase of 32 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (5 Apr 2020) report was prepared, and no newly reported deaths. An additional 12 suspected cases were newly reported, all imported cases. 24 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported 0 newly confirmed cases for the past 2 days.

A total of 32 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 983. There are an additional 89 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine translated report above, there were 30 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 9 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1033, 275 of whom are importations from abroad. There were 2 originally asymptomatic cases that have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours -- both were imported cases.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and was planning on ending it in Wuhan today, 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 47 cases and 6 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (5-6 Apr 2020) when there were also 47 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 331 confirmed cases, including 192 deaths were reported today, up from 10 284 cases and 186 deaths yesterday [5 Apr 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 14 consecutive days and below 50 for 2 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 65.8% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.8% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 27.7% of the total newly confirmed cases while Seoul represented 8.5% of the newly confirmed cases, and Gyeonggi represented 21.3%. Quarantined imported cases represented 29.8% of the newly confirmed cases, with 14 newly confirmed cases in quarantine on arrival in the airport. Similar to yesterday, 9 provinces reported 0 newly confirmed cases.

As seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 324 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Also as in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 132 547 cases, including 16 523 deaths, up from 128 948 cases and 15 887 deaths reported on 5 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 5 and 6 Apr 2020 was 3599 newly confirmed cases, compared with 4316 newly confirmed cases between 4 Apr 2020 and 5 Apr 2020, decreasing from yesterday's observations. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country -- in Lombardy (51 534), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (17 556), Veneto (11588), and Piemonte (12 924). These 4 provinces combined account for 68.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Piedmont, with 15.6% of the newly confirmed cases reported, is seeing more activity than Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

Today's news is a continued cautious ray of sunshine with respect to the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy. The reduction in daily newly confirmed cases and deaths continues.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 24 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 22 days since the countrywide lockdown.

In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 7th globally -- behind the USA, Spain, Italy, Germany, China, and France.

In another media report there is a discussion of the political level wanting to open up the economy and businesses by 8 Apr 2020, against the advice of the Health Ministry (https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/04/iran-billion-sovereign-fund-rohani-coronavirus.html). There is an excellent OpEd piece in the Telegraph by Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the IMF, and Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus the Director-General of the WHO addressing the economic and public health impact of this pandemic and the hazards of dropping containment measures too early (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/protecting-healthandlivelihoods-go-hand-in-hand-cannot-save/).

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that today's (6 Apr 2020) report shows a 53.7% reduction since 31 Mar 2020. As of today, totals of 135 032 cases and 13 055 deaths have been reported, up from 130 759 cases and 12 418 deaths confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 216.8. It is 1st in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 135 032 cases, 59 662 (44.2%) have been hospitalized and 6931 (5.1%) admitted to the ICU. The crude reported case fatality rate is 9.7%, with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions. Both the proportion of cases hospitalized and the proportion of cases in ICU have shown slight decreases over the past few days.

News
Beginning of confinement in the commune of Gombe in Kinshasa
------------------------------------------------------------
- The confinement of the Gombe municipality, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, began today, Monday [6 Apr 2020].
- The activities of the COVID-19 disease response, as part of this containment, were launched with cleaning of the Government House by a mixed team from the response commission in charge of infection prevention and control and the Sanitation Department of the Ministry of the Environment.
- Always within the framework of containment of the Gombe municipality, the sanitation teams of the National Biomedical Research Institute (INRB) proceeded to decontaminate the buildings of this health structure.
- For the proper functioning of this containment, barriers have been placed in hot spots acting as entry or exit from this municipality. At each barrier, handwashing and temperature control devices are placed so that each person entering or leaving it is controlled.
- Supervision of these barriers is ensured by the Congolese National Police and response teams in charge of border hygiene.

[The number of cases have been slowly but steadily increasing in the DR Congo. Kinshasa is the capital city with an estimated population of 12 million in 2016 (Democratic Republic of Congo Urbanization Review, World Bank, page 18 https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28931/9781464812033.pdf?sequence=2). Introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into this crowded city with limited infrastructure in various areas is of significant concern. Of additional concern is the introduction of the virus into the Eastern zones, especially in North and South Kivu and Ituri, the zones of civil unrest and a recent prolonged Ebolavirus disease outbreak.

Gombe is a municipality of the Lukunga district of Kinshasa. It is residential to the European community and the Congolese elite community, as well as the main business district of Kinshasa.

A map showing the location of Gombe within Kinshasa can be found at https://tinyurl.com/rpnl52n and a map of DR Congo showing provinces at <hhttp://goo.gl/DM2AT8>. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be seen at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7193788,194

For the past 2 weeks I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Shaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP
