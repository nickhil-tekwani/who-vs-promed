Dead bison found near Highway 5
-------------------------------
As the latest anthrax outbreak in the Slave River Lowlands slows
down, Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP) employees found 2 dead bison
raising concerns about anthrax last week.

Parks employees found the 2 bison one kilometer apart along Highway
5, between km 130 and 140. The carcasses were estimated to be at
least a week old and the deaths appeared to not be from a
bison-vehicle collision.
