The Department of Health has been notified of a 4th Western
Australian diagnosed with legionnaires' disease following travel to
Bali since December 2010. Acting chief health officer, Dr Andy
Robertson, said while the exact source of the disease remained
unknown, all the Western Australians recently diagnosed had stayed at
the Ramayana Resort and Spa Hotel in Central Kuta.

"The Indonesian Government has been advised of the Australian cases
by the Australian Government, and is working with the World Health
Organisation to investigate the possible source of the disease," Dr
Robertson said.

Dr Robertson said the early symptoms of legionnaires' disease are
typically similar to severe 'flu-like' illness. "Early symptoms may
include fever, chills, muscle soreness, headaches, tiredness, reduced
appetite, and diarrhoea, along with dry cough and breathlessness," Dr
Robertson said. The Department of Health is advising Western
Australians who have recently returned from Bali, and have developed
flu-like symptoms within 10 days, to contact their GP.

"Legionnaires' disease is treated with specific antibiotics, and
while most people recover, some people may develop severe pneumonia
requiring hospitalisation." Legionnaires' disease most often affects
middle-aged and elderly people, particularly those who smoke or who
have lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or a weakened immune
system. _Legionella pneumophila_ is a type of bacteria commonly
transmitted by the inhalation of water droplets from contaminated
warm water environments such as: air conditioning cooling towers in
large buildings and evaporative air conditioners; showers and warm
water systems; spa pools; misting or droplet sprays, and fountains.
Legionnaires' disease cannot be caught from other people or from
animal contact.

Media statement: legionnaires' disease alert to travelers from Bali
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Australia's chief medical officer, Professor Jim Bishop, has issued
an alert to travellers in Bali or who have recently returned, who
experience 'flu-like' symptoms such as fever and cough to consult
their GPs or hospital emergency departments.

"It is important that patients advise their doctor or hospital of
their recent travel to Bali," Professor Bishop said. "Over recent
months, Australian health authorities have been made aware of 11
cases of legionnaires' disease detected in Victorian and Western
Australian residents returning from holidays in the Kuta area of Bali
between August 2010 and January 2011.

Professor Bishop said Indonesian health authorities and the World
Health Organization (WHO) are aware of the problem and are
investigating. They have taken water samples from possible sources of
outbreak for testing and have advised on appropriate disinfection and
cleaning of water supply systems at the hotel and buildings in the
vicinity. A number of those who contracted the disease stayed in the
same hotel in Kuta (the Ramayana Resort and Spa) and most had visited
the same local shopping centre.

The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing is working
with State and Territory health departments to ensure that health
professionals are alert to the potential risk of contracting the
disease from travel to Bali. "There are specific antibiotics
available to treat the disease. The time between a person's exposure
to the bacteria and becoming sick is usually between 2 to 10 days,"
Professor Bishop said. "People most at risk of legionnaires' disease
are those over 50 years of age, smokers, and anyone whose immune
system is suppressed by medication or diseases such as cancer, kidney
failure, or diabetes. These people may experience more severe disease."

Legionnaires' disease may cause fever, chills, a cough and shortness
of breath. Some people also have muscle aches, headache, tiredness,
loss of appetite, and diarrhoea. Legionnaires' disease is not spread
from person to person. The legionella bacteria occur naturally in the
environment, mainly in water and soil. They are normally in very low
concentrations but can increase markedly, particularly in man-made
aquatic environments with warm recirculating water, such as air
conditioning cooling towers. Legionnaires' Disease is acquired
through breathing in very fine droplets of water that contain the
bacteria, such as spray drifts which are vented from cooling towers.
Whirlpool spas and warm water systems can also lead to the illness.

Further advice for travellers is available on the Smart Traveller
website. Media contact: Kay McNiece, 0412 132 585

[Apparently 9 of the 10 confirmed cases in Australians who were
linked to the same hotel while vacationing in Bali stayed at the
Ramayana Resort and Spa and most also had visited the same local
shopping center, both located in the central area of Kuta, Bali. For
a discussion of legionellosis see the prior ProMED-mail post
Legionellosis - Australia: (WA, VI) ex Indonesia (Bali) 20110115.0173.

Kuta is a coastal town in southern Bali, Indonesia, with a long broad
Indian Ocean beachfront and is one of Indonesia's major tourist
destinations (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuta>). Kuta was the site
of 2 Bali bombings, one in 2002 and another in 2005. A map of the
island of Bali can be accessed at

Kuta on the island of Bali and the Australian states of Western
Australia and Victoria can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive maps at <http://healthmap.org/r/03Jc> and
