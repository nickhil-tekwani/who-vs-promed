The Ministry of Health draws attention to the risk of introduction into the national territory of the lumpy skin disease virus (lumpy skin disease) and has intensified the measures of prevention and surveillance.

Lumpy skin disease [LSD] is a viral disease that affects cattle, not transmissible to humans. In animals it causes fever, salivation, lacrimation, nasal discharge and typical skin lesions of nodular form from which it derives its name. In the affected farms, LSD is responsible for serious economic losses, resulting from the decrease in milk production, abortions and fertility disorders. Transmission between animals occurs through arthropod vectors, such as flies, mosquitoes and ticks, but direct infection or indirect by contaminated instruments is not excluded.

LSD is an exotic disease, subject to mandatory reporting.

The presence of the disease to date has been confirmed in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Serbia, Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro.

Italy is still unscathed, but the rapid spread of the disease in several countries of the Middle East and Eastern Europe has led to the blocking of the movement of animals from infected areas, and calls for an intensification of surveillance activities.

The Ministry of Health and the Customs Agency are working closely together to strengthen the border control activities on vehicles engaged in international transport of live animals, with a focus on procedures for cleaning, disinfecting and disinsectization.

[It may be assumed that similar preventive steps are being undertaken by other southern European countries.

Since its re-emergence in northern Greece in early April 2016, LSD has been spreading north and westward, with incursion in 5 countries. Despite the mitigation effect of the emergency vaccination campaign ongoing in the affected countries, uncontrolled animal movements and current weather conditions suitable for vector populations may be increasing the risk of spread. This is also apparent from a recent follow-up report from Serbia, submitted Thu 28 Jul 2016, notifying 27 new outbreaks, 7 of which were in the west, adjacent to the border with Montenegro. This follow-up report no. 7, with details on each of the new outbreaks and an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20597.

Italy experienced, in 1993, economic losses exceeding 100 million Euro, when another highly infectious disease, namely FMD [foot-and-mouth disease], was introduced by cattle imported in 2 consignments, by land and by sea, accompanied by Croatian veterinary certificates (the Croatian authorities later claimed these certificates were forged). The virus was identified as a Middle Eastern strain of FMDV O1. The losses were mainly due to the imposed export restrictions. - Mod.AS
