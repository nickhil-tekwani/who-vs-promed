An outbreak of typhoid fever has been reported in Delmas, Mpumalanga.
Increases in diarrheal disease cases were noted on routine surveillance
from 15 Aug 2005. This prompted an investigation by the Provincial
Communicable Disease Directorate. Preliminary water testing revealed
evidence of fecal contamination of drinking water. Within 2-3 weeks of this
outbreak of diarrheal disease, cases began presenting with typical features
of typhoid fever. To date, at least 15 cases of typhoid fever have been
laboratory-confirmed on blood culture and 34 suspected cases have been
identified.
Health care workers should be alert to the possibility of typhoid fever in
both residents of Delmas and returning travelers from the area and amongst
contacts of cases. Many of the cases to date have been diagnosed in Gauteng
in patients who are attending school in Delmas or travelled to the area.

The number of confirmed typhoid cases in Delmas has risen to 116, with more
than 700 others suffering from diarrhea.
The typhoid-stricken town of Delmas in Mpumalanga will now be linked to the
water reticulation of the Rand Water network. This decision was finalized
at the 9 Sep 2005 meeting by stakeholders, who included the provincial
government and medical experts.
At first, people showed symptoms of diarrhea or fever. Early cases were at
an informal settlement on the outskirts of Delmas but it has since spread
across the town. Tap water is believed to be contaminated by human feces.
Tests show that an underground lake is infected with _E. coli_. The lake
feeds reservoirs in the area.
Residents have been asked to boil or purify water before using it. With
more patients being admitted to hospitals, extra doctors and nurses have
been deployed and the army has been asked to supply tents and set up field
hospitals
