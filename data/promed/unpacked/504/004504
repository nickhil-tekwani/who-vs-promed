Chikungunya outbreak continues to spread
----------------------------------------
The chikungunya outbreak continues its progress not only in Tahiti but also in Moorea, Raiatea, Bora Bora, and some atolls of Tuamotu atolls. Due to a low rate of return of surveillance data on suspected and confirmed chikungunya cases, the Institute for Public Health Surveillance cannot provide definite figures concerning these new cases, or estimate the total number of cases in the territory.

However, in order to continue the epidemiological monitoring and allow the targeting of actions that should be implemented, the syndromic surveillance (weekly report of suspicious cases) is the method which must replace the monitoring of biologically confirmed cases. Therefore, all health care professionals are invited to report suspicious cases seen in the week, using the forms from the syndromic surveillance network.

The number of hospitalizations of people diagnosed with confirmed chikungunya is increasing. Since the beginning of the outbreak until the end of week 44, 63 people from both sexes and all ages were hospitalized, mainly in the hospital e ta Taravao (but also Cardella and Uturoa). Hospitalizations are short-term, and are mainly driven by significant pain or the presence of underlying medical conditions, or extreme ages (infants or elderly).

Since the appearance of the virus in Polynesia, on 10 Oct [2014], the number of cases has exploded. According to the head of the office of health monitoring, there are "at least 4000-5000 cases of chikungunya". And the peak of the epidemic has not yet been reached.

"At least 4000-5000 chikungunya cases were diagnosed in French Polynesia," according to Dr Henri-Pierre Mallet, head of the Office for Public Health Surveillance in the community. "We're probably not even at the peak of the epidemic, based on the experience of the West Indies," added the specialist.

All these cases are not proven: the Department of Health no longer recommends local blood tests because doctors now know how to properly diagnose the disease. Transmitted by mosquitoes, chikungunya has hit Polynesia for just over a month. The 1st cases were reported by health authorities on 10 Oct [2014].

Hospital emergency departments are experiencing high traffic. In the main one, the hospital of Taaone, "we get 70-80 per cent more patients for 6 days," an emergency physician who wishes to remain anonymous told AFP. This hospital has created a short chain for consulting to treat chikungunya that is apart from the true emergencies. For patients with the virus, most do not, for the most part, require an emergency consultation. Even with lack of staff, the short [chikungunya] chain can be open continuously. "This swamped emergency facilities because there are many people who cannot pay a visit to the GP [and go to the emergency unit instead]," the same doctor stated.

Chikungunya currently causes fewer complications than the Zika [virus] epidemic did that struck Polynesia a year earlier [2013].

[The chikungunya virus outbreak in French Polynesia is increasing rapidly, and placing stress on medical services. The virus has spread to several islands in French Polynesia. In the absence of a commercially available vaccine, vector control is the only preventive measure available.
