Murray Valley Encephalitis Warning
----------------------------------
Queensland Health is warning residents to take precautions against Murray
Valley encephalitis after sentinel chickens in the Northern Territory
tested positive [for Murray Valley encephalitis virus.
A spokesman from the Tropical Public Health Unit says it is an indication
that Murray Valley encephalitis virus is moving across from Western
Australia along with migratory water birds, and he says people should take
precautions to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes [which may be carrying
the virus.
