---------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
- this is the 1st serological investigation of hantavirus in Mozambique;
- Mozambicans are exposed to hantavirus[es];
- hantavirus [infection] cases presented significantly higher levels of creatinine and alanine aminotransferase;
- clinicians are unaware of hantavirus[es] and the virus occurs unsuspected;
- most cases of hantavirus infections are misdiagnosed as malaria.

Abstract
Objective
The occurrence of hantavirus[es] in Sub-Saharan Africa is poorly studied and its clinical implications are unknown. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of hantavirus infections among febrile patients attending an outpatient clinic at a primary health care center located in a suburban area of the city of Maputo in Mozambique.

Methods
Paired acute and convalescent samples from a total of 200 febrile patients aged older than 5 years who were recruited between February 2012 and October 2014 were screened for IgM and IgG antibodies against hantavirus[es] using an ELISA. Acute samples were also screened for malaria and to determine hematological and clinical chemistry parameters.

Results
Of the 200 patients enrolled, 4 had IgM antibodies in their acute sample and IgG antibodies in their convalescent sample, yielding a prevalence rate of 2 per cent.

Contact with rodents was higher among IgM-positive participants than IgM-negative participants (50.0 per cent (2/4) vs. 15.3 per cent (30/196)). IgM-positive patients presented significantly higher levels of creatinine and alanine aminotransferase and lower platelet counts than IgM-negative patients.

Conclusions
The findings of this study demonstrate human exposure to hantavirus[es] in Mozambique for the 1st time; however, further studies should be conducted to investigate its clinical implications.

[It would be of interest to know which hantavirus or hantaviruses elicited the antibody responses reported above. One hopes that follow up studies will clarify that. Several hantaviruses have been identified in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. Not all of these hantaviruses have been found in rodents. Sangassou virus was detected in the African wood mouse (_Hylomyscus simus_) but Tanganya virus (TGNV) in the Therese's shrew (_Crocidura theresae_), captured in Guinea. Recently, Azagny virus (AZGV) and Bowé virus (BOWV), have been found in the West African pygmy shrew (_Crocidura obscurior_) in Côte d'Ivoire and in the Doucet's musk shrew (_Crocidura douceti_) in Guinea. Of these viruses, Sangassou virus was responsible for febrile disease in humans. Human infection with other of these viruses has not been determined. - Mod.TY
