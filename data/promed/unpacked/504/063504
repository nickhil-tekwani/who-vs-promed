Connecticut anthrax tests negative
----------------------------------
OXFORD, Connecticut (CNN): The mystery of how a 94 year old Connecticut
woman died of inhalation anthrax came no closer to being solved when
results of preliminary tests for the presence of bacteria in her mail,
mailbox, and local post office came back negative. Sources told CNN that 2
weeks of mail found in the woman's home contained no anthrax spores,
although it is possible that the bacteria might have been on mail that she
had already thrown out.
Lisa Bull, spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation field office
in New Haven, Connecticut, said investigators were "looking into every
possible source of contamination" in the search for clues to the bioterror
mystery. Friends and relatives said she seldom left home, except to visit
the library, a beauty parlor, doctors' offices, and her church. The retired
legal secretary lived alone. In Connecticut, law enforcement and health
officials are speaking to the deceased woman's friends to determine what
she did, where she went, and who she saw before 16 Nov, when she was
admitted to hospital with flu-like symptoms.
Besides sifting through the Connecticut woman's trash and examining her
mail, investigators took environmental samples from the few places she had
visited over the past few weeks in this rural New England town of 9800. On
Thursday, investigators in protective clothing conducted an "inch-by-inch"
search of the woman's home.
Although authorities have not announced the finding of any suspicious
letter or package, they suspect that the mail may once again be the source
of contamination. Mail to the deceased's home would have come through the
Wallingford facility -- called the Connecticut Processing and Distribution
Center -- and then to a post office in Seymour, said Jim Cari, a spokesman
for the United States Postal Service in Connecticut.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta) confirmed on
Wednesday evening that the anthrax strain that infected the Connecticut
woman is indistinguishable from the strain detected in all the other
[recent cases of infection in the United States. A CDC spokeswoman also
said this strain responds to all antibiotics used against it.

[In that she died of the same strain associated with the letters, it
suggests that the separate events must be linked in some way. - Mod.MHJ
