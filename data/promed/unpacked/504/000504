BSE Inquiry: Draft Factual Accounts (DFAs)
------------------------------------------------------
The BSE Inquiry Web site at http://www.bse.org.uk/ now carries the
first three of what will be a series of Draft Factual Accounts, which
can be accessed and downloaded. Those already there relate to the
Southwood Committee (111 pages), the Tyrell Committee (52 pages) and
SEAC (66 pages). A list is given of twenty other topics of DFAs still
to come.
The following explanation is given there:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Draft Factual Accounts
The BSE Inquiry is publishing a number of draft factual accounts for
consultation. The accounts will cover the work of the main scientific
advisory committees, key events such as the ruminant feed ban and the
specified bovine offal ban, slaughter and compensation policy, CJD
surveillance and care, risk assessment, bovine by-products, statistics,
scientific research and several other areas.
The documents are designed to be full accounts of the factual evidence
on certain topics which the Inquiry has gathered in the last twelve
months and to help the Inquiry in the rest of its work. They are not
intended to deal with every aspect of the evidence and they will not
include judgements or conclusions.
The summaries are not intended to cover all the areas of the evidence,
to make any judgements about the implications of the facts or to point
to any conclusions. These will be for the Committee"s report to
Ministers on 30 June 1999. The Draft Factual Accounts (DFAs) are
intended to help the Committee of Inquiry in their further work.
You are invited to point out any errors or material omissions. If you
have any comments which do not involve amendments to the factual
account please put them in a separate document.
Comments on this Draft Factual Account should be sent to:
The Secretary
The BSE Inquiry
6th Floor
Hercules House
Hercules Road
London SE1 7DU
E mail to : inquiry@bse.org.uk
Comments should reach the Secretariat by 21 Jan [1999 for them to be
most useful to the Inquiry.

EU SSC paper on BSE risk of countries or regions
------------------------------------------------------------
As if we do not have enough new reading matter, what with three lengthy
BSE Inquiry Draft Factual Accounts (DFAs) and two recently-posted
lengthy EU documents, here comes another, a real marathon of reading
from the EU Scientific Steering Committee.
"Preliminary-opinion of the SSC on a method to assess the geographical
BSE-Risk of Countries or Regions (adopted on 10 December 1998, open for
comments until 15 January 1999)."
It is downloadable (as Acrobat .pdf files, of course!) from
http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/ssc/out35_en.html
Yes, I did say files, plural. It comes in three separate files, 51 pages
plus 24 pages plus 23 pages.
