The background statement in this posting has an error that was transferred from the original source, the journal "Emerging Infectious Diseases" (Wang J, et al. 2014), namely: "During an investigation of the outbreak, a previously unknown bunyavirus from the tick _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ was identified as the causative agent of SFTS (4)." (Yu et al. 2011).

Please note that _Anaplasma_ is a genus used for a group of rickettsiales bacteria; the tick species involved (mentioned in Yu et al. 2011) was _Haemaphysalis longicornis_.

[ProMED-mail thanks Joel Hutcheson for pointing out the error in the EID article cited in the post above. Two other alert readers, Dr Charles Calisher and Jerome Bouquet also reported the error. Interestingly, this error apparently has been corrected in the EID paper, published ahead of print, and now the corrected _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ appears in the paper http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/6/14-0003_article.htm. - Mod.TY
