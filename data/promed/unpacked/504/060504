Abstract
Rabies and anthrax, being natural focal diseases, are characterized by the ability to persist in areas with a certain combination of environmental factors without human intervention. These infections annually cause sporadic outbreaks in domestic [animals], livestock, and wild animals in the Republic of Kazakhstan (RK), receiving close attention of the veterinary service. In particular, targeted mass vaccination and surveillance are conducted, which requires zoning of the country according to the exposure to the diseases.

This paper presents a zoning approach based on the estimation of suitability to the study diseases using the Environmental Niche Modelling method. Retrospective data on animal rabies outbreaks in the RK for 2003-2014 as well as data on anthrax burial sites for 1933-2014 were used. The following environmental factors were treated as potential explanatory variables: 1) a set of climate data-derived variables BIOCLIM; 2) altitude above the sea level; 3) land cover type; 4) the maximum green vegetation fraction; and 5) soil type.

The modeling outcomes for both diseases indicate elevated risks along the northern and southeastern borders of the RK that not only follows the distribution of historic disease cases, but also accounts for potentially suitable environmental conditions. To comply with the requirements of the veterinary service, gridded risk maps were converted into categorical maps by averaging risk values within municipal districts and ranking according to 4 categories: low, medium, high, and very high.

The maps obtained may be used as recommendations to the veterinary service as a basis for developing region-specific anti-epizootic measures.

[This is an outstanding paper defining the ecological distribution of rabies virus and _Bacillus anthracis_ in Kazakhstan, and it's an easy read. And I should point out that it reflects the hard work that Jason Blackburn, UFL, one of my grad students, has done off and on over some 15 years in that country training their people in niche modeling. When one has such reliable maps, it allows you to concentrate your control and surveillance activities in those areas, thereby significantly increasing the cost effectiveness of the program, and achieves success, eradication, at an earlier date.

There are 3 relevant publications worth reading in regard to such mapping:
(1) Aikembayev AM, Lukhnova L, Temiraliyeva G, et al. Historical Distribution and Molecular Diversity of _Bacillus anthracis_ in Kazakhstan. Emerg Infect Dis. 2010; 16(5): 789-96. Available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953997/.
(2) Kracalik IT, Blackburn JK, Lukhnova L, Pazilov Y, Hugh-Jones ME, Aikimbayev A. Analysing the spatial patterns of livestock anthrax in Kazakhstan in relation to environmental factors: a comparison of local (Gi*) and morphology cluster statistics.

Which gave rise to a valuable insight of the functions of the typing genes:
