More people were infected and died of West Nile virus [infections] across California this year [2017] than last year [2016], especially in Los Angeles county. That's where the number of infections peaked in September, recent data show.

Statewide, there have been 25 deaths so far this year [2017], or 6 more than all of last year, according to recent data from the California Department of Public Health. In addition, 454 people from across the Golden State were infected this year, a 17 per cent increase from 2016.

Though the end of the season is approaching, more reports of infections and deaths are likely, public health officials said.

In Southern California, Los Angeles County seemed to bear the brunt of both infections and deaths. So far, 235 people have been infected by the disease and 17 people have died, including one person in Long Beach. The numbers surpass last year's 153 cases and 6 deaths, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.

Concerned about the rising spread of the disease, Los Angeles county supervisor Janice Hahn and officials with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health launched a campaign in September. Teams ventured out to distribute educational packets to more than 20 000 schools, houses of worship and community centers across the region. The goal was to encourage residents to wear insect repellent outdoors and to empty outdoor containers of any size that hold standing water, where mosquitoes tend to breed.

"The number of human cases with onset of illness through September [2017] is higher than the previous 5-year average," Los Angeles health officials stated in the agency's latest report.

Other southern California counties also saw increases so far this year compared to 2016:
- Orange county has reported 34 people who have been infection this year compared to 32 last year; 3 people have died.
- in Riverside county, 24 people have been infected so far this year, compared to 11 last year but no deaths have been reported to the state.
- San Bernardino county reported that 41 residents have become ill so far this year, compared to 8 last year; 2 people have died.

It's unclear why there has been so much infection, but there could be several contributing factors said Dr Vicki Kramer, chief of vectorborne diseases for the state Department of Public Health. "The level of West Nile virus fluctuates from year to year, region to region, because there's so many factors, such as climatic features," Kramer said. Los Angeles county saw warmer fall temperatures this year. Also, there was more rain across the state.

Known as a disease of wild birds, West Nile virus is spread to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. Infection occurs between mosquitoes and birds. In rare cases, a person can be become ill through a blood transfusion. Kramer said there are some years when the bird population is lower, or in some cases, more resistant to the virus. The virus doesn't always spread during rainier seasons, she noted.

In 2014, a drought year, there were 801 people infected with West Nile virus and 31 deaths. The following year also saw drought. [Fewer] Californians were infected, but 53 people died. Kramer said that shows that the disease may flourish when there less water resources can stagnate. Mosquitoes and birds then compete for those resources, passing on the disease.

Most people infected with West Nile virus do not become seriously ill, but some experience flu-like symptoms. About 1 per cent of them can develop serious neurological illness. People who are 50 and older or who have pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure have the greatest risk of developing complications such as meningitis and encephalitis, health officials say.

Though West Nile virus has been in California for more than a decade, Kramer said the disease and the mosquitoes that carry it, continue to be a great risk to state residents.

[A previous post (West Nile virus - Americas (18): USA (CA) 20171030.5412499) of a report of 27 Oct 2017 described 230 cases, including 17 deaths. This was the 3rd highest number of cases of West Nile virus [WNV] infection in Los Angeles county, with continued risk of infection because the transmission season was ongoing. Now, the number of cases has increased to 235 but the number of deaths (17) has remained unchanged. Interestingly, a 29 Sep 2017 report indicated that WNV transmission was active in Los Angeles country because sentinel chickens had become infected (see West Nile virus - Americas (13): USA (CA) 20170930.5351220). That report indicated that local public health officials had launched an all-out effort to involve the public in control efforts and risk reduction. Teams of vector control agents were being sent door to door to tell residents to wear mosquito repellant, install window screens, and dump the stagnant water where the insects breed. They have been plastering the county with posters that read "It's Not Just a Bite" and "No Es Solo Un Piquete" [in Spanish]. They even created a rap video featuring a fetid swimming pool, a giant dancing mosquito, and teams of uniformed agents rapping, "You've got to dump the water out, drain the water flow, tip the water out, toss the water slow." Given the large number of cases in recent days, these efforts are urgent until cooler weather ends the transmission season.
