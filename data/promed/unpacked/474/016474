Influenza activity continues to rise across Europe -- Week 5/2013
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Clinical activity rates continue to increase in most countries in the WHO European Region, with predominance of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and type B viruses. The proportion of samples from sentinel and non-sentinel sources testing positive for influenza reached its highest level so far this season. In line with the increasing activity in outpatient surveillance, the proportion of hospitalized cases of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) that were positive for influenza continued to increase, and was mainly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

The EuroFlu bulletin describes and comments on influenza activity in the 53 member states in the WHO European Region to provide information to public health specialists, clinicians, and the public on the timing of the influenza season, the spread of influenza, the prevalence and characteristics of circulating viruses (type, subtype and lineage), and severity.

Virological surveillance for influenza
--------------------------------------
The overall number of specimens testing positive for influenza in the Region and the influenza positivity rate continued to rise slowly. A total of 6542 specimens tested positive for influenza in week 05/2013, with 4627 (71 per cent) being influenza A. This distribution is similar to the previous 2 weeks. In week 05/2013, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remained dominant: of 2976 influenza A viruses subtyped, 2314 (78 per cent) were A(H1N1)pdm09 while only 662 (22 per cent) were A(H3N2).

Since the beginning of the season (week 40/2012), 30 119 influenza viruses from sentinel and non-sentinel sources have been typed. A fairly even distribution of influenza virus types has been observed consistently since week 47/2012: 21 097 (70 per cent) were influenza A and 9022 (30 per cent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 13 107 were subtyped: 9355 (71 per cent) as A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3752 (29 per cent) as A(H3N2). In addition, the lineage for 1260 influenza B viruses has been determined since week 40/2012: 1129 (90 per cent) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 131 (10 per cent) to B/Victoria.

Circulation of influenza viruses in week 05/2013 remained diverse, and similar to the previous 2 weeks, across the Region. Influenza A, mainly A(H1N1)pdm09, was reported as the dominant virus in countries in northern, eastern and central Europe, and Turkey, while influenza B was reported as the dominant virus in some countries in the southern and western parts of the Region, as well as the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland). Between these areas, co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B was reported.

Virus strain characterizations
------------------------------
For the 2012/2013 northern hemisphere influenza season, WHO recommends inclusion of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like, A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (from the B/Yamagata lineage) viruses in vaccines (see more at the WHO website).

Since week 40/2012, 1269 influenza viruses characterized antigenically by 11 countries (Denmark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (England and Scotland)) corresponded with the viruses recommended by WHO for inclusion in the current northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine. The United Kingdom characterized the most viruses -- 862 (68 per cent) -- with 485 (71 per cent) of the 682 influenza (H3N2) viruses being characterized by Scotland as A(H3) A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like. 12 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland) have characterized 382 influenza viruses genetically.

Both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses have evolved to fall into a number of different genetic groups, which are all antigenically similar to their vaccine viruses, A/California/7/2009 and A/Victoria/361/2011, respectively. Influenza B viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 and the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineages are co-circulating with dominance of the B/Yamagata lineage viruses this season (90 per cent). Influenza B viruses of the B/Victoria lineage all fall within the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade and are antigenically indistinguishable. B/Yamagata lineage viruses fall into 2 distinct genetic clades, represented by B/Estonia/55669/2011 (Clade 2) and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 (Clade 3) respectively. Viruses in these clades can be distinguished antigenically from each other, but remain antigenically similar to the current vaccine virus, B/Wisconsin/1/2010.

Monitoring of susceptibility to antiviral drugs
-----------------------------------------------
Since week 40/2012, 8 countries (Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) have screened 278 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The 96 influenza A(H3N2) and 74 influenza B viruses showed susceptibility to both drugs. Of the 108 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested, 107 showed susceptibility to both drugs and 1 virus carrying the neuraminidase H275Y amino acid substitution, causing resistance to oseltamivir, was detected in the Netherlands in a hospitalized immunocompromised patient exposed to oseltamivir through treatment.

The 14 influenza A(H3N2) and 10 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Outpatient surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI)
--------------------------------------------------------
ILI and ARI consultation rates continued to increase in most of the Region, with most countries reporting medium intensity levels although some north western countries (such as Norway, Poland, and the United Kingdom) seem to have experienced peaks in clinical activity earlier in the season. Most of the countries across the Region reported regional or widespread circulation of influenza for week 05/2013. Of the 20 countries that have established epidemic thresholds, only 2 (Kazakhstan and Ukraine) reported ILI/ARI consultation rates remaining below their national threshold levels.

Hospital surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of hospitalizations, as well as the proportion of respiratory specimens from patients with SARI testing positive for influenza, has continued to increase since week 01/2013 (Fig. 7), in line with increasing influenza activity in countries reporting on SARI hospitalizations. Overall, the majority of countries reported cases mainly in the group aged 0-4 years.

For week 05/2013, 11 countries (Armenia, Belarus, Belgium, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine) reported 87 influenza detections among 282 specimens tested, 78 per cent of which (68) were influenza A (Fig. 8a). Since week 40/2012, 2898 SARI specimens have been collected and tested for influenza with the relative distribution of influenza types and subtypes in hospitalized SARI patients similar to that observed from other sentinel data sources.

Among the countries reporting on hospitalization of severe influenza cases to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 71 cases were reported for week 05/2013. To date, A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and influenza B have been detected among hospitalized patients.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
---------------------------------
Based on the data presented by countries reporting on RSV, the positivity rate peaked in week 52/2012, after which the number of detections has gradually decreased.

[By contrast in North America the predominant virus in the current season has been influenza A(H3N2) (characterized as A/Victoria/361/2011-like), followed by influenza B (Yamagata and Victoria lineages) and to a lesser extent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) (A/California/7/2009-like). 3 of these 4 strains are included in the 2012-2013 influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere. With regards to antiviral resistance, of the subset of influenza cases analyzed this season, the majority (99.9 per cent) are susceptible to oseltamivir and all are susceptible to zanamivir. The annual RSV outbreak appears to have passed and no longer biases the number of childhood ARI cases.

The majority of characterized viruses from the WHO European Region remain similar to the current Northern hemisphere vaccine viruses. Interested readers should consult the original document via the source URL to view the many of charts and illustrations accompanying this text.
