5th round table on FMD surveillance and control in the Middle East,
7-8 Apr 2009, Beirut, Lebanon. Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[The meeting was attended by representatives of the following
countries: Bahrain, Cyprus, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, KSA, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, United Arab
Emirates, and Yemen. In addition, there were participants from
regional and international organisations and international experts.
The following excepts have been selected in relation to significant
recent regional epidemiological developments. - Mod.AS]

Session 2.2: Circulating strains
--------------------------------
Dr Antonello Di Nardo (OIE-FAO WRLFMD [World Reference
Laboratory for FMD], Pirbright UK) presented the FMD situation for
the Middle East (as determined from samples submitted to WRLFMD) and
the different topotypes observed in the region, detailing sequencing
of each batch received at the WRLFMD and underlining the possible
threat for neighbouring regions, particularly Europe:

1. The A Iran 05 topotype, belonging to the Asia topotype, is the
predominant serotype A lineage circulating in Middle East. It has 2
different paths of evolution (S and NS genome regions): the A22
sub-lineage as starting point and A/IRN/105, A-Iran-96, A-Iran-99 as
evolutionary intermediates. In Turkey, in 2007, the new sub-lineages
A-Iran-05ARD-07 and A-Iran-05EZM-07 were observed and were
predominant in this country.

This strain is now presented in most of the Middle Eastern countries
and has reached since the beginning of 2009 Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon,
and Libya [and, as discovered later, also Israel and the Palestinian
Autonomy/West Bank; see commentary below. - Mod.AS] The new epidemic
sub-lineage reported in the above countries and circulating recently
in West Eurasia has been named as A-Iran-05BAR-08.

2. The A Egypt 06 has more than 90 percent identity with A/KEN/98,
A/ETH/92 and A/KEN/05, and all topotypes are closely related (maximum
about 5 percent difference). Its introduction in Egypt from East
Africa was probably made through the trade in live cattle from
Ethiopia (via sea-route). The A Egypt 09 identified recently in Egypt
is closely related to A/EGY/06 (95.5 percent identity). This confirms
the persistence of African type A virus in Egypt, spread in 2006 and
evolved until 2009.

3. The O PanAsia II, belonging to the ME-SA topotype, was first
recorded in 2003 in India and is now widely spread in all the Middle
East. All viruses are closely related to each other (maximum about 5
percent difference) and distinct from the earlier PanAsia lineage.
Over the period 2008-09, it has been reported in Turkey, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Bahrain, and Pakistan.

Dr Di Nardo also presented the vaccine recommendations of the WRL for
the Middle-East underlining that each country should undertake a risk
assessment to consider risk of other types and subtypes including
Type Asia-1 and SAT [Southern African Territories] viruses.
Furthermore, it has been stressed that serological matching of
serotype A vaccine strains and some A-Iran-05 field isolates is
currently poor, however studies have shown that vaccines with weak
antigenic match to field isolates, as determined by serology, can
nevertheless afford protection if they are of sufficiently high
potency (PD50 higher than 7).

For the circulating strains [the following recommendations are made;
also see commentary]:
- Risk: A Iran 05 genotype (as circulating in 2009)
- Routine vaccination: A Iran O5 or homologue (A TUR 06)
- Alternatives: or high potency (greater than 7 and recommended to be
24 PD50 or higher) -- A 22 Iraq, or A Iran 99, or A Iran 96.

A large discussion followed the presentation of the recommended
vaccines for the region, notably on the fact that now high potency
vaccines are recommended to protect susceptible animals against the A
Iran 05 strains. There was a consensus on the fact that such vaccines
are not the panacea, but considering the lack of routine vaccine
available on the market, and therefore in the absence of a good match
or where the match is unknown, they are actually the best option.
Relevant routine vaccines matching the field strains are currently
under development [see commentary].

[From the information above, dated early April 2009, it is apparent
that FMDV A Iran 05 (currently named A-Iran-05BAR-08) is widely
distributed in the Middle East while previously applied vaccines
provide poor protection against it. Since April 2009, the virus has
been identified also in Israel and in the Palestinian territory (West Bank).

Dr Di-Nardo's presentation on the regional situations, with maps and
sequencing data, is available at
<http://www.rr-middleeast.oie.int/download/pdf/Nardo.pdf>.

Middle East situation: Summary of Answers to the Questionnaire",

the Middle East, at

Updated recommendations on the vaccine strains to be applied against
the current FMDV-A strains in the Middle East are to be included in
the 2nd quarterly report for 2009 of the WRLFMD, expected to be
published shortly. As we have noted, the recommendation is to use
specific vaccines against A Iran-05 of strains currently circulating
in the region. Such vaccines seem to be already available in the market.

Subscribers may also note that, during 2009, another FMDV serotype
has been recorded in the region, namely FMDV Asia1 in Bahrain.
Samples were received in Pirbright on 1 May 2009; the sequencing
results of the strains BAR/8/2009 and BAR/9/2009, including a
dendrogram, are available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009/WRLFMD-2009-00021-Bahrain-Asia1.pdf>.
Hopefully, the due 2nd quarterly report of WRLFMD will cover this
issue as well, including recommendations for appropriate vaccine
strains. - Mod.AS]
