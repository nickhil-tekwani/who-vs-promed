Tick with rabbit fever found in East County
--------------------------------------------
A tick infected with a potentially fatal disease called tularemia was found
in the East County, according to the county Department of Environmental
Health.
The tick was found on a dog just south of Mount Helix County Park, said
Patricia Cawthon, the county's acting chief of community health. It's the
first discovery on a canine in at least 20 years.
Tularemia, commonly known as rabbit fever, is primarily transmitted by
ticks and biting flies, Cawthon said. The disease causes sudden fever, an
ulcer at the site of a bite, and swollen, painful lymph nodes. Antibiotics
can be used to treat the disease easily, "but it has to be diagnosed,"
Cawthon said. It cannot be transmitted between humans, Cawthon said.
Signs have been posted in the area where the tick was found to warn
residents about the danger of contracting the disease from insects.
Tularemia was found in 2 wild rabbits near Encinitas in May 2003, Cawthon
said. Tularemia infections are a "fairly common occurrence in the mountains
and the Midwest" but rare here, Cawthon said.

[The term tularemia was derived from its description in Tulare County,
California, although the disease seems to be more endemic in the midwestern
USA as well as Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts.
Although no human cases have been reported, the recognition of infection in
a tick and in several feral rabbits in the area requires the need for
increased knowledge about the presence of _Francisella tularensis_ in
southern California; hence, this alert. - Mod.LL]
