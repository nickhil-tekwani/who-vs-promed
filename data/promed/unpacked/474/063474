Although the government considers leprosy to be almost eradicated as its prevalence rate has reached less than one for the past few years, the district leprosy office fears that stopping the active search of leprosy patients is increasing leprosy cases in the district.

According to district leprosy officer (DLO) Rahul Singh, as many as 35 fresh cases of leprosy were detected from the district in June [2013]. In normal trends, some 15 to 25 cases are detected every month. The 3 indicators of leprosy that are multibacillary [MB], MB percentage, disability and child leprosy cases have also increased over time.

"More than 50 percent of all leprosy cases in Varanasi are MB cases, while ideally its figure should be less than 40 percent. The disability in new leprosy patients is around 9 percent in the city in place of 3 percent. The new cases with deformity or disability is also increasing, the pressure on the leper colonies as most of these patients are ostracized. Government has no scheme or planning to rehabilitate such people. The leper colonies are mostly looked after by non-profit organisations. Alarmingly, 15 percent of cases are of children while the children leprosy cases should not be more than 7 percent of the total cases," Singh said.

According to records, as many as 35 new cases were detected out of which 18 were paucibacillary (PB) while 17 cases were MB; 6 of these patients were found with deformity, while 5 out of 35 were children.

"The active search for leprosy patients had been stopped since 2005 when the prevalence rate reached less than one. However the indicators that determine the prevalence rate are increasing in the region. In active search, our staff reaches out to patients. They make efforts [to ensure] that healthy people coming in contact with leprosy patient are not infected. But since the government has stopped active detection, it is the patients who are approaching us. However, the alarming figures point to the fact that there is need of active detection again," he said.

[Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by a bacillus, _Mycobacterium leprae_ (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/). _M. leprae_ multiplies very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years, but symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. Although leprosy is not highly contagious, because patients with the lepromatous form of leprosy excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions (that is, are multibacillary), a patient with untreated lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for transmission of the infection to close, long-term contacts, such as household members. As the organism is also present in skin lesions in these patients, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Because the organisms that are shed by lepromatous patients can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to pose a risk for spread the disease.

In the absence of a significant insect vector or non-human reservoir, antimicrobial therapy of the infectious human reservoir is an effective strategy to control transmission. Leprosy is treated with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine. These drugs are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml. Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.

India, Brazil, and Indonesia are the 3 countries that have the greatest number of leprosy cases. The WHO South East Asia Region (SEAR) that includes India contributed about 69 per cent of 2005 new cases detected globally (http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/southasia/message/5378). SEAR achieved what WHO refers to as "the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem" (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in December 2005 (http://209.61.208.233/en/Section10/Section20_16172.htm). With a population of about 1.1 billion people, there were 83,000 patients registered with leprosy in India in 2011 (http://209.61.208.233/en/Section10/Section20_16172.htm). Between 1985 and 2005, more than 15 million leprosy cases were cured globally. Of these, about 12.8 million were from the SEA Region, of which India accounted for about 11.8 million (http://apps.searo.who.int/pds_docs/B0343.pdf).

The "new" cases of leprosy with deformity or disability in the news report above are likely cases that were missed in prior efforts at case finding in Varanasi. The high proportion of cases with lepromatous leprosy is an indication of the number of contagious cases in the community and leprosy among children is an indication of ongoing disease transmission.

Varanasi, also known as Benares, is a city in northeastern India with a population (2012) of about 3.7 million on the banks of the Ganges in Uttar Pradesh state, 320 km (200 miles) southeast of the state capital, Lucknow and 797 km (495 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
