The Minister of Agriculture [for The Netherlands, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst
has ordered (yesterday evening) 3 new measures to prevent risk of spreading
FMD:
1) forbidden to transport even-hoofed animals TO or FROM France or Italy,
even when they do not originate in these countries.
2) forbidden to transport horses TO or FROM the United Kingdom, even when
they do not originate in UK.
3) Director of State Institute of Inspection of Meat and Animals (RVV), may
forbid transport of even-hoofed animals TO or FROM any other member state

Letter from the Dutch Union of Pig Producers to the President of the
European Parliament
Mrs N Fontaine, President
European Parliament
Dear Mrs Fontaine,
In 1992 the European Union, then consisting of 12 countries, in majority
accepted the decision to stop vaccination against foot and mouth disease
(FMD). Before 1992 all cattle were preventively vaccinated and all pigs
[were vaccinated at the beginning of an outbreak.
In those days one of the reasons for this non-vaccination policy was the
demand by Japan for meat free of viral antigen of FMD or CSF ([classical
swine fever). As Japan was considered an important and growing trade market
and FMD disease antigens are not distinguishable from the vaccine antigen,
the EU decided on this policy. It was expected that such a preventive
approach could control the outbreak.
Last year's FMD outbreak in Greece, the present outbreaks all over England,
and the threatening outbreaks in the other EU countries prompt me to ask
you to reconsider the present EU-non-vaccination policy.
Experts are saying there is an economic basis for this non-vaccination
policy. This may be correct. However, these calculations were made before
1990, when we supposed an FMD-outbreak would occur only sporadically and
the costs of vaccination would be substantially higher than the costs of an
outbreak. Now, 10 years later, the situation has radically changed:
1) As a result of the higher standard of living, rural as well as non-rural
traffic has increased dramatically in all EU- countries.
2) With the enlargement of the European Union even more cattle traffic
occurs, while animal health care in some new member countries remains of
poorer quality.
3) As shown by the outbreaks in England, being surrounded by water does not
protect an area from viral outbreaks. Overall traffic by air and sea has
increased so much, there is no longer any such thing as isolation.
I wonder if the European Union has calculated the costs to farmers and
governments as preventive measures to minimize the opportunities of infection.
In my opinion animals do not have any protection against FMD or CSF not
being vaccinated for so long. Most of the livestock has not been vaccinated
at all. When an outbreak occurs, the catastrophe is enormous.
Animals, which we keep to supply us with meat and milk, are treated as mere
dirt with the outbreak of FMD or CSF. They are killed, thrown on heaps and
burned or destroyed. Our approach to animal husbandry does not allow for
vaccination, thus unnecessarily harming these animals. To be in favor of
this policy shows the deepest contempt for animals.
FMD and CSF are among the most contagious animal diseases, but are of no
threat to the public health. The non-vaccination policy with its many
preventive measures and its Draconian methods, has the effect of turning
majority opinion against rural people. The massive killing and destroying
of thousands of animals has a devastating effect on the image of the farmers.
An outbreak of FMD or CSF results in a complete disruption of a rural
society. Rural events and meetings are canceled; farmers are advised not to
visit each other; children are not allowed to play together or even to go
to school; citizens are recommended to avoid the country. This reminds me
of the stories in the history books, when the plague scourged Europe in the
Middle Ages. [Although both outbreaks affected life in Europe, the plague
epidemic during the 14th century killed approximately one-third of Europe's
population. By contrast, the current epidemic of FMD is not a direct risk
to human health. - Man. Ed. DS
It is unbelievable that in the 21st century an outbreak of a contagious
animal disease for which there is a vaccine totally shatters a society.
No pharmaceutical company is willing to invest in the development of marker
vaccines due to this non-vaccination policy. At the moment, there is an
outbreak of FMD, and we have no choice but to fall back on the methods of
the Middle Ages. I am ashamed to be a part of the western European society
which permits this.
I disapprove of this policy, and declare to you I favor a policy based on
preventive vaccination in regions or countries. Regions or countries who
want to export to countries demanding FMD-free meat and therefore do not
want to vaccinate, will do this for their own risk and costs. With the
present information systems and certificates this could easily be achieved.
If the European Union adopts this policy, countries and/or regions that
vaccinate are mutually protected in regard to possible trade limits and
financial consequences.
Madame, I ask you: of what magnitude must the catastrophe be before the EU
authorities see that this non-vaccination policy is worthless and they
consider a modern approach?
