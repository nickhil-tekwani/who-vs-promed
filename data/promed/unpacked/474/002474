Cases of [human] anthrax have been reported in 2 districts of the northern province of Sogd (Sughd). "Cases of anthrax have been registered in the Ayni and Panjakent districts," Nasibjon Ikromov, the 1st deputy head of the Sogd sanitary and epidemiological center, told Asia-Plus in an interview.

According to him, 2 cases of anthrax have been registered in Ayni and 4 cases of anthrax have been registered in Panjakent. "The anthrax patients from Ayni have been taken to the hospital in Khujand for further medical treatment," Ikromov added.

[Sogd (also spelled Sughd) is tucked inside Uzbekistan: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sughd_Province. In the Perry-Castaneda Library Map Collection 2001 map (see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/tajikistan_pol01.jpg) it is labeled Viloyati Leninobod. Ayni and Panjakent are on the A377 highway to Samarqand. Its closeness to an enzootically affected region of Uzbekistan and the commonality of the road systems raises the possibility that these 6 people might have gotten infected from purchased (contaminated) meat that had originated in the Ferghana valley of western Uzbekistan. Or it could have gone east on the A377 highway; this is given weight by the 4 cases in Panjakent in the west compared to cases in Ayni in the east -- the cities are some 90-plus kilometres [56-plus miles] apart. In either case there should be more human cases. This is speculation as the news account gives no information from Nasibjon Ikromov, the deputy chief of the provincial public health service and epidemiology center, as to the source, if he knows.

Livestock outbreaks in Sogd were last reported to OIE in 2009 and 2011; both outbreaks involved cattle. - Mod.MHJ
