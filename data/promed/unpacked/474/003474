The number of toxocariasis cases has increased in the Tumen region of Russia.
Territorial Management of Federal Services for Protection of
Consumers' Rights and Human Well-being [Rospotrebnadzor] has
announced that 13 cases of toxocariasis have been registered for 9
months of 2006 versus one cases for the same period of 2005. This is
the result of increased surveillance for toxocariasis.
Toxocariasis is caused by the larvae of the nematode species
_Toxocara cani_ and _cati_, parasites of domestic and wild animals.
Eggs of toxocarae are found in the environment, excreted by dogs and
cats. Though cases of toxocariasis appear all year, the highest
number of cases is registered during the summer-autumnal period when
the number of eggs in the ground is highest and contact with them is maximal.
At room temperature, eggs of _Toxocara_ spp. can develop and be
viable all the year round. Children 3-5 years of age, veterinarians,
workers of nurseries, circuses, zoos; and people with a low level of
hygienic skills; owners of personal plots, the persons engaged in
hunting are in the groups of risk of toxocariasis.

[_Toxocara canis_ and _T. cati_ are widespread in temperate climates.
Dogs and cats are the main hosts, and the eggs are shed in feces;
they can stay alive for months in the environment depending on
temperature and humidity. The clinical picture for humans is called
"visceral larval migrans," which has unspecific symptoms;
occasionally eye symptoms may result when the worm is located in the
eye. The active infection is always followed by a rise in total IgE
and/or eosinophils. - Mod.EP]
