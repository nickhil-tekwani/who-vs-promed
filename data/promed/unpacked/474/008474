Typhus -- an infectious disease spread by fleas -- is sweeping LA County, having infected a city hall prosecutor and more than 100 others. Officials recorded 124 cases of the disease in the county last year [2018], and there is no sign of the spread letting up. The outbreak has largely been seen as exclusively affecting homeless people.

But today, [a] Deputy City Attorney revealed she was diagnosed in November [2018] -- blaming the fleas in her office at LA's City Hall. And the symptoms [she] described sounded excruciating. "It felt like somebody was driving railroad stakes through my eyes and out the back of my neck," [she] told NBC Los Angeles. She believes the rats that nestle in the building's trash were carrying fleas that transmitted the disease. "There are rats in City Hall and City Hall East," [she] told NBC. "There are enormous rats and their tails are as long as their bodies." She has yet to go back to work, and is calling on the city to fumigate the building before she does "because I thought I was going to die. This is a terrible illness and I wouldn't wish this on anybody," she said, adding: "It's not just homeless folks getting it."

Typhus is a bacterial disease that causes fever, headache, rash, muscle ache, and fever and chills. In severe cases, patients can require hospitalisation due to hepatitis or internal bleeding. It is caused by the bacteria _Rickettsia typhi_ and possibly _Rickettsia felis_, which are carried by fleas, lice, mites or ticks. The pests live on animals, particularly feral and stray cats, rats and opossums, but do not make their host animals unwell.

Flea-borne typhus is endemic in parts of LA and Orange counties. The disease also often occurs in Texas and Hawaii. Around 200 cases occur every year throughout the US, particularly in coastal regions.

Bacteria spread when faeces from an infected insect contaminate a person's cut or graze while the insect is sucking their blood. If the person scratches the bite area, the bacteria from the faeces can enter their bloodstream. Bacteria can also be rubbed into a person's eyes, or, in rare cases, inhaled. Symptoms then appear 6 to 14 days later.

Typhus can be treated via antibiotics, with most people recovering within a few days. Between 2% and 4% of people who do not receive treatment die worldwide. Typhus can be prevented by avoiding contact with fleas, mites, ticks and lice by discouraging wild animals around the home, keeping rubbish covered, [and] using flea control on pets.

Typhus was 1st described in 1489 by the Spanish, when their soldiers started developing symptoms during the War of Granada. They lost 17 000 men to typhus -- almost 6 times the amount that died in battle (3000). Then, reports of it started popping up all over, particularly in dungeons and warzones. Sufferers developed fevers, spots, delirium and gangrene. It killed 100 000 people in Ireland in the early 1800s. It was first recorded in the US in the late 1800s, with an epidemic in Philadelphia in 1837. In 1843, the son of President Franklin Pierce died of typhus. During the Civil War, it was known as "camp fever," killing hundreds of thousands. [This paragraph undoubtedly is describing a disease with very high case fatality rates, most likely louse-borne typhus caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_ and spread by the human body lice; it is not describing murine typhus (with a case fatality rate of less than 4% for untreated cases, caused by _Rickettsia typhi_ and spread by rat or cat fleas), which is the subject of this news report.]

[Murine typhus, which occurs throughout the world, is a flea-borne rickettsial disease caused by _Rickettsia typhi_ and possibly _R. felis_ (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737805/). Rats are the primary animal reservoir of _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such as free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums, as well as their fleas, can maintain this microorganism in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad AF, Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al. Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic considerations. Emerg Infect Dis 1997;3(3):319-27; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/).

Humans are usually infected by contact with infected flea feces, either by inoculation into excoriated flea bites, inhalation, or ingestion. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, vomiting, nausea, myalgia, and rash. The illness usually resolves within 3 weeks, even if untreated. However, some patients are sick enough to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit, and up to 4% of hospitalized patients will die from the infection. Treatment is doxycycline. Prevention is directed at control of flea vectors and animal reservoirs.

The Los Angeles [LA] County Department of Public Health on 30 Oct 2018 said there were 72 cases of murine typhus in its jurisdiction, which does not include the LA County cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments. At that time, Long Beach and Pasadena were said to have 15 and 20 cases, respectively, which brought LA County's total to at least 107 murine typhus cases (ProMED-mail post Murine typhus - USA (11): (CA) Los Angeles county, more cases, homeless 20181101.6123421). The above news report says that the 2018 total is now 124 cases in the county, but it is unclear in that report if it is referring to LA County as a whole (including the cities of Long Beach and Pasadena) or the county exclusive of Long Beach and Pasadena.

Previous reports said that the outbreak in the city of LA involved mainly the homeless community in the downtown area, which had increased 47% since 2012 (Murine typhus - USA (11): (CA) Los Angeles county, more cases, homeless 20181101.6123421). However, the above news report tries to emphasize that not just the homeless are involved, but fails to mention what proportion of cases are occurring outside LA's homeless community. - Mod.ML
