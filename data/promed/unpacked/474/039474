2 Legionnaires cases reported; unrelated to Bronx outbreak
----------------------
Legionnaires' disease is a potentially severe form of pneumonia caused by a type of bacterium called Legionella, according to the CDC.
2 more people have caught Legionnaires' disease, but New York City officials said Wed, 26 Aug 2015, the infections are unrelated to this summer's outbreak in the South Bronx that killed 12 and sickened 116 others.

Nor are the latest cases connected to each other, said Ishanee Parikh, a spokeswoman for [New York City] Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Officials turned off the water at San Quentin State Prison on Friday, 28 Aug 2015, and temporarily trucked in portable toilets after an inmate was hospitalized with Legionnaires' disease and more than 2 dozen other prisoners showed signs of the illness.

The state corrections department, in conjunction with medical and health department staff, then began a hunt for the source of the bacterial infection, which can cause severe and sometimes fatal pneumonia. Fortunately, "Legionnaires' is not an infectious disease -- it cannot be transmitted person to person," said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the medical receiver's office that runs prison healthcare services in California. "It is transmitted through aerosolized water or inhaling contaminated soil."

State corrections spokeswoman Dana Simas said some 30 inmates at the Marin County prison -- the state's oldest -- were under observation Friday, 28 Aug 2015, with for pneumonia-like symptoms. 1 inmate who tested positive for the bacteria on Thu, 27 Aug 2015, remained hospitalized in stable condition, Simas said. 2 others also were hospitalized but had not been officially diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease. No staff members were reported sick with the bacteria.

In the meantime, prison officials ordered a halt to visitation and shut off water to the more than 3700 inmates and 1800 workers at the 163-year-old lockup. They brought in water trucks, bottled water and 100 portable toilets. On the advice of public health experts, the prison decided by late Friday afternoon, 28 Aug 2015, to allow inmates to again use the toilets in their cells, and to permit cooking with tap water.

California public health records show 348 reported cases of Legionnaires' disease in 2014, 2/3 of them affecting individuals 65 or older. More than half of the cases occurred in Los Angeles County.

From 2009 to 2012, California reported 82 deaths attributed to the bacterium, according to the state Department of Public Health.

The Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs (IDVA) and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) announced Thursday, 27 Aug 2015, there are 8 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease in residents at the Illinois Veterans' Home - Quincy. There have been no known deaths related to this outbreak. IDVA and IDPH are working closely with the Adams County Health Department to identify and mitigate possible sources of the Legionella bacterium.

Legionella bacteria grow in areas of warm water. In order to be infected with the bacteria, a person must inhale contaminated water vapor.
Legionnaires' disease cannot be transmitted person-to-person. Common water sources include decorative fountains, hot tubs, shower areas, and cooling towers.

"Legionnaires' disease can be a dangerous illness, especially in older adults who have weaker immune systems," said IDPH Director Nirav D. Shah. "While there can be numerous causes of respiratory illness, we will continue to work with our public health partners and local healthcare
providers to quickly identify residents who may have Legionnaires' disease and get them treatment as soon as possible."

Test results are currently pending for other residents.

[As a reminder, the following is a short summary of the outbreak that led to the characterization of the organism which came to be called _Legionella pneumophilia_ although it had, in retrospect, caused outbreaks before (http://www.open-access-biology.com/legionella/edelstein.html). The citations have been removed.:

Legionnaires' disease was initially recognized as a distinct entity during an epidemic of pneumonia that occurred in Philadelphia, in the summer of 1976. About 4000 members of the Pennsylvania State American Legion, an organization of former military veterans, met in July for their annual meeting in the city, which lasted from 21 to 24 July. The convention hotel, the Bellevue Stratford, considered the best hotel in the city, was a frequent convention site and the hotel where visiting dignitaries stayed.

July, 1976 was a special time in Philadelphia and the nation, as this was the bicentennial anniversary of the United States Declaration of Independence from Great Britain. Philadelphia was where the Declaration of Independence was written and 1st announced, and the nation's 1st capital. Celebrations and large parades were held in the city during the time of the American Legion convention. City officials were worried that outside protestors would create violent disruptions of planned bicentennial celebrations. In addition, the hot and humid Philadelphia summer was made even more unbearable by a garbage collector's strike that left high mounds of stinking garbage on city streets.

In the spring of 1976, the US Center for Disease Control warned about the possibility of pandemic swine influenza occurring in the United States after 2 cases of the disease were diagnosed in army recruits at Fort Dix, New Jersey (Gaydos et al., 2006; Sencer and Millar, 2006). A nationwide influenza vaccination campaign was advised, but this was stalled because of manufacturer's concerns about financial liability.

On Fri 30 Jul 1976, Dr Ernest Campbell, a Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, physician, realized that he was treating 3 convention delegates for a febrile illness. From Friday 30 Jul 1976 until Sunday 1 Aug 1976, other health care providers became aware of clusters of pneumonia , and at least 1 called the Philadelphia Department of Health on Sunday, 1 Aug 1976. Since the Pennsylvania State Public Health Department was closed on that day and through the weekend, these reports were made on Mon, 2 Aug 1976. By that day 18 convention delegates or city visitors had died of acute pneumonia, and about 170 were sick with pneumonia. In retrospect, the 1st recorded death from the epidemic was on 27 Jul 1976. Initial recognition of the epidemic was delayed because the convention delegates were widely disbursed after the convention ended, and because many lived in small towns. The Philadelphia epidemic was featured in national television and radio broadcasts on 2 Aug 1976, with an emphasis on the unknown cause of the epidemic. Convention delegates last became ill on 3 Aug 1976, with the last known cases of Legionnaires' disease being in non-convention delegates on 16 Aug 1976. The epidemic was over by the time that the epidemiological investigation began in earnest.

The total number of Legionnaires' disease cases was 182, with 29 deaths. Both convention delegates (149 cases) and non-Legionnaires (33 cases) were affected by the disease, including some who never entered the convention hotel. Some members of a marching band and people who watched a parade outside the hotel became ill; this was initially termed Broad Street pneumonia to distinguish the illness from that suffered by the Legionnaires. One dramatic example is that of a marching band bus driver who became ill and died of the disease; he had spent only hours in Philadelphia, and most of the time in his bus. Great public concern and fear arose, such that funerals of those who died with the disease were not attended by the public because of concern of getting the disease from the corpse. Even before the public health investigations had been completed, Bellevue Stratford hotel guests cancelled their reservations and the hotel was left empty. The state governor stayed overnight in the hotel to emphasize its safety, but to no avail; the hotel was forced to close permanently on 18 Nov 1976. Reopened later under a new name and after major renovations, it is now known as the Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue.

Epidemiological studies, led by David Fraser of the CDC, concluded that the focus of the disease was the Bellevue Stratford Hotel, that both American Legionnaires and non-convention delegates had acquired the disease, and that the disease was most probably spread by the air-borne route. However, the cause of the epidemic pneumonia was not determined until December 1976, some 5 months after the outbreak. Tests for almost all known types of respiratory infections were negative, as were toxicological studies.

The inability of the CDC investigators to quickly determine the cause of the outbreak led to widespread, and often unfounded, speculations about the cause of the epidemic. Some suggested that the epidemic was a US Central Intelligence Agency germ or chemical warfare experiment gone bad. Others suggested that the epidemic was a hoax, designed to gain support for the CDC and swine influenza vaccination. Some of this speculation was fuelled by the rapid US congressional subcommittee approval of a vaccine manufacturers liability protection act, on 3 Aug 1977, after congressional testimony that swine influenza could not be excluded as a cause of the epidemic. Some thought that domestic terrorists had caused the illnesses through chemical or microbiological means. A leading Philadelphia pathologist and toxicologist, Dr William Sunderman, suggested that the epidemic was due to nickel carbonyl poisoning, a disease that he had studied for years. The New York Times excoriated the CDC for its failure to collect adequate specimens for toxicological studies. The possibility of nickel carbonyl poisoning was supported briefly by autopsy studies until it was realized that the autopsy instruments were the probable sources of the nickel that was detected; repeat testing and detailed analysis showed that nickel carbonyl poisoning was not the cause of the epidemic. Regardless, Dr Sunderman and his son, also a toxicologist, maintained for years afterwards that nickel carbonyl poisoning was a strong possibility as the cause of the epidemic. Others speculations for an etiology were toxic fumes from photocopy machines, air conditioning refrigerant decomposition producing phosgene gas, and nefarious foreign or extra-terrestrial forces.

Concern about the inability to identify the etiology of the epidemic led to US Congressional hearings in November 1976, about a week after the permanent closure of the Bellevue Stratford Hotel. The hearings, representative of the frustration of many that no etiology had been determined for the epidemic, were primarily political theatre. A month later Joseph McDade had determined that the etiology of the outbreak was _L. pneumophila _. In April, 1977, the term Legionnaires' disease was 1st published by the CDC as the official name of the epidemic disease, although it had been called that in the press as early as September 1976. - Mod.LL
