MANDATORY IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM, CATTLE - CANADA

Ontario Cattlemen's Association special projects coordinator Peter Doris
was cited as telling farmers at the North Eastern Ontario Agricultural
Conference recently that farmers will likely be dealing with a mandatory
national identification system for cattle within the next three to four
years, adding, "The question is not will the system be mandatory but when,"
adding an effective system could be in place by 2000 or 2001, and perhaps
earlier.
The first step is to find an identification tag that works, and the
Canadian Cattle Identification Agency -- a private group developed to run
the program along the lines of the privatized national beef grading agency
-- will field test types of ID tags on Canadian farms this year.
Doris was cited as admitting there will be some discomfort with the system,
especially among independent-minded cattlemen. But the architects of the
system decided it had to be mandatory in order to be effective. Doris was
quoted as saying, "Cattle producers are free-enterprisers and private
business people who have great respect for the rights of the individual.
But when you break it all down, this is something that we need everybody in."
Reassuring foreign buyers is a key thrust of the program. Because the
identification system permits health and disease problems to be traced
quickly, the Canadian industry can demonstrate its willingness to safeguard
food quality.

[Maybe one of our eastern Canadian members might care to comment on this -
how far this identification is likely to be developed beyond merely having a
better and longer lasting "ear tag"; to be read as needed or tied to a
national/regional database; will it carry accumulating information or will
it be animal identification? - Mod.MHJ]
