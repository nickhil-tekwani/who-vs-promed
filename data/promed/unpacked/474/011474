The [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa] provincial government has failed to control leishmaniasis disease found in over 1000 persons, including women and children, in the suburbs of Kohat city, sources said.

The sources said leishmaniasis had affected over 1000 people mostly women and children in Barh, Jabbi, and other areas for the last 3 months but the health authorities were keeping quiet over the issue.

Despite several attempts, District Health Officer [DHO] Habibur Rehman did not attend the call as he had been in Peshawar for the last one week. When contacted, Assistant Commissioner Farrukh Attique said that he had discussed the issue with the DHO and asked him to take prompt action and send medical teams to the affected areas for vaccination [see comment below].

Meanwhile, Additional Assistant Commissioner Fakhr Khan said that he had informed the Health Department about the epidemic long before, but had received no response so far.

[It is presumed that the report is about cutaneous leishmaniasis, CL. Leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Pakistan, but it is unclear what the denominator is.

Kohat is the administrative center of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, located in the northwest close to the border with Afghanistan.

The report mentions "teams for vaccination". This must be a mistake, as there is no vaccine for leishmaniasis.

A detailed discussion of leishmaniasis in the tribal areas of Pakistan is included in the 3 Feb 2014 ProMED-mail post from Leishmaniasis - Pakistan: (TA) 20140203.2252445. - Mod.EP
