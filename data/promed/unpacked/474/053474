Dane tests negative for bird flu
----------------------------
A Danish man who was hospitalized with suspected bird flu has tested
negative for the deadly disease, doctors said.
"Tests have shown that the man does not have bird influenza and we
expect he would be sent home later today after we have carried out
further tests on him," Dr Peter Skinhoj, an epidemiologist at the
Copenhagen University Hospital, told Danish radio.
On the basis of blood tests in the local hospital of Nykoebing,
southern Denmark, the 25-year-old man, who works in a poultry farm,
was diagnosed with suspected bird flu. Late Friday, he was transfered
to Copenhagen.
"He was admitted on Friday with symptoms of the disease, saying he
felt unwell and that he feared he might have got the disease,"
Skinhoj said.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu, its most aggressive form, has killed
more than 100 people worldwide, according to the World Health
Organisation (WHO).
Several cases of the H5N1 virus have been reported in birds in
Denmark since mid-March.
If the Danish man had tested positive for the disease, it would have
been the first case of bird flu reported in humans in the European
Union.

Egypt: Death of 12th Case of Human Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
A fourth person has died in Egypt after being infected with bird flu,
the state news agency, MENA, has stated. The victim, an 18-year-old
woman from north of Cairo, was admitted to hospital on Monday and
found to be suffering from the H5N1 virus infection [see: Avian
influenza, human - worldwide (46): Egypt 20060413.1096. - Mod.CP]
There have so far been 12 reported cases of human bird flu in Egypt.
Around the world, more than 100 people have died from the H5N1 strain
of the disease since 2003 - the majority of them in Asia. Egypt first
reported H5N1 in birds in February. The first human case was reported
a month later. Egypt is a major route for migratory birds and has now
joined Turkey as the worst-hit countries outside Asia.
Nasser Kamel, a spokesman for the Supreme National Committee to
Combat Bird Flu, said: "It was an 18-year-old woman from the Menufiya
governorate. She was already in bad health when she arrived to
hospital." The woman was believed to have been handling infected
poultry. Many women in Egypt are responsible for slaughtering
domestic birds.
The government has urged more awareness about the dangers of bird
flu. Of the 12 people infected in the country, four have died, five
have recovered and three are still receiving treatment, health
officials say.
The World Health Organization has expressed concern about the number
of deaths in Egypt in a relatively short amount of time. Egypt
responded to the first deaths by culling more than 10 million birds
and banning domestic poultry farms. Cairo Zoo was closed in February
after birds there were found to be infected.
So far across the world the disease has mainly affected animals. But
experts fear the virus could mutate into a form that passes easily
between humans, possibly sparking a pandemic. However, there is no
evidence that this has happened yet.
