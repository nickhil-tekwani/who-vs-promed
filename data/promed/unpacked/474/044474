Cases of invasive _Mycobacterium chimaera_ infection in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery have recently been reported in Switzerland and the Netherlands. A Swiss investigation has been published suggesting an association with contaminated heater cooler units used during cardiopulmonary bypass [1]. Detailed investigations are now underway in the UK to assess any historic or ongoing risk to patients.

_M. chimaera_ is a recently identified member of the _Mycobacterium avium_ complex [MAC], very similar to _M. intracellulare_, another member of the complex. These are slow-growing, environmental organisms; in a clinical context, they are usually described as causing respiratory infections and disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients. _M. chimaera_ would be identified by most UK laboratories as _M. intracellulare_ or _M. avium_ complex.

Following initial identification of 2 cases of invasive _M. chimaera_ infection in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery at the University Hospital of Zurich [2], a retrospective study was undertaken. This identified a total of 6 cases of _M. chimaera_ prosthetic valve endocarditis or vascular graft infection associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass [1]. The cases underwent surgery between 2008 and 2012.

The intervals between surgery and infection were very prolonged, over 3 years in one instance, reflecting the slow-growing nature of the organism. Given the total number of such surgeries performed in this hospital over the 5-year period (approximately 3000), this suggests a low risk of infection. The outcome for patients infected was, however, poor, with 2 of the 6 cases subsequently dying.

Extensive local investigations, including air and water sampling, attributed the infections to mycobacterial contamination of the water circulating within the heater cooler unit of the cardiopulmonary bypass equipment used in surgery, transmitted by aerosol production.

A specific brand of heater cooler machine was implicated in the Swiss report. This brand of machine is widely used in Europe, including the UK. It is not yet known whether any risk is limited to one brand of heater cooler.

As a result, Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have launched a series of investigations to assess the risk in the UK. This includes retrospective case finding, sampling from heater cooler units and enhanced microbiological testing by the National Mycobacterial Reference Laboratory to identify _M. chimaera_ from clinical or environmental samples. Whilst it remains possible that other organisms found in water could be transmitted by the same route, initial investigations will focus on _M. avium_ complex in line with findings from Switzerland.

[_Mycobacterium chimaera_ is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) (NTM is a grouping outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex) in the _Mycobacterium avium intracellulare_ complex (MAC). _M. chimaera_ is a slowly growing acid-fast bacillus that is commonly found in the environmental water and soil (http://cmr.asm.org/content/6/3/266.full.pdf+html). Because of its close relationship to _M. intracellulare_, _M. chimaera_ strains can be misidentified as _M. intracellulare_. _M. chimaera_ is known to cause pulmonary disease, but until the reports from Switzerland (1, 2), _M. chimaera_ had not been reported as a cause of bloodstream infection or endocarditis. Mycobacterial endocarditis is rare, and the predominant causative mycobacterial pathogens are the rapidly growing NTM (http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-76382015000100017&script=sci_arttext).

The above news report refers to an article published by Swiss investigators at the University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich Heart Institute in March 2015 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases (1), the abstract of which is reproduced below:

"Background. Invasive _Mycobacterium chimaera_ infections were diagnosed in 2012 in 2 heart surgery patients on extracorporeal circulation. We launched an outbreak investigation to identify the source and extent of the potential outbreak and to implement preventive measures.

"Methods. We collected water samples from operating theaters, intensive care units, and wards, including air samples from operating theaters. _Mycobacterium chimaera_ strains were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Case detection was performed based on archived histopathology samples and _M. chimaera_ isolates since 2006, and the patient population at risk was prospectively surveyed.

"Results. We identified 6 male patients aged between 49 and 64 years with prosthetic valve endocarditis or vascular graft infection due to _M. chimaera_, which became clinically manifest with a latency of between 1.5 and 3.6 years after surgery. _Mycobacterium chimaera_ was isolated from cardiac tissue specimens, blood cultures, or other biopsy specimens. We were able also to culture _M. chimaera_ from water circuits of heater-cooler units connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass, and air samples collected when the units were in use. RAPD-PCR demonstrated identical patterns among _M. chimaera_ strains from heater-cooler unit water circuits and air samples, and strains in 2 patient clusters.

"Conclusions. The epidemiological and microbiological features of this prolonged outbreak provided evidence for the airborne transmission of _M. chimaera_ from contaminated heater-cooler unit water tanks to patients during open-heart surgery."

This same group of Swiss investigators at the University Hospital of Zurich had previously reported one case of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and one case of bloodstream infection caused by _M. chimaera_ (2). Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR indicated relatedness of the 2 _M. chimaera_ strains. Both patients had heart surgery 2 years apart from each other. A nosocomial link at the time, however, was not detected.
