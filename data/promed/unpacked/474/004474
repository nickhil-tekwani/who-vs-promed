Fears raised over new vCJD wave
-------------------------------
Doctors fear a new wave of the human form of "mad cow disease" is
about to hit Britain, BBC Newsnight has learned. In the UK, 164
people have died of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD), which
originally came from cows infected with BSE, and all cases shared a
version of a certain gene.

But Newsnight has been told of a new case in a separate genetic
group. The government's chief adviser on vCJD, Professor Chris
Higgins, said estimates were that up to 350 people could become
affected by this new type. He told Newsnight the new case had been
diagnosed on a clinical basis as vCJD. Such cases can be officially
confirmed only if further, more invasive, tests go ahead, such as a
brain biopsy.

What is of concern to doctors in the new case is that the individual
concerned has a particular genetic make-up and it is the first case
to appear of that type. There is a key gene linked to vCJD and 42
percent of the population have a version of that gene, known as MM
[methionine/ methionine]. The number of human victims peaked in the
year 2000 and there are now only a handful of cases a year. It looked
like the disease had almost gone away, but this new case is from a
group with a version of the gene called MV [methionine/valine]. This
raises fears that the 47 percent of the population who have this gene
are now at risk.

Prof Higgins, chairman of the government's Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee, said: "Given that 160 to 170 MM individuals were
infected, we would estimate the number of MV victims would be a
maximum of 300 to 350, probably between 50 and 350."

Hugh Pennington, the emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen
University, told Newsnight that any new cases may well have
originated at the same time as the original vCJD outbreak. He said it
was probably the case that the MV-genotye cases "have a longer
incubation period, because they're more resistant... a longer period
goes by between [the patient] being infected... and falling ill."

The new case is likely to push the whole issue up the political
agenda again. Campaigner Christine Lord, who lost her son to vCJD a
year ago, when he was 24, is going to Downing Street on Thursday [18
Dec 2008] to ask Gordon Brown to do more. "I want people to know out
there that vCJD hasn't gone away and it's still killing people... and
now it looks like it's the next wave." She said that while not much
could be done about those who might already have been infected by
eating BSE-infected meat, the chances of secondary infection via
blood donors who might be "silent carriers" of the disease could be
minimised. She wants the government to speed up the use of tests that
might screen people's blood supply for vCJD and to release documents
she says will name those who are to blame for the whole BSE fiasco.

[In summary: The risk of development of vCJD has included age,
residence in the UK and methionine homozygosity (M/M) at codon 129 of
the prion protein gene; all 146 clinically affected cases of vCJD
with available genetic analysis have been methionine homozygotes. The
only exception has been the identification of disease-related PrP in
the spleen of a clinically unaffected blood recipient with a PRNP-129
MV genotype.

Now a patient in a London hospital with a PRNP-129 M/V genotype has
been diagnosed clinically as a case of vCJD. If the clinical
diagnosis of vCJD is confirmed by molecular analysis it may indicate
that late onset vCJD is associated with this genotype (which is the
majority genotype in the UK population), and that a new wave of vCJD
may be imminent as a delayed consequence of the exposure of the UK
population to BSE-contaminated meat. - Mod.CP]
