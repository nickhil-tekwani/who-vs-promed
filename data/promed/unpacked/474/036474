I'm not a toxicologist, but I believe aflatoxin is commonly found in mold
growing on nuts. I think tests are available to identify this type of
pathogen, as it's been produced for biological warfare (see today's Iraq
reports). I hope others more knowledgeable than I respond also!

Although one is loath to consider such a scenario, we cannot rule out, nor
should we rule out among the range of possible aetiologies, test-runs for
biological/chemical warfare agents. Geneva convention notwithstanding,
there is increasing evidence of much activity not too far away from
Afghanistan.

Re: pistachio pickers in Afghanistan. Have pesticides such as
organophosphates or carbamates been used...both can be associated with
severe diarrhea.

The Associate Knowledge base lists the following diseases as afebrile
diseases which
have diarrhea as a clinical sign:
Ciguatera Food Poisoning
_Bacillus cereus_ Food Poisoning
Cholera
Clostridial Food Poisoning (Enterotoxemia)
Botulism
You should also consider organophosphate and carbamate poisoning.
