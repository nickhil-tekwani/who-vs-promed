City and Lincoln Park Zoo Organize West Nile Virus Early-warning System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
With West Nile virus (WNV) spreading faster than anticipated, the Lincoln
Park Zoo and Chicago city health officials are creating a novel
early-warning system that could detect WNV-related disease in birds and
[mosquitoes before it affects the human population. With the city's help
the Lincoln Park zoo will regularly draw blood from its flamingos,
chickens, raptors and waterfowl to screen for the virus. Mosquitoes trapped
on zoo property will also be tested.
Since WNV first appeared in New York 2 years ago, it has infected tens of
thousands of birds, dozens of horses and at least 81 people. Nine people
have died. Last year the virus reached the shores of Lake Erie and covered
10 times as much ground as it did the summer before. The fact that WNV is a
threat not only to zoo animals but also to people pushed the zoo and city
to make animals a significant part of their efforts to track human disease.
"It's important that we enhance our surveillance to include other
populations, not just humans," said Dr. Pamela Diaz, Medical Director for
Acute Disease for the Chicago Department of Public Health. "We have learned
a lot from watching the East Coast respond to this."
Experts in both scientific communities say their work will prove crucial
not only to controlling WNV but also to detecting other serious disease
threats. "WNV is the issue that brought to the forefront the need to have
these links between animal and public health," said Dr. Thomas Gomez, a
veterinary epidemiologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The
virus was detected as near as northwestern Pennsylvania last year, and
health officials expect it eventually will reach Illinois.
The disease is transmitted primarily from bird to bird by mosquitoes.
However, a mosquito that has fed from an infected bird can infect a human.
Specialists in human health are interested in zoos not because they harbor
the virus, but because watchful zoo-keepers have shown they can detect the
disease in their animals early. With its seasonal transmission cycle, the
virus can infect birds weeks before it infects people. It is important to
know when the virus arrives because health officials can then increase
spraying and other measures to control mosquitoes, potentially preventing
more cases of the illness.
Since the outbreak, cities and states have ratcheted up mosquito
surveillance and begun collecting wild bird carcasses to check for the
virus. Some keep "sentinel" flocks of chickens to test or draw blood from
wild birds. Just 2 years ago the world of disease surveillance was vastly
different. There was little talk of cooperation among top human and animal
health watchdogs. When birds died, even hundreds of birds, few people took
notice. Animal specialists began investigating crow illnesses and deaths in
New York as early as mid-June 1999, nearly 3 months before the West Nile
virus would be identified as the cause of the illnesses in birds and
people. By late August 1991, birds had started dying at the Bronx Zoo.
Meanwhile in Queens, hospital workers were puzzling over 6 patients with
strange neurological symptoms.
After the city announced in September 1999 that the human cases were St.
Louis encephalitis, a misdiagnosis, animal health workers began to ask if
the illnesses could be connected. But although the head pathologist at the
Bronx Zoo and city epidemiologists suggested the link to investigators with
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC continued to treat
the deaths as coincidental for about 2 more weeks, according to a report
from the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Gomez said there are reasons besides WNV for humans to worry about animal
health. Of the 156 pathogens considered to be "emerging," either because
they are new illnesses or drug-resistant strains of old ones, 73 percent
can move from animals to people, he said. Scientists are paying close
attention to these emerging diseases not only because high-volume global
travel makes it easier to spread them. The New York [isolate of WNV
resembles a strain found in Israel. Though biological terrorism was quickly
ruled out as a source of WNV, New York's response was seen by many as a
trial run for responding to such a threat.

[The Bronx zoo played a key role in the WNV outbreak in 1999, as recounted
above and in detail in the GAO Report (which can be accessed via
<http://www.gao.gov>). This is the likely rationale for the Chicago
early-warning system.
Retrospective analysis indicated that in 1999 the first infected wild bird
was identified in late June. In the following year over-wintering of WNV in
mosquitoes was reported in January/February 2000, and a WNV-infected red
tailed hawk was found dead in February 2000. There have been no reports of
detection of WNV so far in 2001, despite the increased surveillance
throughout the northeastern states. However, since the mosquito season runs
from April to October, it may not be long before the first reports appear.
