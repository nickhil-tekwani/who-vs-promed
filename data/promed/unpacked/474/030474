State veterans and health officials said in a statement on [Tue 1 Sep 2015], that 7 people have died and 32 sickened in a legionnaires' disease outbreak at a veterans home in Quincy, Illinois.

The 7 residents who died had underlying medical conditions, the statement said, adding that results are pending from tests to determine whether other residents have contracted the disease.

Nearly 450 people call the Illinois Veterans' Home at Quincy home, and it is the largest and oldest veterans home in the state, the home's website said.

The outbreak in Quincy, located about 240 miles [149 mi] southwest of Chicago, follows recent outbreaks of the respiratory illness that killed a dozen people in New York City and has sickened inmates at a California prison.

Legionnaires' is a severe form of pneumonia caused by inhaling mist infected with the bacteria _Legionella_. Symptoms include fever, cough, chills, and muscle aches. Legionnaires' disease cannot be transmitted person-to-person, and a person must inhale contaminated water vapor to be infected.

"Unfortunately, we expect to see additional cases and possibly additional deaths because the incubation period for legionnaires' disease can be up to 2 weeks, and because patients with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of more severe illness," Illinois Department of Public Health Director Nirav Shah said.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have been working with Illinois veterans and health officials to investigate the latest outbreak.

[The news report above is an update of a prior ProMED-mail post on this legionnaires' disease outbreak in a veterans home in Quincy, Illinois (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (11): (NY, CA, IL) RFI 20150829.3610573).

Quincy, with a population of 40 633 in 2010, is a city on the Mississippi River and the county seat of Adams County, Illinois, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Illinois). The Illinois Veterans' Home at Quincy is responsible for providing economical and quality long-term care for veterans and their spouses, which includes domiciliary care, intermediate care, and skilled healthcare (http://www.quincyivh.org). According to its website, the Illinois Veterans' Home at Quincy is one of the larger and older veterans homes in the country, with nearly 450 residents and over 25 buildings that house a post office, bank, assembly hall, guest house, mini post exchange, chapel, animal park, museum, and television station; water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone, and data networks are owned and maintained by the Home (http://www.quincyivh.org).

The news report above does not says if the 39 cases of legionnaires' disease are linked epidemiologically in any way other than residence at the Home. For example, did the cases reside or attend activities in a particular building?

People with weakened immune systems, the elderly, and smokers are particularly at risk for severe disease. Although _Legionella_ infection is usually thought to be acquired by inhalation of contaminated aerosols, sometimes aspiration of contaminated water is thought to be the mechanism (1,2). Dr Victor Yu was the first to suggest that the mode of transmission for legionnaires' disease is aspiration of contaminated water rather than aerosolization, as is widely assumed and _Legionella_-contaminated potable water systems are the source. He has nicely reviewed this topic (3). Aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated water is also the obvious source for neonatal legionnaires' disease that has occurred following use of _Legionella_-contaminated home birthing pools (4-6).

Another example of possible aspiration as a mode of acquiring legionnaires' disease is dental procedures that use warm water under high pressure. In one example, genetic sequencing found that _L. pneumophila_ in the waterlines matched the organisms that caused legionnaires' disease (7). This report postulated that "aerosolized water from high speed turbine instruments was most likely the source of the infection," but anyone who has undergone similar dental procedures using high-pressure waterlines could easily imagine aspiration was the mechanism involved.

Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (8,9). However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.
