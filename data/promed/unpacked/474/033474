External situation report 46: Tue 18 Jun 2019
Data as reported by 16 Jun 2019

The number of new Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases has continued to decrease in recent weeks in Katwa and Butembo, with a total of 8 cases reported in these 2 health zones combined in the past week. On the other hand, case incidence in Mabalako, especially in Aloya health area, has grown substantially. In this area, in addition to transmission within community and social settings, an increased number of healthcare worker (HCW) and potential nosocomial infections have been reported, highlighting the ongoing need for further improvement in protecting HCWs and patients in health facilities in these emerging areas. Reintroduction events were also detected in Lubero, Komanda, and Rwampara health zones in recent weeks, pointing to the ongoing risk of spread associated with the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These events are also a strain on limited resources available to support operations, including the security required to maintain access across multiple geographical areas.

Overall, case incidence has slightly increased in the past week. In the 21 days between 27 May to 16 Jun 2019, 64 health areas within 17 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces. During this period, a total of 248 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (38%, n=93), Katwa (12%, n=30), Mandima (11%, n=27), Butembo (10%, n=26), and Beni (10%, n=24). As of 16 Jun 2019, a total of 2168 EVD cases, including 2074 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1449 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1355 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2168 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1226) were female, and 29% (632) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected increasing to 121 (6% of total cases).

On 14 Jun 2019, a meeting of the Emergency Committee was convened by the WHO director-general under the International Health Regulations (IHR). The committee expressed its deep concern about the ongoing outbreak, which, despite some positive epidemiological trends, especially in the epicentres of Butembo and Katwa, shows that the extension and/or reinfection of disease in other areas like Mabalako presents, once again, challenges around community acceptance and security. In addition, the response continues to be hampered by a lack of adequate funding and strained human resources. It was noted that the cluster of cases in Uganda is not unexpected, and the rapid response and initial containment is a testament to the importance of preparedness in neighbouring countries. It was the view of the committee that the outbreak is a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region but does not meet all the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The committee provided public health advice, which it strongly urged countries and responding partners to heed.

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/ebola-cases-top-2180-uganda-oks-experimental-therapies
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

As expected, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) yesterday [Mon 17 Jun 2019] announced 20 new cases, part of an uptick in activity and transmission that continues in several smaller hot spots, and it added 13 cases today [Tue 18 Jun 2019] for a total of 2181.

In developments in Uganda, where 3 imported cases were recently detected, health officials cleared the use of 3 experimental treatments so that any other cases confirmed in the country can receive similar Ebola care as in the DRC.

Mabalako emerges as hot spot
-----------------
Today [Tue 18 Jun 2019], DRC officials said 4 new cases were in Mandima, 3 in Mabalako, 2 in Butembo, and 1 each in Katwa, Kyondo, Beni, and Kalunguta.

In a daily update late yesterday [Mon 17 Jun 2019], the DRC health ministry said the new cases were from 7 locations: 14 in Mabalako and 1 each from Musienene, Beni, Bunia, Rwampara, Kalunguta, and Kyondo.

The ministry said Mabalako has become the outbreak's main hot spot and that response teams there have stepped up their active search for cases to isolate them as quickly as possible to break transmission chains. It also said the new case in Bunia is a contact of an earlier case in Rawmpara health zone who had refused follow-up and vaccination.

The health ministry said the 3 cases confirmed recently in Uganda will be counted as cases from Mutwanga health zone in the DRC's North Kivu province, since that's where their symptoms began after visiting Mabalako.

Of the 2181 total cases, 2087 have been confirmed. Health officials are still investigating 322 suspected cases.

The health ministry said yesterday and today [17-18 Jun 2019] that 19 more people died from Ebola, including 8 in community settings and 11 in Ebola treatment or transit centers. The latest fatal cases lift the death count to 1459.

Security incidents continue
----------------
Yesterday [Mon 17 Jun 2019], the DRC said a burial team in Bunia was attacked by a group of young people who assaulted them and took their phones and money. All of the team members have been accounted for, and the dead body was brought back to the Bunia transit center.

In an update 2 days ago, the DRC noted 2 other incidents: one, the destruction and burning of a sanitary checkpoint during the night in Ituri province, and the other, an attempted attack by a group of bikers on an infection control and prevention team cleaning up the site of a recently confirmed case in Rwampara health zone. Police dispersed the attackers, and the responders were able to complete their work.

Clearance of experimental treatments
----------------------------
On Twitter yesterday [Mon 17 Jun 2019], Uganda health minister Jane Ruth Aceng, MD announced that officials have received clearance from 2 government groups to bring experimental Ebola treatments into the country. The groups include the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology and the National Drug Authority.

According to a Reuters story that cited a WHO spokesman, the treatments are ZMapp, Regeneron's REGN-EB3 antibody cocktail, and the antiviral remdesivir.

Uganda doesn't have any active Ebola cases, but in a press release, the health ministry said there are 2 suspected cases that have been isolated while test results are pending.

Ring vaccination of contacts and contacts of contacts began on 15 Jun [2019]. And, as of yesterday [Mon 17 Jun 2019], 128 contacts and frontline health and response workers had been vaccinated in the latest push.

[3] Concern over virus spread
- Tue 18 Jun 2019. DR Congo exodus of 300 000 may "hamper Ebola battle"
[BBC, abridged, edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48676435

More than 300 000 people have been displaced this month [June 2019] by ethnic violence in Ituri province in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the UN says.

There are fears that the latest clashes -- between Hema cattle-herders and Lendu farmers -- could hamper efforts to combat an Ebola outbreak in the region. The 2 communities have repeatedly fought over land and water in Ituri, a gold-rich region in the northeast.

A total of 6 million people were killed during 6 years of war in DR Congo. Most of the deaths were from disease and malnutrition.

Several neighbouring countries were involved in the fighting, described by some observers as "Africa's world war."

United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) spokesman Babar Baloch said the agency had received reports of "large-scale displacement" in 3 of Ituri's 5 administrative territories: Djugu, Mahagi, and Irumu. "People are fleeing attacks and counterattacks in Djugu Territory, with reports of both communities forming self-defence groups and being involved in revenge killings," he said.

He added there had been reports of kidnapping, maiming, and sexual violence, and that the UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies did not have access to most of the affected areas.

The displacement could endanger the response to an Ebola epidemic in the region, a spokesman for the UN's health agency, the WHO, told reporters. Tarik Jasarevic said it was "more complicated" to monitor people on a daily basis for 21 days -- the disease's incubation period -- whenever there were large numbers of people on the move.

About 10% of the latest cases and deaths were recorded in Ituri, Mr Jasarevic said.

[Also see the New York Times opinion piece https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/opinion/ebola-epidemic-congo.html, 19 Jun 2019. There is concern that if the virus reaches "South Sudan, a country dotted with refugee camps and teeming with instability, containment could become nearly impossible. To prevent that from happening, healthcare workers will have to eradicate the deep mistrust within Congo's borders. The United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, says that the best way to combat this mistrust is for foreign aid workers to address other needs in the region in addition to combating Ebola. Most Congolese are more concerned with malaria, malnutrition, and diarrheal diseases. Tackling these problems would go a long way toward building trust and make it easier to conquer Ebola in the long run." - Mod.LK]

- Mon 17 Jun 2019. East Africa: Fears rife Ebola outbreak could spread to wider Eastern Africa
[All Africa, abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201906180183.html
[Byline: Daniel Friday Martin]

South Sudan
-------
Residents at the common borders of Uganda and Congo said there were several feeder routes without Ebola screening points, health facilities, and health workers.

"We are moving freely from DRC to South Sudan, and nobody asked us about where we are coming from upon reaching Yei town. It's only in Yei town I saw Ebola centers and concerns about the disease," [JT], a resident of Senema area of Otogo county in South Sudan, told the Nation.

[JT] said governments and humanitarian agencies need to create awareness "deep in the villages."

"Seriously if nothing is done, with the cold weather, rains, and free movement of civilians from DRC, Ebola is most likely to start in Yei River state and spread to the rest of South Sudan," he warned.

Armed groups
-----
[ME], a resident of Yei's Morobo county, which connects to Uganda and Congo, expressed similar fears.

Humanitarian agencies operating in Yei state, however, said insecurity made it difficult to reach the villages with armed groups, governments, or rebel forces restricting access.

"We have the capacity to establish Ebola screening centers and install health officials away in rural areas. Our fear is that once we are there, we become victims of the situation," one humanitarian worker said.

Such fears are real in DR Congo, where health workers in Butembo, one of the districts worst hit by Ebola, have been attacked by armed groups looking to snatch their provisions, medicines, and other valuables.

WHO had threatened to move health workers from the war zone (Eastern North Cape and Ituri provinces) after a series of attacks on health centers and abductions of health workers led to several fatalities.

South Sudan minister of health Kogo Manase said social mobilisers were moving from house to house conducting awareness. "We are also using local radio stations to inform people about preventive measures on the disease. We have set up an Ebola treatment isolation center and also have a mobile ambulance to respond to any suspected Ebola case," Mr Manase said.

So far, Ebola screening centers have been established in Lasu (South Sudan-Congo border) and Kaya (South Sudan-Uganda border), leaving about 15 entry points without screening facilities.

"Our biggest fear has been the issue of insecurity and free movement across the border without using official entry points. With this we are at high risk," he said.

He appealed to people to use official routes and to armed personnel to give passage to humanitarian workers.

South Sudan made an emergency appeal for USD 12 million last Thursday [13 Jun 2019] to bolster its Ebola preparedness.

Somalia federal minister for health Fawzia Abikar Nur said on Sunday [16 Jun 2019] that the government was closely monitoring the situation in neighbouring countries and was working with WHO to prepare for any eventualities.

"We have alerted all health institutions in the country about the dangers of Ebola," Dr Nur said.

Kenya has also deployed health workers who, in 2015, were sent to Sierra Leone and Liberia to combat the disease as part of an African Union mission to enhance surveillance at border points.

Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi have also increased their surveillance following the deaths in Uganda.

- Mon 17 Jun 2019. Mai Mai militia threated by Ebola virus disease in the outskirts of Beni
[Province Nord Kivu, Google trans., edited]

https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/06/mai-mai-militia-threatened-by-ebola-virus-disease-in-the-outskirts-of-beni.html

Via the portal of North Kivu province, a 17 Jun [2019] ACP report: Mai Mai militia threatened by Ebola virus disease in the outskirts of Beni. The Mai Mai are apparently learning that attacks on Ebola treatment centres can be counterproductive.

The deputy mayor of the city of Beni, Modeste Bwanakawa, announced at the rise of the national colors this Mon 17 Jun 2019, agents and civil servants of the state, a threat of Ebola virus disease that would have already declared in the maquis held by Mai Mai militia in the outskirts of the city of Beni.

This urban authority has put forward a balance sheet of 12 cases (12) confirmed and already admitted to the Ebola treatment center CTE / Beni for 2 days in addition to 2 other probable cases that would have disappeared in the wild. Full city reminding that a systematic search was triggered to find the fugitives.

Mayor Bakwanamaha, however, expressed his concern that most of the militia admitted to CTE / Beni are most likely to come from the nearby town of Butembo, a small portion of whom are from the Mabalako health zone.

According to the no. 2 of the city of Beni, the militia leaders, who themselves took the initiative to alert the response teams through the urban authorities of Beni, are ready to contribute to the eradication of this deadly disease which, as of 17 Jun [2019] has killed 1430 victims with more than 722 confirmed cases having been admitted and treated at CTE / Beni.

For him, the fact that militiamen are attacked in their maquis is likely to bring the counter to zero in a city of Beni where it was yet to the point of eradicating the Ebola virus disease.

It is suspected that the Mai Mai affected by Ebola were among those who participated actively in the various attacks against Katwa CTE and UCG / Butembo from where they would have taken mattresses and several other effects used by the interned patients.

-Tue 18 Jun 2019. Uganda clears experimental Ebola treatments, watches for spread
[The Star, edited]
https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/africa/2019-06-18-uganda-clears-three-experimental-ebola-treatments/
[Byline: George Obulutsa]

In summary
- At least another 1411 people have died in Congo since August [2018] in the 2nd-worst outbreak of the disease on record.
- Two people who had travelled from Congo died in Uganda last week [week of Mon 10 Jun 2019], the World Health Organization said.

Health workers have gotten the all-clear to use 3 experimental Ebola treatments in Uganda, a week after the deadly disease spread over the border from Democratic Republic of Congo, authorities said on Tuesday [18 Jun 2019].

Two people who had travelled from Congo died in Uganda last week [week of Mon 10 Jun 2019], the World Health Organization said. A 3-year-old boy who was sent back to Congo after testing positive died [during] the weekend, Congo's health ministry said.

"Happy to inform you all that we got clearance from both Uganda National Council for Science and Technology and National Drug Authority to bring in the therapeutic treatment for #Ebola patients in the country," Uganda's health minister, Jane Ruth Aceng, said on Twitter.

The treatments approved for shipment to Uganda were Mapp Biopharmaceutical's ZMapp, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's Regeneron, and Remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. "The protocols for the 4th being submitted. Logistics underway with MSF support for importation of a few courses, about 10 each," he added in an email.

The UN health agency has said there have so far been no known cases of Ebola spreading between people in Uganda; all recorded patients had travelled in from Congo. Four experimental therapeutic treatments are already being used in Congo, it added.

On Friday [14 Jun 2019], a WHO panel decided not to declare an international emergency over Congo's Ebola outbreak despite its spread to Uganda, saying such a declaration could cause too much economic harm.

"Obviously, the crisis is far from over," Mark Green, the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), told a news conference in Nairobi.

Health workers and people who came in contact with infected people began receiving a Merck experimental vaccine in Uganda on Saturday [15 Jun 2019].
