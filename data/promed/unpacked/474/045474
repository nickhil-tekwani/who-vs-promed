Outbreak of _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ infection in central Finland
Six pupils aged 11 to 15 years of a school in Pirkkala, a town in central
Finland, went to hospital with suspected appendicitis between 19 and 22
August 1997. Healthy appendixes were removed from four who underwent
surgery. Thirty other pupils, aged 6 to 16 years from other classes at the
same school and two members of staff, reported milder symptoms over this
time, including abdominal pain, fever, arthritis, and sore throat.
_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ serotype III was isolated from the stools of
three cases. The results of serological testing of provisional cases are
awaited. The school had returned from summer vacation the previous week.
The only common exposure among cases during the 10 days before they became
ill seems to have been eating food prepared in the school kitchen. A case
control study to determine risk factors for infection, such as food and
water consumption and animal contact is currently underway.
_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ is a bacterium enzootic in various mammals
and birds in Eurasia and North America (1). Human infections are unusual,
presenting with a range of symptoms including abdominal pain, fever, and
pseudoappendicitis (2,3). Most reported human cases have been from Japan,
Eastern Russia, Europe, and North America. Outbreaks are very rare and
have been associated with drinking contaminated water (2) and contact with
infected animals (1). Thirty-four sporadic cases of _Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis_ infection were notified in Finland during 1996. Two
outbreaks were investigated in Finland during the 1980s whose aetiology
remains unknown (3,4).
