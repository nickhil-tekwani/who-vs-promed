A man with suspected Nipah virus was admitted at the Jawharal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) here [in Puducherry] on Monday night [17 Jun 2019]. According to sources, the man, hailing from Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu, was working in Kerala.

As he suffered from high fever, he returned to his native place and got admitted in a hospital. Since there was no improvement in his condition and he was having symptoms of Nipah [virus infection], doctors referred him to JIPMER. He was admitted to an isolation ward, and his blood samples were sent to Pune Virology Institute for confirmation.

It may be noted that another man (52), also from Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu and working at Guruvayur in Kerala, was admitted to JIPMER on 10 Jun [2019] with symptoms of Nipah. His blood samples were sent to the Virological Institute in Pune, and these have proved negative for Nipah. Doctors confirmed he was having encephalitis, and he died 2 days ago.

[Although from Tamil Nadu state, where he reported after becoming ill, the patient was apparently infected in Kerala state. The etiology of his infection is suspected to be Nipah virus, but that remains to be laboratory confirmed. If confirmed, this would be the 2nd case of Nipah virus infection in Kerala state this year (2019). Last year (2018), as of 17 Jul 2018, a total of 19 Nipah virus (NiV) cases, including 17 deaths, were reported from Kerala state: 18 of the cases were laboratory confirmed, and the deceased index case was suspected to have NiV but could not be tested. The 2018 outbreak was localized to 2 districts in Kerala state: Kozhikode and Malappuram. No new cases or deaths have been reported since 1 Jun 2018, and, as of 30 Jul 2018, human-to-human transmission of NiV has been contained in Kerala state. The exact circumstances under which this or the previous confirmed Nipah virus index case acquired their infections are not stated in the above or in previous reports, nor is it stated whether these individuals had contact with flying fox fruit bats (_Pteropus giganteus_), the reservoir hosts of Nipah virus, or fruit that the bats may have contaminated.
