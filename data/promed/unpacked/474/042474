[1] CDC report
Date: Wed 23 Mar 2011
Source: CDC, _E. coli_ Outbreak Investigations [edited]
<http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2011/O157_0311/index.html>


CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and
the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(USDA/FSIS) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7
infections. Investigators are using DNA analysis of _E. coli_ O157:H7
bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify cases of
illness that may be part of this outbreak.

As of 22 Mar 2011, 14 persons infected with the outbreak strain of
_E. coli_ serotype O157:H7 have been reported from Maryland (3 cases),
New Jersey (2 cases), North Carolina (1 case), Ohio (2 cases), and
Pennsylvania (6 cases). Reported dates of illness onset range from 10
Jan 2011 to 15 Feb 2011. Ill persons range in age from 1 to 70 years,
with a median age of 13.5 years. 79 percent are male. Among 13 ill
persons for whom information is known, 3 or 23 percent, reported being
hospitalized, and none have reported hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),
a type of kidney failure that is associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7
infections. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Collaborative investigative efforts of local, state, federal public
health and regulatory agencies have associated this outbreak with
eating Lebanon bologna. Lebanon bologna is a fermented, semi-dry
sausage. This beef product has an appearance similar to salami. In an
epidemiologic study conducted during 15-18 Mar 2011, a total of 13 ill
persons answered questions about foods consumed during the days before
becoming ill, and investigators compared their responses to those of
21 persons of similar age previously reported to state health
departments with other illnesses ("controls"). Ill persons (69
percent) were significantly more likely than controls (0 percent) to
report eating Lebanon bologna. Additionally, 4 ill persons have been
identified who purchased Seltzer Brand Lebanon bologna at 4 different
grocery store locations in 3 states before becoming ill.

Recall information
------------------
Palmyra Bologna Company, of Palmyra, Pennsylvania, is recalling
approximately 23 000 pounds of Lebanon bologna products that may be
contaminated with _E. coli_ 0157:H7. Consumers are advised to review
the USDA's FSIS Recall Press Release [see below] for a list of
recalled products and images of the product.

[Lebanon bologna (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon_bologna>) is
a type of cured, smoked, fermented, semi-dry sausage. This all-beef
sausage is similar in appearance and texture to salami, although it is
somewhat darker colored. Lebanon bologna has a distinct tangy flavor,
more so than other fermented meat products such as summer sausage.
Hardwood smoking imparts a strong smoky flavor to the traditionally
prepared versions of the product.

Originating with the Pennsylvania Dutch, Lebanon bologna was
developed with heavy influence coming from slow-cured sausages of
Europe. It is commonly available throughout Pennsylvania and is often
served as a luncheon meat. It is named for the Lebanon Valley of
Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, where it is most commonly produced.
There are 4 versions: original, sweet, double smoked, and honey
smoked.

The thermal processing of Lebanon bologna typically does not exceed
120 deg F (49 deg C) due to undesirable quality effects high heat has
on the final product. Because it is not cooked to a higher
temperature, other ingredients and processes are used to control
microbial growth. Fermenting the product to a low pH coupled with the
inclusion of curing salts inhibits the outgrowth of pathogenic
bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ and _Salmonella typhimurium_, as
well as spoilage organisms.

Typically, the blended and stuffed beef sausage is aged for 10 days
prior to smoking to enrich lactic acid bacteria and allow for the
reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Fermentation occurs during the
smoking step, which can last for up to 4 days. A 1 pH unit (or more)
decline is observed during this step, as well as the development of
nitrosohemochrome, the pigment responsible for the red color of cured
meats.

Although it has not been reported as yet that the outbreak organism
has been isolated from the alleged vehicle (a real "smoking" smoked
salami), the epidemiologic evidence seems strong. It is apparent that
the processes spelled out above did not adequately eradicate the
contamination. - Mod. LL]
