Foot and Mouth update: epidemiology report, changes to movement
restrictions and latest test results
-----------------------------------------------------
Debby Reynolds, Chief Veterinary Officer, has today set out the following:
- the latest Epidemiological Report;
- changes to current restrictions on animal movement in support of welfare; and
- the standing down of vaccination teams, provided that initial
negative results from the current Temporary Control Zones (TCZs) in
Kent and Surrey are followed by negative results from the final tests.
The latest Epidemiology Report on the outbreak of Foot and Mouth
Disease [FMD] in Surrey was published today [see item 2]. It
concludes that the risk of disease spread outside of the Surrey
Protection and Surveillance Zones is now very low. This conclusion is
an important part of the totality of the veterinary assessment of the
current disease situation. Based on that assessment a package of
changes will be introduced alongside the current restrictions on
animal movements, which should alleviate some specific welfare
problems. These have been developed in partnership with industry.
Based on the overall risk assessment, including the findings of the
Epidemiology Report, and provided initial negative tests from the
TCZs are confirmed and there is no change in the disease situation,
the Chief Veterinary Officer will stand down vaccination teams from
their current level of alert. Teams could be stood up again in 5
days, if needed.
Government and industry will continue to work closely in partnership.
The Secretary of State, Hilary Benn yesterday met key food chain
stakeholders. Prior to the meeting a core group of stakeholders
worked in partnership with Defra to develop joint proposals for
changes to movement restrictions to alleviate specific welfare
problems.
Those attending recognised these problems created by the restrictions
and supported the proposal to make changes. They also recognised the
need to provide businesses with greater certainty on the likely
timeline for future changes, so that they can plan more effectively.
Key dates were discussed in a timeline leading to disease-free
status, and they agreed to work closely together over the coming
weeks to deliver it, while recognising that the timeline is subject
to no further cases being confirmed.
Debby Reynolds said, "We are grateful to the industry for its
tremendous help to date in support of efforts to control this
outbreak. Vigilance and biosecurity remain top priorities for all. We
understand the industry's need for information about likely next
steps to help manage the pressures and to plan going forward. In
light of the present disease situation and the assessment today of
the very low risk of disease spread outside the Surveillance Zone, we
have agreed with stakeholders a set of changes to movement
restrictions designed to alleviate the most acute welfare problems.
These changes form the next step in our ongoing risk-based, staged
approach to movement controls. They will be informed by any changes
in the disease situation."
The core group of stakeholders said, "In developing this work with
Defra we have been acutely aware of the pressures which individual
businesses across the food chain are facing. It is hoped that this
clear package of movement changes will help alleviate some of the
immediate welfare problems. We are hopeful that the timetable will
give businesses some basis upon which to plan and make decisions.
"Vigilance and compliance with the new and existing rules are of
critical importance. Failure by anyone to do this puts at risk both
the timetable and therefore our ability to return to normality."
Notes to editors:
1. Details of the changes to animal movement restrictions, and the
latest Epidemiology Report, can be found at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/>.
2. The current Protection and Surveillance Zones remain. The exact
details of these measures can be found on the Defra website at:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/>. Disease surveillance is ongoing.
3. Where farmers are facing acute welfare problems as a result of
movement restrictions they can contact the RSPCA Farm Welfare Hotline
0870 7538 333
4. The core group of stakeholders is comprised of senior individuals
from the following organisations, attending in a personal capacity:
Ben Messer Bennetts (Livestock Auctioneers Association)
Duff Burrell (National Beef Association)
Kevin Pearce (NFU)
Peter Morris (National Sheep Association)
Stewart Houston (British Pig Executive)
Stuart Roberts (British Meat Processors Association)
5. The Defra public helpline is currently operating from 6am-10pm.
The public should call: 08459 335577.
6. Advice from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) is that FMD is not
a public health threat.
7. FMD is a disease of cattle and very few human cases have ever been
recorded even though the disease is endemic in animals in many parts
of the world including Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South
America. FMD only crosses the species barrier from cattle to human
with very great difficulty. The last human case reported in Britain
occurred in 1966. The disease in humans, in the very rare cases that
have occurred, is mild, short-lived and requires no medical treatment.

FMD 2007. Summary Epidemiology Report
Situation at 16:00 Mon 13 Aug 2007, day 10 of the outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------
[The Interim Epidemiology Report includes the following paragraphs:
Executive Summary
Descriptive Epidemiology FMD2007/0001 (IP 1)
Descriptive Epidemiology FMD2007/0002 (IP 2)
Hypotheses for source
RISK OF SPREAD
-Protection Zone
-Risk of spread out of PZ and SZ
-Risk of spread out of Surrey (other than out of PZ/SZ)
Wider Surveillance Modelling
Forward look to assess risk of further outbreaks
4 Annexes
We hereby reproduce the 1st (Executive summary) and the last (Forward
look to assess risk of further outbreaks) paragraphs. For the full
report, subscribers are referred to the above URL. - Mod.AS]
A. Executive summary
--------------------
1. A total of 2 confirmed cases of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) have
been confirmed in Surrey since 9 pm on Fri 3 Aug 2007.
2. The strain of virus has been identified as Type O1 BFS, which is
the strain recovered from the 1967 FMD epidemic in Great Britain.
This strain is used by both of the enterprises on the nearby
Pirbright site. Current evidence indicates that this site is the
likely source of infection for the outbreak.
3. The potential mechanism of spread from the Pirbright site is under
investigation; possibilities include
- Windborne spread, as winds were in a suitable direction at times
during the risk period
- Via effluent released from the laboratory, possibly aided by local flooding
- Deliberate or accidental fomite transmission from one of the
laboratory containment areas
4. Investigations to date have revealed little evidence for windborne
spread, and are currently focusing on escape via contaminated flood
water or contaminated articles such as clothing, equipment or
vehicles.
5. Investigations into whether the source for IP 2 was the Pirbright
site, or IP 1, continue.
6. Review of the risk of spread of infection to the rest of the
country, through movements of cattle, pigs or silently infected sheep
out of the PZ/SZ during the risk period is considered to be very low.
B. Forward look to assess risk of further outbreaks
---------------------------------------------------
52. This outbreak of FMD has very distinctive features which assist
in both the establishment of the important epidemiological timelines
and in the control of the disease. These can be summarised as follows:
- A known point source of infection, that is the Pirbright site, and
a precise period of the likely release of the virus.
- Detailed clinical examination of, and laboratory testing of
samples from, all susceptible species on premises slaughtered as
infected premises and on suspicion (SOS) of FMD disease or infection.
This has resulted in an unusual precision of both the time of
infection of IPs and the period of infectiousness of the IPs, which
provides additional reassurance for the estimate of the risk of
further cases of FMD.
53. In addition, the area in which infection of commercial farms
occurred is of very low susceptible population density and movements
of susceptible species from the farms in the 'at risk' area was
notably low.
54. Slaughter of all stock on IP 2 was completed on 7 Aug 2007 and
preliminary cleansing and disinfection was completed on 9 Aug 2007.
This is the last date on which virus is known to have been present in
the field. It is unlikely that this virus could have been transmitted
to other holdings after the imposition of the livestock movement ban
and PZ restrictions on 3 Aug 2007, as this premises lies within the
PZ. The possibility of an incubation period of up to 14 days from
exposure to virus, suggest the latest date by which new cases could
arise from the last IP is 23 Aug 2007.
55. In view of the low number of movements of susceptible stock to
other holdings either within Surrey or elsewhere (as most movements
are direct to slaughter), and the intensive surveillance that has
been in place since the 1st confirmation of disease, it is unlikely
that FMD is present elsewhere in Great Britain.

[According to the information provided by the CVO in the above news
release, the initial results from the tests from the 2 new temporary
control zones established around the suspected outbreaks in Kent
(cattle) and Surrey (sheep), are negative. The final confirmation of
these negative results is expected.
The interim epidemiology report includes, among others, comparative
data from the 2001 outbreak, underlining and explaining the
differences between them. Recommended reading. - Mod.AS].
