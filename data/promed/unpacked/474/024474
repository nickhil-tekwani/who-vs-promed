Thank you for posting the news release regarding the recent discovery of canine distemper cases in California desert kit foxes. Thanks also to the moderator for the useful comments.

I wanted to provide a brief update: The CA Dept of Fish and Game and collaborators at the University of California Davis, Cornell University, University of Illinois, and the Integral Ecology Research Center are attempting to determine the molecular identity of the canine distemper virus infection in this species. To date, the virus has been isolated from the tissues of several carcasses at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center at the Cornell University School of Veterinary Medicine and molecular characterization is planned at University of Illinois School of Veterinary Medicine.
