2548 goats have been destroyed so far in the combat against Q fever;
this was reported by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Agriculture.
During each of the last 3 days, 3 holdings were emptied, totaling 9
farms, mainly in the south and southeast of the country. Today [Thu
24 Dec 2009], the work was discontinued, to be restarted Monday [28
Dec 2009], again handling 3 farms per day, pausing during the New Year's days.

According to the spokesman, there are no details to report. "It went
well, but it was sad."

It is not so that fewer animals need to be killed in the infected
premises. Minister Gerda Verburg (Agriculture) received a negative
opinion of the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) upon her query of
whether repeated testing of individual animals on infected farms
could enable a distinction between infected and non-infected animals
in order to spare the latter. The CVI said that such testing will not
provide a complete assurance of the animals' freedom of infection; on
top of that, such testing is not performable, since the lambing is
soon to start. Consequently, the announced measures remain in force,
as Verburg informed the House.

On the Ministry's website, Verburg reported how depressing it was
that healthy, pregnant animals should be killed. "It cuts deep into
my soul." According to her, such an event had never happened in Dutch
history. However, according to the Minister, the culling of all
pregnant animals on infected farms is currently the only way to
drastically decrease the spread of the Q fever bacteria in 2010.

The culling of the 61 infected farms began Monday [21 Dec 2009] in
Vinkel, Tilburg and Horssen, because the animals there were soon to
start lambing. "I hope very much that not many more new infected
farms are to be found and that the number of Q-fever patients in 2010
will be limited. We need to see the light at the end of the tunnel,
and the industry needs a sustainable and healthy future prospect,"
said Verburg.

[The above report includes a useful map, demonstrating the locations
of human cases and infected animal farms in the Netherlands.

It will be interesting to obtain information on the role of
vaccination in suppressing Q fever dissemination, as viewed by CDI.

On 24 Dec 2009, Minister Verburg sent the Dutch Parliament a detailed
reply, addressing several questions regarding the press coverage of
the culling operation. She confirmed that, in agreement with the
industry, a temporary limitation of such coverage on the affected
farms was applied, as expressed in a letter she sent to the Society
of Chief Editors on 20 Dec 2009.

The above letter, as well as the Minister's letters to the Parliament
issued on an almost daily basis explaining the recent decisions of
the Ministry of Agriculture regarding Q fever, are available on the
Ministry's website. All decisions have been supported by written
advise from CVI, provided as replies to detailed questions from the
Dutch CVO, Dr Christianne Bruschke. Such replies were appended to the
Minister's letters to the Parliament of 16, 18 and 23 Dec 2009. See
