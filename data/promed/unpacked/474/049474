Environmental officials have dismissed claims of an outbreak of goat
influenza in the [Umm al Qaywayn] emirate following a rash of
unexplained deaths in herds.

Sultan Abdullah Alwan, the executive director for agricultural and
livestock affairs at the Ministry of Environment and Water, said there
were no livestock deaths connected to any influenza cases and that
instances of goats dying in Umm al Qaywayn should not be exaggerated.
His statement came after some livestock owners claimed dozens of goats
had died recently because of an unknown disease.

Mr Alwan said "weather changes, like a rise in temperature," could be
behind the deaths and said it was not an epidemic. He also cautioned
livestock owners not to mix sick animals with healthy ones, and
encouraged routine visits from a veterinarian. He said the UAE was
free of livestock diseases.

Some animal keepers are not convinced. [One of them] said she had lost
36 goats in the last 2 months. She claimed all of the animals had been
vaccinated. "I have been in livestock for the last 25 years, but not
at any time did I see this," she said. "The goats just start coughing,
stop eating, and then go into a coma and die."

She said a veterinarian had visited her farm twice, diagnosed the
goats, and recommended medication. [She] said she had to buy some of
the medications from neighbouring emirates and urged the ministry to
make more drugs available to cover the whole emirate.

[Another farmer] said he had lost 55 goats, all of which had been
vaccinated by a ministry veterinarian. At one time, he had 150 goats,
but now has fewer than 100. "I believe there is something wrong." He
said there is a need for more veterinarians in the emirate.

[If the disease signs described in the affected goats are accurate,
namely "coughing and death", several infectious diseases deserve
consideration. These include primarily PPR (peste des petits
ruminants), a disease known to be endemic in the UAE. Several other
diseases are also potential candidates, particularly contagious
caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP; reportedly, never seen in the UAE), as
well as endemic diseases such as pasteurellosis and lungworms. Goat
pox, FMD, and contagious ecthyma could lead to pneumonia as a
complication.

Details on the goat vaccinations which are routinely applied in the
UAE and results of clinical and lab investigations are requested. -

[The die-off reported in 2001 (see ProMED archives below) showed
different symptoms: diarrhea and blisters. No final diagnosis was
found by ProMED. - Mod.JW]
