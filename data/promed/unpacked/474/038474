An outbreak of splenic fever [anthrax] at a farm in Sweden has mystified local farmers and authorities.

Over the past 2 weeks, a total of 9 animals have died at the Omberg farm in southeastern Sweden after being infected with splenic fever, a serious bacterial infection also known as anthrax. The latest animal to succumb was a horse. However, the cause of the outbreak is still unknown. "It's a pretty pressured situation, especially for the animal owners," said Catrin Molander, chief of staff at the Swedish Board of Agriculture. She added: "It's not easy seeing your animals and your business being hit by this."

Cattle at the affected and surrounding farms have been vaccinated in order to prevent the disease from spreading further.

[The reports of this cluster of outbreaks came in dribs & drabs. This last report, along with the adjusted number in the primary OIE report suggest, to me very clearly, that this is a classical tabanid fly assisted series of outbreaks of neighboring farms. Classically these occur following an index outbreak where reporting is delayed and when seen there are a number of sick and dead animals. In this case it started with 3 dead animals which soon became 7 and then 9 -- quite enough to load up a fair number of female tabanids, which would look for their next blood meal in the neighbouring herds. This can reach out at least 5-10 km [approx. 3-6 mi], sometimes further. And remember, Warmblood horses are very large and therefore would be a choice target for the flies attracted to "black bodies", a.k.a. dark shade + CO2. 300 m is an easy target recognition for tabanids.

If you have not witnessed such an event before it can be very confusing as to how to explain what you are seeing. But once experienced you will then always remember how important it is to vaccinate your stock in late spring if only to protect your neighbours. Because, if they ever realized that you had had an outbreak which involved half-a-dozen head and then their stock were infected, they would call their lawyer to recover the cost from you. Vaccinating your livestock protects your animals and is lawyer insurance and protection. - Mod.MHJ
