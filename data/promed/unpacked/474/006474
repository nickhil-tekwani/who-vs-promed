Madison County [Indiana] Health Department officials are discouraged with the early participation in the needle exchange program. Stephanie Grimes, public health coordinator for the county department, told Board of Health members on Wednesday [7 Oct 2015] that 3000 syringes have been distributed in the 1st 2 months of the program to combat the spread of hepatitis C.

"We have had 12 1st-time and 2 repeat visitors," she said. "We're a little discouraged by the numbers and participants. The state feels the program has been successful." Grimes said half of the clients wanting to exchange needles through the program have been at the mobile sites and half at the designated locations. The department receives daily calls inquiring about the program, she said.

The needle exchange program was established to prevent the spread of hepatitis C and HIV. Both infections can be contracted by contact with the blood of an infected person. Health officials say the hepatitis C and HIV infections are a result of needle sharing by drug users.

Kellie Kelley, public information officer for the county department, said the number of hepatitis C cases in the county continues to increase.

In 2013, there were 70 new cases of hepatitis C identified in Madison County and the number increased to 130 in 2014 and the current rates will match or surpass 2014's levels, she said. Through September [2015] there have been 154 cases of hepatitis C in the county.

Officials in northeastern Indiana's Allen County have taken a 1st step toward creating a needle exchange to combat the county's growing hepatitis C cases. The Fort Wayne-Allen County Board of Health unanimously approved a resolution Monday, 5 Oct 2015, calling for a needle-exchange program to slow the spread of the disease among intravenous drug users.

Allen County has had about 270 new hepatitis C cases during the 1st 9 months of 2015. That's more than in any of the past 3 years.

The Journal Gazette reports the health department must next hold a public hearing and get support from elected local officials for the needle-exchange proposal. Needle-exchange requests need the approval of Indiana's health commissioner under a law passed in response to an HIV outbreak among IV drug users in southeastern Indiana.

[Needle exchange programs and availability of rehabilitation programs are vital in the approach to injection drug use-associated infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis B as well as hepatitis C. - Mod.LL]

[While treatment is expensive, it is cost-effective compared with other healthcare expenses. (See, for example, Linas et al. Ann Intern Med. 2015;162(9):619-629. http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleID=2212248.) In addition, there is an as-yet unquantified public health benefit in treatment because it reduces the likelihood of transmission to others. - Mod.LM
