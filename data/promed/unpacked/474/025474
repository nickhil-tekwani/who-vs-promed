[1] North Carolina (Buncombe County): beaver, human exposure

A local woman is undergoing rabies treatment after she was bitten by a beaver last week [week of 4 Jul 2016].

The 67-year-old woman was paddleboarding on Beaver Lake [Asheville, North Carolina] on [Fri 8 Jul 2016] at the time of the bite. She was taken to Mission for emergency treatment.

Police say the beaver was caught a day later and euthanized.

Results for the rabies test from the Western Veterinary Diagnostic Lab will be returned on [Tue 12 Jul 2016], and the warden says Lake View Park is closed until further notice.

The warden reminds residents that seeing a beaver in the middle of the day is not normal and you should stay away from one if seen.

[2] North Carolina (Orange County): skunk, dog

An unvaccinated dog was surrendered for euthanasia when a skunk found outside a Hillsborough [Orange County, North Carolina] home last week tested positive for rabies.

The skunk was Orange County's 3rd confirmed rabies case this year [2016]. Last year the county had a total of 10 cases and 23 the year before [2014].

The county will hold its next USD 10 rabies vaccination clinic [Thu 21 Jul 2026], at the Orange County Animal Services Center in Chapel Hill.

The latest case happened [Wed 6 Jul 2016] when residents in Hillsborough saw their 2 dogs with a skunk inside a fenced yard. They removed the dogs from the situation and called Animal Control to come get the skunk for rabies testing.

One of the 2 dogs had not yet been vaccinated against rabies, county officials said, and under state law it must be killed or quarantined for 4 months at the owner's expense.

The other dog was currently vaccinated against rabies and received the required booster shot within the allotted time frame. When there is "a reasonable suspicion of exposure," a dog, cat, or ferret with a current vaccination or a documented vaccination history must receive a booster shot within 96 hours (4 days) of the exposure, according to a county news release.

A county nurse has spoken with the residents to evaluate their own risk, since they had contact with the dogs after the incident, according to the release.

"Prevention is the best measure for effective rabies control for pets and people alike," said Bob Marotto, director of Animal Services. "Ensuring cats, dogs, and ferrets are current on their rabies vaccinations is one of the most important responsibilities of a pet owner, since it can quite literally be the difference between life and death for their pet."

Skunks are not the dominant host species of rabies and typically contract it from a host species, most often the raccoon, in what is called a "spillover effect." The other species that are most susceptible to getting rabies from raccoons are dogs and cats, groundhogs, and foxes.

The other host species of rabies in the region is bats. Of the few cases of rabies in humans in the United States in recent years, most have been traced to bats. If an incident involving a bat or other possible rabid animal occurs people should call Animal Control at 919-942-7387 or 911.

Orange County holds low-cost clinics throughout the year. At the [11 Jun 2016] clinic, 48 dogs and 61 cats were vaccinated against rabies, bringing the year's total to 383 pets.

[3] Maryland (Anne Arundel County): cat, human exposure

The county Health Department is asking to be called by anyone who may have come in contact with a cat, found in Glen Burnie [Anne Arundel County] that has tested positive for rabies.

The grey and black tiger shorthair tabby was found on [Thu 7 Jul 2016] near Hamlen Road in the Munroe Gardens community, according to a Health Department release.

Anyone who had contact with a stray, wild, or unfamiliar cat in that area should immediately call the county Department of Health at 410-222-7256, Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm, and 443-481-3140 after business hours.

Also, anyone whose pet was bitten or scratched by a cat should call County Animal Control at 410-222-8900.

Rabies is spread by the bite or scratch of an infected animal, such as a cat, raccoon, fox, or bat. It is also spread when the infected animal's saliva comes in contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, or open cut of a person or another animal.

Rabies is a potentially fatal disease and preventive treatment through vaccines must be started as soon as possible by anyone who handled or fed the cat.

The Health Department asks county residents to not feed stray or wild animals or leave food dishes outside. Pet owners should also keep their animals' rabies vaccinations current.
