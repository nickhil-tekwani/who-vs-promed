Sleeping sickness reported in Luanda
------------------------------------
A total of 76 cases of sleeping sickness were diagnosed in the 1st
half of this year [2011] in the 6 endemic provinces of the country --
that is, Malanje, Uije, Kwanza Norte, Kwanza Sul, Bengo, and Zaire.

According to the national supervisor of the Institute of Combat and
Control Trypanosomiasis (ICCT), Daniel Mafuta, the patients were in
the 32 thousand people tested in 220 diagnostic centers and 6 teams.

The 6 mobile teams carried out a campaign tracking in June [2011],
where 20 000 people were examined, and 7 new cases of sleeping
sickness diagnosed.

The teams worked in the districts of Calculation and Kahango (Bengo),
San Pedro of Kilembe and the municipality of Lucala (Kwanza Norte),
Kizemga (Malanje) Kimari and Lukunga (Uije) and NPAL and Lufico
(Zaire).

Under a campaign against the tsetse fly which started in March and
will end in August [2011], 6518 traps were placed and captured 1 341
072 flies.

This campaign is associated with fumigation and spraying areas hit,
or infested by the tsetse fly.

[Programme Against African Trypanosomosis
(PAAT)http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/paat/home.html):

Trypanosomosis affects both people and animals and occurs in 37
sub-Saharan countries covering more than 9 million square kilometers
[3 474 919 square miles], an area which corresponds approximately to
one third of the Africa's total land area. The infection threatens an
estimated 60 million people and about 50 million head of cattle.

Currently, between 50 000 and 70 000 people are estimated to be
infected. Every year, African trypanosomosis causes about 3 million
deaths in cattle while about 35 million doses of trypanocidal drugs
are administered. The economic losses in cattle production alone are
in the range of USD 1.0 - 1.2 billion. A ponderated evaluation
extrapolated for the total tsetse-infested lands values total losses,
in terms of agricultural gross domestic product, at USD 4.75 billion
per year.
