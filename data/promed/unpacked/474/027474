Aleksey Ermolov, a Head of the Press office of the Ministry on Emergency
Situations in Kyrgyzia reported that some scores of the cattle domestic
animals were registered with the foot-and-mouth disease in Manassk district
(rayon), Talassk province (oblast) in Kyrgyzia. In the region a mass
anti-foot-and-mouth disease vaccination [programme of about 30 000 cattle
is being conducted in order to prevent the epidemic spreading. A. Ermolov
noted that the preliminary data indicated that the outbreak appeared
because of contact between animals from Kyrgyzia and the neighbouring
Kazakhstan (Dzhambul oblast), where some cattle were infected with
foot-and-mouth disease.
