TULAREMIA, SPAIN. FRESHWATER CRAYFISH TO HUMAN
On 4 Aug 1998 suspected evidence of an outbreak [of unknown etiology in
the province of Cuenca (Castilla-La Mancha region-SPAIN) was communicated
to health authorities. [Cases had the common circumstance of having
handled freshwater crayfish from the same river, both fishers and cooks as
well. At first _Mycobacterium marinum_ was suspected based on the skin
granuloma-like lesions.
Last 7 Sep 1998, the Centro Nacional de Microbiologia of Instituto de
Salud Carlos III, showed the serological results obtained from 10 samples
from affected patients, with significant positive serology against
_Francisella tularensis_. The existence of seroconversion (only in one
patient) and very high titers for the rest, besides clinical findings and
compatible exposition antecedents, showed the presence of tularemia.
Sixteen people have been affected (10 male and 6 female) each of them
having suffered small wounds when handling live freshwater crayfish. Main
symptoms were: Hand finger ulceration (100%), adenopathies (81%)-axilar
(61%), elbow (15%), axilar+elbow (23%)-; headache (56%), vomiting (25%) and
anorexia (25%).
The average age was 58, range 38-72 years. Occupations were housewives (6),
retired people (3) and building worker (1). All of them had been handling
freshwater crayfish (_Procambarus clarkii_) with the same origin: Mayor
River in Moncalvillo de Huete (Cuenca).
The exposure period was between 13 Jul 1998 and 30 Jul 1998. The
incubation period average was 6.6 days (range 0-21 days)
Fishing has been forbidden in the zone and people told about tularemia and
its prevention.
Samples of water and mud have been taken as well, with no results up to now.

[We would be interested in the comments of experts concerning the
likelihood that crayfish have played a role in this outbreak, or
whether it does indeed sound like tularemia.
Up to the present, tularemia has only been known to be transmitted by
rabbit ticks (F.t. biovar _tularensis_), or in a rodent-mosquito
cycle (F.t. biovar _palaearctica_), but we hear that contaminated
water may also contribute to transmission of this disease.
It is notable that seroconversion was demonstrated in only one
patient (although it is possible that acute phase sera were not
available in the others), and we wonder what kind of serological test
was used, what specificity it has, and whether biovar identification
has been made - Mod.ES/JW
