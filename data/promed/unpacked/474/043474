Influenza update - 341 (based on data up to 28 Apr 2019)
-------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary

In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity decreased overall.

- In North America and Europe, influenza activity was low overall.
- In North Africa, influenza detections were low across reporting countries.
- In western Asia, influenza activity decreased overall, with the exception of Saudi Arabia, where activity remained elevated.
- In East Asia, decreasing influenza activity was reported in some countries.
- In southern Asia, influenza activity was low overall.
- In the Caribbean, Central American countries, and the tropical countries of South America, influenza and RSV activity were low in general.
- In West and Middle Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries. Influenza activity continued to be reported from Eastern Africa, although in decreasing trend with predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 followed by A(H3N2) detections.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza detections increased in southern Australia and South Africa. The influenza activity in South America remained at interseasonal levels.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 120 countries, areas, or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 15 Apr 2019 to 28 Apr 2019 (data as of 10 May 2019 04:05:29 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 78 989 specimens during that time period. Of these, 11 262 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 6777 (60.2%) were typed as influenza A and 4485 (39.8%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 1111 (32.3%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2330 (67.7%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 89 (2.6%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 3285 (97.4%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[2] Australia: seasonal activity
Date: Thu 16 May 2019
Source: 9News, Australian Associated Press (AAP) report [edited]
https://www.9news.com.au/national/australia-news-influenza-death-toll-rises-queensland-south-australia/d1d57af1-bafe-4e16-92a7-1e27e5d37f87


Australia is in the grip of a horror flu season, with the virus killing 25 people in Queensland and 17 in South Australia so far this year [2019]. Health authorities have again urged people to get a flu vaccination, as experts predict 4000 Australians will die from influenza in 2019. Queensland's peak flu season usually runs from July to October, but the state is on track to surpass the 43 deaths recorded in 2018.

"We are seeing a lot more cases of flu this year [2019], around 3.5 times more than we would expect to see at this time of year," Queensland's chief health officer Dr. Jeannette Young said. "We're not yet into the flu season, but we expect that will shortly arrive, so it is really important people get vaccinated now."

Dr. Young said those who have died this year [2019] were not within the at-risk category, which includes people with complex medical conditions, indigenous Australians, and the young. "People who are perfectly fit and healthy can also develop complications; that's why everyone should really consider getting the vaccine," she said.

Queensland health minister Steven Miles said the number of influenza cases is putting a strain on the state's hospitals. Down in South Australia, 12 339 cases of the flu have been recorded for 2019, with 17 deaths reported to health authorities. Across the state, 18 nursing homes have been closed to all visitors since the beginning of this year [2019].

Experts predict about 4000 people will die from complications due to influenza this year [2019] as the number of infections increase again following a quiet 2018. There have already been 40 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza in 2019, almost 3 times the number recorded at the same time in recent years.

Experts from the Immunisation Coalition have urged people to get vaccinated now so they are protected during the winter flu peak. "What we are really concerned about is that these very large numbers don't continue on through winter," medical virologist Prof. William Rawlinson said.

He said the number of flu cases could end up being the highest since 2017, when a quarter of a million laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded. The 2017 influenza season was the worst since the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Last year [2018] there were 58 570 confirmed influenza cases in Australia, although the laboratory numbers do not show the full extent of the flu because most people do not get tested.

Prof. Rawlinson predicted about 2 million people would get the flu this year [2019], as typically occurred in a busy influenza year. "It's likely this will be the highest number since 2017, although I'd be very concerned that it may be higher because we haven't seen so much in 2018."

The Immunisation Coalition chairman, Prof Robert Booy, said there has been a sustained and rising summer and autumn surge [in influenza cases] that is continuing to increase. "The best explanation is that 2018 was so quiet that we have reduced community immunity, so there are more people who are vulnerable to catching infection and therefore transmitting infection," he said.

While the latest ABS statistics showed 1200 people died due to influenza in 2017, Prof Booy said modelling showed the actual number of deaths on average each season was about 3000-4000. "We've got a very busy early season, but it's nothing like the peak that we had in 2017," Prof Booy said.

What's behind the surge?
Health experts say one explanation for the high number of cases is 2 different influenza A viruses that affect different age groups are circulating at the same time. "One's more likely to affect children and young adults, and the other affects old people, but they're both around so everybody's going to be impacted," Griffith University immunisation expert Professor Paul Van Buynder told The Courier-Mail.

Dr Young said it was too early to tell if the vaccine in circulation could fend off this year's strain of the flu. A majority of cases this year [2019] are influenza A viruses, with only a few cases of influenza B.

[The elevated influenza activity being reported from Australia seems to be a repeat of the 2017 surge, with high risk groups especially vulnerable to severe outcomes. Administration of the annual vaccine as early as possible would be helpful in improving the immunity levels in the community, presuming it's a good match to the circulating influenza A and B subtypes. - Mod.UBA
