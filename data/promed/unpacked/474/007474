Pakistan has begun culling over 21 000 imported Australian sheep after tests showed they were diseased, a media report said Monday [17 Sep 2012].

Sindh government officials decided Sunday [16 Sep 2012] to cull more than 21 000 imported Australian sheep and the process of killing the animals and burying them started late at night, reported Dawn from Karachi.

The government took the decision after reports from a 2nd laboratory confirmed that the animals were diseased.

"We have culled about 150 sheep so far. The step has been taken after the animals were found suffering from highly contagious diseases. Infections could spread in our environment if the animals were allowed to live," Abdul Hafeez Shaikh from the livestock department said.

The sheep were being buried in a 15-foot-deep [4.6 m] ditch after being slaughtered.

Syed Abid Ali Shah, a senior official, said the sheep had got foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], besides having bacterial infection [see comment].

"There is no option left in the public interest but to cull all animals because 2 laboratory reports have confirmed that they are diseased," he said.

The sheep were recently offloaded [in Sindh]. Parts of the same consignment were also delivered to Qatar and Oman.

The authorities in Bahrain rejected the shipment on account of the animals' sickness.

Dawn cited media reports that said the consignment was brought to Karachi instead of being taken back to Australia. It was bought here by a meat company and the sheep were being kept at its farms in Razzakabad area with other animals meant for slaughter.

Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf directed the Sindh government to hold inquiry into the import of infected sheep at the Port Qasim. The prime minister desired that findings of the inquiry may be communicated for his consideration within 7 days.

[In previous Pakistani media reports addressing the fate of the shipped sheep consignment, 4 pathogens were mentioned as reasons for culling: a viral one, contagious ecthyma (scabby mouth), and 3 bacteria, namely _Salmonella_ (no subspecies or serovar named), _E. coli_, and Actinomyces. (see ProMED-mail posting 20120917.1297467).

The current report on the detection of FMD, an OIE-listed, highly contagious viral disease, in the imported sheep adds weight to the decision to cull, provided the causative virus strain is an exotic one. Genotyping of the isolate is in state to uncover its origin, with 2 main possibilities: a local infection (plausible since the sheep were, as reported, kept on farms in Pakistan with other animals meant for slaughter), or an ex-Pakistani origin. In case the virus is not an endemic strain, several ex-Pakistani possible locations of origin may be considered: Bahrain, from where the consignment had been redirected to Pakistan; Qatar or Oman, where -- reportedly -- parts of the same consignment were delivered; or an unknown other source along the way.

The FMD situation in Pakistan, particularly in Punjab, has been exhaustively reviewed in the column "Burning issue" published in Pakistan's daily The Nation on Sun 16 Sep 2012, from where the following excerpts are copied.

"FMD: a threat to dairy industry! by Dr Khushi Muhammad, Dr Farhat Nazir Awan, Dr Akram Munir, and Dr Athar Khan.

T"he province of Punjab is the most populous area in terms of animal and human populations. At present, the population of cattle and buffaloes in Punjab is 18.1 and 21.2 million. Over 71 percent of the buffalo population in Punjab is kept in irrigated areas, which contributes around 70 percent of Pakistan's total milk production. The majority of buffalo is reared by small dairy farmers, who generally own 5 to 8 buffalo heads for supplying milk in the urban market. However, the benefits from the livestock are hampered by many factors such as good supply of feed and fodder, poor husbandry practices, and occurrence of infectious diseases like FMD.

"FMD, commonly known as 'moun khur' in the villages of Punjab, is a viral problem that affects cloven-footed animals, including cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats.

"The disease is prevailing in all the districts of Punjab, which might be due to the movement of infected livestock from other provinces and neighbouring countries, non-availability or non-accessibility of veterinary health services and veterinary inputs by the livestock keepers of remote areas. Punjab has a relatively large animal health infrastructure in the public sector. The existing public service for animal health and livestock extension are weak and are constrained by poor mobility and lack of operational funding and training. The Veterinary Services have neither the power to enforce movement standstills when outbreaks take place, nor sufficient manpower or vaccine for routine use. Moreover, common village ponds and entry of new animals to the herd without adopting any precautionary measures to check the introduction of infection are the other plausible factors enhancing incidence of the disease in animal population. The incidence of disease is comparatively higher in the canal-irrigated areas such as Lahore, Multan, Gujranwala, and Faisalabad divisions. These areas constitute an important milk production zone with a relatively higher population of elite dairy animals.

"The incidences of the outbreaks increase gradually following the post-monsoon period. The greatest number of outbreaks is observed during the winter season, from December to February. Dry weather and dry wind with low temperature and moderate relative humidity during winter months might be the cause of rapid propagation of FMD virus among the susceptible animals.

"A recent study conducted in Punjab showed that this disease caused a loss of Rs 4615 (USD 48.7948) per buffalo and with 10 percent incidence, the total buffalo affected with this disease are numbered at 2.12 million and the total loss is estimated at Rs 9784 million [about USD 103.4 million]."

The outcome of the investigation, preferably including results of genotyping performed on the FMD virus strain involved, is anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
