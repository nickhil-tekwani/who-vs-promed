The Press Trust of India on Tuesday [25 Aug 2009] reported that 3 more
Indian children have died of Japanese encephalitis in the northern
Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, taking the toll due to the viral
infection in the state since January [2009], to 180. The children
belonging to Kushinagar, Siddharthanagar, and Mahrajganj districts of
Uttar Pradesh died in the last 2 days at the BRD Medical College in
Gorakhpur, where a total of 20 people suffering from the viral fever
were being treated, said the report.

The deadly Japanese encephalitis fever is caused by a virus found in
pigs and transferred to humans by mosquito bites. The disease affects
the brain and causes high fever and respiratory distress.
