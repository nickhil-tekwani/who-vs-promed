Epidemiological situation
-------------------------
- Mabalako [North Kivu]: the Mabalako response teams launched a few days ago the active search for Ebola cases in the community and health facilities. As Mabalako became the main hot spot of the epidemic, it was necessary to strengthen the level of epidemiological surveillance to detect Ebola cases and isolate them as quickly as possible in order to break the chain of transmission in the community.
- [Ituri] Bunia: the new confirmed case detected in Bunia was cared for at a health post in Hoho, in the Rwampara health zone, together with a confirmed case notified on 7 Jun 2019. It had been listed as a contact but he refused to be followed and vaccinated. He died at the Bunia transit center and 23 of his contacts were listed. The new confirmed case of the day in Rwampara is also a co-patient of the confirmed case of 7 Jun 2019.
- The dignified and safe Bunia burial team was attacked by young people from the Kindia district of Bunia while trying to bury the deceased patient at the Bunia Transit Center. The youths violently assaulted the team members and took away phones and money. All the agents of the team were found and were able to return to the coordination. The body of the deceased was brought back to the transit center of Bunia.

Figures of the response
-----------------------
- 135 951 vaccinated persons
- 556 people vaccinated on 16 Jun 2019;
- persons vaccinated by health zone: 34 159 in Katwa, 26 408 in Beni, 18 496 in Butembo, 12 077 in Mabalako [total number of people vaccinated can be seen at the source URL above];
- 66 724 495 controlled people;
- 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (OHC);
- 118 contaminated health workers;
- the cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 118 (5.5% of all confirmed/probable cases), including 39 deaths.

- Sun 16 Jun 2019. Congo DR (Bunia, Ituri): 3rd confirmed case
[Media Congo Press, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-52738_bunia_troisieme_cas_d_ebola_confirme_il_s_agit_d_un_garcon_de_13_ans.html

The city of Bunia recorded [Thu 12 Jun 2019] its 3rd confirmed case of Ebola virus disease, according to the provincial coordination of the response to this disease in Ituri.

This is a 13-year-old boy, after a 14-year-old girl, who was notified on 12 Jun 2019 in the Hoho district, in the southwestern outskirts of Ituri. The 1st case was that of a 28-year-old woman from Beni who died on 6 Jun 2019 after having stayed in a health center after samples were taken to reveal the presence of Ebola. All are from the same family.

The coordination of the response intends to undertake several decontamination activities, mainly the health structures where the patients have stayed in this part of the city, epicenter of the contagion.

Vaccination of high-risk people, active search for people who come into contact with the sick are also part of the work of the response teams.

The provincial authorities, for their part, called on the population to strictly observe hygiene measures and to systematically check entries at the border with neighboring North Kivu.

- Mon 17 Jun 2019. Kenya (Kericho): false alarm
[New Vision, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report, edited]
https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1502097/kenya-reassures-public-ebola-false-alarm

Kenya sought to reassure the public and foreign visitors on [Mon 17 Jun 2019] after a suspected Ebola case, which turned out to be negative, was detected near the border with Uganda.

Uganda last week [week of 10 Jun 2019] reported 3 cases of Ebola, 2 of them fatal, among people who had been to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where an epidemic has been underway since last August [2018].

Kenyan Health Minister Sicily Kariuki said a 36-year-old woman in the western county of Kericho had fallen ill with headache, fever, and vomiting, which can also be symptoms of Ebola.

Further examination found she did not have the disease, Kariuki said at a press conference staged at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

"The Rapid Surveillance and Response Team has examined the patient, who is in stable condition, and has confirmed that she does not meet the case definition for Ebola," she said. [Subsequent lab tests reportedly confirmed the patient was negative for Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses. - Mod.JH]

"I wish to reassure all Kenyans and our visitors that we do not have any cases of Ebola."

The Ugandan cases were confirmed in a town that is more than 600 kilometres (375 miles) from the border with Kenya.

Kariuki spelled out a list of preventive measures that Kenya had already taken.

They included the installation of thermal cameras at entry points to detect people with high temperatures, as well as isolation units to host suspected cases. More than 250 health ministry workers have been deployed at entry points as part of this strategy.

The minister called on the public to be vigilant, urging anyone with Ebola-like symptoms who had travelled to affected countries to go to the nearest hospital

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Mon 17 Jun 2019. Ebola case counts spike again in DRC
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/ebola-case-counts-spike-again-drc
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Over the weekend [15-16 Jun 2019], the ministry of health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded 28 new cases of Ebola and will likely confirm another 20 new cases today [17 Jun 2019]. With nearly 50 cases in 3 days, the outbreak is experiencing another spike in activity following the discovery of cases in neighboring Uganda last week [week of 10 Jun 2019].

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Ebola dashboard, the outbreak total now stands at 2168 cases.

In addition to the newly confirmed cases, there were 19 fatalities over the weekend, including 8 that took place in the community.

In total, 1440 people have died during this outbreak, which began last August [2018] in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Another 319 suspected cases are under investigation.

The new cases come from known hotspots, including 11 in Mabalako, 4 each in Katwa and Mandima, 3 in Kalunguta, 2 in Butembo, and 1 each in Lubero, Beni, Rwampara, and Musienene.

Ring vaccination begins in Uganda
---------------------------------
The DRC confirmed late last week [week of 10 Jun 2019] that the 3-year-old brother of Uganda's index case-a 5-year-old boy who traveled with his family from the DRC to Uganda-had died from Ebola upon his arrival at the Ebola treatment center in Beni.

At this time Uganda has extradited all members of the boys' family, some of who were Congolese and some Ugandan, to the DRC. The family had been crossing the border between the 2 countries to attend the funeral of the boys' grandfather, who died from Ebola in Mabalako.

Over the weekend [15-16 Jun 2019], Uganda's minister of health, Jane Ruth Aceng, MD, tweeted that a ring vaccination had launched in Kasese district, Uganda, involving an initial 43 case contacts. Non-vaccinated frontline health and other workers were also being vaccinated.

Today [17 Jun 2019], WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, is in Uganda to meet with the ministry of health and discuss the Ebola response. Over the weekend, Tedros visited Ebola treatment centers and vaccination clinics in the DRC.

His visits came on the heels of a WHO emergency committee decision last week to hold off on recommending a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), for a 3rd time. WHO experts, including Tedros, said the decision was made because the overall risk of international spread is low, and a PHEIC designation could further hurt the DRC's economy.

2 health workers infected
-------------------------
Yesterday [16 Jun 2019], the DRC's ministry of health said 2 health workers, including one in Rwampara [Ituri] and one in Musienene [North Kivu], were newly diagnosed with Ebola. Both workers had refused vaccination with Merck's VSV-EBOV, the unlicensed Ebola vaccine currently being used in the region.

The Musienene health worker died in the community, officials said. The 2 new cases raise the total number of health workers infected during this outbreak to 118, including 39 deaths. Health workers represent 5.5% of all cases diagnosed since last August [2018].

As of yesterday [16 Jun 2019], a total of 135 395 people in the DRC and neighboring countries had been vaccinated with Merck's vaccine.

Background
----------
On 11 Jun 2019, the Ministry of Health of Uganda declared the 6th outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the country. The first case was a five-year-old child with a recent history of travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This child was one of 6 people that travelled from the DRC while still being monitored as suspect cases following a burial of the grandfather who succumbed to EVD. The child was ill by the time he crossed into Uganda and the mother took him for medical care at Kagando hospital in Kasese district with symptoms of vomiting blood, bloody diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, fatigue and abdominal pain. The child tested positive for Ebola Zaire by PCR and he later died on 11 Jun 2019. Two other members of the family, a grandmother and 3-year-old brother also tested positive for Ebola on 12 Jun 2019 and the grandmother died later the same day. The 3-year-old brother also died on the 13 Jun 2019. As of today, there is no confirmed EVD case in Uganda, however 2 suspect cases are admitted at Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit. Ninety-two (92) contacts are being followed up.

[3] Porous borders

https://theconversation.com/how-africas-porous-borders-make-it-difficult-to-contain-ebola-118719


How Africa's porous borders make it difficult to contain Ebola
--------------------------------------------------------------
Many borders between countries in the region [Africa] are porous: people are in fact much more likely to cross into a neighbouring country without even going through a formal border crossing.

People cross for all sorts of reasons. One of them is funeral rites. The spread of the cases from Guinea to Liberia and eventually to Sierra Leone centred around funeral rites.

There are a lot more informal crossings than the formal ones. The surveillance system for scanning people who are crossing into Uganda are at these formal crossings. This isn't always foolproof.

All of this means that health authorities' interventions must be strategic. They cannot physically monitor all of the informal porous borders between these countries.

What they need to do now is to mobilise all of the towns and villages that share border points with the regions of DRC that are at high risk for the export of Ebola. These villages and towns can physically monitor their individual crossing points. The local leaders and chiefs can keep a visitor log and identify a common building to keep new visitors from the DRC for observation. These logs should be reported to the regional response team daily.

The visitors can then be tracked back to their village of origin to investigate any linkage to a cluster of cases. Coordinating visitors' movements across the multiple borders will be the greatest strategic intervention. If possible, mobile application can be deployed to local youths to enter these data for real time reporting and coordination.

This strategy was employed in Liberia during the latter part of the Ebola crisis in the region and was critical in preventing the cross-border import of cases.

What is being done now to try and ensure the cases in Uganda do not lead to more Ebola infections?

Health workers are tracking the cases, finding out who the 5 people came in contact with and then taking them to a treatment centre immediately. From the recent situation report from Uganda, they have tracked down 98 contacts which is very impressive. As the average number of contacts per case is 10-12. But they have gone beyond that average.

These are very critical response steps in any epidemic. The surveillance team has to enter the mind of a typical villager from the DRC who knows they're infected and is trying to escape to relatives in Uganda. They will have to figure out whether the infected people visited traditional healers or local medicine stores. How long were they in Uganda before they were picked up? In this way they'll be able to identify all the contacts and monitor them.

ref: Glennon EE, Jephcott FL, Restif O, Wood JLN. Estimating undetected Ebola spillovers. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2019; 13(6): e0007428
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract. The preparedness of health systems to detect, treat, and prevent onward transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is central to mitigating future outbreaks. Early detection of outbreaks is critical to timely response, but estimating detection rates is difficult because unreported spillover events and outbreaks do not generate data. Using 3 independent datasets available on the distributions of secondary infections during EVD outbreaks across West Africa, in a single district (Western Area) of Sierra Leone, and in the city of Conakry, Guinea, we simulated realistic outbreak size distributions and compared them to reported outbreak sizes. These 3 empirical distributions lead to estimates for the proportion of detected spillover events and small outbreaks of 26% (range 8-40%, based on the full outbreak data), 48% (range 39-62%, based on the Sierra Leone data), and 17% (range 11-24%, based on the Guinea data). We conclude that at least half of all spillover events have failed to be reported since EVD was first recognized. We also estimate the probability of detecting outbreaks of different sizes, which is likely less than 10% for single-case spillover events. Comparing models of the observation process also suggests the probability of detecting an outbreak is not simply the cumulative probability of independently detecting any one individual. Rather, we find that any individual's probability of detection is highly dependent upon the size of the cluster of cases. These findings highlight the importance of primary health care and local case management to detect and contain undetected early stage outbreaks at source.

Author summary. Emerging infectious diseases are often not investigated in rural Africa unless outbreaks involve a sizeable number of cases. A number of different Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks have been reported in the literature and in surveillance reports since its discovery in 1976. The majority of the reports are of large outbreaks. Given the low reported rate of transmission of Ebola, and the high frequency with which cases infect no one else, one might expect most outbreaks to be very small (less than 5 people). This is the 1st study to the authors' knowledge that quantitatively estimates the number of undetected EVD outbreaks or probabilities of EVD outbreak detection by outbreak size. Although the total amount of evidence in this area is still limited, this study's main result -- that at least half of EVD outbreaks go undetected -- is consistent under many different sets of assumptions. This is the most thorough estimation of EVD outbreak detection to date and corroborates the majority of more qualitative work on EVD surveillance, suggesting greater investment in primary health care and local surveillance will be important to detect EVD outbreaks early and consistently.

[The authors of this study used data to model expected Ebola cases since 1976 and compared their model to cases actually reported. The study suggested that about half of all spillover events from animal to a person-to-person transmission cycle have gone unreported. - Mod.LK

We have known that there must be undiagnosed Ebola spillover events, since seropositive individuals have been discovered in surveys who were never even clinically ill. This study uses some modeling exercises to estimate how often that happens.

The modeling data set is from the West African epidemic, but I have always assumed that there have been small outbreaks in the Congo, probably for hundreds of years, that never became known because they were very isolated cohorts that then died out.

The article concludes that we should deploy diagnostics widely to detect such initial tiny outbreaks. But my take-away is that we should use such inferences to learn how spillover events happen from their zoonotic sources, for example, what proportion of original spillover human cases derive directly from bat reservoirs, versus the primate bushmeat trade, versus non-primate mammal amplification hosts? - Mod.LXL
