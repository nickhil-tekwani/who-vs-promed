CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in
New York and other states and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Enteritidis infections linked to Turkish pine nuts purchased
from bulk bins at Wegmans grocery stores.

Representatives from Wegmans are cooperating with public health
officials. Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of
bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be
part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national
subtyping network made up of state and local public health
laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs
molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

A total of 42 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._
Enteritidis have been reported from 6 states. The number of ill
persons identified in each state with the outbreak strain is as
follows: Arizona (1), Maryland (1), New Jersey (2), New York (26),
Pennsylvania (8), and Virginia (4).

Among 42 persons for whom information is available, illnesses began on
or after 20 Aug 2011. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 to 94
years, and the median age is 43 years old. 57 percent of patients are
female. 2 patients were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations conducted by officials in
local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory
agencies linked this outbreak to eating Turkish pine nuts sold in bulk
bins at Wegmans grocery stores. Some Turkish pine nuts were consumed
as an ingredient in prepared foods, such as Caprese salad or asparagus
with pine nuts, sold at Wegmans stores. These pine nuts are imported
from Turkey, but may not have originated there.

Among 30 ill persons for whom information is available, 19 (63
percent) reported consuming Turkish pine nuts or products containing
these pine nuts in the week before their illness began.

Early in the investigation, shopper card information was collected and
used to identify which specific products to suspect as sources of
illness. Ill persons gave permission for public health officials to
retrieve shopper card purchase information. A review of shopper card
records identified that ill persons had purchased the same type of
Turkish pine nuts from bulk bins at different locations of Wegmans
grocery stores before becoming ill.

Laboratory testing conducted by the Virginia Division of Consolidated
Laboratory Services isolated the outbreak strain of _S._ Enteritidis
from Turkish pine nuts that were purchased from bulk bins at Wegmans
stores and collected from an ill person's home. The Virginia Division
of Consolidated Laboratory Services also isolated the outbreak strain
from retail samples of Turkish pine nuts collected from a Wegmans
store where ill persons reported shopping. Laboratory testing
conducted by the New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center
Laboratory, isolated _S._ Enteritidis from 2 separate samples of
homemade pesto containing Turkish pine nuts from 2 unrelated ill
persons' homes, and from Turkish pine nuts which were purchased from
bulk bins at a Wegmans store and collected from another ill person's
home. Both samples of homemade pesto have been tested and it is
determined the organism in these pine nuts is also the outbreak
strain. Further tests on the whole bulk pine nuts are pending.

Recall information
------------------
Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. is recalling approximately 5000 lbs of
Turkish Pine Nuts sold in the Bulk Foods department of most Wegmans
stores in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland
between 1 Jul 2011 and 18 Oct 2011.

[Pine nuts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_nut) are the edible
seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus _Pinus_). About 20 species of
pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines
the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of great value as a
human food.

The source of contamination of the bulk nuts is yet to be established.
The extent of the outbreak will depend in part on the extent of
distribution of Wegmans stores and if the source of the nuts supplied
them to other establishments in the USA or elsewhere. - Mod.LL]
