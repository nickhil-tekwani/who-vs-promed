Comment on Identification of Mayaro virus
-----------------------------------------
[Re: >Serum samples ... revealed high specific anti-Mayaro virus IgM titers
... All 4 cases ... were negative ... for Venezuelan equine encephalitis
virus
IgM.< (see first ref. above).
Our experience with testing serum samples from febrile cases in the Amazon
Basin
region of Peru by ELISA is consistent with that reported from Venezuela, in
that IgM antibody testing can distinguish between cases of VEE virus (enzootic
strains) and Mayaro virus.
However, in contrast, IgG antibody was highly cross-reactive, and therefore
was not specific for either virus.

Additional Information on the Mayaro Virus Disease Patients in Venezuela
---------------------------------------------------------------
The comment on the lack of specificity of IgG antibodies for the diagnosis of
any alphavirus infection is well taken. Since it was a brief and preliminary
epidemiological report, some details were not mentioned or discussed.
All 4 patients were also assayed for both IgM and IgG against dengue, yellow
fever, and VEE viruses. IgM titers were negative in each case. VEE virus is
not known to occur in the area, and only 3 of the patients had been vaccinated
against yellow fever in the distant past.
The patients were first seen by me almost 3 months after onset of illness.
Therefore,
the finding of high serum Mayaro virus IgG titers is not surprising. Samples
were analyzed at the US Naval Research Institute Detachment in Lima, Peru. At
this moment I can not tell you whether the strain used to develop the antibody
capture ELISA assay was epizootic or enzootic.

[There is usually little problem in distinguishing even IgG antibody to VEE
viruses from IgG antibody to Mayaro viruses, by almost any test. Using IgM
antibody,
which is complex-specific (Calisher, C.H., A.O. ElKafrawi, M.I. AlD. Mahmud,
A.P.A. Travassos da Rosa, C.R. Bartz, M. Brummer Korvenkontio, S. Haksohusodo,
and W. Suharyono. Complex-specific immunoglobulin M antibody patterns in
humans
infected with alphaviruses. J. Clin. Microbiol. 23:155159, 1986), even
antibody
to viruses within an antigenic complex can be distinguished. - Temp.Mod.CHC
