Abstract
--------
The elemental composition of the 2001 attack anthrax presents critical clues that were not considered or were misinterpreted throughout the original investigation. Extensive experimental data released by the FBI after the anthrax case was closed make it possible to trace some of the implications of these clues: the substantial presence of tin, a toxic material that must have been added subsequent to growth, and a uniquely high content of silicon in the attack spores.

No _Bacillus_ spore preparations other than the attack anthrax have ever been found to contain such a high level of silicon, although some surrogate spore powders prepared at Dugway following FBI instructions have been cited as evidence that high levels of silicon can be reproduced; however, examination of the experimental data reveals that the silicon in these samples was unquestionably an artifact. The elemental evidence suggests that the attack spores had been coated with silicone (a polysiloxane) in the presence of tin, which catalyzes the cross-linking of polysiloxane chains needed to form an encapsulating coating on the spore coat.

Microencapsulation helps protect biological agents from damage during atmospheric exposure and from the body's defenses during infection, and would defeat some detection methods. Microencapsulation, which would explain the location and amounts of both tin and silicon in the attack spores, requires special expertise and sophisticated facilities. DOD-sponsored projects explicitly involving microencapsulation at DARPA, Dugway and perhaps elsewhere were spelled out publicly in budget documents in 1999 and thereafter, and executed at the very time of the anthrax attacks. Both the Dugway laboratory and Battelle Memorial Institute, a sub-contractor at Dugway, had extensive experience in making Bacillus spore powders; both had access to _Bacillus_ anthracis genetically matching the attack spores; both could have made the attack spores legally for institutions conducting biodefense activities that required microencapsulated spores.

Furthermore, a small but significant amount of tin, about 4 percent of that in the attack spores, has been found in some surrogate spore products made at Dugway. A measureable tin content has not been found in any other _Bacillus_ spores except the attack spores. The tin in the Dugway surrogates may have been a remnant, indicative of earlier, classified work. Avoidance of government sponsored, classified research may account for some of the limitations of the investigation.

[This paper builds on an earlier JBTBD paper (Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (08): spore characteristics 20111017.3112) which identified that the anthrax spores in the 2001 letters had been microencapsulated. In this paper we demonstrate that the raised silicon levels in some test surrogate spore preparations were but the result of spore production procedures, as was the extraordinary appearance of aluminum. That is, the silicon levels in the letter spores was truly exceptional though characteristic of microencapsulation. This was publicly denied by the FBI but I am privately informed that some senior FBI scientists are in agreement about the spore microencapsulation.

As of 1 Jan 2013 the GAO formally initiated a reassessment of the FBI investigation under the leadership of Assistant Director Dr. Sushil Sharma (email: <sharmas@gao.gov>) and I urge any and everyone with knowledge of those pathogen microencapsulation studies of 1999 - 2001 or other similar spore research to contact Dr. Sharma with whatever you know. In this way you will aid and speed the identification of the true perpetrators who utilised the honest products -- microencapsulated spores -- of that research for their criminal purpose.

I would advise readers to ignore the footnotes on their 1st read through as it can get confusing switching up and down before you have an appreciation of the arguments and facts. - Mod.MHJ]
