OLYMPIA-Feb. 28, 1997--State health and local officials are investigating
the death of a 65-year-old Mason County man that was positively linked to
rabies today by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The man
became ill in late December. He was first hospitalized in Thurston County
and later transferred to King County, where he died in mid-January.

"Human rabies is extremely rare," said Dr. Mark Trucksess, health officer
for Mason County. "We do not know at this time how the man was exposed, but
many recent cases have been linked to bat exposure."
Additional lab tests will be completed by CDC.
Although bats are the only known reservoir of rabies in Washington, Dr.
Diana Yu emphasized that only 10 percent of bats that bite people test
positive. It is estimated that about one percent of bats in the wild carry
the rabies virus.
The Mason County man is the second person in Washington to die of rabies
since 1939. The last death was two years ago, when a 4- year-old Lewis
County girl contracted rabies after exposure to a bat.
