Amphibians at risk over climate change, habitat loss: scientists
----------------------------------------------------------------
Climate change, habitat destruction, and disease threaten to wipe out
over half of Europe's frog, toad, and newt species by the middle of
the century, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) warned Thursday
[25 Sep 2008]. In a speech at London Zoo, ZSL research fellow Trent
Garner said a recent study had shown that warmer winters in southern
England had affected the hibernation of toads, forcing them to use
more of their energy reserves and resulting in them emerging from
winter in poor health.

Garner said that survival rates among female toads were dropping.
"The number one threat has been and will be habitat loss, and there
are also threats from pollution and introduction of new species," he
said. "There's now evidence coming out that climate change is having
or will have a strong impact, while the other thing that is a problem
is infectious disease."

Overall there are over 80 species of amphibian in Europe, a large
proportion distributed around the Mediterranean basin, he said,
adding that some may find themselves trapped on islands or peninsulas
due to climate change. As conditions change many specialised
amphibian species, or those who cannot move to other habitats for
example because they live on islands, would be unable to adapt, he
said. "If their habitat no longer exists where they live, they're in
real trouble," he said.

He recommended legislation be introduced to stop the spread of
disease, and said captive breeding programmes were needed in zoos
around the world to boost the numbers of those amphibians at highest
risk of extinction.

Dr Garner's report [above] adds a new twist to a growing list of
threats to amphibians globally. A recent IUCN [International Union for
Conservation of Nature] global assessment found that over 30 percent
of [amphibian] species are globally threatened, a much higher
percentage than for either birds or mammals, and that in some regions,
waves of extinctions have occurred over the past 3 decades due to
disease, habitat loss and over-harvesting for the food and pet trade
(Stuart et al. 2004, Science: vol 306; abstract available at
<http://www.scienceonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/306/5702/1783>).

Of interest to ProMED-mail readers, amphibians are also affected by
what appears to be a pandemic (more correctly a panzootic) caused by a
fungal disease that has led to the 1st demonstrated extinction of a
wild species due to disease (Schloegel et al. 2006, EcoHealth: vol 3;
available at
<http://www.springerlink.com/content/0lpl47075346554t/fulltext.html>).

This disease, chytridiomycosis, may be responsible for the recent
disappearance of around 20 species of the neotropical genus
_Atelopus_, and seems to be spread by the trade in frogs for food, as
pets and lab animals. Indeed, one study in EID [Emerging Infectious
Diseases] suggested that the disease was first spread globally with
the _Xenopus_ trade for pregnancy testing in the 1940s-60s (Weldon et
al. 2004, EID: vol 10; available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no12/03-0804.htm>).

The link to climate change that this article highlights adds a new
twist to these threats, and brings urgency to efforts to understand
the impact of
emerging disease on wildlife.

One important note of relevance to surveillance, quarantine, and
control of emerging diseases -- Dr Garner here calls for legislation
to stop the spread of disease affecting amphibians. The OIE [World
Organisation for Animal Health], via the Aquatic Animals Health
Commission, has recently (May 2008) voted to list 2 diseases
affecting amphibians as notifiable -- amphibian chytridiomycosis and
amphibian ranaviral disease. The justification includes the impact of
these diseases on the environment as well as on the surprisingly high
volume of international trade in amphibians for restaurants (around 1
million live bullfrogs are imported into the US each year for the
food trade, for example). This is a welcome step both in bringing the
environmental impact of introduced diseases into center stage, as
well as providing a mechanism to protect these trades from emerging
diseases.
