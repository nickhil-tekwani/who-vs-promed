A new drug to treat malaria has been given the green light by authorities in the United States. The medicine is specifically for the recurring form of malaria -- caused by the parasite _Plasmodium vivax_ -- which makes 8.5 million people ill each year. This type of malaria is a challenge to get rid of because it can remain dormant in the liver for years before reawakening many times.

Scientists have described tafenoquine as a "phenomenal achievement." Regulators around the world will now look at the drug to see if they can recommend it for their populations.

Recurring malaria is the most common type of malaria outside sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be particularly at risk, getting several bouts of malaria from a single bite, missing lots of school and getting weaker each time they get the disease. In addition, infected people can act as unwitting reservoirs of the disease because when the parasite reawakens in their bodies, a mosquito can carry that parasite on to someone else. This can make it hard to eliminate around the world.

Now the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has given its seal of approval to tafenoquine, a drug that can flush the parasite out of its hiding place in the liver and stop people getting it again. Tafenoquine can be taken alongside another medicine to treat the immediate infection.

There is already a medication that can be used to get rid of malaria hiding in the liver, called primaquine. However, unlike the single dose of tafenoquine needed, primaquine often needs to be taken for 14 days. Some experts are concerned that many people feel better after just a few days and stop taking the pills, allowing the parasite to awaken at a later date.

The FDA says the new drug is effective and approves it for use in the United States but points out that there are important side effects to be aware of. For example, people with an enzyme problem, called G6PD deficiency, should not take the drug because it can cause severe anaemia. The regulator recommends people are tested for the deficiency for this before it is given, which can pose a problem in poorer areas where malaria is common.

There are also concerns that at higher doses it can be a problem for people with psychiatric illnesses. But despite these cautions there is hope the drug, together with bed nets and other precautions, will help reduce the amount of _P. vivax_ malaria in the world.

Professor Ric Price, of Oxford University, told the BBC: "The ability to get rid of the parasite in the liver with a single dose of tafenoquine is a phenomenal achievement and in my mind it represents one of the most significant advances in malaria treatment in the last 60 years."

Meanwhile, Dr. Hal Barron, president of research and development at GSK, the company that manufactures the drug, said it was a significant milestone for people living with this type of relapsing malaria. "Together with our partner, Medicines for Malaria Venture, we believe Krintafel [trade name for tafenoquine] will be an important medicine for patients with malaria and contribute to the ongoing effort to eradicate this disease."

Tafenoquine has been in existence since the 1970s, but working with Medicines for Malaria, GSK has repurposed the drug so that it can be used to get rid of malaria parasites in the liver. The next step will be for the drug to be assessed by regulators in countries where this form of malaria is a significant problem.

[Tafenoquine is an 8-aminoquinoline, the same class of drug as primaquine, but with a long half-life. The first human study dates to 1998, when tafenoquine was tested as a prophylaxis against _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria (Brueckner RP et al. Prophylaxis of _Plasmodium falciparum_ infection in a human challenge model with WR 238605, a new 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1998;42:1293-4; Walsh DS et al. Randomized dose-ranging study of the safety and efficacy of WR 238605 [tafenoquine] in the prevention of relapse of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria in Thailand. J Infect Dis 1999;180:1282-7). A study comparing tafenoquine with mefloquine for the prevention of _P. falciparum_ malaria in Gabon found that they were equally effective with few side effects (Hale BR et al. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of tafenoquine for weekly prophylaxis against _Plasmodium falciparum_. Clin Infect Dis 2003;36:541-9), and monthly dosing also proved to have a protective efficacy of more than 95% (Walsh DS et al. Efficacy of monthly tafenoquine for prophylaxis of _Plasmodium vivax_ and multidrug-resistant _P. falciparum_ malaria. J Infect Dis 2004;190:1456-63).

However, a study from 2009 (Nasveld PE et al. Randomized, double-blind study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tafenoquine versus mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis in nonimmune subjects. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2010;54:792-8) reported mild vortex keratopathy in 93% (69 of 74) of tafenoquine subjects. There was not any effect on visual acuity, and it was fully resolved in all subjects by one year. After that, the development of tafenoquine for the long-term prophylaxis against _P. falciparum_ malaria ceased.

A recent study proved tafenoquine effective as a prophylaxis against _P. vivax_ relapse (Llanos-Cuentas A et al. Tafenoquine plus chloroquine for the treatment and relapse prevention of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria (DETECTIVE): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, phase 2b dose-selection study. Lancet 2014;383:1049-58).
