Influenza vaccine licence withdrawn by UK authorities
-----------------------------------------------------
Global and United States health officials warned on Tue 5 Oct 2004 of major
influenza vaccine shortages after British health officials abruptly pulled
the license of the maker of half the US vaccine just as the influenza
season was about to begin. The news means the US will face "a significant
shortage," said Dr Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health's
infectious disease chief. Other countries will likely face similar
problems. "The implications may be significant," said Dr Klaus Stohr, of
the World Health Organization.
The British authorities suspended the license of Chiron Corp. for 3 months
because of problems at its vaccine manufacturing plant in Liverpool,
England. The action means the company can't supply any influenza vaccines
to any market during that time, and Chiron said it would provide no vaccine
this year.
British officials didn't explain details for the license suspension. Chiron
officials said the British action came because of broad concerns about
standards at the Liverpool factory, not just worries about the safety of
already-produced vaccine. The company has no obligation to recall or
withdraw any vaccine, but none has been released anywhere, and none will be
this season, Chiron officials said.
US health officials were caught off-guard, learning of the developments
only during a mid-morning phone call. "We need to regroup," Fauci said
shortly afterward. Chiron had planned to ship 46 to 48 million doses, but
that already had been delayed by a contamination problem discovered in
August 2004 in the English factory where the vaccine is made. At the time,
the company said only 4 million doses were tainted but that the entire
supply would be held up and retested. About 1 million doses already had
arrived in the United States, but it remains under Chiron's control and has
not been released for use.
Influenza vaccination campaigns usually start in October, a month before
the flu season typically begins in the US. In an average year, influenza
kills 36 000 Americans and hospitalizes another 114 000, mostly the
elderly. Less than 2 weeks ago, top US health officials assured the public
that close FDA monitoring of the rest of Chiron's supply suggested it was
fine and that there would be plenty of supplies.
Dr Walt Orenstein, formerly the top influenza expert at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and now the associate director of the Emory
Vaccine Center, said the government may have to ration available vaccine.
"It's a very serious concern. We're already in October, which is vaccine
season. If we have to ration at this stage, it becomes more complicated."
If problems prevent the Chiron vaccine from being used at all this year,
it's unlikely that other manufacturers could fill the gap. Aventis Pasteur,
which expects to supply 52 million doses, said earlier that federal
officials had asked it to make additional vaccine but that it already was
at capacity and couldn't produce more until after November when existing
orders are filled. A third manufacturer, MedImmune, which makes FluMist, a
new nasal spray influenza vaccine for use in healthy 5 to 49 year olds,
said it couldn't produce more than the 1.5 million doses it had planned to
make for this year's flu season. That vaccine is made from modified live
virus and isn't considered safe for the elderly or people with medical
problems.
Worldwide, Chiron is the 2nd leading flu vaccine manufacturer, behind
French pharmaceutical company Aventis, which makes about 45 to 50 per cent
of the world's supply, Stohr said. Chiron, based in California, makes 4
influenza vaccines, including Fluvirin, the top flu vaccine in northern
Europe and the No. 2 vaccine in the US. Chiron Corp. officials cut the
company's expected profits by more than half on Tuesday. Trading in
Chiron's stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was temporarily halted Tuesday
morning. Share price dropped USD 7.69 a share, or 17 per cent, to USD 37.73
after trading resumed. "Chiron deeply regrets that we will be unable to
meet public health needs this season," Chiron chief executive Howard Pien
said. "What happened was unexpected."
The timing of the license suspension is particularly worrying because
vaccine production goes in cycles. The manufacturing cycle for the northern
hemisphere vaccine finished in August and manufacturers are now gearing up
to make the vaccine for the southern hemisphere. Vaccine makers do not have
a lot of spare stock because they produce on demand.

[The practical difficulties inherent in large-scale production of 2004/2005
northern hemisphere human influenza virus vaccines put in perspective the
over-optimistic demands for rapid development and supply of an avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus vaccine for use in control of the outbreak of
avian influenza in East Asia. - Mod.CP
The above article does not indicate the implications of this withdrawal on
vaccination campaigns in other countries. About a quarter of the population
in the United Kingdom are invited for annual vaccination against flu on
account of advancing age (65 or over) or chronic illnesses likely to make
influenza a greater hazard. Vaccine recommendations in the US now include
covering children aged 6 to 23 months and those who come in contact with
them (Influenza activity update 2003/2004 - worldwide 20040703.1776). - Mod.SH]
