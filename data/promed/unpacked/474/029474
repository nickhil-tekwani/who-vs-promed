You are right: insufficient funding is one of the reasons, but not
the principle one. The 1st reason is a very hot, dry summer.

The 2nd one is lack of vets: old experienced ones have retired, and
young vets don't want to work in distant regions. Private veterinary
service is not developed well enough either.

I have been continuously speaking about this for the last 10 years,
but there are no principle activities undertaken to improve the
situation so far. Today I will attend the session of Special
Commission on anthrax situation in the republic and later I will
share its results with you.

[For some 10 years Asankadyr was the Kyrgyz Chief Veterinary Officer
and thus knows of which he speaks. Lack of rural veterinarians is not
a new problem in the world; another country presently afflicted by it
is Jamaica where small and marginal farmers, the commonest group in
the Caribbean, have great difficulty getting vetereinary advice and
help. The larger towns and cities are well supplied with dog and cat vets.

The traditional solution is the New Zealand sheep farmer cooperatives
who suppliment their veterinarian's income. Other times the
suppliment is a government subsidy to veterinarians working in
certain rural areas with low population densities as historically in
the Maritime Provinces in Canada and at Port Arthur/Thunder Bay in
western Ontario. There was also the Highlands and Islands Scheme in
the UK and in a similar scheme for south Wales -- these areas
traditionally produced outstanding warrant officers for the army
(former region) and the navy (latter) and so the UK government wanted
the rural populations to not collapse.

Another solution was the German system in Tanganika where you had a
veterinarian in a town and veterinary assistants in the surrounding
villages; the veterinarian visited each village VA once a week but
was otherwise on call for emergencies. I have heard of this being
successfully applied at one time in Colombia for medical services
using medical students in the villages. Today we have nurse
practitioners who successfully fill many geographical medical gaps. I
look forward to seeing how the Kyrgyz solve it. - Mod.MHJ]
