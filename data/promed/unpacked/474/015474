HAZMAT in Germany on Thursday, 24 Oct 2013
------------------------------------------
Residents in the eastern German town of Leuna in Saxony-Anhalt [state] are being evacuated after a stash of chemical arms dating back to World War II has allegedly been discovered in one of the country's major industrial clusters. Some media have reported hazardous gas to have escaped the rusted containers, prompting the town authority to evacuate the area in the radius of 300 meters [about 984 feet]. Experts in liquidation of chemical weapons have been called to the scene to oversee the police operation as they are trying to deal with the chemical threat. At 13 square kilometers [about 5 square miles], the town of Leuna houses one of the biggest chemical industrial complexes in Germany, producing a wide range of chemicals and plastics.

[One must wonder why this World War II stash of chemical weapons has only just been revealed. "Discovered" can mean anything in these circumstances. And what cumulative risk has the leakage posed to the citizens of Leuna during that time, combined with the risks from propinquity to "one of the biggest chemical industrial complexes" in Germany? Logically the 2 sites are related in a number of ways.

The enclosing town of 13 sq. km [about 5 sq. miles], indicates that it would be only 3.6 km by 3.6 km [about 2.2 miles by 2.2 miles] in size if it were square, but it is stretched out, which implies that nothing is very far from anything else.
