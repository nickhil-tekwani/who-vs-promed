The state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) determined that
botulism caused 70 geese and ducks to die at local retention basins.
"It's avian botulism, which is [caused by] a [bacterium]," said Jack
Kaskey, a DEP spokesman, Friday. "It is not a health threat to people."
[_Clostridium botulinum_ is one of the bacteria responsible for the
production of the toxin botulinum, which is responsible for the toxic
condition known as botulism. ­ Mod.TG]
The determination came from blood samples investigators took from sick
birds at the 3 basins near Delsea Drive and Sarah Place. The basins, which
are 3 feet deep, are located behind Lilliston Ford and Luther Acres, a
senior housing complex.
The birds' deaths last week prompted concerns and a DEP investigation.
Kaskey said conditions in the shallow basins were perfect for fostering
increased levels of the bacteria, noting that botulism naturally occurs in
bodies of water. Those conditions included stagnant water, where oxygen
levels are low. A contributing factor was that the water was warmer, and
colder water holds oxygen better. The large number of birds also added to
low oxygen levels with their feces. And runoff into the basin likely
included fertilizers, which added nutrients.
The nutrients created an algae bloom that traditionally creates oxygen. But
as the bloom died, it further depleted the oxygen in the water.This caused
the fish to die, with Kaskey noting that even carp, considered a sturdy
fish, were rising to the surface and gasping for air.
Kaskey said botulism thrives in dead fish. "The next step is maggots in the
fish, which are then concentrating botulism in their bodies. And the
waterfowl are eating the maggots and dying from it," he said. In order to
stem the avian deaths, Kaskey said the city has been diligent about
removing dead fish and bird carcasses.
While pesticides were considered culprits, an analysis of the birds' brains
proved otherwise, Kaskey said. "Ultimately, this should fade away," Kaskey
said. "In the long term, one could install a fountain in the basins to keep
water moving and keep oxygen at normal levels."
Kaskey noted that a similar situation in Millville was remedied that way.
Also, residents around the pond should strictly follow directions on
fertilizers to make sure they are not overdoing it. Excess fertilizer will
end up in the basins, contributing more nutrients. Lastly, feeding the
geese and ducks should be curbed. Fewer birds attracted to the basins would
mean lower amounts of feces.

[Avian botulism is seen most often in regions other than NJ. However, it
will occur where the conditions are favorable.
The sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_ elaborates
7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect humans:
type A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxins types A and B are highly poisonous
proteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes. Approximately 50 percent of
foodborne outbreaks in the USA are caused by type A toxin, followed by
types B and E.
Type C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds living in
an aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most notably in
waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America, it has been
reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia. In the
Great Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936 in ducks on Green Bay
of Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County marshes along Lake Erie. Type
C is most often associated with limberneck paralysis in birds.
Type E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs mainly in
gulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute swans, grebes,
and shorebirds. It now appears that any birds or mammals susceptible to
botulinum toxin run a risk of becoming poisoned if they scavenge dead fish.
Evidence for this includes the identification of type E toxin in a bald
eagle, wood ducks, and muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.
_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high
temperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.
Toxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat and by cooking
food. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at temperatures as low
as 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F), i.e., inside a refrigerator, and does not
require strict anaerobic conditions.
Human illness from Type E is most often associated with improperly smoked
fish. Since the toxin is destroyed by heat, it appears that no problem with
botulism will result from eating cooked waterfowl. - Mod.TG]
