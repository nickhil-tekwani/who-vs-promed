'Bleeding eye fever' that's deadlier than the plague has killed 4 and infected dozens in East Africa, as health chiefs warn the spread could be "catastrophic". The disease could be about to bring misery to the continent -- so soon after the Ebola outbreak of 2014-16.

Fears are growing that the disease could spread across Africa. The virus which leaves people bleeding from their eyes, mouth, and anus is thought to be spreading in South Sudan. A total of 3 people have already died, a pregnant woman, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl in Eastern Lakes state.

Up to 60 people are suspected to be infected, and are undergoing tests by a team from the Sudanese healthy ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO). Medics are now concerned a health emergency worse that the Black Death outbreak last year [2017], after the sudden death of a child in the Nakaseke district of neighbouring Uganda.

The 9-year-old girl died after displaying the nightmarish symptoms of virus that kills up to 40 per cent of those affected.

And tests have now confirmed she died from the disease, named Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, according to Xinhua news agency. The disease is transmitted to humans through tick bites, or through contact with the blood of infected animals especially during slaughter.

[The Republic of South Sudan is a landlocked country in North or Eastern Africa. It shares its borders with Ethiopia to the east, Kenya to the southeast, Uganda to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southwest, the Central African Republic to the west, and Sudan to the north.

This report is linked to the confirmed CCHF case reported from Uganda, but it does not mention whether the cases in South Sudan have been confirmed as CCHF through laboratory tests. Any further information on the epidemiological context of these cases would be highly appreciated.

Uganda's health ministry confirmed on [Mon 15 Jan 2018] an outbreak of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in the central district of Nakaseke.

Sarah Opendi, state minister for health, told Xinhua that the laboratory results of the samples taken from a 9-year-old suspected case that has been under isolation at Kiwoko Hospital, Nakaseke, tested positive of the fever.

She said a National Rapid Response team from the Ministry of Health and that of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries has been dispatched to Nakaseke and Luweero districts to handle the outbreak. "Results from Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe tested positive for the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and negative for other viral hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley fever, and Sosuga," said Opendi.

The confirmation of the CCHF comes barely 2 weeks after the ministry of health denied the outbreak. On [Fri 5 Jan 2017], Opendi told reporters that the samples taken from the suspected 9-year-old boy tested negative of CCHF, contrary to the claims from Nakaseke districts authorities on the outbreak.

The minister on [Mon 15 Jan 2018] dismissed reports that an 8-year-old girl from Kagugo village, Luweero district succumbed to the fever. "The laboratory results from the deceased's blood samples tested negative for CCHF and other viral Hemorrhagic fevers. The Ministry of Health is continuing to investigate the possible cause of the death of this young girl in collaboration with partners," said Opendi.

Crimean-Congo is a tick-borne illness transmitted to humans through tick bites. It is also be transmitted through contact with the blood of infected animals especially during slaughter. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with the blood, secretions and the organs of infected people. Nosocomial transmission can occur through contaminated medical equipment or body fluid from infected persons.

A CCHF outbreak constitutes a threat to public health, according to the World Health Organization.

According to the global health body, the fever - which is endemic in Africa, the Balkans and the Middle East - is associated with high case fatality ratio of about 10 to 40 percent.

[CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north -- the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats.

In early January 2018, a confirmed case of CCHF was reported from Luwero district; the patient was admitted in a hospital in Nakaseke district [Promed post; Crimean-Congo hem fever - Uganda: (LW) 20180106.5541551].

According to this report, another suspected fatal case is mentioned which later tested negative for CCHF. Further investigation into the epidemiological risk factors involved and contact tracing of those exposed to the confirmed case would be helpful to contain disease transmission.
