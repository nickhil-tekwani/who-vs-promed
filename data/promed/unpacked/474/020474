Legionellosis is a lung infection caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. Infection is mainly by inhalation of contaminated water spray. After an incubation period of 2-10 days, the patient feels as if infected by influenza, with a cough, initially unproductive, which then gives way to severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization.

The Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region is one of the most affected regions with the highest incidence at national level: 2.7 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in 2016 (212 cases) compared to 1.8 cases per 100 000 inhabitants on average in France, the regional unit of Public Health France reported in a balance sheet in mid-June 2018.

In addition, the year 2017 was marked by a sharp increase compared to 2016, with a peak to more than 40 cases in September [2017] against less than 20 in [September] 2016. The departments most affected by this increase are the Puy-de -Dome, Savoy, Cantal and Haute-Savoie.

Frequent weather conditions creating favorable conditions for _Legionella_ development (moisture content and mild temperatures) could partly explain this phenomenon.

Between 1 Jan and 12 Jun 2018, 114 cases have already been recorded, including 23 in the Rhone, 19 in the Puy-de-Dôme, 18 in Isère, 17 in Haute-Savoie, 12 in the Loire, and 2 in Ain.

[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes is a region of France and is the 3rd largest in metropolitan France, with a population of about 7.7 million residents, 2nd only to Île-de-France (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes); a map showing the location of this region can be found at https://www.france-pub.com/region/auvergne-rhone-alpes.php.

Surveillance of Legionnaires' disease (LD) in France started in 1987 with a mandatory clinician-based notification system (http://www.q-net.net.au/~legion/Legionnaires_Disease_France.htm). France also participates in the European LD surveillance network (ELDSNet) related to travel-associated cases. _Legionella_ isolates have been routinely typed in France since 2008 by 3 methods: use of monoclonal antibodies, PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis), and amplification and sequencing of 7 selected genes to identify common-source outbreaks (sequencing can be done directly on pulmonary samples, even if no strain is isolated) to detect case clusters that have a common source and then identify their source of contamination (1).

In 2013, 1262 cases of LD were reported in France (incidence rate 1.94 per 100 000 individuals, which was reported to be similar to those of Italy, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands, but higher than the European average of 1.2 per 100 000 individuals in 2012 (1).

In 2015, France reported 1389 cases (1380 confirmed cases) (incidence rate 2.1); the European average was 1.37 per 100 000 individuals in 2015 (https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/AER_for_2015-legionnaires-disease_0.pdf). For 2011-15, 4 countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) accounted for 70.3% of all reported cases, although their combined populations represented only 49.9% of the study population (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.27.30566).

The annual incidence rate of LD in France initially rose dramatically, probably because of increasingly more complete reporting, but has been stable since 2008 (1). The sources of contamination for most cases of LD in France were not identified, but almost 50 percent of cases were noted to be nosocomial, and 6 percent involved people who lived in an institution for the elderly in 2013 (1).

More information on the epidemiology of legionellosis in France from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
