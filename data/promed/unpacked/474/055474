Experts have warned of a potential new outbreak of a "very rare" disease which is usually fatal and could cause inflammation in the brain. The Express reports that health authorities in Germany have issued a warning as a new case of a very rare disease known as Borna disease has been detected.

Also known as sad horse disease, this fatal illness comes from the Borna Disease Virus (BDV) and is an infectious neurological syndrome affecting warm-blooded animals. The disease is very rare, only previously detected in humans a handful of times after it originated in Germany in the late 1800s.

Local authorities in the country announced on Tuesday [7 Jun 2022] that a person from the district of Muhldorf am Inn was infected. In the Bavarian district, 2 other cases of the virus affecting humans have been reported over the past 3 years.

BDV can cause an inflammation of the brain after infection, leading to death in almost all cases, while those who did survive the virus were left to suffer long-term damage. On average, Germany reports about 2 infections every year, although experts assume that the number of unreported cases in the country could go as high as up to 6 cases per year.

Borna disease viruses, which come in type 1 and type 2 variants, can affect a wide host of mammals aside from humans. BDV-1 and BDV-2 have been previously detected in horses, cattle, sheep, dogs and foxes.

Patients infected with Borna disease could end up with meningitis, which is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. According to the NHS, meningitis "can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults".

Meningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening blood involvment (septicaemia) and result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves.

Fortunately, a number of vaccinations are available which can offer some protection against the brain disease. Scientists believe the transmission of Borna viruses occurs through the intranasal exposure of contaminated saliva or nasal secretions.

[Cases of Bornavirus disease occur sporadically in Germany and have been diagnosed in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Austria. A 2018 article in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control provides a good overview of the Borna disease virus (BoDV) complex and the disease BoDV-1 can cause in animals and its association with disease in humans (see Borna virus - Germany: fatal 20180328.5714656).

"Main conclusions and options for response in the article follow [edited]:

"Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) has been associated with human disease in 4 cases in Germany resulting in the death of 3 people. As 3 of the cases belong to a cluster of solid organ recipients from a single donor, donor-derived BoDV-1 transmission is possible. There is no evidence that the donor had any clinical manifestation of the disease.

"BoDV-1 in humans occurs rarely; however considering the severity of this disease, Member States may consider adding BoDV-1 to the list of pathogens included in the differential diagnosis of causes of human encephalitis. The fact that the virus could be transmitted through solid organ transplantation raises concerns about the possibility of transmission through other types of substances of human origin (SoHO). This should be further
investigated.

"Clinicians and transplantation professionals should be aware of possible BoDV-1 related encephalitis and the possibility of transmission through donated organs, especially in areas where Borna disease is endemic. Endemic areas so far have been identified in central Europe including eastern and southern Germany, the eastern part of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the most western federal state of Austria and more recently in Upper Austria.

"The bicoloured, white-toothed shrew (_Crocidura leucodon_) has been proposed as the animal reservoir of BoDV-1. The routes of transmission of BoDV-1 to humans from the animal reservoir remain unknown and the zoonotic transmission pathways should be further investigated."
