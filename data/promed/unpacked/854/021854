Outbreak of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ in a tomato nursery
-------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) has been
confirmed at a tomato production nursery in the north of England. This
is the 2nd outbreak of this viroid in the UK. The 1st was in Kent in
2003 [ProMED-mail post 20030909.2268], also on a tomato crop.

The viroid is listed as a quarantine organism in EU [EPPO A2 list --
see below]. UK plant health legislation and statutory controls have
been put in place on the affected nursery, requiring hygiene measures
to prevent further spread and restrictions on the marketing of the
fruit. Fera are investigating the extent and cause of the outbreak and
whether other premises could be affected.

PSTVd is closely related to _Columnea latent viroid_ (CLVd) and
_Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ (TCDVd). CLVd was confirmed in 2007
and 2009 in 4 tomato production nurseries in the UK, and both PSTVd
and TCDVd are occasionally found in solanaceous ornamentals [see
ProMED-mail post 20070822.2742] where symptoms are rarely seen. There
have been no findings of any of these viroids on potato crops in the
UK.

In the previous PSTVd case in 2003, spread within plants and rows was
found, by observation and research, to be relatively slow and this
[PSTVd outbreak] and the CLVd outbreaks were successfully eradicated
with no re-occurrence the following year.

Tomato growers are strongly advised to inspect their crops and report
any suspicious symptoms to their local Plant Health and Seeds
Inspectorate. PSTVd is considered to pose a significant risk to tomato
crops and potentially to potato; this means that any material found to
be infected would be subject to statutory controls.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus
_Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including
potato, tomato, and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic")
disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to
65 per cent in potato and up to 50 per cent in tomato. Many
solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to
PSTVd.

Symptoms in tomatoes include leaf chlorosis and discolouration, leaf
distortion, shortening of internodes, and stunting of plants; flower
and fruit initiation stops. In potato, shoots are spindly and may show
distortions and proliferations; plants are stunted, and tubers are
small, elongated, cylindrical, spindle, or dumb-bell-shaped, with
prominent eyes evenly distributed over the tuber; sprouting is slower
than in healthy tubers. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to
be susceptible, with no natural resistance to PSTVd available in
either host. However, mild strains causing latent infections in some
host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 per cent, depending
on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato
germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed.
Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts
(potato seed tubers, tomato explants), pollen, mechanical means
(including insect and human activities) and plant-to-plant contact.
Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_, PSTVd can also be
transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number
of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are
complicated. Furthermore, PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can
survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Disease
management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other
possible sources of inoculum, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free
planting material. PSTVd has been included on the A2 quarantine list
of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
