[1] MSF: response to WHO
Date: 8 Aug 2014
Source: MSF [edited]
http://www.msf.org.uk/article/ebola-official-msf-response-who-declaring-epidemic-extraordinary-event


In response [to the WHO statement on Ebola], Dr Bart Janssens, Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Director of Operations said:

"Declaring Ebola virus disease an international public health emergency shows how seriously WHO is taking the current outbreak, but statements won't save lives. Now, we need this statement to translate into immediate action on the ground. For weeks, MSF has been repeating that a massive medical, epidemiological and public health response is desperately needed to saves lives and reverse the course of the epidemic. Lives are being lost because the response is too slow."

"Countries possessing necessary capacities must immediately dispatch available infectious disease experts and disaster relief assets to the region. It is clear the epidemic will not be contained without a massive deployment on the ground from these states. In concrete terms, all of the following need to be radically scaled up: medical care, training of health staff, infection control, contact tracing, epidemiological surveillance, alert and referral systems, community mobilisation and education."

"MSF currently has 66 international and 610 national staff responding to the crisis in the 3 affected countries. All of our Ebola experts are mobilised; we simply cannot do more."

MSF emergency teams are continuing their efforts to fight the EVD epidemic in West Africa. The disease has claimed 932 lives, according to the WHO, since the outbreak began in March 2014.

Over recent weeks, MSF teams have seen a worrying surge in the epidemic, with the number of cases increasing dramatically in Sierra Leone and Liberia and the disease spreading to many more villages and towns. MSF urges the WHO, health authorities and other organisations to scale up their response.

[2] Sierra Leone: Kenema hospital
Date: 8 Aug 2014

At the government hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone, health care workers struggle to contain the Ebola virus disease epidemic, which has killed almost 1000 people across West Africa. So many patients, nurses and health workers have died in the government hospital that many people in this city, a center of the world's worst EVD epidemic, see it as a death trap. Now, the wards are empty in the principal institution fighting the disease. EVD stalks the city, claiming lives every day, but patients have fled the hospital's long, narrow buildings, which sit silent and echoing in the fading light. Few people are taking any chances by coming here. "Don't touch the walls!" a Western medical technician yelled out. "Totally infected."

Some Ebola patients still die at the hospital, perhaps 4 per day, in the tent-like temporary isolation ward at the back of the muddy grounds. But just as many, if not more, are dying in the city and neighboring villages, greatly increasing the risk of spreading the disease and undermining international efforts to halt the epidemic. "People don't die here now," said the deputy chief of the hospital's burying team, Albert J. Mattia, exasperated after a long day of EVD burials. "They are dying in the community, 5, 6 a day." Mr. Mattia was particularly disturbed that many of the bodies his team were putting in the ground had come from outside the hospital, thwarting attempts to isolate patients and prevent them from passing the disease to others. "It's very, very dangerous, very hazardous; it is contributing to the EVD dead," he said as his 2 deputies nodded glumly in agreement. "You go to the wards, there are no patients."

Containing the virus in Kenema -- one of the nation's largest cities and a gateway to an area of the country where the disease is rampant -- is critical to taming the epidemic's deadly advance across parts of West Africa. More than 930 people, including over 280 here in Sierra Leone, have died since the outbreak was 1st identified across the border in Guinea in March [2014]. Since then, Sierra Leone has been hit with more cases of the disease than any other nation -- 691 out of 1711 at last count -- and the hospital in Kenema quickly became a focal point in the effort to grapple with the epidemic when the government set up a treatment center here for cases in the region.

International health officials have concentrated intensively on the hospital in the last several days, training healthcare workers, preparing a more secure isolation ward, establishing the rigorous separation of zones -- low risk, high risk -- that characterize the tightly sealed Doctors Without Borders [MSF] EVD facilities elsewhere in stricken West Africa. But it is a tough struggle, and the recent history of the hospital looms. More than 20 health care workers at the hospital have died trying to battle the disease over the last several months, including nurses, support staff and the country's leading doctor.

[3] New drug release
Date: 8 Aug 2014
Source: Bio Tuesdays [edited]
http://biotuesdays.com/2014/08/08/fda-eases-tekmiras-tkm-ebola-to-partial-clinical-hold


The FDA has verbally confirmed that it has modified a full clinical hold on Tekmira Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:TKMR; TSX:TKM) TKM-Ebola Investigational New Drug [IND] application to a partial clinical hold.

"We view this news as extremely positive, as this paves the way for TKM-Ebola to potentially be used in the treatment of individuals currently infected with the ebolavirus," writes David Novak, an analyst with Clarus Securities. He said TKM-Ebola is presently the most clinically advanced therapeutic in development, "being the only one to have entered formal, regulated human safety testing." In addition, Tekmira has developed a scalable cGMP manufacturing process, which enables the company to produce sufficient quantities of therapeutic compounds for human use, unlike other preclinical alternatives. "We remain confident that Tekmira is actively pursuing discussions with the FDA to advance a special emergency protocol for use of TKM-Ebola in infected humans and expect further details in the short term," he added.

This is the 2nd batch of material assistance offered by China to the countries of West Africa. The 1st batch of medical equipment for prevention and treatment of the virus, worth around one million yuan [USD 162 000] arrived in the country in May [2014]. Moreover, China also sent medical teams to these countries to help in the treatment of infected people. The ebolavirus outbreak continues expanding, especially in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The United Nations and the World Health Organization requested international assistance to fight against the epidemic.

Nigeria: 2 more cases
----------------------
8 Aug 2014: The federal government on Fri 8 Aug 2014 has said that 2 new cases of Ebola virus disease infection have been confirmed in Lagos. This brings to 7 the number of new cases of EVD in Lagos and a 2nd death from the virus. Also, the federal government warned against bathing with salt water being circulated via SMSs [texts] and the social media as a cure for EVD, saying it will prosecute individuals who spread such false information. Vanguard gathered that 139 people are under surveillance in Africa's most populous country as panic over the spread of the diseases heightens.

Nigeria: salt therapy dangerous
--------------------------
8 Aug 2014: At least 2 persons have been feared killed and 20 others hospitalised in various hospitals in Plateau State after consuming excessive quantities of salt and bitter kola [see http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/411030.stm] to prevent Ebolavirus disease (EVD). The 2, according to a source in Shendam who spoke with our reporter on the phone, were rushed to the hospital by their family members after they suddenly collapsed in the morning, having consumed too much salt overnight. They later died of high blood pressure in the hospital. According to medical personnel in the hospitals where the other patients are currently taking treatment in Jos, some developed ulcers, while others had severe diarrhea, having consumed table salt in excess.
