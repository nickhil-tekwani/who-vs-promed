The City Council of Alhama de Murcia has agreed to close the heated
indoor swimming pool in this town because of an outbreak of molluscum
contagiosum in several children who have used it, local sources
reported. In the middle of this week [beginning 17 Nov 2008], the
Department of Health and Sports took preventive action after
pediatricians had seen several children with skin eruptions.

Molluscum contagiosum virus is spread through contact with the skin
of someone infected, as well as various things, which children use
for exercises and games in the pool, but not through water. According
to the council, it is likely that the infection was spread by someone
who was already suffering from it and who used the pool.

It is a benign infection that acts on the skin and is characterized
by a few clearly defined, flesh-colored, translucent, dome-shaped
papules, which usually appear on the trunk, the face, and the
extremities.

[Molluscum contagiosum is a common benign skin disease that is caused
by a poxvirus, classified as the single species in the genus
_Molluscipoxvirus_ in the subfamily _Chordopoxvirinae_. Molluscum
contagiosum virus has not been propagated in cultured cells, but
restriction-fragment length analysis suggests that at least 4 strains
exist.

Molluscum contagiosum virus usually infects children and is endemic
worldwide. Transmission is mechanically by direct contact (sexually
or non-sexually) or via infected fomites. Outbreaks have involved
children attending swimming pools and users of Turkish baths.
Diagnosis is generally made on the basis of appearance of the
lesions. Skin biopsy may be necessary in immunocompromised patients
to exclude other conditions such as malignancy or endemic fungal
infections. (Infected cells contain characteristic cytoplasmic
inclusions). Infection may recur.

Molluscum infection causes small white, pink, or flesh-colored bumps
or growths with a dimple or pit in the center. The bumps are usually
smooth and firm and can appear anywhere on the body. They may become
sore, red, and swollen but are usually painless and normally
disappear within 6 to 12 months without treatment and without leaving
scars. In people with weakened immune systems, molluscum growths may
grow very large, spread more easily to other parts of the body and
may be harder to cure. There are no associated systemic symptoms.

To prevent spread of the infection to others, children with molluscum
contagiosum should not take part in contact sports unless all growths
can be covered by clothing or bandages. Activities that use shared
gear should also be avoided unless all bumps can be covered. Swimming
should also be avoided unless all growths can be covered by
watertight bandages. Personal items (such as towels, goggles, and
swim suits) should not be shared.
