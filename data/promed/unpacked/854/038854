It is my pleasure to share with you the information I have about the new
outbreak in Germany. Fortunately, I just had several telephone
conversations with friends of mine in Germany, who are familiar with the
Classical Swine Fever (CSF) situation there.
In January, CSF was diagnosed in one of the big eastern German sow units
(5,500 sows and 64,000 pigs altogether under one roof). The veterinary
authorities reacted very swiftly and all swine herds that had received
weaners or feeder pigs from this unit from Nov. 11, 1997, until the pigs of
the big unit were culled, were destroyed. I do not know the exact number of
culled herds as of today, but I think it is at least around 20. Apart from
one or two of those herds, none of them had shown either clinical disease
or serological reactors, i.e. the vast majority of the culling is
"preventive". Compared to the CSF epidemic in 1993 to 1995, the reaction of
the veterinary authorities, the swine practitioners, and the pork producers
has so far been calm, cooperative and shows much more understanding of the
necessity to cope with a CSF-outbreak without vaccination. Most people
think that the outbreak will be soon under control.
As for the source of infection of the initial outbreak in the eastern
German sow unit, there is no final decision on the introduction of the
virus; this is the more the case, since the unit is regarded as a well
managed herd with an extraordinarily good (at least above average)
biosecurity. However, the most likely assumption is that Polish seasonal
workers could have brought in some food originating from Poland (German
food is extremely expensive for them and saving every deutsche mark makes
sense to them), and with the food possibly the virus was introduced into
the herd. The second likely-assumption is the indirect transmission of the
virus from local wild boar, in which the CSF virus is still endemic in some
pockets in this area. Please note that these two theories really are
nothing more than speculation.
All in all, I really think (and hope) that this outbreak will be well
tackled and will soon be history and another contribution to the learning
curve for the German pork producers and swine practitioners that "CSF is
not an unpreventable fate, but can be brought under control and, if all
known facts about its epidemiology are taken into consideration, can be
eradicated".

[Presumably the suggested explanations can be readily tested if the German
authorities are comparing today's classical swine fever virus (CSFv) PCR
finger-prints with those of CSFv from Poland, other recent European
outbreaks, the previous German outbreaks, and the virus(es) circulating in
the local boars. Apparently they are currently subtyping the virus at the
Federal Institute for Animal Virological Diseases, Riems Island. - Mod.MHJ
