Re: Kyasanur forest disease vaccine
-----------------------------------
Regarding Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), an effective and safe
vaccine has been available for over 15 years. 88 152 persons were
immunized in trials during 1990 to 1992, with no report of adverse
effects. The formalin-inactivated vaccine is prepared from tissue
culture, and administered at a dose of 1.0 ml subcutaneously (0.5 ml
below age 6), with a booster dose after 4 weeks.

The geographic distribution of this group of viruses is not
restricted to Karnataka. For example, 22.4 percent of persons living
in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were found to be seropositive
for KFD in 2002; and human infection by closely related agents is
reported in Saudi Arabia (Alkhurma virus) and China (Nanjianyin
virus).
