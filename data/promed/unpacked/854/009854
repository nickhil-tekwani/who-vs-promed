A new avian influenza- [avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection] suspected 23-year-old patient residing at 10 RW 06, Sunter Agung, Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta has died. This is unexpected, because throughout 2011, avian influenza almost never occurred in Jakarta. The patient was buried in Budi Dharma Cemetery, Semper, Cilincing, North Jakarta last Sunday [8 Jan 2011].

The Head of the Public Health Control Section of North Jakarta Health Suboffice, Ati Kusmaningsih, said that: "There is high suspicion that the patient contracted avian influenza infection. Mucus samples from the patient's nose and throat and blood samples are being tested at the Health Research and Development Center of the Ministry of Health," she said.

The patient's 48-year-old mother said that her son's body was returned from Tangerang Regional Hospital. It had been bathed and immediately sealed in a coffin by the hospital. "When we prayed for him at home, we were not allowed to open the coffin," she said.

The patient had suffered high fever since New Year's Eve. On Mon 2 Jan 2012, he was brought to Satya Negara Hospital in Sunter, and there a doctor suspected he suffered from gastritis. The next day, he was treated at home, but his health did not improve, and he even could not get up unaided. On Wed 4 Jan 2012, he was taken back to Satya Negara Hospital where another doctor diagnosed dengue fever and heart problems, and he was admitted for treatment.

By Fri 6 Jan 2012, the doctor referred the patient to the Prof. Dr. Sulianti Saroso Hospital for Infectious Diseases, but he was not admitted because the hospital's Intensive Care Unit was full of patients. The next day, Saturday [7 Jan 2012], Satya Negara Hospital moved him to Tangerang Regional Hospital, which also has special facilities for avian influenza patients.

"But, before arriving at Tangerang Regional Hospital, my son had died," said his mother. The patient's 5-year-old youngest sister is also now suspected to have avian influenza infection. She is now being treated in a special avian influenza isolation room in Persahabatan Hospital.

A person suspected of being infected with bird flu [avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection], identified as a 23-year-old resident of Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, died on Sunday [8 Jan 2012]. The patient's body was sealed in a coffin by the Tangerang public hospital and was buried in Jakarta.

North Jakarta health agency's public health management unit head Ati Sukmaningsih said that, based on the examination of the patient's blood and mucus, he had died of bird flu. Samples of blood and mucus were further examined by the Health Ministry's research agency.

The victim's 48-year-old mother said her son had had a high fever since New Year's Eve and had been rushed to the Satya Negara hospital in North Jakarta. The hospital said that he might have suffered from a gastric infection. A few days later, the patient's family brought him back to the hospital, after which the hospital claimed that he might have been suffering from dengue [fever] and suggested that he stay at the hospital. On Friday 6 Jan 2012, a doctor recommended the patient be taken to the Sulianto Suroso infectious diseases hospital because the hospital has a special unit for handling cases of bird flu. However, the patient was rejected by the hospital because its intensive care unit was full. On Sat 7 Jan 2012, the patient was rushed to the Tangerang public hospital. "My son died on the way there," said his mother. She said her son had played with his sick pigeon before the incident.

The patient's 5-year-old sister is currently being treated at the Persahabatan hospital with the similar symptoms, according to the Kompas agency.

[Jakarta is the capital and largest city of Indonesia. Officially known as the Special Capital Territory of Jakarta, it is located on the northwest coast of Java and has an area of 661 square km and a population of 9 580 000. It is the most populous city in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia. The HealthMap interactive map of Java can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1CO1.

The outcome of the laboratory tests is awaited. On the basis of the description of the patient's symptoms, the diagnosis of avian a/(H5N1) influenza virus infection is inconclusive. If avian influenza virus infection is confirmed, this case will become the 183rd, and 151st fatality, in Indonesia since the 1st case was recorded in 2005, and the 1st case recorded in 2012. - Mod.CP]
