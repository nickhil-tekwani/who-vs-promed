Varicella cases have spiked in Gaffney, South Carolina, with 5 cases in just 2 days.

"My brother had them 1st, and he was 2," said Gaffney Mom of her chickenpox case at age 5. "My grandmother said to put 2 of us in the bath together with betadine." She said her soon-to-be son Jackson gets his vaccines soon.

"I just knew that it was the right thing to do," she said of vaccinations. "Do what's necessary to keep your child and others safe."

It's something Carolina Pediatric Associates nurse practitioner Dana Stanford wants other parents to know too.

"They can still have the virus, but typically it's not as bad as if they don't have the vaccine," said Stanford. "There's been a 90 percent decrease in the death rate since the chicken pox vaccine came out."

Carolina Pediatric Associates saw 5 chickenpox cases in just 2 days.

"We typically don't see any patients with the chickenpox, so any patient with chickenpox is a 100 percent increase," she said. "A few [patients] came in with a fever, exhibiting the headache, the tiredness, things like that, that may very well develop into the rash."

She says the office has reported this to the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).

She says the patients have a common contact point at a local daycare center. She says they're worried about the timing.

"It's very highly contagious," she said. "Once you're exposed to chickenpox, it takes about 2 weeks to develop the rash, so that's going to put us right around the start of school when the kids are in class together."

Stanford says they're not releasing the name of the daycare center, which has notified all the parents there.

[Since there is a single contact for the cases, it should be rather direct to make sure the children in the daycare center get vaccinated if they are not yet. - Mod.LK
