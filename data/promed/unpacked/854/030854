NORWALK-LIKE VIRUS, CRUISE SHIP - USA (FL) (13)

Question from a correspondent
-----------------------------
I'm an interested lay person with a question. In the ProMED-mail post
entitled: Norwalk-like virus, cruise ship - USA (FL) (11) it is stated
that: " Passengers on the Oceana began reporting classic symptoms of
Norwalk virus infection... ...within hours of the ship setting sail." I
don't know what the incubation period is for this illness, but has anyone
looked at the possibility that the exposure to this illness is occurring at
one or more hotels in the vicinity of these ports where passengers are
lodging prior to boarding ship?

[All the passengers on the Oceana were from the United Kingdom, and all the
sick passengers had flown to Florida on the same charter flight. As some of
the passengers became ill during the first day of the cruise it is likely
that they were exposed to the virus prior to boarding the ship, either en
route or in Florida prior to embarkation. These circumstances should enable
those investigating these outbreaks to provide an answer to the
correspondent's question - Mod.CP]
