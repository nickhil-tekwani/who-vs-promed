Red leg in frogs
------------------
In the early 1970s it was common practice to ship live amphibians by
rail or bus to rural high schools in western Canada for use in the
biology curriculum. If the bus was delayed, or if the heating system
allowed the frogs to become chilled, there were large die-offs due to
"red leg". At the time (I was, of course, a student then) we were
told that red-leg was caused by a virus that was dormant in frogs
unless they were "cold-shocked".
Alberta Wildlife Status Report No. 9 (1997) says: "Mortality in
Northern Leopard Frogs has often been associated with the condition
of "red leg", which is not a disease itself but rather a condition of
kidney failure. It is often associated with infection by _Aeromonas
hydrophila_, a naturally occurring and widespread bacterium.
Ordinarily, this pathogen only affects individuals whose immune
systems have been weakened by stress, and not entire populations."
Other useful information is available in Greg Lewbart's review
"Amphibian Medicine", stating the following in the chapter Important
Diseases - Red Leg Disease:
"_Aeromonas hydrophila_ is considered an opportunistic pathogen of
amphibians. It is essentially ubiquitous in aquatic environments. It
establishes itself in stressed or immunosuppressed animals."
