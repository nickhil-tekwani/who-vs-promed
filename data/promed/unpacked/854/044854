----------------------------------------------------
ProMED-mail has been informed by a reliable source in Pakistan that there have been no press reports of an extensive outbreak of mumps virus infection in Sindh province of Pakistan. In contrast there have been numerous press reports (See: ProMED-mail Measles updates (01) and (02) describing country-wide outbreaks of measles virus infection.

It seems likely that the report of fatalities associated with a province-wide outbreak of mumps virus infection (relayed by a Foreign News Agency) is erroneous -- possibly as a result of confusion arising from the identity of of the vaccine (Mumps, measles and rubella triple vaccine) employed in control of the outbreak of disease, and in part due to inaccurate statements (or interpretation of statements) by administrators in Sindh province.
