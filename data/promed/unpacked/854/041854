From: Dr. Christoph Staubach <epics01@wus.bfav.de>

Back from a short holiday of one week I found two e-mails in my electronic
post-office.
In this posting I detected a very important mistake: in Germany no(!)
occurrence of _Echinococcus granulosus_ is known and the possibility of
this tapeworm to infect foxes is only scientifically discussed.
[In prior communications, I referred to the tapeworm _Echinococcus
multilocularis_! Nevertheless, if the parasite is transmitted to humans,
the consequences could be dramatic.

[Obviously my memory had let me down, for which I apologise. However, it
would be appreciated if our German members could provide some hard data on
the incidence on _E. granulosus_ in humans, livestock, and wildlife in
Germany. Has there been an increase in autochthonous human cases? Or is
this an instance of risk-waving.
