[The mention of 'dipping/spraying' among the measures applied against
avian influenza is somewhat undefined. Dipping and spraying of animals
is generally related to insecticides, applicable in cases of diseases
involving arthropods or non-vertebrates, either as vectors (such as
tick fevers, arboviruses) or as direct disease agents (such as screw
worm). Explanation will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
