A Japanese house bat found dead in Yunlin last week [week 10-16 Apr 2017] tested positive for lyssavirus. Gene sequencing showed that it was 98.7 percent similar to the virus found in another Japanese house bat in November last year [2016].

[This novel virus was reported in November 2016 (see ProMED post 20161114.4627752).

Bats are the natural reservoirs of most lyssaviruses. Bat lyssaviruses, reported in Australia, Europe and Asia, are closely related but not identical to rabies virus. For some bat lyssaviruses there has been confirmation of their transmission from bats to humans.

Further research is needed to better characterize this new lyssavirus type and to assess its distribution and zoonotic potential.

Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove an effective preventative measure.

The Japanese house bat (_Pipistrellus abramus_) is found across East Asia. For a picture go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_house_bat#/media/File:Pipistrellus_abramus.jpg. - Mod.PMB
