Ranchers & Veterinarians: Watch for, report, signs of livestock
disease
------------------------
Livestock health officials are asking ranchers to check their
livestock regularly and immediately report signs of disease.
We're urging producers to keep a closer watch on their animals, in
light of recent events in our country, commented Dr. Linda Logan,
Texas' state veterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory agency. As
always, individual livestock producers and private veterinary
practitioners are our first line of defense when a livestock disease
is accidentally or intentionally introduced into the state. The
immediate reporting of suspicious or unusual conditions can make all
the difference in our ability to swiftly diagnose, control, and
eradicate a disease.
She said ranchers should watch for and report any of these signs:
1. Sudden, unexplained death loss in the herd or flock.
2. Severe illness affecting a high percentage of animals.
3. Blistering around an animal's mouth, nose, teats or hooves.
4. Unusual ticks or maggots.
5. Central nervous system disorders that cause an animal to stagger or
fall.
"The TAHC and Texas' USDA staff for months has maintained a 24-hour
hotline for disease reporting," said Dr. Jon Lomme, assistant area
veterinarian in charge of Texas for the US Department of Agriculture's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services
(USDA-APHIS-VS). "We take reports and dispatch a trained foreign
animal disease diagnostician to collect samples, evaluate the
situation, and take appropriate measures to protect livestock health.
There is no charge for the service."
To report suspicious signs, call 1-800-550-8242. After work hours,
follow the recorded instructions to page a veterinarian, commented
Dr. Logan. Be prepared to provide a description of the potential
disease signs and information regarding the location, species and
number of animals involved.
