New Jersey state officials shut down the Delaware Bay oyster beds
Tuesday [19 Aug 2008] after 2 people were sickened from _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ linked to oysters from those waters. The state
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) temporarily closed New
Jersey coastal waters from the Maurice River Cove south of Port
Norris northwest to Artificial Island, Salem County. The DEP dubbed
the closure a "precautionary" measure as waters are tested.

The 2 people fell sick from _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection after
eating New Jersey oysters in a Maryland restaurant, according to Dawn
Thomas, a spokeswoman for the NJ Department of Health and Senior Services.

Health officials traced the oysters back to the Ship John and
Shellrock oyster beds in the upper Delaware Bay, according to Barney
Hollinger, a veteran oysterman and head of the DEP's Delaware Bay
Shellfish Council.

The Department of Environmental Protection today [19 Aug 2008]
temporarily suspended shellfish harvesting from a portion of the
Delaware Bay after state health officials confirmed 2 cases of
illness from _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ linked to oysters harvested
from those New Jersey waters.

The temporary suspension is intended to protect public health while
the DEP continues testing shellfish from these waters.

_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is a bacterium that occurs naturally in
coastal waters, and is not related to human waste or pollution. It
thrives under warm temperatures and typically is linked to oysters
and other seafood harvested and consumed raw during the summer
months. It can cause illness, especially in people with compromised
immune systems. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal cramps and, less frequently, headache, fever, and chills.
On rare occasions, an infection in the bloodstream can occur.

About 130 square miles (337 sq km) of Delaware Bay are affected by
the temporary suspension of shellfish harvesting.

[Although generally associated with shellfish harvested from waters
along the Gulf of Mexico and southern USA, outbreaks have also
occurred from shellfish originating in waters as far north as
Washington State and Alaska.
