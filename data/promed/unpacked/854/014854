[1] Cholera - Nigeria (Ogun State)

No fewer than 20 persons, mostly children have been hospitalized following cholera outbreak in Idi-Araba NITEL area of Ikorita, Local Government Area of Ogun State. The epidemic was said to have affected four communities in the area and forced residents to flee.

Vanguard's investigation revealed that the abandoned refuse dumpsite in the area might have been responsible for the outbreak. It was gathered that residents used to dump refuse in a canal in the area which eventually blocked the drainage and wreaked a lot of havoc. At the time of this report, no fewer than 20 casualties were recorded including an old man.

Chairman, Ogo-Oluwa Community Development Area, Nurudeen Bisiriyu, told Vanguard that 4 communities had been affected. Bisiriyu also said the canal had been turned to refuse dumpsite and had led to the collapse of a building after a heavy downpour last week.
According to him, "about 20 children have been taken to hospitals because of the cholera. In fact, Alhaji Abu, whose house was behind the dumpsite has been diagnosed of the disease. We have written letters to the local government, the lawmaker from this place, Olakunle Oluomo, the Chairman and the health officials of the local government, but none of them has replied our letters."

When contacted, the Director of Information in the council, Prince Tola Osunlaja said the council had begun moves to relocate the dumpsite.
He however, explained that the dumpsite had been there before the present administration came on board, saying, notwithstanding, the council executive had secured another place to be used as a dumpsite.

[2] Cholera - Sudan (White Nile State)

More than 100 citizens in Sudan's White Nile state have suffered from watery diarrhoea, suspected of being cholera. A local hospital has received about 1000 diarrhea cases.

Hamid Ali, the Minister of Health in White Nile has denied that the infections among the 154 citizens were cholera. "All the laboratory tests attributed the infections to 2 reasons: contaminated water and vegetables." Ismail Nawai, the locality commissioner, said that the infection was caused by contaminated vegetables as well. The most recent victim was the resident engineer who was transferred to Khartoum for treatment from Zilaita area.

Ed Duwaim hospital has received about 1000 cases of watery diarrhoea. Reportedly, a number of people has died, although the number has not yet been specified. Dr Mohamed Abdel Gadir, the Medical Director of the hospital, has explained to Radio Dabanga that the high number of people suffering from the disease is owing to the contamination of drinking water throughout the state.

A local source told Radio Tamazuj last Friday [23 May 2014] that over 106 cases of diarrhea had been recorded in El Salam locality. 3 persons died.

[3] Diarrhea, not cholera - South Africa (North West Province)

Tests done to check for cholera in Bloemhof, in the North West, were negative, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said on Mon 2 Jun 2014.

"The tests were negative, so cholera has been excluded now," Professor Lucille Blumberg told Sapa. "The source of the problem is contaminated water and that needs to be fixed."

The institute was conducting more tests to check for other viruses, like those that cause gastroenteritis.

Earlier, the North West health department confirmed that two more babies had died from diarrhoea in Bloemhof, where water contamination left the town without water last week. "One baby was seven-months-old and the other was 13-months-old," said spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane. The circumstances surrounding their deaths were similar to the first baby that died last Wednesday, he said.

Dozens of residents went to local clinics to be examined last week following the contamination. Five babies were admitted to hospital for observation.

The Lekwa-Teemane municipality shut down its water supply system more than a week ago. The national water affairs department on Friday, 30 May 2014, said the system had been cleaned and sanitised, and water was restored on Thursday evening, 29 May 2014. But residents said the water coming out of taps was still brown on Friday, 30 May 2014, and residents were asked to boil the water first before using it.
