Widow sues Petsmart over husband's death
----------------------------------------
A widow is suing Petsmart Inc, saying that her husband died after a
liver transplant that was contaminated by a sick hamster sold by the
largest U.S. specialty pet retailer to the organ donor. The suit,
filed in Massachusetts Superior Court in February [2008], seeking
unspecified damages, moved up to U.S. District Court in Boston this
week [7-11 Apr 2008].

In papers filed in the state court, Nancy Magee charged that a
Petsmart in Warwick, RI, in March 2005 sold a hamster infected with
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to a woman not named in the
suit. That woman later died of stroke and her liver was implanted in
Magee's husband, Thomas, in April 2005. A month later, Thomas Magee
died of LCMV infection.

In addition, 2 other people who received organs from this woman died
and one became seriously ill, the suit says, noting that medical
authorities later tracked down the hamster in question and found it
to be infected with LCMV.

Petsmart spokeswoman Jessica Douglas said the Phoenix, AZ-based,
company does not comment on pending litigation.

[This is not the 1st occasion that lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV) has been identified as an organ transplant contaminant. The
foregoing story, however, adds an additional dimension, namely the
transmission of virus from an LCMV-infected pet rodent to an owner
who subsequently died as a result of unrelated illness and became an
organ donor, donating organs to 4 recipients, 3 of whom died
subsequently, and whose death in one case at least have been
attributed to LCMV infection.

LCMV is a rodent-borne viral infectious disease that presents as
aseptic meningitis (inflammation of the membrane, or meninges, that
surrounds the brain and spinal cord), encephalitis (inflammation of
the brain), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain
and meninges). Its causative agent is _Human Lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus_, a member of the family _Arenaviridae_.
Although LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological
disease, as its name implies, infection without symptoms or mild
febrile illnesses are common clinical manifestations. Additionally,
pregnancy-related infection has been associated with congenital
hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and mental retardation.

LCM and milder LCMV infections have been reported in Europe, the
Americas, Australia, and Japan, and may occur wherever infected
rodent hosts of the virus are found. However, the disease has
historically been underreported, often making it difficult to
determine incidence rates or estimates of prevalence by geographic
region. Several serologic studies conducted in urban areas have shown
that the prevalence of LCMV infection among humans ranges from 2
percent to 5 percent.

LCMV infection can be prevented by avoiding contact with house mice
and taking precautions when handling pet rodents (i.e., mice,
hamsters, or guinea pigs). Although rare, pet rodents may become
infected with LCMV from wild rodents. Pet owners should take measures
to prevent infestations of wild rodents. Pet rodents should not come
into contact with wild rodents.
