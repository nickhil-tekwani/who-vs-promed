The following background information on meningococcal disease in the United
States were extracted from the GIDEON software program:
Rates for meningococcal disease in the United States peak during late
winter and early spring, and are highest for the age group 3 to 12 months.
130,637 cases of meningococcal infection were reported during 1944 to 1983
(mean 3,265/year) - the yearly incidence did not changed appreciably during
this period.
Meningococcal infection was responsible for 7,154 deaths during 1961 to
1970; and 2,728 deaths during 1982 to 1991.
Cases of meningococcal infection reported in the US by year:
1991 2,130
1992 2,134 (201 fatalities)
1993 2,637 (260 fatalities)
1994 2,886 (276 fatalities)
1995 3,243 (273 fatalities)
1996 3,437
1997 3,117

The age-adjusted mortality rate for meningococcal disease is approximately
0.2/100,000/year; and the case/fatality rate 11.5% for septicemia, and 13%
for meningitic disease.
21 outbreaks (230 cases) of group C meningococcal disease were reported
during 1980 - 1992. During 1989 to 1991, 46% of meningococcal isolates were
group B and 45% group C. High rates of group B disease were reported in
Oregon and Washington State in 1994.
