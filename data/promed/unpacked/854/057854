INFLUENZA, INCREASED CASE LOAD - USA (CALIFORNIA)

[No, no! The deadly H5N1 has not struck California. It is just that
ProMED-mail has been receiving reports of increased hospital admissions
("ER rooms flooded", "Hospital beds filling", "Gurneys in hallways", etc.)
due to "influenza" at various sites in the U.S. Some weeks ago we received
a similar report about hospitals in Perth, Western Australia. As there is
nothing at all unusual about an increase in influenza at this time of year
in the U.S., I chose to put these reports on a back burner. In the past
ProMED-mail has rarely posted reports of influenza; our coverage of the
H5N1 episode is based on its being a possible emerging disease.
Nonetheless, we have received information about the recent influenza
activity in southern California and we are posting this as a courtesy to
our readers and in view of the recent and current Hong Kong situation. We
shall not continue such reports unless we find the situation becoming
extremely unusual. - Mod.CHC]

Ed Schroder, Managing Editor, ProMED-mail, today succeeded in obtaining a
telephone interview with Rob Schechter, M.D., Medical Epidemiologist,
Division of Communicable Disease Control, California Department of Health
Services. He indicated the following:
1. A number of hospitals in Southern California have seen recent increases
in patient visits to Emergency Rooms and some increase in admissions. Some
(unspecified) fraction of the visits/admissions were due to influenza. The
increase began shortly before Christmas. The increased case load has
caused diversion of some ambulances to alternate hospitals when Emergency
Room personnel were already working at capacity.
2. Surveillance laboratories have seen a marked increase in isolates of
influenzavirus A, and also in positive results for rapid tests for
influenza A. Again, these increased positive results commenced shortly
before Christmas.
3. All strains isolated have been A (H3N2), and all so far have been Wuhan
strains or Wuhan-like strains. There is a program of ongoing surveillance
for influenza A-Sydney-like strains, but none has yet been identified. The
strains isolated since a few days before Christmas have not yet been typed,
but these results will be available during the next two weeks.
4. There have been no cases if H5N1 influenzavirus isolations.
5. One influenzavirus B has been isolated so far this season, but that
isolate was found in Northern California.

Health officials say [southern California] emergency rooms are overcrowded
with patients suffering from the flu. According to Virginia Hastings,
director of county Emergency Medical Service, many area hospitals have
requested that no more ambulance transports be received because the
hospitals are filled.
A TV station reported that many hospitals are referring flu patients to
other facilities so they can deal with more critical cases. County
officials say they don't want to dissuade someone with a true emergency
from coming in for treatment, but they are discouraging unnecessary visits.
Patients, many of them elderly, are coming in with typical flu-like
illnesses such as high-fever, cough, sore throat and general aches and
pains, which last three to five days, said Dr. Shirley Fannin, chief of
county disease control.
Fannin says there is no evidence of an unusual type of influenza in Los
Angeles County this year. She added there have been no reports in this
county of the avian, or "bird" influenza that killed four people in Hong
Kong.
The Los Angeles Health Department issued some guidelines on how to treat a
cold or flu at home and how to determine when it is necessary to see a
doctor.
