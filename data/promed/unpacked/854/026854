[The ongoing panzootic of ASF started in April 2007 in the Caucasus region, initially discovered in western Georgia, in the vicinity of the Black Sea port-city of Poti. It subsequently spread westwards (mainly affecting wild boar) and eastwards, reaching as far west as (recently) eastern Germany, and - on the east through Russia's Asian provinces and into China (August 2018). Since then, ASF has continued its spread into the other 15 territories in Asia and the pacific (Papua New Guinea), as addressed in the above FAO update.

ASF, a viral, non-zoonotic disease is regarded endemic in sub-Saharan Africa; so far, there is no vaccine against this disease.
