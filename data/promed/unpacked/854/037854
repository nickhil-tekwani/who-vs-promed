People with leprosy might be being misdiagnosed because of the rarity of the disease in Britain, doctors will be told on Monday [30 Jun 2014]. Dermatologists from Cardiff reported 2 cases in which men who had moved to Britain from Asia were initially thought to have more common skin complaints.

Ausama Atwan, who will outline the concerns at the Glasgow conference of the British Association of Dermatologists, said the team were not out to alarm people, "but it is certainly something that doctors should be mindful of if they encounter patients, especially those originally from endemic countries, with persistent or unexplained lesions, changes to skin pigmentation and sensation."

Given the disease's rarity in Europe, Atwan said, "it may easily be misdiagnosed and consequently pose future health risks for patients if missed." There have been no cases confirmed of patients acquiring the disease or catching it from someone else in England and Wales for 60 years. However, there were 129 cases "imported" from people who had lived in endemic countries, often in south Asia, reported between 2001 and 2010. Public Health England (PHE) said another 38 occurred between 2011 and 2013. Nearly 233 000 cases were reported globally in 2012.

The cases identified at the University Hospital of Wales in 2010 and 2013 were in men who came from Asia. One was 25 [years old] and had experienced changes to his skin colour and sensation on the left side of his face. He had at 1st been treated for a skin infection and a rash. The other, aged 35 [years old], had patches of skin lightening over his body, raised red areas on his forehead, and circular lesions on his legs. He had been 1st diagnosed as having a type of eczema.

Leprosy is not highly contagious, and the bacteria responsible multiply slowly, so the disease can take [up to] 20 years to become apparent. Reduced circulation, muscle loss, and ultimately limb deformity and disability only occur in a minority of cases. With early detection and the correct multi-drug treatment, it is curable. American researchers hope to start trials of a vaccine next year [2015].

Prof. Ibrahim Abubakar, PHE's expert on leprosy, said: "Although rare in the UK, it is important that people with suspected leprosy receive early diagnosis and expert treatment using the Public Health England guidance published in the Memorandum on Leprosy."

Doctors in Scotland are being warned to look out for leprosy cases masquerading as more common skin diseases. The contagious condition is commonly thought to have been eradicated in the UK, but newly diagnosed cases have raised fresh fears about the chronic infection. The warning is being issued to 1300 doctors at a medical conference in Glasgow this week. It comes after dermatologists in Cardiff came across 2 leprosy cases in clinics. The victims had originally been diagnosed as having skin complaints.

Patients who travel to areas where the disease is prevalent are also at risk, and it can have a long incubation period before symptoms appear.

The 2 men diagnosed with leprosy at the University Hospital of Wales had moved to the UK from Asia in the past few years. The 1st, aged 25 [years], had been experiencing changes to the colour of his skin on the left side of his face for 6 months and to his right shoulder for up to a year. The symptoms on his face had been misdiagnosed as a skin infection called erysipelas, while his shoulder was treated as a rash called pityriasis versicolor.

Doctors thought the 2nd victim, aged 35 [years], had a form of eczema. Both men were correctly diagnosed after being referred to dermatologists.

Left untreated, leprosy can lead to the loss of limbs.

[Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_. This disease is still a major health problem in the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Western Pacific region. Transmission is thought to occur following close, prolonged contact with a case of lepromatous leprosy, usually within a household setting. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to spread the disease. Tourists from non-endemic regions traveling briefly through countries where leprosy is endemic very rarely acquire leprosy (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.2310/7060.2005.12307/asset/7060.2005.12307.pdf;jsessionid=318ADB2708F66CD7CA25FD4FA19EEFAB.f03t03?v=1&t=hx2ghx45&s=7844499eb0ed008caa8abb7479aaed096d2ac971.)

Because lepromatous patients excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions, the mode of spread is likely respiratory or nasal discharge. As the organism is also present in skin lesions of patients with lepromatous leprosy, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Fomites are an additional potential source of infection. _M. leprae_ can persist on surfaces in the environment (Desikan KV, Sreevatsa. Extended studies on the viability of _Mycobacterium leprae_ outside the human body. Leprosy Review 1995; 66(4):287-295. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8637382), and _M. leprae_ from the environment and the patients have been found to exhibit the same genotype (Turankar RP, Lavania M, Singh M, Siva Sai KS, Jadhav RS. Dynamics of _Mycobacterium leprae_ transmission in environmental context: deciphering the role of environment as a potential reservoir. Infect Genet Evol. 2012 Jan;12(1):121-6. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101333).

In the Western Hemisphere, armadillos are another possible source. Armadillos, mammals that are found in 5 southern states in the US (Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas), Mexico, Central, and South America, are naturally infected with _M. leprae_. (Armadillos in more eastern US states, which originated from a separate introduction of armadillos into Florida, are not known to be infected with _M. leprae_).

In the US, about 150 new cases of leprosy are reported yearly. About 70 percent of these cases are "imported," as are the cases in the UK, i.e., they acquired their disease when they lived or worked in leprosy-endemic regions outside the US or UK; however, about 30 percent of new cases in the US report no foreign residence in regions where the disease is prevalent and, therefore, likely acquired leprosy in the US. Most of these indigenously acquired cases reside in Texas and Louisiana, where wild _M. leprae_- infected armadillos can be found.

A recently reported study analyzed the genomes of _M. leprae_ collected from 50 unrelated US patients with multibacillary leprosy and 33 armadillos that were captured in the wild in the 5 southern states in the US (Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) where armadillos are known to harbor _M. leprae_ (Truman RW, Singh P, Sharma R, et al. Probable Zoonotic Leprosy in the Southern United States. N Engl J Med 2011; 364:1626-1633. 28 Apr 2011. Available at: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010536). 39 of the 50 patients reported residence in Mexico or US states with leprosy-infected armadillos, and 29 of the 39 reported no foreign residence. Genotyping confirmed the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ in 28 of the 33 armadillos and in 22 of 29 patients who had never lived outside the US and Mexico and who resided in states with leprosy-infected armadillos. Interviews with 15 of the leprosy patients further revealed that 8 had had direct contact with armadillos. This genotype has not been reported previously elsewhere in the world. In patients whose risk was foreign residence only, the genotype was typical for the strains found in that foreign region.

Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months, and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months. Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. - Mod.ML
