Trypanosomiasis from Luangwa river, Eastern Zambia
--------------------------------------------------
Trypanosomiasis was confirmed in Johannesburg in a young woman resident in
Lusaka, Zambia who presented with an acute febrile illness 4 days after
returning from a 5 day visit to the Luangwa river area in Eastern Zambia.

She experienced multiple tsetse fly bites while hiking in the area, but did
not travel into the National Park. The diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was not
initially suspected and she received treatment with artemisinin combination
therapy for suspected malaria and then doxycycline for suspected tick bite
fever based on the presence of an 'eschar' and macular papular rash.

The patient developed profound leucopenia and thrombocytopaenia, and a
transaminitis and was transferred to Johannesburg for further medical care.
East African trypanosomiasis was suspected on the basis of the history of
exposure to tsetse flies in an area with well- documented trypanosomiasis,
and the finding of a typical trypanosomal chancre.

Her illness has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome,
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and hepatic dysfunction. Suramin
treatment has been commenced, supportive care initiated, and a
cerebrospinal fluid examination will follow.

[This case was infected in the same area -- Luangwa river -- as the
previous case in a US traveler, which ProMED-mail reported on 13 Sep 2010.
Two cases were imported to the UK, one had visited Zambia and the other
Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe (close to the Lake Kariba region in
Zimbabwe in Mashonaland West, and on the border with the Southern province
of Zambia.)

The US traveler was on a hunting safari in a reserve in the South Luangwa
river valley in eastern Zambia just south of the South Luangwa National Park.

Of note, another case of travel-related trypanosomiasis was reported in
August 2010 in the monthly bulletin of the South African National Institute
of Communicable Diseases (Communicable Diseases Communique
<http://www.nicd.ac.za/pubs/communique/2010/NICDCommAug10Vol09_08.pdf>,
page 5). - Mod.EP
