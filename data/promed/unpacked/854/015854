Porcine plague - [Ministry of Agriculture sacrifices 1400 pigs from 2
farms in Titaguas (Valencia) for "suspect symptoms"
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture has ordered as a preventive measure the
slaughter of 1400 pigs from 2 farms in Titaguas (Valencia), within the
region of Los Serranos, on the basis of "suspicious symptoms," although the
laboratory confirmation is still pending. This was announced by the
director in an official notice.
Yesterday they began the slaughter of some 4000 pigs from 5 farms located
in the Alpuente municipality, located in the village of Corcolilla where
one of the analyses was positive [for classical swine fever and as a
preventive measure the Ministry took the decision to cull the pigs from 4
farms located within a 1 kilometer radius of the first [farm where
classical swine fever had been confirmed.
The veterinary services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fishing and Foods
were carrying out a rigorous epidemiologic control in the Valencian
community. All of the tests for PPC [Classical swine fever conducted
outside of the zone of Los Serranos have been negative up to this date,
according to the director. The animals on 62 farms outside of the zone of
Los Serranos are being tested and at this time 1585 specimens have been
taken and found negative for [classical swine fever.
The Ministry of Agriculture will continue the epidemiologic controls to
avoid the spread of the disease outside of the affected zone, where they
are checking an additional 50 farms. In addition, results of the
epidemiologic investigations of 21 out of 22 farms checked by the
veterinarians were negative.
The director general of Agrarian Innovation and Cattle Ranching, Eduardo
Prima, was due to hold a technical meeting with members of the Committee
for Follow-up of [classical swine fever beginning at 18:00 [18 July to
give updates on what the ministry has done.
