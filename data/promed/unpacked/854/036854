More Crimean-Congo fever suspects land in Pindi hospitals
---------------------------------------------------------
The city hospitals on Thursday [30 Sep 2010] received 15 patients with
symptoms of the deadly Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) from
Chakwal and adjoining areas. A total of 11 patients were admitted to
Holy Family Hospital (HFH) and 2 each to District Headquarters (DHQ)
Hospital and Benazir Bhutto Hospital. The doctors said that [the
patients] had been suffering from fever for the last 6 days and some
of the patients' gums had started to bleed.

They said that the doctors suspected them to be patients with CCHF.
They were shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and their blood
samples were dispatched to the National Institute of Health (NIH) for
testing for CCHF and dengue fever. They said that the hospitals would
receive the blood test report on Friday [01 Oct 2010] and if the
patients tested positive for the disease the doctors would start to
provide medication in an isolation room.

Doctors at Holy Family Hospital said that as many as 7 patients came
from tehsil [administrative zone] Dhudyal, Chakwal; one patient from
Chakwal city and the rest [5] from Rawalpindi city. They said that 2
patients with symptoms of dengue and CCHF also came to hospital from
Chakwal but they expired on Wednesday night [29 Sep 2010]. They said
that the dead were handed over to their families on Thursday morning.
Talking to Dawn, Dr Javed Hayat of Holy Family Hospital said, "the
patients have been kept under observation in an ICU and their
treatment will start as soon as the hospital receives their blood test
report."

Replying to a query about the staff of the hospital who had contracted
the CCHF, Dr Hayat said that their condition was stable and they were
being provided with all available medical treatment. He said, "Though
the blood tests of the doctors were positive, no symptoms have
appeared."

The Benazir Bhutto Hospital medical superintendent, Dr Asif Qadir Mir,
said that the blood samples of 2 patients had been sent to the NIH and
they would receive a report on Friday [01 Oct 2010].

DHQ hospital medical superintendent Dr Sher Ali Khan also confirmed
that there were 2 patients in the hospital and the doctors suspected
them to be cases of CCHF. He said that the medical treatment of the
patients would be started after they received reports from the NIH.
However, he said that the doctors were monitoring the condition of the
patients in an isolation ward.

[If all of the suspected cases are confirmed by laboratory diagnostics
this outbreak will prove to among the largest outbreaks of CCHF
recorded in Pakistan. In addition to the nosocomial infections in the
HFH hospital in Rawalpindi, suspected patients are being referred from
different parts of Punjab province. The routes of exposure of these
patients and their occupations have not been disclosed.

Under normal conditions CCHF infection is restricted mainly to those
involved with the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers,
slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. It may be that the recent
disastrous flooding in the Indus valley has exposed humans to direct
infection from the _Hyalomma_ tick vector of CCHF virus. The most
important source for acquisition of CCHF virus by ticks is believed to
be the small vertebrates on which immature _Hyalomma_ ticks feed.

Further information is awaited on the outcome of the diagnostic tests
now in progress.

[Given the high index of suspicion of CCHF in these cases, it seems
dangerous to postpone treatment until the results of the blood tests
are known. One hopes that the families to whom the the expired
patients are returned have been told of the danger of contact with
their blood or excretions. It is again unclear whether the medical
staff in Holy Family Hospital are symptomatic or merely in isolation
under observation. - Mod.JW]
