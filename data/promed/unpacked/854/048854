Cases of the tick-borne infectious disease severe fever thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) are gradually increasing in number. This year [2022], there are 6 more than the 40 people at the beginning of June last year [2021], which was said to be the highest number ever. What's more, what used to be centered in western Japan is now expanding to eastern Japan. Last year [2021], it was confirmed for the 1st time in Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures.

This infectious disease has symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and bleeding, and is a life-threatening disease when it becomes severe.

Summer is the "season" of ticks, and local governments are calling attention to tick infections. They are urging prevention, such as not getting into the grass as much as possible, not exposing the skin, and not placing jackets or towels on the grass.

There are many other diseases transmitted by ticks, such as tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, and Japanese spotted fever. Prevention is important for that reason, but I feel that it has not been fully explained why tick infections are increasing recently.

SFTS is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever that was first reported in China in 2011, and was first confirmed in Yamaguchi prefecture in 2013 in Japan. It's a relatively new infectious disease.

However, the virus did not come into existence recently, and it must have been in ticks for a long time. It must have been "discovered" because it began to infect humans.

The reason people have started to get infected is probably not because the number of people entering the mountains has increased. Although Japan is said to be in a camping boom, many people with tick infections had not entered the mountains recently.

Rather, it is possible that ticks have come down to where people live.

The carriers are wild animals entering populated areas. These are wild boars, deer, raccoons, raccoon dogs, weasels, and many other wild animals descending from the mountains to less remote areas. Antibodies to the SFTS virus have been found in them. The number of these wild animals has increased explosively in recent years, expanding their habitat from mountains to less remote areas. They are also appearing not only in the satoyama [border zone or area between mountain foothills and arable flat land] of farming and mountain villages of Okuyama, but also in urban areas in considerable numbers.

Wild animals drop ticks which are then picked up by rats. From there, it is possible that they infect feral cats and then spread to free-range domestic cats. In addition to domestic cats, there are cases of infection in domestic dogs. And from dogs and cats the ticks go to humans., who may spread ticks, and the virus widely.

[SFTS virus is actively transmitted again this year (2022) and its geographic range in Japan is increasing. SFTS has been occurring sporadically in Japan since 2013, and SFTS virus has become established there. Cases were widely dispersed geographically in 2018, with 24 prefectures reporting infected individuals. There were 96 cases in the 1st 11 months of 2019 (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd - Japan 20210705.8495328). SFTS is likely underreported in some areas. SFTS should be included in differential diagnoses when cases of _Rickettsia japonica_ infections are suspected. Since there is no vaccine, the best way to avoid infection is to avoid tick bites and contact with infected pets, especially cats.

As noted earlier, SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the previous numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS-virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids was not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of a longhorn tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
