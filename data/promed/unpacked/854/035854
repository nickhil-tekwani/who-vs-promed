Signs are increasing that camels are involved in spreading a deadly new virus that surfaced in the Middle East last year [2012]. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced today [29 Nov 2013] that researchers had detected Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in a herd of camels in Qatar linked to 2 recent human cases. "This is a very important piece of the puzzle," says Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. So far, the virus has sickened 160 people and killed 68.

The finding was part of an investigation into 2 patients from Qatar who both contracted MERS but survived. Qatari officials took samples from the environment and numerous animals at the farm where the 2 worked. Researchers in the Netherlands detected MERS coronavirus RNA in nose swabs from 3 of the 14 camels tested. The scientists confirmed the result by sequencing a fragment of the virus. "Based on the length of the sequence we are absolutely certain that this is MERS," says Marion Koopmans, chief of virology at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, who was involved in the work.

Scientists suspect bats as the ultimate source of the new virus, but human interactions with bats are limited so another animal species may act as a bridge. In August 2013, Koopmans and other scientists reported that they had found antibodies against MERS coronavirus in 50 out of 50 camels from Oman. They also tested sheep, goats, and cows but found no antibodies. Whether the camels really were infected with MERS remained unclear, however. Earlier this month [November 2013] Saudi officials announced that a camel owned by a MERS patient had tested positive for MERS as well but they have not presented any sequence data to date.

The result from the Qatari camels does not prove that the virus is transmitted from camels to humans. Infected humans could also have transmitted it to the camels and other animals may also be involved. "We have to be careful about assuming that this is just in camels," says Osterholm. "If camels can be infected then it's very likely that other domestic animals can be infected as well." Virologist Ab Osterhaus who was involved in the work, confirmed to ScienceInsider that other animals including pigeons, chicken, and sheep were being tested as well, but did not want to discuss preliminary findings. Researchers were also trying to piece together the whole viral sequence found in the camel samples, he said.

Even if they succeed and the link to camels is confirmed many questions about the outbreak remain open. It is not clear, for instance, how many of the observed cases are linked to human-to-human transmissions and how many were animal-to-human. Osterholm also points out that many mild cases in humans may be being missed. Saudi Arabia has only been looking for the virus in patients in intensive care, he says. "That is like the drunk looking for his lost keys only under the street light because that is where there is light."

Osterholm praises Qatar for its efforts. "The public health officials in Qatar deserve a great deal of credit for their aggressive actions in investigating this situation and involving the relevant international laboratory partners," he says.

Health officials in Qatar have announced they have found the MERS coronavirus in 3 camels from a farm where 2 people also contracted the virus.

While scientists are still trying to isolate the full virus from samples taken from the camels, the multiple fragments of RNA recovered are conclusive that the virus is MERS, Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist who is leading the laboratory work on the investigation, said in an interview.

"We have definitive proof that it's MERS coronavirus," Koopmans said in an interview from the Netherlands on Thursday [28 Nov 2013].

The viral fragments were isolated from nose swabs taken from the camels, Koopmans said.

But finding infected camels and infected people on the same farm does not prove that the former transmitted the virus to the latter, she said.

It is theoretically possible that the camels contracted the virus from the people ­- 2 men, both of whom survived their brush with MERS. Or some other animal or animals on the farm may have played a role in the transmission dynamic.

"How they (the camels) got it and what the relationship (to humans) is, that still remains open, I think," said Koopmans, who is chief of virology for the National Institute of Public Health for the Netherlands.

She praised the Qatari investigators, saying the work done on the farm was thorough and carefully done, with lots of information and specimens gathered. Scientists in the Netherlands ­- who were asked to help ­- are still testing samples from other animals, and sifting through the information the Qataris gathered. There are only a few laboratories in the world that are equipped to do this type of work.

Koopmans cautioned against jumping to conclusions at this point.

"We have to put everything together carefully and then see what it tells us," she said. "It's still very much an ongoing investigation, so I think we need to really piece the information together."

To date the World Health Organization has confirmed 160 infections with the new virus, which is from the same family as the SARS coronavirus. All of the infections either occurred in, or have links back to, 6 countries in the Middle East: Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait.

In the 14 months since the world learned there was a new coronavirus spreading on the Arabian Peninsula, suspicion has often focused on camels. That's because from time to time there have been reports that an infected person owned camels or attended camel races. But the WHO says many of the people who have contracted this virus reported no contact with the beasts.

The working hypothesis is the virus originated in bats, as SARS likely did before it. But people typically don't have a lot of contact with bats, and scientists have assumed some animal or animals is playing a bridging role, transmitting MERS to people.

Koopmans and colleagues uncovered a big clue earlier this year [2013], finding antibodies to MERS or a similar virus in camels from Oman and the Canary Islands. A later study found them in camels in Egypt as well.

But antibodies signal prior exposure to a pathogen. To confirm that camels play a role in this story, science needs evidence of current infection ­- which is what the Qatar team is reporting.

Earlier this month [November 2013] the deputy minister of health for Saudi Arabia, Dr. Ziad Memish, also reported a similar finding from a single camel in that country. Memish said at the time that work was underway to compare the genetic sequences of viral material taken from the camel and the man who owned him, who had also contracted the virus.

Memish has not responded to repeated requests for information on how that work is progressing.

Koopmans said the findings will answer some questions but raises others.

"This is our 1st clue which further fills out the whole story," agreed Bart Haagmans, a Dutch virologist who is involved in the laboratory side of this investigation.

"But there's more work to do, especially on routes of transmission."

Haagmans, who is with Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, said the team believes the findings are solid. They used 3 different tests, and found multiple fragments of viral RNA. As well, he said, the camels have developed antibodies to MERS.

What remains to be discovered ­- the key question the WHO would like to see answered ­- is how people are becoming infected with this virus. It is also critical to find out how much of a role animal-to-person spread is playing at this point and how much transmission is person to person.

"For sure there is a part of the outbreak that is caused by human-to-human transmission," Haagmans said.

"The question is, what is the fraction of these cases? And how many independent introductions do you have through zoonotic (from an animal) transmission?"

[The above information, to which we have been kindly referred by Helen Branswell, clarifies that the tests were apparently carried out in material from camel nasal swabs, identifying "multiple fragments of RNA"; serology was applied as well. Qatar has submitted an official notification to the OIE, reporting MERS-CoV in camels as an "emerging disease." The diagnosis was reportedly obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). No clinical signs were reported; this, different from the 12 Nov 2013 report from Saudi Arabia (albeit, not to the OIE) which indicated that the camels, tested for MERS-CoV and found positive, "were symptomatic with fever and rhinorrhea" (see posting 20131112.2051424). Clinical observations of the camels on the affected barn in Qatar will be helpful.

The diagnosis of MERS-CoV in camels in Qatar has been endorsed by the WHO and OIE, apparently based upon PCR results; the virus has not been isolated yet. A scientific report describing the basis upon which the similarity between the human MERS-CoV and the camel-derived material has been demonstrated, is anticipated with much interest.

As rightly indicated by the interviewed scientists and underlined in OIE's Questions and Answers (see posting 20131129.2082115), the possibility of camel infection as being related to human disease is yet to be thoroughly studied. - Mod.AS
