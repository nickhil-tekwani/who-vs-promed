Several patients have been admitted to the regional Infectious
Diseases Hospital with botulism, reported a correspondent of IA
Regnum. Doctors say that the incidence of this dangerous food
poisoning traditionally increases with the beginning of summer.
"Spores of the agent exist in soil, and fish swallow it with silt.
Then, if the technology of drying fish is not followed, the toxin can
enter the human organism," said Olga Firyulina, the Head of the ICU
of the Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital of the Zaporozhye Region
(RIDHZ). The toxin is not equally distributed in the food, so not all
are affected if an infected food is consumed.
It is not possible to treat this infection in home-based settings. A
patient from the Akimowskiy Area (Zaporozhye Region, coast of Azov
sea) who tried to do so is still unconscious a day after admission.
The Head of the Resuscitation Unit, Dr. Dmitrij Musik, said that this
patient stayed at home for 4 days and called an ambulance after
falling ill seriously. "We were forced to switch the patient to
mechanical ventilation," the doctor said.

The method of diagnosis of botulism is not stated here. Individual
cases of the paralysis can be confused with other diseases, but a
cluster of such cases is certainly likely to be botulism. Type E
botulism is the type frequently associated with fish products (1).
Classically, botulism is a food borne disease caused by the ingestion
of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in
which _C. botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant
botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).
Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although each
type has a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that
type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status
and more autonomic dysfunction (2).
