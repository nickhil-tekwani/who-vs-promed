Alert: 1st soybean rust found in Kentucky on kudzu
--------------------------------------------------
The USDA confirmed the presence of Asian soybean rust (ASR) on Friday
(19 Nov 2005) on a single kudzu leaf collected the week before (11
Nov 2005) in Caldwell County, Kentucky. The find is the 1st in that
state and now the northernmost U.S. ASR location this year [2005].
University of Kentucky plant pathologist Don Hershman found only one
leaf with ASR lesions and pustules among several he picked up in a
Princeton kudzu patch in western Kentucky. He said that after several
trips back to the same kudzu patch, he could not find another
infected leaf.
As the suspected rust sample was the 1st in Kentucky, it was sent to
the USDA lab in Beltsville, Maryland for confirmation. It was
confirmed by real-time PCR and microscopic observation on 18 Nov
2005. Kentucky becomes the 9th U.S. state affected by ASR in 2005.
"The kudzu patch in question has since been killed back by freezing
temperatures," Hershman said. Before cold weather arrived, he said,
Kentucky plant disease diagnostician Paul Bachi found no ASR on
samples collected from Ballard, Fulton and Hickman counties in the
far western part of the state, or from Perry County in the southeast
corner of the state.
Hershman also said the kudzu patch with the infected leaf was about a
mile away from a spore trap at the UK Research and Education Center
that picked up "rust-like" spores 5 times this summer and fall
[2005]. Under the circumstances, it was not possible to confirm that
the spores were those of ASR.

[Most of the 2005 soybean crop has been harvested. Kudzu is most
likely the major host for perpetuation of the fungus. The fact that
ASR was found on kudzu in Kentucky is not surprising. The Piedmont,
more correctly called the Piedmont Plateau, lies between the coastal
plain and the Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern USA,
extending in an arc from Alabama through Georgia, South Carolina,
North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania to New Jersey. Kudzu
vine survives in zones 5 and 6, re-sprouting each spring, but the
frost-free periods in those regions are usually not long enough for
flower and seed production.
