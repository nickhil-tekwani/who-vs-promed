ProMED-mail's contact in Kenya has a new report that in Ijara, south of
Garissa, 6 people have died in 24 hours, making 25 since December 1, 1997.
There were active cases in Ijara at the time of the call, but the team in
Garissa was unable to get transport to the remote village [basically only
accessible by helicopter.
