Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Canada
-----------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 1 May 2015 from Dr Martine Dubuc, OIE Delegate for Canada, Chief Food Safety Officer Vice-President, Science Branch, Health Ministry, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canada

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 6 Feb 2015
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 13 Apr 2015
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (BC-2015-NAI-WB1): Abbotsford, British Columbia
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Feb 2015
Outbreak status: Resolved (6 Feb 2015)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
American wigeon: _Anas americana_ (Anatidae) / - / 1 / - / - / -
Affected population: BC-2015-NAI-WB1 juvenile American wigeon

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comments: Canada conducts surveillance for avian influenza in wild birds. In addition, enhanced surveillance was undertaken in wild birds in response to the event in poultry (H5N2) in the province of British Columbia (BC) in December 2014. This sample was collected in February 2015 as part of the enhanced surveillance undertaken by BC. The sample was received from the BC provincial laboratory by the Canadian Food inspection Agency (CFIA) National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) on 25 Mar 2015 for further testing. The results confirmed HPAI H5N8 virus with an IVPI [intravenous pathogenicity index] of 2.73. Sequencing of the H5N8 virus isolated indicates it is a wholly Eurasian H5N8 and very similar to the H5N8 virus that was isolated from the gyrfalcon in Washington State in December 2014. This is the 1st report of a detection of H5N8 HPAI virus in Canada. This virus has NOT been found in commercial poultry anywhere in Canada. In accordance with the Terrestrial Animal Health Code Article 10.4.1, Member Countries should not impose bans on the trade of poultry commodities in response to notification of influenza A virus in wild birds.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[According to comments made in the epidemiologic section of the report, "this is the 1st report of a H5N8 HPAI virus detection in Canada. This virus has not been found in commercial poultry anywhere in Canada."

"The bird carcass was collected from a wild bird sanctuary near Abbotsford, British Columbia as part of ongoing surveillance activities by the province of British Columbia. Wild bird surveillance is one of several ways that provincial/territorial governments, industry, and animal and public health practitioners monitor for notifiable avian influenza in Canada. The CFIA supports wild bird surveillance though the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC). The CWHC coordinates wild bird surveillance activities on behalf of federal, provincial, and territorial government partners.

According to OIE guidelines, the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in wild birds should not disrupt trade between member countries."

Increased surveillance and biosecurity in commercial poultry operations in Canada need to be maintained and/or strengthened to prevent the introduction of this and other subtype into commercial poultry flocks. - Mod.CRD
