Please note that TTV stands for TT virus - TT are the initials of the
patient from whom it was first isolated, _not_ an acronym for
transfusion-transmitted (Nishizawa et al 1997; BBRC 24, 92).
Given the very high prevalence of infection (>50% in some surveys), it's
not surprising that some transfusion recipients and hepatitis patients are
positive.

The "TT" in TT virus represents the initials of the patient from whom the
virus was isolated, not "transfusion-transmitted". Given the current
uncertainty as to the route(s) of transmission and the etiologic role in
human disease of TTV, the semantic distinction may be relevant.

A novel DNA virus (TTV) associated with elevated transaminase levels in
posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology.
Nishizawa T, Okamoto H, Konishi K, Yoshizawa H, Miyakawa Y, Mayumi M,
Immunology Division, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-Ken, 329-04, Japan.
By means of representational difference analysis, a viral clone (N22) of
500 nucleotides was isolated from serum of a patient (TT) with
posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. The N22 clone showed a poor
homology to any reported sequences. Oligonucleotide primers were deduced
from the N22 sequence for detecting it by polymerase chain reaction. N22
sequence in serum banded at a sucrose density of 1.26 g/cm3, indicating its
association with a viral particle which was designated TT virus (TTV).
Since nucleic acids of TTV were sensitive to DNase I, it would be a DNA
virus. TTV DNA was detected in sera from three of the five
patients with posttransfusion non-A to G hepatitis, including the index
case (TT). TTV DNA titers closely correlated with aminotransferase
levels in the three patients. These results indicate that TTV would be a
novel DNA virus with a possible capacity to induce posttransfusion
non-A to G hepatitis.

It would be useful to know whether:
1. these positive tests were antibody or antigen tests?
2. the positive participants who were tested had received
transfusions in
the past and when?
3. there are plans to test the positive participants' spouses or
partners?
4. the blood from positive participants will be given to primates
5. the positive participants will be followed to check for elevated liver
enzymes in future.

They are generally all transmitted that way, aren't they?
