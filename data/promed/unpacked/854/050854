The Ministry of Public Health has reported over 17 000 cases of dengue fever in Thailand this year [2012], resulting in 18 deaths from the illness.

Deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department, Dr Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoenchai, said this year [2012] dengue fever affected more adults than children.

In Amnaj Charoen province, a 48 year old woman recently died from dengue fever after visiting 3 hospitals in the area. Initial investigations indicated that she had experienced flu-like symptoms for 3 days before going to hospital.

Dr Suwanchai urged members of the public to consult a doctor if flu-like symptoms persist beyond 48 hours and to avoid taking aspirin tablets.

He added that sudden deaths often occur in 2nd infections with dengue virus.
