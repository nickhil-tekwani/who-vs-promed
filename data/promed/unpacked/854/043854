Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal neurological disease of deer, elk and moose, has been discovered in deer hunt area 97, bringing the known total of CWD areas in the Lander Region to 4; areas 97, 98, 157, and 87.

A mule deer doe from hunt area 97 was confirmed CWD positive by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's wildlife disease laboratory in Laramie on 3 Aug 2014. The animal was dispatched by wardens after being reported as acting strangely west of Muddy Gap. Hunt area 97 borders deer CWD endemic areas 87 and 89 to the east. Hunt area 89 became positive in 2002 and 87 in 2007.

After a review of available scientific data, the World Health Organization in December 1999 stated: "There is currently no evidence that CWD in cervidae (deer and elk) is transmitted to humans." In 2004, Dr. Ermias Belay of the Center for Disease Control said: "The lack of evidence of a link between CWD transmission and unusual cases of CJD, [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a human prion disease], despite several epidemiological investigations, suggests that the risk, if any, of transmission of CWD to humans is low." Nonetheless, to avoid risk, both organizations say parts or products from any animal that looks sick and/or tests positive for CWD should not be eaten.

Lander region personnel will continue to collect samples through hunter field checks and at CWD sampling stations.

[The regions and borders that a state uses to determine areas of risk may be based on risk or geography or both. With area 97 bordering an area already having a CWD positive animal, it is not entirely surprising that 97 has been found to have a positive animal. This article does not indicate whether the CWD positive animal was found near the border of this hunt area or in the center of the area.

While chronic wasting disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, there has been no evidence of this disease in people since deer were 1st found to have the disease in the 1960s.
