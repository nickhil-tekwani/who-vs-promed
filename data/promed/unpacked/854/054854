Deadly, incurable vanilla fungus hits Madagascar
------------------------------------------------
Madagascar farming officials say a deadly and incurable crop disease has
spread widely in the island's main vanilla-producing area. Assessment teams
say in a report released on Monday [8 Dec 2008] that the world's main
vanilla producer has to radically change farming methods to fight the fungus.

Malagasy agronomic research chief Simeon Rakotomamonjy says the situation
is "critical". He says the disease has hit 80 per cent of plantations
around Sambava and Andapa, 2 of 3 main centers of vanilla production on the
Indian Ocean island's north east coast.

Most of Madagascar's vanilla is exported to the United States, where it is
used for making confectionary, soft drinks, and ice cream.

Government scientists said the disease is carried by an underground fungus.
It has hit 80 per cent of plantations around Sambava and Andapa, but
surveys in the more isolated Antalaha region so far reveal only a trace of
the fungus.

Fungus spores attack a vanilla plant at the root, and a black rot spreads
upward, often killing pods before they reach maturity. The disease is known
for the moment only by its local name, bekorontsana, which means "falls to
the ground often," said plant specialist Alain Paul Andrianaivo.

Researchers propose a wholesale replanting of disease-prone species with a
vanilla hybrid that, laboratory tests suggest, is fungus-resistant. If new
plants are the answer, the government will have to help, said a farmer in
the affected region. Monday's report did not address how fighting the
disease would be funded.

High prices on the world vanilla market contributed to a surge in
unregulated planting 10 years ago, researchers say. The result has been
fields of plants set too close together, helping the disease spread rapidly
now.

[_Vanilla_ is a genus of climbing terrestrial tropical orchids. Commercial
vanilla is derived from its processed beans and is the second most
expensive spice after saffron. In Madagascar _V. planifolia_ (Bourbon
vanilla) is grown while other species such as _V. tahitensis_ and _V.
pompona_ are cultivated in different regions.

Vanilla is susceptible to many fungal rots affecting various plant parts.
In Madagascar, fungal or fungus-like pathogens in the genera _Phytophthora_
and _Fusarium_ have been reported previously to be associated with vanilla
root rots. These include, for example, _P. jatrophae_, which also affects
the jatropha trees used as support for the vanilla vines, and _F.
oxysporum_ f.sp. _vanillae_. It is not clear whether these may be the
pathogens referred to above.

Soilborne fungi are difficult to control due to the inaccessibility of
underground plant parts to fungicides. Disease management usually relies on
exclusion, cultural practices, and use of resistant cultivars. It appears
from the reports above that it is not yet certain whether suitable
resistant vanilla varieties are available in Madagascar. Furthermore, it
takes several years before the 1st crop can be harvested from a vanilla
vine and therefore replanting schemes will not be a quick solution to local
farmers.
