Government says swine fever outbreak under control
--------------------------------------------------
South Africa is facing its 1st outbreak of classical swine fever [CSF] in
87 years, but the government said it believed the disease was under
control. 2 pig farms in the Western Cape were put under quarantine
following the outbreak.
Also known as hog cholera, classical swine fever only affects pigs but can
be spread through contact, by farm visitors and in frozen or partially
cooked food. It is often spread through kitchen waste served to pigs.
"The fever was confirmed, and 1200 pigs have been destroyed on 2 farms and
a nearby informal settlement," department of agriculture spokesman Steve
Galane said. "But we can contain it. Since the 1st diagnoses, there have
been no more cases." The north of the country already suffers from African
swine fever, a tickborne illness that affects some European, Asian and
African countries. [see comment]. Neither disease affects humans.
Export of pork products and animals from the affected area -- around
Worcester, roughly 100 km north east of Cape Town -- had been stopped,
Galane said. "Our track record in terms of containing animal diseases is an
excellent one," he said. "We managed to contain foot and mouth disease, and
we managed to contain the avian flu."
In 2004, thousands of ostriches in the Cape had to be destroyed after a
bird flu epidemic swept through farms, but the outbreak was eventually
controlled and the industry is now recovering.

[South Africa's notification of 12 Jul 2005 to the OIE
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/a_current.htm#Sec3> included the following
information about the diagnosis of this CSF outbreak, additional to the
information included in posting 20050713.1991: "Samples are being submitted
to the OIE Reference Laboratories in Weybridge (United Kingdom) and Hanover
(Germany) for virus typing." An official follow-up report with 1st-hand
information on the course of the outbreak and diagnosis confirmation might
be expected soon.
In our posting 20050713.1991, a reference was made to a moderator's comment
in a previous posting, which read "There is patently a widespread risk of
this wildlife disease infecting domestic swine in many countries in
Africa." However, the "wildlife disease" to which the said comment was
related was not CSF but African swine fever (ASF), a different, tickborne
viral disease, which is indeed present in wildlife in many African
countries. Contrary to ASF, CSF is rather exotic to Africa. We are grateful
to Dr Howard Pharo for kindly observing and indicating the error, and
apologize for the misquote. - Mod.AS]
