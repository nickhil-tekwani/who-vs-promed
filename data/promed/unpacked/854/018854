Number of _E. coli_ victims rises to 160 as outbreak expands
------------------------------------------------------------
The number of people with symptoms of _E. coli_ [O157] infection last
night [2 Oct 2005] rose to 160 as the outbreak entered its 3rd week.

Most of the people who have been affected are children connected to
38 schools across 4 South Wales local authority areas. But a number
of the latest cases are believed have been acquired in the community.

Public health experts have described the situation as "dynamic," as new cases
continue to emerge. Earlier last week [final week September 2005], the
outbreak control team had said that the outbreak was declining. But in the
past 7 days, the number of people showing signs of the potentially lethal
infection, which has seen several children rushed to the hospital for life-
saving dialysis, has risen from 117 to 160.

The outbreak control team said that the figures have been revised, as
some people who were originally suspected to have _E. coli_ O157 had
not been confirmed and have been taken off the total.

Children who fell ill after attending and eating lunch at the schools
linked to the outbreak -- all 38 are in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr
Tydfil, Caerphilly and Bridgend -- are all thought to have caught the
infection before control measures were put in place a fortnight ago.

In a statement last night [2 Oct 2005], the outbreak control team
said that the investigations were continuing "well" in the
laboratories and that statistical evidence is still being collected.

The meat supplier, John Tudor & Son, which is based on Bridgend
Industrial Estate, is still the only business to have been publicly
linked with the outbreak, although tests are still ongoing.

[As in the last posting, the article states that some cases were
acquired outside the schools. The number of these cases is not
stated, and whether they were secondary to the school-related
cases is also unclear. - Mod.LL]
