Caesarian sections, inductions dropped during first months of COVID-19
------------------------------------------------------------
Fewer in-person prenatal visits during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 6.5% drop in premature caesarian sections and inductions, according to a new study in Pediatrics. The research was conducted by a team at Georgia Tech's School of Economics. This is the first major study to examine pandemic-era birth data at scale, the authors say, and it raises questions about how and if some medical interventions may unnecessarily result in preterm deliveries.

The study was based on 39 million US births from 2010 through 2020. Using data from the National Center for Health Statistics, researchers forecasted expected premature births -- babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy-- from March to December 2020, and compared these to actual outcomes seen during those months.

From March 2020 to December 2020, the number of preterm births from caesarian sections or induced deliveries remained 0.35 percentage points below the predicted values, which meant 350 fewer preterm caesarian sections and induced deliveries per 100 000 live births, or 10 000 fewer overall during the study period, the authors said.

"While much more research needs to be done, including understanding how these changes affected fetal deaths and how doctors triaged patient care by risk category during the pandemic, these are significant findings that should spark discussion in the medical community," Daniel Dench, lead author of the study, said in a Georgia Tech press release.

[Georgia Tech press release: First large-scale study of Covid-era birth data finds significant drop in premature cesarian, induced deliveries. https://econ.gatech.edu/news/item/656656/first-large-scale-study-covid-birth-data-finds-significant-drop-premature

The researchers' findings raise a critical question: Was the pre-pandemic level of doctor intervention necessary? "It's really about, how does this affect fetal health?" said Dench. "Did doctors miss some false positives -- did they just not deliver the babies that would have survived anyway? Or did they miss some babies that would die in the womb without intervention?" Dench plans to use fetal death records from March 2020 to December 2020 to answer this question. If he finds no change in fetal deaths at the same time as the drop in preterm births, that could point to "false positives" in doctor intervention that can be avoided in the future. Learning which pregnancies required care during the pandemic and which ones didn't could help doctors avoid unnecessary interventions in the future. - Mod.LK]

[2] monoclonal antibody sotrovimab ineffective against BA.2

https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-sotrovimab-emergency-use-authorization#:~:text=%5B2%2F25%2F2022%5D,not%20susceptible%20to%20this%20treatment


Sotrovimab is no longer authorized to treat COVID-19 in any US region due to increases in the proportion of COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Nowcast data from 5 Apr 2022, estimates that the proportion of COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron BA.2 variant is above 50% in all Health and Human Services (HHS) US regions. Data included in the health care provider fact sheet show the authorized dose of sotrovimab is unlikely to be effective against the BA.2 sub-variant. Due to these data, sotrovimab is not authorized in any US state or territory at this time.

Health care providers should use other approved or authorized products as they choose appropriate treatment options for patients.

FDA will continue to monitor BA.2 in all US regions and will provide follow-up communication when appropriate.

[In the past 24 hours, 19 countries -- South Korea (224 761), Germany (207 778), France (161 950), Italy (69 885), Australia (62 588), Vietnam (58 424), UK (51 251), the USA (50 235), Japan (42 315), Brazil (27 120), Thailand (26 081), Austria (21 076), Netherlands (13 005), Russia (14 661), Canada (13 639), Mexico (12 105), Greece (12 265), New Zealand (11 702), and Turkey (10 314) -- all reported more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 7916 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 4 Apr 2022 to late 5 Apr 2022).

A total of 42 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 42 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 9 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 22.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 14.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 0.79% decrease in daily reported cases and a 15.6% decrease in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.21 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 495.35 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.19 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
