Hawaii: West Nile Virus Sample Confirmed Negative
------------------------------------------------
The Hawaii State Department of Health has received a negative confirmation
from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on test
results from a blood sample taken from a live sparrow collected at the
Kahului Airport last week. "We are very pleased that the test result is
negative," said State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Effler.
"While these results are reassuring, we will remain vigilant in our
coordinated efforts to minimize the chances of West Nile virus reaching
Hawaii. West Nile virus is still a potential threat to Hawaii, as the
disease continues to spread throughout the mainland and particularly on the
West Coast. We appreciate the public's efforts to turn in dead birds to
collection sites and report dead birds by telephone (call 211). It is very
important that we all continue to turn in dead birds for testing and reduce
mosquito-breeding sites around our homes and work places," said Dr. Effler.
Testing of dead birds is critical to identifying and controlling the spread
of West Nile virus. Anyone finding a freshly dead bird should collect the
bird in a plastic bag and deliver it to the nearest designated collection
site. Birds collected are tested by the Department of Health's State
Laboratory. A complete list of collection sites is available at
<http://www.hawaii.gov/health>, or call 211 for further information.
Dr. Effler said last week's mosquito spraying and larviciding at Kahului
and Honolulu Airports enhanced the state's continuing preventative measures
to eliminate mosquitoes at potential entry points for West Nile Virus.
Residents, businesses, schools and landowners are also asked to eliminate
standing water from their property and work sites to get rid of places
mosquito can breed. The Department of Health will continue to work with
county, state, federal and private sector partners on bird and mosquito
surveillance and mosquito control activities. For more information, visit

[The initial report stated that a wild sparrow found at Kahului Airport has
tested positive for West Nile virus. The above report indicates that the
sparrow was alive at the time of sampling. It would be interesting to know
the circumstances surrounding this incident and why it was considered
appropriate to test this bird for West Nile virus infection. - Mod.CP]
