News
Confirmed Ebola patient from Butembo supported at Goma Ebola treatment center
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This [Sun 14 Jul 2019], a pastor from South Kivu arrived in Goma [North Kivu] after a short stay in Butembo [North Kivu]. The 46-year-old pastor traveled from Bukavu [South Kivu] to Butembo via Goma on [Thu 4 Jul 2019] for an evangelistic mission. During his stay in Butembo, the pastor preached in 7 churches where he regularly laid hands on Christians, including the sick. His 1st symptoms appeared on [9 Jul 2019] when he was still in Butembo. He was treated at home by a nurse until he left by bus for Goma on [Fri 12 Jul 2019]

On the route between Butembo and Goma, the bus passed through 3 health checkpoints, namely Kanyabayonga, Kiwanja, and OPRP. During the checks, he did not seem to show signs of the disease. In addition, at each checkpoint, he provided different names and surnames on the lists of travelers, probably indicating his desire to hide his identity and state of health.

As soon as he arrived in Goma on Sunday morning [14 Jul 2019], he went to a health center because he did not feel well and started having a fever. No other patients were in the health center, reducing the risk of nosocomial infections of others. Nurses and doctors at the health center who recognized the symptoms of Ebola immediately alerted the response teams in Goma who transferred him to the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC). Around 15:00, the result of the lab test confirmed that he was Ebola positive. If his state of health permits, the patient will be transferred by ambulance to the ETC of Butembo to continue his care as of [Mon 15 Jul 2019], as provided by the procedure of the contingency plan.

It is important for people to stay calm. Due to the speed with which the patient has been identified and isolated, as well as the identification of all bus passengers from Butembo, the risk of spreading to the rest of the city of Goma remains low. Caution is still required. In order to avoid the contamination of additional people in Goma, it is urgent to break the chain of transmission by carrying out the following actions:
- decontaminate the health center in which the patient has passed;
- identify and vaccinate all contacts of the patient without exception;
- track and limit contact movement for 21 days.

Since November 2018, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) have put in place an Ebola response planning and preparation system in the city of Goma due to the large influx of travelers from affected by the epidemic. Rapid detection of the patient by medical teams at the Goma Health Center proves the effectiveness of the city's preparedness activities in dealing with the importation of potential Ebola patients. As part of this preparation, more than 3000 health workers in Goma have been vaccinated and trained in the detection and management of Ebola patients.

In addition, the transport company has shown great professionalism in having a passenger list and making this list available to response teams to identify all passengers on the bus. The bus driver and the 18 other passengers have been identified and their vaccination will begin on [Mon 15 Jul 2019].

The collaboration of the entire population is necessary to prevent the spread of the epidemic in Goma. Beyond the medical arsenal, the Ministry of Health recalls that the response against Ebola is above all community.

As a reminder, the recommendations of the Ministry of Health are as follows:
- follow basic hygiene practices, including regular hand washing with soap and water or ashes;
- if an acquaintance from an epidemic area comes to visit you and is ill, do not touch him/her and call the North Kivu civil protection hotline directly;
- if you are identified as an Ebola patient contact, agree to be vaccinated and followed for 21 days;
- if a person dies because of Ebola, follow the rules for safe and dignified burials. It is simply a funeral method that respects funerary customs and traditions while protecting the family and community from Ebola contamination;
- for all health professionals, observe the hygiene measures in the health centers and report any patient with symptoms of Ebola (fever, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, bleeding).

If all citizens comply with the health measures recommended by the Ministry of Health, it is possible to ensure that this case of Ebola detected in Goma is a sporadic case that does not cause a new outbreak.

Two response providers murdered at their home in Beni
-----------------------------------------------------
- 2 agents of the Ebola response in Beni, including a Community Relay (RECO) and a street leader, were murdered, each at their home on the night of [13-14 Jul 2019] in the Mukulia health area on the border with Butembo [North Kivu]. Both agents were part of the local response team.
- These 2 providers had been threatened since December 2018. The RECO, a woman from the neighborhood, had already been attacked a few times a few weeks ago but she was saved because she gave money to the attackers.
- According to several sources, the attackers are people from the same neighborhood as the 2 victims who envied their neighbors because they had found employment in the response to Ebola.

[2] Goma: 1st case discovered
- Sun 14 Jul 2019
From: Greg Folkers (NIH/NIAID) <gfolkers@niaid.nih.gov>

First mentioned on Twitter, now confirmed by Christine Tshibuyi of Actualite.cd: DRC: 1st confirmed case of Ebola in Goma, capital of North Kivu. The Google translation:
The Congolese health authorities announced this [Sun 14 Jul 2019], the appearance of the 1st confirmed case of Ebola virus disease in the city of Goma, capital of North Kivu province.

This is a case imported from the city of Butembo, the 2nd largest city in the province, said the director general of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB), Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe, on his Twitter account.

The case is currently being treated at the Ebola treatment center (ETC) and will be transferred to Butembo as recommended by the response.

"This is correct information," said the Ministry of Health Communications Officer, Jessica Ilunga, responding to a question from NEWS.CD. The 1st case of Ebola in Goma, a city of nearly 2 million people, is a pastor of a Protestant church.

- Sun 14 Jul 2019. 1st Ebola case discovered in DRC's Goma city, home to 2 million people
[The Independent, abridged, edited]
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/congo-ebola-outbreak-goma-first-case-who-spread-emergency-a9004746.html
[Byline: Chiara Giordano]

The 1st case of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo city of Goma has been discovered.

Goma, a lakeside city with a population of 2 million people, is close to the Rwanda border -- more than 354 km (220 miles) south of where the 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak was first detected a year ago.

The haemorrhagic fever has gradually spread south, infecting almost 2500 people and killing more than 1600.

The Ministry of Health said the person with the confirmed case was a pastor who became infected during a visit to the city of Butembo [North Kivu], where he interacted with Ebola patients.

He first developed symptoms last week before taking a bus to Goma on [Fri 12 Jul 2019].

When he arrived in Goma on [Sun 14 Jul 2019] he went to a clinic where he tested positive for Ebola.

Officials have now located the bus driver and 18 other passengers, who will all be vaccinated on [Mon 15 Jul 2019].

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation, said that while the case was "not welcome news", it was something the organisation "had long anticipated" and prepared for. He said in a tweet: "An Ebola treatment centre in Goma ... has been operational since February [2019], and the person is now receiving care there. As part of the preparedness, 3000 health workers have been vaccinated in this city alone."

However, experts have raised concerns that the deadly disease could spread faster in such a densely populated area.

Academic and author Laurie Garrett, an expert on infectious diseases, said the case could be a "dangerous turning point" in the epidemic. She tweeted: "The arrival of Ebola to the large, intl trading city of Goma is a dangerous turning point in the DRC Ebola epidemic.

"We can hope/pray it's an isolated case. But everybody in the Ebola fight has been dreading this moment."

Ronald Klain, who served as Barack Obama's Ebola czar, said: "Just one case might be just one case. But, if this is multiple cases in Goma, that is a turning point."

Goma has been preparing for the arrival of Ebola for a year, setting up hand-washing stations and making sure mototaxi drivers do not share helmets.

But in more rural areas, where containment efforts have been hindered by mistrust of health officials and militia violence, the virus has been hard to contain and the number of new cases has spiked.

From: Daniel Lucey <daniel.lucey8@gmail.com> [abridged, edited]
[Daniel Lucey, senior scholar with the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law and an adjunct professor of medicine-infectious diseases at Georgetown University Medical Center]

"The official DRC MoH 5-paragraph report about the Goma patient from Dr Tedros's twitter feed: the pastor became symptomatic 9 Jul 2019 in Butembo, then got on the bus 12 Jul 2019 and travelled with 18 other passengers to Goma, arriving [Sun 14 Jul 2019. He was known to be ill, although NOT due to Ebola until he arrived today in Goma. He was first taken to a "centre de sante" [health center] where the medical workers first suspected Ebola and transferred him to an ETU [Ebola treatment unit] where his lab test for Ebola was performed and around 3pm ("vers 15h") confirmed EVD. The bus driver and 18 other passengers have reportedly been identified and will be vaccinated starting tomorrow [Mon 15 Jul 2019]."

"If my translation from the French and all this information is accurate, then in my opinion there is no reason to start vaccinating people in Goma with the J&J vaccine. The main point of the BBC interview [BBC Radio 'World Service Newsday programme' interview broadcast at 22:30 EDT 15 Jul 2019] that I emphasized was what IHR-mandated "temporary recommendations" Dr Tedros could announce immediately after declaring a PHEIC. (For example, (1) improved safety and security measures; (2) extending healthcare to "Ebola and Beyond" such as, malaria, diarrheal diseases, maternal and child health, measles vaccination; and (3) warning against unintended and adverse effects of declaring a PHEIC, for example that if airlines stop flying to DRC they will be publicly called out by the WHO D-G and other measures taken to dissuade such behaviors that would have an adverse effect on DRC travel and trade (and maybe hinder the NGO "Ebola fighters" efforts from transporting workers and materials into DRC).

Also, tomorrow [15 Jul 2019] in Geneva a large and public Ebola meeting with multiple esteemed people and organizations will be held at 13:00 their time. [See report below]. I anticipate an announcement about the DRC/WHO/Partners Ebola "4th Strategic Response Plan" that will cover the next 5-6 months of the epidemic. Ideally I hoped some of the recommendations to be announced as part of this 4th Strategic Response Plan would be adapted/adopted into PHEIC "temporary recommendations"; however, now I do not anticipate declaration of a PHEIC tomorrow. Instead, I expect a statement regarding why a PHEIC is not being declared. Events seem to be accelerating."

[This incursion into Goma by Ebola virus could be a "turning point" as pointed out by others, or the preparation in place for exactly this event could allow it to be controlled without further spread. Those of us on the sidelines will have to hold our breath and wait and see which way it goes. The Washington Post Op-Ed piece written by Ronald A Klain and Daniel Lucey, could not have been more timely [see ProMED-mail Ebola update (65): Congo DR (NK, IT) case update, summaries, opinion 20190713.6566907]. Even if we are lucky this time and Ebola is contained before it spreads further into Goma, it is time for the global community to take stock of the situation and take action to not only control Ebola, but also measles, TB, malaria, and the other neglected diseases afflicting this population before things get even worse.
