Health department officials in northern Utah are working with parents and teachers in several Weber County schools in order to contain an outbreak of pertussis, which is commonly known as whooping cough. According to a press release from the Weber-Morgan Health Department, an infant has been hospitalized due to pertussis and 5 more individuals are experiencing symptoms. The investigation involves family members and students at Wahlquist Junior High School, Plain City Elementary School, and Evergreen Montessori Academy.

The release states that an outbreak is defined as a period in which 2 or more cases present themselves in one school within 20 days. Amy Carter, who is a communicable disease nurse with the Weber-Morgan Health Department, said people should take precautionary measures. "Pertussis is something we see all year long, not just during cold and flu season," she stated in the press release. "This reminds us that we all need to be diligent about getting vaccinated, frequent hand washing, covering your cough and staying home when you are ill."

Carter said they are concerned about those who are too young to be immunized. "While the vaccines are very effective, we know there are some people who will not build full immunity," Carter stated in the release. "Our main goal is to protect infants who cannot be immunized and are most at-risk from severe complications and even death."

Carter said "most" of the cases are recovering, and she said people "should contact their medical provider if they are experiencing sneezing, a runny nose and other cold like symptoms especially if they have been exposed to someone who has had a lingering cough. Pertussis symptoms can last as long as 3 months if left untreated." Those experiencing symptoms should remain home from school, work and other activities until they complete a 5-day course of antibiotics.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, continues to infect residents. "So far in 2014, we have 30 new cases of pertussis," said Dr Mark Wallace, executive director of the Weld County Department of Public Health & Environment. In 2013, Weld had just more than 100 cases and typically averages only 4 cases per year.

Wallace stresses the following points:
- "Get vaccinated." It is important to follow the recommended series of boosters for both adults and children, because the pertussis vaccine does not provide lifelong protection.
- Pertussis can be treated. "Get tested by a health care provider if a cough lasts longer than 2 weeks in order to receive the appropriate treatment."
- "Always cover your cough and wash your hands." The health department also recommends "cocooning" vaccination efforts beyond just parents and siblings -- that is to encourage grandparents and caregivers to get vaccinated, in order to protect the infants and children they are caring for from pertussis.

New cases of pertussis have been reported in the Riverhead Central School District, according to a notice published yesterday, 24 Feb 2014, on the school district's website. "Please be advised that we continue to have new cases of pertussis in the Riverhead Central School District," the notice said. "The cases are not limited to 1 school." The district did not disclose the number of cases or the school buildings affected.

The district published a similar notice 3 Dec 2013, referencing multiple cases of the illness in more than 1 building. On 13 Nov 2013, the district reported on case of pertussis in the high school.

There have been 2048 cases reported in the USA so far in 2014 -- 75 in NY, according to the CDC. There were 131 cases reported in NY in 2013.

Sometimes referred to as the "pertussis paradox", the rise in reported cases of pertussis in the USA and other parts of the developed world after switching to a more tolerable, less reactogenic vaccine that could be given to adults as well as children, is probably multifactorial in origin, but is not just a case of "post hoc ergo propter hoc", if it occurred after, it must be due to. An example of false "post hoc logic" is if one eats a cheeseburger and an hour later gets fever and diarrhea with a stool culture growing a salmonella then the cheeseburger was the vehicle. This is not true since the incubation period of salmonellosis is far greater than an hour. Perhaps the well recognized up and down swings of pertussis outbreaks and/or the increased sensitivity of physicians to the diagnosis with better availability of specific diagnostic testing are involved here.

The current acellular (aP) pertussis vaccine, however, has had a role to play in the reemergence of pertussis' pertinence. The following summaries 2 issues in this regard (from: Lutwick LI, Preis J: Pertussis: In: Emerging Infectious Diseases: Clinical Case Studies. Ergonul O, Can F, Akova M, Madoff L (eds), 2014, Elsevier, (in press)):

"Clearly, the current formulation of the acellular pertussis vaccine is less potent than its whole cell ancestor. Whether measuring specific antibodies to proteins in the vaccine during the primary sequence (34) or assessing pertussis incidence after the sequence ends at age 5 (35), immunity to pertussis promptly waned. Indeed, pertussis incidence and risk ratios rose in the 3 study states (36) at high as 8.8 times and 3.9 times in Minnesota between year 1 and year 6 after completion of the sequence. Currently 3 antigen and 5 antigen component acellular pertussis vaccines are available in the USA. The 5 component vaccine had greater efficacy in a head-to-head comparison (36). Interestingly, the relative risk of pertussis was 8.57 times higher in those with a 5-dose aP schedule as compared to those who had received at least 1 dose of whole cell vaccine (37) while those with 6 doses of aP had a relative risk of 3.55 as compared to the 1 or more whole cell group. Whether changing the balance of antigens in the vaccine or adding different antigens is unclear. In a response to the waning immunity observed following the primary immunization sequence of the acellular pertussis vaccine, further immunizations were recommended first for adolescents and then for adults 19-64 years old and then to adults 65 years and older. Finally, in order to best "cocoon" the as yet unborn baby, recommendations now exist for aP vaccination of the pregnant woman in the 2nd or 3rd trimester (38).

Evolutional changes have been observed in _B. pertussis_ that may have had a role in the organism's ability to persist in a highly immunized population. Despite the genetically monomorphic nature of the pathogen without horizontal acquisition of new genes, Mooi and colleagues have observed strains carrying a mutation in the gene for the pertussis toxin gene promoter which mediates increased production that was associated with pertussis resurgence (39) and other genetic differences between surface proteins including pertussis toxin, pertactin, and fimbriae (40). Additionally, Lan's Australian group (41,42) have divided _B. pertussis_ isolates into six clusters based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The reemergence of pertussis seemed to coincide with the emergence of SNP cluster 1 of strains carrying pertactin and pertussis toxin genes (prn2 and ptxP3) able to evade acellular pertussis vaccine-induced selective pressure.

Two additional observations have been made following the writing of the piece above:
- If pregnant women were not immunized: it is reasonable to immunize them in the immediate postpartum period prior to discharge (1) although this does not optimize the baby's protection since there is no transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies (Yeh S, Mink C, Kim M, et al: Effectiveness of hospital-based postpartum procedures on pertussis vaccination among postpartum women. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2014; 210: e1-6; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24096180).
- Lam's group in Australia furthered their observations about pertactin-deficient pertussis isolates are not clonal, and have arose independently multiple times since 2008. This is consistent with vaccine pressure involved with the continued evolution of the organism (Lam C, Octavia S, Ricafort L, et al: Rapid increase in pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ isolates, Australia. Emerg Infect Dis 2014; 20(4); available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1478_article.htm. - Mod.LL]
