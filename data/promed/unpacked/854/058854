Almost one in 10 children who contracted measles over the summer
[2011] had to be hospitalised according to reports.

Some 139 cases of measles were recorded in August and September 2011
alone, with 11 of these admitted to hospital. Seven of these -- aged
between 5 and 9 -- were either not vaccinated against the disease or
were under-vaccinated.

According to the Health Protection Surveillance Centres, 265 cases
have been reported in 2011 with 90 percent of those in Dublin.

The Health Ministry of Ukraine has declared that the level of measles
morbidity does not exceed the epidemic threshold, but it is better to
be ready for an outbreak. The WHO representative in Ukraine, Igor
Pokanevych, stated that as of 20 Sep 2011, 40 of 53 Member States in
the WHO European Region have reported 26 025 confirmed measles cases
for the period January - July 2011.

The highest number of cases was reported from France, with 14 025
cases for the 1st 6 months of the year [2011]. In addition, 11 of all
cases in the Region were fatal (6 in France and one in each in
Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and the United Kingdom). The most recent outbreak was
reported from Israel in September 2011, with 12 cases. According to
Pokanevych, [in North America], the largest outbreak was in Quebec,
Canada, involving 742 cases. In contrast, 213 cases were registered in
the United States. Most of these outbreaks are linked to importations
from Europe.

Pokanevych noted that in 2012, Ukraine is hosting the Euro football
championship and called upon the authorities to conduct an information
campaign and [enhance] immunization. In his turn, the representative
of the Sanitary Epidemic Agency of the Health Ministry, Viktor Svita,
stated that there were 194 cases of measles registered in Ukraine in
2011, and 93 percent of them were in the territory of the Western
Ukraine. He pointed out that Ukraine has a problem with vaccination
and revaccination. "The number of unvaccinated children increases,"
Svita added.

The Chief infection disease doctor of the Health Ministry, Kramariv,
underlined that adults are at greater risk from the measles outbreak
than children. He also noted that adults can voluntarily get
vaccinated, and as for children, there is a vaccination calendar,
according to which Ukrainian children are vaccinated free of charge.

By mid-October 2011, it was already the worst year for measles cases
in the U.S. since 1996. But with 214 U.S. measles cases identified by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of 14 Oct 2011, the
case number still remains very modest and allows America to remain a
country where measles has been "eliminated," its status since 2000,
Huong McLean, Ph.D., said at the annual meeting of the Infectious
Diseases Society of America.

For measles to be considered no longer eliminated from the United
States, person-to-person transmission of the virus would need to
persist in the country for a year, said Dr. McLean, an epidemiologist
in the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases of
the CDC in Atlanta. "We've been getting a lot of imported cases, but
the spread has been very limited," she said in an interview. "As long
as there is measles elsewhere in the world, [the United States] is
going to get importations."

The CDC attributed 1/3rd of the U.S. cases this year [2011] to direct
importations, roughly similar to the 47 percent average importation
rate each year over the past decade, she reported. Other world
locations have a much greater measles burden. The CDC traced about
half of the 2011 importations [to] the European Union, which this year
[2011] has so far reported more than 28 000 measles cases, half of
them in France. The majority of U.S. measles cases this year were in
children aged 19 years or younger, with 20 percent of the national
total in infants aged 6-15 months.

However, adult cases accounted for 41 percent of the 2011 caseload,
and within that subgroup, the largest number occurred in young adults
aged 20-39, who had 27 percent of the total U.S. measles cases this
year [2011].

Among the 214 U.S. cases, 187 were in U.S. residents, and 180 cases
(84 percent) occurred in people who had either been previously
unvaccinated for measles or had an unknown vaccine status. The total
also included 19 people (9 percent) who had previously received just
one measles vaccine dose (the CDC recommends that people receive 2
doses to better insure immune coverage), and 15 (7 percent) with
evidence of having received 2 doses, Dr. McLean said.

This year [2011] included 16 U.S. measles outbreaks, the highest
number in more than a decade. The outbreaks, defined as at least 3
linked cases, accounted for half of the 2011 U.S. measles cases, with
a median of 5.5 patients in each outbreak.

The largest U.S. 2011 outbreak as of mid-October 2011 -- in the
Minneapolis area -- typifies a common outbreak scenario. According to
a report at the meeting from the Minnesota Department of Health, an
unvaccinated, U.S.-born 2-year-old child traveled to Kenya. Back home
in Hennepin County, Minnesota, the index case attended a drop-in
childcare center, and a day later manifested a rash. Measles later
developed in 2 other children at the childcare center and one
household contact, and later spread to people at 2 homeless shelters,
2 health care facilities, and another childcare center. The Minnesota
investigators identified 21 cases in this outbreak all together,
including 16 unvaccinated people. Seven were infants too young to have
been vaccinated, and 9 were unvaccinated despite being of age. Seven
of these 9 had avoided vaccination because of safety concerns.

"Health care providers together with public health and community
leaders must address growing vaccine hesitancy to ensure high
immunization rates in all communities," said Pam Gahr, a senior
epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health, in a written
statement.

Another report at the meeting addressed the public cost of a measles
outbreak. Last March and April [2011], a measles outbreak that
eventually caused 9 confirmed cases occurred in the Salt Lake City
area. The total cost for investigating and dealing with the outbreak
ran to about USD 330 000, or roughly USD 33 000 per case, reported Dr.
Karyn Leniek, deputy state epidemiologist with the Utah Department of
Health. Most of the expense accumulated from the salaries paid to the
health care workers who worked on the outbreak.

Dwarfing the 2011 U.S. outbreaks, a Canadian outbreak occurred last
May and June 2011 in a rural region of Quebec that, through early
October 2011, included 757 confirmed cases, the largest North American
outbreak in more than a decade, said Philippe Belanger, an
epidemiologist with the Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services
in Montreal. Although 62 percent of the cases occurred in unvaccinated
people, 13 percent of the confirmed measles cases were in people with
documentation of having received 2 measles vaccinations, all of them
29 years old or younger, Mr. Belanger said in a talk at the meeting.
"We need a better understanding of this outbreak, as it is unclear
that the problem was only a failure to vaccinate," Mr. Belanger said.

The measles outbreak continues to spread in Auckland, with the disease
infecting an extra 75 victims in October [2011]. Since the outbreak
began in May [2011], a total of 278 people have been infected in the
region. Of those, 53 people have been hospitalised. The measles toll
stood at 203 at the beginning of October 2011.

The Ministry of Health is working with the 3 district health boards to
provide a measles vaccine. Officials rolled out the measles, mumps and
rubella (MMR) vaccine free of charge since the beginning of October
2011. It is advised that people born after 1 Jan 1969 check their
immunisation status. If they have received only one dose of the
vaccine or are not immunised, they should arrange an MMR vaccination.

The practice around vaccinating infants has also changed, with them
being able to receive their 1st vaccination at 12 months instead of 15
months, with the 2nd being administered 28 days later instead of at
the age of 4.

The symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny or blocked nose,
sore red eyes and white spots inside the mouth with a rash appearing
on the face and spreading down the body. Anyone who has any of these
symptoms are being urged to stay at home and call their doctor or
Healthline at 0800 611 116.

A Dunedin Hospital staff member has been diagnosed with measles,
raising fears the outbreak of the disease has spread to the region.
The woman was the 2nd person to have contracted measles in Otago, with
both cases linked to a visitor from Wellington. There is currently an
outbreak of measles in New Zealand, with 373 cases this year [2011],
with the majority, 295, in Auckland.

The Southern District Health Board (DHB) said the infected woman had
contact with patients and other staff members at the early stages of
the illness last Monday [24 Oct 2011]. She then travelled to Auckland
on Tuesday and returned on Friday [25 and 28 Oct 2011]. The DHB said
they were making "every effort" to alert people who had come into
contact with her. Air New Zealand had provided passenger seating
lists, and people seated in the same row, 2 rows in front and a row
behind her were being contacted. Close contacts who were not immunised
against measles have been isolated for 14 days to prevent potential
spread of the disease.

The DHB's medical officer of health, Derek Bell, said there were
countless opportunities for other people to have been exposed because
measles is so easily transmitted. He said the only way to prevent
measles is by vaccination, or by having had the disease in the past.
"Parents should ensure that children are vaccinated on time, according
to the Childhood Immunisation Schedule. This involves MMR (measles,
mumps and rubella) vaccination at 15 months and 4 years. If there is a
community outbreak, there may be a recommendation for these childhood
vaccinations to be moved forward. Adults who were born before 1969 are
presumed to be immune to measles. Adults born after 1969 should check
that they have had 2 doses of measles vaccine. Many will have only had
one dose, and a 2nd dose is funded by the immunisation benefit," Bell
said.

http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/5891739/Southland-measles-scare


Three Southland people have been contacted by Public Health South
after sitting near a Dunedin Hospital staff member, who was later
diagnosed with measles, on an Air New Zealand flight, the Southern
District Health Board said yesterday [1 Nov 2011]. While infectious,
the worker travelled to Auckland on 25 Oct 2011 on Flight NZ672 from
Dunedin and returned on Friday [28 Oct 2011] on Flight NZ673. Air New
Zealand gave Public Health South the passenger seating lists, and
passengers seated in the same row and 2 rows in front and behind had
been contacted. Board Medical officer of health Derek Bell said
yesterday [1 Nov 2011] that 3 of the passengers contacted were from
Southland but would not specify where or whether they had been
immunised.

No outbreak of measles in the Southland region had been reported since
the health board's statement this week that the staff member at
Dunedin Hospital had been diagnosed with the disease. This is the 2nd
case of measles in the Southern health district. Both remain in Otago
and were linked to an infectious visitor from Wellington last month
[October 2011].

The hospital worker had contact with patients and other staff at the
very early stage of the illness on the night of Mon 24 Oct 2011. Dr
Bell said that none of the patients or other staff were from the
Southland region. The Southern DHB said in a statement this week that
every effort had been made to contact these patients and staff members
in order to advise them appropriately depending on their immune
status. Close contacts of the case who have not been immunised against
measles have been isolated for 14 days to prevent the potential spread
of the disease.

Dr Bell said the only way to prevent measles is with vaccination or by
having the disease. So far, the current outbreak of measles in New
Zealand has mainly centred on Auckland. Parents should ensure children
are vaccinated on time according to the Childhood Immunisation
Schedule.

The authorities in New Zealand have been concerned about the risk of
spread of measles virus infection by airline passengers. While
examples of this have occurred, the short duration of internal flights
probably diminishes this hazard.

The transmission of measles within the United States has been
contained. In Europe, outbreaks continue, with France remaining the
centre of the epidemic. - Mod.CP]
