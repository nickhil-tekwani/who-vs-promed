News Reports out of Syria indicate the emergence of epidemic cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL] in the besieged city of Aleppo, adding further to the misery there.

Even in the best of times the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria) has struggled with CL. We reported previously in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases that Old World or anthroponotic CL caused by _Leishmania tropica_ is endemic to Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia.

In the ancient northern Syrian city of Aleppo, CL has been present for hundreds of years (if not longer), where it is known as the "Aleppo evil", "Aleppo ulcer", "Aleppo boil", or "Aleppo button". Aleppo ulcer is a disfiguring condition that disproportionately occurs on the face, especially of young people. It typically lasts one or 2 years before the lesion heals spontaneously, and is often known locally as "one-year sore". However, in many cases specific anti-parasitic chemotherapy can hasten the healing process and improve clinical and cosmetic outcomes.

A major problem with one-year sore is that the scar can produce permanent disfigurement of the face. According to some experts working in Afghanistan, Old World CL is a cause of social isolation and stigma particularly among girls and young women who can be rendered unmarriageable. Mothers with CL may not be allowed to touch their children even though human to human contact does not transmit the infection.

Experts working on CL in Syria have written about the rise and fall and then a rise again in the incidence of the disease in the city of Aleppo. During the 1950s the number of cases of CL fell after an insecticide campaign aimed at controlling malaria, but it then rose again during the 1960s. However, CL was mostly controlled during the 1980s.

There was a subsequent increase after 1992, which has been attributed in part to inadequate garbage disposal and construction waste in areas undergoing development outside of the ancient city center. Garbage collection, open sewage, and poverty are notorious for promoting the habitats of _Phlebotomus_ sandflies that transmit Old World CL. Interestingly, a clinical trial conducted prior to the current civil conflict found that use of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) could prevent CL in Aleppo.

[There have been several previous reports on an increased number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in Syria. See the ProMED postings listed below, and refer to the comments in archive no. 20130420.1660409.

There is no doubt that the areas of Syria affected by the civil war are experiencing an increase in cutaneous leishmaniasis and this will also be seen in the refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey. - Mod.EP
