Nkasi District fights to contain measles 'imported' from Congo DR
-----------------------------------------------------------------
There has been an influx of people from the Democratic Republic of
Congo (Congo DR) into 6 villages in Nkasi District, Rukwa Region
following an outbreak of measles in their country, the 'Daily News'
has learnt. The Rukwa Health Officer, Mr Jacob Twange, has said
already 7 measles patients, 5 adults and 2 children below 5, have
died at Kalungu village dispensary.

Kalungu is a small fishing camp located along the shores of Lake
Tanganyika in Kirando Division, Nkasi District. All the deceased were
identified as citizens from Congo DR. Mr Twangwe is also in charge of
the measles vaccination campaign in the region. He said the patients
had 1st been taken to traditional healers by their relatives and were
brought to the dispensary when it was too late to save their lives,
adding that there were still 2 measles patients from the Congo DR
admitted to the dispensary and their conditions were reported to be improving.

He said it was difficult to determine the number of people running
away from the Congo DR into the country seeking treatment and
vaccination against measles which is said to be ravaging that
country [the Congo DR] because their hosts were reluctant to expose them.

Mr Twange said the most affected villages by the influx were Kirando,
Manda Kerenge, Kalungu and Namasi, all situated along the shore of
Lake Tanganyika in the district. According to Mr Twange, a team of 4
medical experts were dispatched to the villages to carry out further
investigations. He added that after house to house search, it was
discovered that about 183 children aged below 5 years were attacked
by the disease among them are 22 children below 9 months old, saying
that all were citizens from the Congo DR. Mr Twange said parents of
the children claimed that they were compelled to run away from their
country to Tanzania because there was no treatment in their country.

Following the outbreak of measles in the 5 villages in Nkasi
District, the regional authorities have launched a special house to
house a vaccination campaign against measles along the shores of Lake
Tanganyika in the district in order to stop it from spreading to the
neighbouring districts in the region.
