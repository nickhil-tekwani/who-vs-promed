Hantavirus claims life in South Dakota
--------------------------------------
The South Dakota Health Department says hantavirus has caused the death of
a McCook County resident. A total of 2 other lives in south eastern South
Dakota have been claimed by the virus in the past 3 years. Earlier deaths
were in Turner and Bon Homme counties.

Hantavirus, which is carried by rodents, attacks the lungs and blood
vessels. South Dakota has had 13 hantavirus cases since 1993. The primary
carrier of the disease in South Dakota is the deer mouse, which is found
statewide. People are infected when they breathe in the aerosolized virus
from droppings, urine or saliva of rodents.

State epidemiologist Lon Kightlinger says rodent control is prudent in the
fall when mice begin moving indoors.
