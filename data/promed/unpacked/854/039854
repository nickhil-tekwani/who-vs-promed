Russia: 3 human cases of West Nile fever in West Siberia in 2004
-----------------------------------------------
Samples from 3 patients from Novosibirsk and Novosibirsk district
have tested [positive] by anti-West Nile virus (WNV) IgG immunoenzyme
assay and RT-PCR and virus isolation. The testing was carried out at
the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology "Vector."
Case 1: A patient with severe fever syndrome had the complete course
of vaccination against tick borne encephalitis (TBE). Lab tests:
RT-PCR positive, sequence of cDNA - genotype I of WNV, IgG positive
with seroconversion.
Case 2: A patient with very severe meningoencephalitis with TBE
negative tests during infection (not tested for WNV in this stage).
Retrospective test: anti-WNV IgG positive in very high titer after
infection (2 months).
Case 3: A patient with 3-days of mild fever after contact with birds
and mosquitoes (during sample collection). WNV infection confirmed
RT-PCR positive, sequence of cDNA - genotype I of WNV, IgG positive
and virus isolation from an early blood sample.
These are the 1st confirmed cases of WNV infection in humans in West
Siberia, where WNV has been detected in birds from 2002 to the
present. [For details, see: Ternovoi VA, Shchelkanov MIu, Shestopalov
