Abstract
--------
In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged. To date, more than 2300 cases have been reported, with an approximate case fatality rate of 35%. Epidemiological investigations identified dromedary camels as the source of MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission, and evidence of MERS-CoV circulation has been observed throughout the original range of distribution. Other new-world camelids, alpacas and llamas, are also susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Currently, it is unknown whether Bactrian camels are susceptible to infection. The distribution of Bactrian camels overlaps partly with that of the dromedary camel in west and central Asia. The receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4, of the Bactrian camel was 98.3% identical to the dromedary camel DPP4, and 100% identical for the 14 residues that interact with the MERS-CoV spike receptor. Upon intranasal inoculation with 107 plaque-forming units of MERS-CoV, animals developed a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract (URT) infection. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but shedding of large quantities of MERS-CoV from the URT was observed. These data are similar to infections reported with dromedary camel infections and indicate that Bactrians are susceptible to MERS-CoV and, given their overlapping range, are at risk of introduction and establishment of MERS-CoV within the Bactrian camel populations.

[Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) circulates in dromedary camels and is responsible for severe respiratory disease in humans. Experimental infections and field observations indicate that infected dromedaries shed large quantities of virus via nasal secretions while infection remains subclinical or signs limited to rhinorrhea and a mild elevation in body temperature.

The world's camel population is estimated at around 30 million head. Old-world camelids include dromedary (single-humped) and Bactrian (double-humped) camels. Dromedaries count more than 90% of the total, located in hot arid lands from the northern regions of Africa to eastern Asia, the leading countries (more than a million head) being Somalia, Sudan, Niger, Kenya, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania and Pakistan. The total number of dromedary camels in the Arabian peninsula, the region where most human cases of MERS-CoV have been recorded to date (6 countries), counts about 1.3 million dromedary camels.

Bactrian camels consist of 2 subspecies: the critically endangered wild Bactrian camels (_Camelus bactrianus ferus_) and domesticated Bactrian camels (_Camelus bactrianus bactrianus_). They count considerably less than 10% of the world's total, located mainly in Mongolia, Kazakhstan and north China (Inner Mongolia). Some areas are shared by both dromedary and Bactrian camels.

A 2014 survey of 30 Bactrian camels from 12 herds in southern Mongolia failed to detect circulation of MERS-CoV either by qRT-PCR on nasal swabs or serology, indicating either that the virus was not circulating in these herds or that these animals are not susceptible to infection. Similarly, a 2015 survey of 190 Bactrian camels from 10 herds in the West Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China failed to detect circulation of MERS-CoV by qRT-PCR or serology. Sero-surveillance conducted in Kazakhstan did not detect any evidence for circulation of MERS-CoV in 455 sampled dromedary and 95 Bactrian camels.

In order to determine the susceptibility of Bactrian camels to infection with MERS-CoV and the potential risk for introduction of MERS-CoV in areas with Bactrian camels, the authors inoculated 2 Bactrian camels and monitored them for nasal shedding and seroconversion, comparing the response with experimental historic data from dromedary camels.

The following comments are extracted from the (slightly edited) discussion section.

"In the present study we demonstrated that Bactrian camels are also susceptible to infection with MERS-CoV and, like dromedary camels, shed large quantities of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Moreover, the virus shedding kinetics of MERS-CoV in Bactrian camels was virtually identical to previous experimental studies in dromedary camels. Similar to infections reported in both naturally and experimentally infected dromedaries, infected Bactrian camels displayed only minor clinical disease characterized by mild to moderate quantities of nasal discharge.

"The limitation of this study was the limited number (2) of animals, of which only one was monitored for seroconversion. Nonetheless, the susceptibility and the magnitude and pattern of nasal virus shedding was nearly identical in both animals and clearly demonstrated that Bactrian camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV. The susceptibility of the Bactrian camel to MERS-CoV suggests a general pattern of susceptibility in new- and old-world camelids. Experimental infections in camelids have resulted in productive infection and shedding of MERS-CoV, in contrast to other livestock species such as goat, sheep, pigs and horses. Inoculation of goats, sheep, and horses with MERS-CoV does not result in productive viral shedding.

"Interestingly, the MERS-CoV amounts in the upper respiratory tract and the shedding from the upper respiratory tract in the new-world camelids, llama and alpaca, are generally 2 log lower compared with those of the old-world camelids, dromedary and Bactrian camel. In addition, upon experimental MERS-CoV transmission studies with alpaca, although transmission between infected animal and contact animal occurred, the contact animal had 2 log lower virus shedding than the inoculated animals. This potentially suggests a lower ability of MERS-CoV for sustained transmission in this species.

"Despite the current lack of field evidence of MERS-CoV infection in Bactrian camels, this study demonstrates that Bactrian camels can be readily infected and shed large quantities of virus in nasal secretions. If MERS-CoV were to be introduced into populations of Bactrian camels, we would expect that a potential endemic and sustained pattern of infection may result and they could act as a reservoir, similar to dromedaries, potentially exposing associated human communities to infection."

Although MERS-CoV is not included in OIE's list of notifiable animal diseases, diagnosed cases in camels are required to be notified due to its status of an emerging zoonotic disease. As of now, the disease has been reported in dromedary camels by the following countries (with year of 1st report): Qatar, 2013; Oman, 2014; Kuwait, 2014; Iran, 2014; Saudi Arabia, 2016; Jordan, 2016; Kenya, 2019. - Mod.AS]
