The death of a 26-year-old farmer on Monday [14 Jan 2008], was
attributed to anthrax. According to Victor Torres, the head of the
Regional Epidemiology Directorate in Lambayeque, the farmer, who
lived in the village of Valle Hermoso, caught the disease from a goat.

At the time of [the man's] death, 2 other people that had been
exposed to the goat meat had also been infected with the disease; a
19-year-old [woman] and a 25-year-old [man] who were admitted into
Las Mercedes de Chiclayo Hospital.

Since then, 5 more people in the region of Lambayeque have been found
to also be infected with anthrax. A 35-year-old [woman] and her
8-year-old son, who also live in the village of Valle Hermoso, were
admitted into Mercedes de Chiclayo Hospital Monday [14 Jan 2008] at 5 pm.

It is believed that the woman and her son contracted the disease
after handling an infected animal. [The woman] explained she had had
symptoms for a week but attributed them to witchcraft, stating she
believed someone had cast a spell on her. She was found by a team of
doctors that has been searching the area for people that have
symptoms of anthrax with the hopes of helping them before the disease
kills them.

Peru's Ministry of Agriculture has also opened an investigation in
the province of Chiclayo, located approximately 780 kilometers (484
miles) northwest of Lima.

Teams of specialists are in the area inspecting animals and
interviewing farmers.

[This is in the same area as the outbreak we reported in 2006 (see
Anthrax, human, bovine - Peru (Lambayeque) 20060710.1892.) In 2005
outbreaks were reported in Lima (8), Tacna (6), Piura (1), Ica (2),
and in 2006 in Lambayeque (2). See OIE WAHID (World Animal Health
Information Database) at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=country>.
They recorded 55 human cases in 2005 and 22 (with one death) in 2006.
Lima has yet to enter their data for 2007. The disease has long been
a problem, mainly in the coastal provinces such as Callao,
Lambayeque, Moquegua, Tumbes, La Libertad, Ancash, Lima, Ica, and
Cajamarca, Huanuco, Cerro de Pasco.

The Peruvian veterinary authorities are battling non-compliance in
the livestock community because of fears that the vaccine can cause
pregnant animals to die ... a not unrealistic fear when infected
animals incubating disease are vaccinated. To the peasant eye, the
vaccine causes the death. As effective protection from the vaccine
only kicks in around the 8th day after vaccination it can appear to
be not very effective. Which is why in an outbreak we advise
injecting all exposed animals with long acting antibiotics to stop
any covert incubating infections and then follow that by vaccination
some 10 days later. Using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) one
can better target where proactive livestock vaccination should be
carried out and have targetted surveillance programmes to check on
progress or lack thereof. - Mod.MHJ
