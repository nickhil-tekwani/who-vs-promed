[1] WHO statement
Date: Wed 15 Dec 2010

<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/events/en/index.html>

The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom has reported an
increase in the number of severe cases of infection with influenza
H1N1 (2009) virus across the country, particularly in the last 3
weeks. The current situation suggests that the local winter influenza
epidemic is well underway. Although investigations are ongoing,
preliminary analysis of the data from the UK indicate that the
epidemiological, clinical, and virological profile of severe cases of
infection with H1N1 (2009) virus is similar to what was observed
globally during the influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic. Notably, there has
been no change in the antigenic character of the virus, implying that
the currently available vaccine should continue to provide protection.
Other seasonal influenza viruses, particularly influenza B virus, are
co-circulating with H1N1 (2009) virus in the UK. Surveillance data
from Europe also indicate that other parts of the continent are in the
early stages of the winter influenza season.

It is too early to tell what the overall impact of the current
epidemic will be in the UK or elsewhere in Europe. As the 2010-2011
Northern Hemisphere winter influenza season commences, several key
public health messages warrant emphasis as mentioned in the WHO
Director General's announcement of the end of pandemic phase 6.

National and sub-national public health authorities should maintain
vigilance for the arrival of their local winter influenza epidemics
and should use this opportunity to prepare routine influenza
surveillance systems to detect and monitor influenza activity and to
encourage influenza vaccination, particularly among groups at high
risk for complications from influenza.

Clinicians should be reminded of appropriate diagnostic testing and
management of patients presenting with influenza-like-illness,
including early treatment with appropriate antiviral medications for
patients presenting with severe or deteriorating illness and where
influenza is suspected in high risk individuals. Treatment in such
cases should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation. Full details
of WHO recommendations for antiviral use and clinical management may
be found at
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/guidance/clincal/en/index.html>.

Unusual epidemiological, clinical, or virological patterns of
influenza virus infection should be immediately reported to WHO.

[2] HPA statement
Date: Fri 17 Dec 2010

<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2010/news5010.htm#flu>

Influenza activity is increasing, and levels of consultation for
influenza-like illness in primary care have now exceeded base line
thresholds in England. The rise in the number of reported cases in the
community has been accompanied by reports of patients with serious
illness requiring hospitalisation and numerous outbreaks of flu in
schools across the country. The HPA [Health Protection Agency] Weekly
National Influenza Report [1] provides a regular situation report on
flu and flu-like illness in the UK.

The headline influenza indicators reported in the 16 Dec 2010 edition
[2] are:

- in week 49 (ending 12 Dec 2010), the weekly
influenza/influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate increased to
above baseline levels in England (34.6 per 100 000);

- reports of severe illness due to influenza infection including
ICU/ECMO (intensive care unit/extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation)
admissions and the number of influenza-associated deaths increased in
the last few weeks (since week 36, 17 deaths associated with influenza
infection have been reported);

- influenza A H1N1 (2009) and influenza B are the predominant
circulating viruses. The virus strains circulating are well matched to
the current influenza vaccine and very little antiviral resistance has
been detected;

- 57 acute respiratory disease outbreaks were reported in the UK in
week 49, 55 schools, one care home and one hospital;

- 84 of 149 (56.4 percent) specimens from patients with ILI
presenting to sentinel GPs in England in week 49 were reported as
positive for influenza.

Following the increase in the level of seasonal influenza circulating
in the UK reported last week, the Department of Health issued guidance
on the use of antiviral drugs for the management of those influenza
patients in England who are at high risk of developing complications
from flu [3]. The Department is also encouraging those in at-risk
groups to be vaccinated and has written to PCTs [primary care trusts]
suggesting that GP practices should actively invite those in at-risk
groups to visit surgeries to be vaccinated [4]. The Chief Medical
Officer has also issued an update on appropriate guidelines for the
treatment and management of patients with influenza in secondary care
and other settings [5]. Updated guidance on the pharmacological
treatment and prophylaxis of influenza has just been published on the
HPA website [6]. The HPA has reiterated that, although not
life-threatening for most people, seasonal flu can be far more
dangerous for those in "at-risk" groups: people aged 65 and over, and
people aged under 65 in clinical risk groups, which includes all
pregnant women.
