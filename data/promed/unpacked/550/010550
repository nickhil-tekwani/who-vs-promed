2001 Cereal Rust Bulletin #7 July 10, 2001 [extract
Hot, dry weather stopped stripe rust development in most of the U.S.

[The small grain harvest has commenced from southern Michigan to southern
South Dakota. Winter wheat is generally in good condition. In the northern
small grain area, the warm temperatures and dry conditions have pushed
spring-sown grain development closer to the normal growth stage for this
time of the year, but the crop still remains slightly behind.
During the last week in June, stripe rust was the most common rust found on
small grains throughout Nebraska and South Dakota. ... But by late June and
early July, the onset of hot [and dry conditions effectively stopped stripe
rust development throughout the Great Plains.
