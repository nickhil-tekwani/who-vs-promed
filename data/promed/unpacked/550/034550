The risk of contracting Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the
Southern Federal District is increasing. According to Vladimir
Rijkov, head of the Russian epidemiology service, this is mainly a
consequence of benign weather conditions. The chief public health
physician of Russia had previously issued a document concerning
control of the spread of the CCHF virus.
Although the CCHF virus has been known for half a century, there is
no preventive vaccine or effective method of treatment of the
disease. Currently, 55 cases of CCHF have been registered in Rostov,
a significant rise in incidence according to Rijkov. "Despite all our
efforts, the number of cases of CCHF in Rostov and other towns of the
Southern Federal District towns is increasing. Last year [2006],
there were only 19 cases in Rostov.
Depletion of the tick population has been less than usual on account
of the mild winter. As a consequence, ticks have been more active
than in previous years and tick-bites are being recorded earlier.
People have been seeking treatment for tick bites as early as
February this year [2007]. [To date], more than 400 cases of
tick-bites have been recorded in the Southern Federal District with
more than 70 of them reported on the 1st holiday of the year, when
people venture into the countryside for the 1st time [after the
winter], according to Vladimir Rijkov.

[Weather conditions -- a mild winter and a hot summer -- in the
Southern Federal District are reminiscent of the 1999 situation, when
the largest outbreaks of the last decade -- CCHF in the Obliv
district of Rostov and West Nile fever in Volgograd -- were recorded
