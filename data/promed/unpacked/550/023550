A cholera outbreak in Liberia's war-battered capital has
struck down nearly 500 people, but no deaths have yet been
reported, officials said yesterday.
Health Minister Peter Coleman told reporters that the
bacterial infection has stricken 499 in Monrovia over the
past month, with 188 admitted to hospital. "Fortunately
for us, there has been no death," he said.
Most people in the city are still without running water or
proper waste-disposal systems after a 1989-2003 civil war
destroyed the country's infrastructure.
Cholera, a severe bacterial infection of the intestine
caused by ingesting infected food or water and poor
sanitation, is frequently reported in Africa. Symptoms of
the disease include diarrhoea and vomiting, which can kill
unless treated quickly.

[2] Cholera - Liberia (Monrovia)

Health Minister Peter Coleman says although the disease is gradually
spreading throughout the city, no deaths have been reported so far.
Liberian officials have reported the acute outbreak of diarrhea or
cholera in Monrovia and its environs with at least 150 persons
admitted at the Cholera Intensive Care Unit in Sinkor.
Minister Coleman explained that following the outbreak of the
epidemic, his ministry and other health institutions have been
devising plans to carry out the chlorination of wells in Monrovia and
its environs.
"We are conducting analysis of water in various parts of the city,"
said Minister Coleman. We will also be launching community-based
educational campaigns in Monrovia and its environs." The minister
said his ministry is in the process of mobilizing resources to
contain the epidemic. He cautioned the public against buying cold
water and [coolade] sold in plastic bags on the streets of Monrovia
since they do not know the source of the water.
Although a transitional government headed by Gyude Bryant has been in power
since 2003, nothing has been done to restore safe drinking water to Monrovia
and its environs. The health minister is urging residents in Monrovia and its
environs to boil their water before drinking and wash all fruits they buy on
the market before eating them.

Cholera outbreak kills 3 in Kenya
---------------------------------
The Kenyan government has confirmed an outbreak of cholera which it said has
killed 3 people in Nairobi in the past 4 days. The Ministry of Health said in
a statement Fri, 10 Jun 2005, that 64 cases had so far been reported and that
6 people were admitted to local health centers.
"So far 64 cases have been seen, 6 admitted, 3 suspected cases have
died (1 died at home, 1 on admission at Bahati Health Center and 1 at
Pumwani Hospital)," the country's chief physician, James Nyikal said
in the statement. He said intervention teams have been set up and
measures put in place for free treatment for all suspected cases of
cholera.
"Among the measures [taken] to contain the situation are clearing and spraying
of waste water drains, clearing of garbage, installation of pilled [sic -- I
suppose it's a typo for "piped". - Mod.JW] water, new toilets are being put up
and food hawking in the area has been banned," said Nyikal.
Health experts fear many more people may have died, as the official
death toll is based on those who sought treatment at medical centers
and hospitals. Some victims live far away from hospitals and are in
no fit state to travel; others are reluctant to seek treatment.

Cholera Claims 2 More Lives in Nairobi
--------------------------------------
The number of deaths following an outbreak of a waterborne disease in
some Nairobi estates has risen to 5. Health officials said 2 more
people died yesterday, 8 Jun 2005, while 9 others were admitted to
Kenyatta National Hospital, St Teresa and Bahati clinics.
2 patients who had been admitted to Bahati on Tue, 7 Jun 2005 were
treated and discharged, while 5 others were transferred to Kenyatta.
Public health officials from the Nairobi city council yesterday, 8
Jun 2005, took samples of water from Motherland slum in Eastleigh
Phase 3 for analysis, a Ministry of Health official told the Nation.
The official said tests done on some of the patients admitted to
Kenyatta showed the disease could be cholera.
The council officials held a meeting with the acting provincial
medical officer of health and other top officials from the ministry
at Nyayo House to discuss the outbreak and their findings. The
meeting followed a joint meeting between the health officials and the
provincial administration at Eastleigh yesterday afternoon, to
enlighten the community on precautionary measures to be taken. The
residents, they said, should ensure proper sanitation, boil water
before drinking, and wash their hands before eating. They were also
told that leaving the patients in the house heightened [other family
members'] chances of infection. The patients should be taken to
hospital and treated separately.
In Bahati, health personnel said 3 more patients were admitted
yesterday suffering from diarrhea and vomiting. A team from City
Hall, led by public health nurse Angela Njiru, was at the clinic in
the morning. The patients (one male and 2 female) were being treated.
Tests from the patients were forwarded to the Government Chemist for
further analysis.
3 people died on 6 and 7 Jun 2005 and several others were admitted to
various hospitals. Doctors said the 3 died after developing severe
diarrhea and vomiting. The victims were suspected to have drunk
contaminated water from a borehole near a garbage dump.

45 students down with food poisoning
------------------------------------
45 students from Sekolah Rendah Amar Pahlawan, Berakas were admitted
to the RIPAS Accident and Emergency Section yesterday, 8 Jun 2005,
after they suffered from a bout of vomiting and diarrhea due to
suspected food poisoning. The hospital received a call from a teacher
at around 10 am.
3 ambulances were rushed to the school to take all 45 students -- 22
girls and 23 boys -- to the RIPAS Hospital. It was learnt that the
children had consumed a chocolate drink during recess, which is
believed to be the cause of the alleged food poisoning. The children
were released later the same day.

[6] Shigellosis - USA (KY)

Officials try to contain shigellosis
------------------------------------
Fayette County health officials are urging people to wash their hands
often to contain a recent infectious disease outbreak. Jim Wilkins,
public information officer for the Lexington-Fayette County Health
Department, said 26 cases of shigellosis have been reported since 26
May 2005.
Wilkins said 22 pre-school children and 4 parents have been diagnosed
with shigellosis. He said the cases appeared in 3 Lexington day-care
centers, but he declined to name them. The disease is most commonly
spread when children or adults do not wash their hands after using
the bathroom, before they prepare or eat food, after changing diapers
or taking care of people who might be ill.
Antibiotics can treat shigellosis, and patients usually recover in 5
to 7 days, according to the CDC. Though symptoms can be severe enough
to cause hospitalization, Wilkins said no Lexington patients have
been hospitalized. "In fact, we haven't even had any cases from the
emergency room," Wilkins said. "They've all come from family doctors."
The CDC advises against using antidiarrheal agents to treat symptoms.
They could make the illness worse. Wilkins said environmentalists
and epidemiologists have visited day-care centers but haven't
identified the origin of the outbreak.
In Mar 2005, Woodford County officials confirmed at least 9 cases of
shigellosis. The last major outbreak in the state came when Jefferson
County officials reported 863 cases in 1996.
Wilkins said frequent and thorough handwashing will stop the spread
of the disease. "Before you prepare food, after you change a diaper,
wash your hands all the time," Wilkins said. "A regular bar of soap
will do the trick, but you have to do it often."
