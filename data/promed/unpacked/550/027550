_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Bovismorbificans phage type 32 traced to
iceberg lettuce
-------------------------------------------------
In response to the recent posting of a cluster of _Salmonella enterica_
serotype Bovismorbificans in Denmark, the following information briefly
describes the investigation of an outbreak of _Salmonella_ serotype
Bovismorbificans phage type 32 infection which recently occurred in
Queensland, Australia. A total of 41 cases of _S._ serotype
Bovismorbificans were notified to Queensland Health between May and July
this year. 36 of the 41 cases were phage type 32, 4 were phage type 14, and
one was phage type 24.
_Salmonella_ serotype Bovismorbificans is a moderately common serovar in
Australia, with approximately 100 cases reported each year. _S._ serotype
Bovismorbificans phage type 32, however, has only recently been reported in
Australia, with 7 sporadic cases of human infection occurring in 1997, and
11 cases in 2000. There have been very few reported outbreaks of _S._
serotype Bovismorbificans in Australia, and none due to phage type 32. 2
outbreaks of _S._ serotype Bovismorbificans phage type 7 which occurred in
New South Wales in 1991 were traced to a fruit salad supplier.
Internationally, 2 large outbreaks of _S._ serotype Bovismorbificans in
Finland and Sweden in 1994 were linked to alfalfa sprouts using seeds
imported from Australia.
A total of 36 cases of _S._ serotype Bovismorbificans phage type 32
[infection were identified in this recent outbreak. Specimen collection
dates ranged from 20 May to 27 Jun 2001. The median age of cases was 22.5
years (range 1-72 years), 47 percent were aged between 20 and 39 years, and
50 percent were female. Cases were resident across Queensland, and no
associated cases were identified in other Australian States or Territories.
A case control study identified a significant association between illness
and having eaten a particular takeaway food product in the 7 days prior to
onset (matched odds ratio: undefined, 95 percent CI 9.5 - ?, P<0.001) and
between illness and eating food from the takeaway premises (matched OR:
17.5, 95 percent CI 2.0 - 657, P=0.004). Environmental and microbiological
investigations were conducted on the suppliers of the various food
ingredients for this takeaway food product.
Subsequently, _S._ serotype Bovismorbificans phage type 32 was cultured
from a swab of food residue taken from behind the blade of a shredder,
specifically used for slicing iceberg lettuce only. The shredded iceberg
lettuce was the primary component used in the production of a salad mix.
This salad mix was one of the ingredients for the takeaway food product
implicated in the epidemiological study. We were unable to culture this
pathogen directly from samples of iceberg lettuce or salad mix, and the
source of contamination of the lettuce was not identified. Molecular typing
of the fecal and environmental isolates is currently being undertaken.
In summary, the epidemiological and microbiological evidence suggests that
the takeaway food product was the likely vehicle of transmission and that
contaminated iceberg lettuce was the salad ingredient responsible for this
outbreak. Based on the results of this investigation, the food product was
withdrawn from sale. No further cases have since been reported.
