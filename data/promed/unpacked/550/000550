West Nile Virus-positive Bird Total in Indiana Now 39
-----------------------------------------------------
INDIANAPOLIS: A total of 9 more dead birds, found in Clark, Lake, and

first time birds have tested positive for the virus in Clark and
Vanderburgh counties.
The information on the birds is as follows: 1 dead hawk found in Clark

dead bluejay found in Lake County on 27 Sep; 1 dead crow found in Lake

State health officials have now confirmed 39 birds as positive for West
Nile virus since it was first detected in Indiana on 21 Aug 2001. No human
cases have occurred in the state.
West Nile encephalitis virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. Health officials
say the mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus are night-time biting
mosquitoes, and warn Indiana residents that night-time exposure to
mosquitoes increases a person's risk of being infected by the virus.
