CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) collected different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Hadar infections.

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data showed that ground turkey made people sick. As of 17 May 2021, this outbreak is over.

Epidemiologic data
--------------------
As of 17 May 2021, a total of 33 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Hadar were reported from 14 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 28 Dec 2020 to 22 Apr 2021.

Location / Number of sick people
----------------------------------------
Arizona / 1
Connecticut / 2
Indiana / 1
Maine / 1
Maryland / 1
Massachusetts / 7
Missouri / 2
New Hampshire / 1
New Jersey / 3
New York / 4
North Carolina / 3
Pennsylvania / 4
Vermont / 1
Virginia / 2

Sick people ranged in age from less than 1 to 92 years, with a median age of 49 years; 66% of people were female. Of 22 people with information available, 4 were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.

State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 13 people interviewed, 8 (62%) reported eating ground turkey. This percentage was significantly higher than results from a 2018-2019 survey of healthy people in which 13% of respondents reported eating ground turkey in the week before they were interviewed. This suggested that people in this outbreak got sick from eating ground turkey.

Laboratory and traceback data
-----------------------
Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same food.

USDA-FSIS collected an unopened package of ground turkey from a sick person's freezer for testing. Testing results showed that the ground turkey contained the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_. The traceback investigation found that the ground turkey purchased by the sick person was produced by Plainville Brands, LLC. Not all illnesses were linked to ground turkey produced by Plainville Brands, LLC. Sick people reported buying many different brands of ground turkey from multiple stores, and USDA-FSIS's traceback investigation identified several turkey-processing facilities. The outbreak strain was also identified in routine turkey samples, from multiple companies, collected by USDA-FSIS and state officials from 13 establishments.

WGS predicted that _Salmonella_ bacteria from 33 people's samples and 19 turkey samples were resistant to one or both of the antibacterials streptomycin and tetracycline. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antimicrobials. However, if therapy is needed for an infection related to this outbreak, this resistance likely will not affect the choice of antibacterial used to treat most people.

Public health actions
---------------------
On 10 Apr [2021], USDA-FSIS issued a public health alert for approximately 211 406 pounds of raw ground turkey products produced by Plainville Brands, LLC. These products had the establishment number "P-244" inside the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) mark of inspection. They were made from 18-29 Dec 2020 and were sold nationwide. CDC and FSIS also shared information about this outbreak with members of the National Turkey Federation.

[This post gives additional information regarding this now-resolved ground-turkey-related outbreak of _S._ Hadar. As noted, the organism involved had some degree of antimicrobial resistance but not related to the antibacterials that would be chosen to treat salmonellosis. Clearly, most cases of salmonellosis are self-limited over 4-5 days and do not require specific antimicrobial therapy. - Mod.LL
