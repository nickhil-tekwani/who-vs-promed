The Secretariat of Health of the State of Bahia (SESAB) confirmed
this Wednesday [11 Feb 2009] the death of the 4th child caused by
dengue this year [2008] in the state. The death of the 11-year-old
boy was confirmed today [11 Feb 2009]. He died in the early hours of
Sunday [8 Feb 2009] in the Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes Hospital, in Porto Seguro.

Besides the 4 deaths already confirmed, according to SESAB, another 6
suspected dengue deaths were reported since the beginning of January
[2009]. Of these, 5 are children of the municipalities of Jequie,
Porto Seguro and Itabuna. The other death is a woman of 27 years who
died in Jequie. [Samples from] all these cases are tested by the
Professor Goncalo Moniz (Lacen) Central Laboratory of Public Health.

Jequie municipality already recorded 2637 cases of [dengue] disease
(corresponding to 60 percent of total cases in the state).

According to SESAB, since the beginning of January [2009], 4272 cases
of classical dengue were registered throughout the state, and 84 were

The 3212 cases of dengue reported last month in January [2009] in
Espirito Santo indicate the beginning of a [dengue] epidemic in the
state. According to the State Secretariat of Health, the number of
reported cases in January of this year [2009] is 400 percent higher
than that recorded in the same month of 2008, when there were 758
reported cases of the disease. Only last week [week of 1 Feb 2009],
the state had 1011 cases.

According to the Secretariat, the trend is that in a few weeks the
most explosive period of the disease will occur. The forecast is
based on the history of the last 2 years, where the peak incidence of
the disease began in March, after the rainy season. In December of
last year [2008], there were 1495 reported [dengue cases], up to 3212
suspected dengue cases in the past month [January 2009]. Last year
[2008], the peak occurred in the month March, when 3636 reported
[cases] were recorded.

In the worst national [dengue] outbreak in a decade, 9 Bolivians have
died after contracting DHF, officials announced Saturday [14 Feb 2009].

The health ministry reported 64 confirmed cases of people with the
deadly DHF virus and some 15 800 people with regular dengue fever.
Local media reported the number of people affected by the classical
type of dengue fever was around 20 000.

Authorities have declared a health emergency in the central, eastern
and northern parts of the country, in the departments [state or
province equivalents] of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando and Cochabamba.

The hemorrhagic variant of the dengue virus [infection] is much more
dangerous than the classic type because it causes violent internal
bleeding and swift fluid loss, which can lead to a quick, painful
death if not treated in time.

This year [2009], 115 persons have been diagnosed with dengue for the
year, but there is no outbreak of the infection, according to Chief
Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Shamdeo Persaud, who said the Ministry of
Health has been monitoring the situation closely.

Dr Persaud told Stabroek News that while the number of positive cases
may appear high, it should be taken against the background that the
ministry has been testing many more persons than it did in the past.

According to Dr Persaud, the figure of 115 is for the 1st 5 weeks of
the year [2009], and the number was out of the 468 persons who were
tested. For the same period last year [2008], 154 persons were
tested, and 43 were found to be positive [for dengue virus
infection]. He was careful to stress that there is no "outbreak" of
dengue fever and that the cases were taken from both private and
public institutions.

The CMO said that the ministry has stepped up its surveillance from
mid last year [2008] since neighbouring countries such as Trinidad
and Brazil have seen increases in the number of persons affected. In
the case of Trinidad, there have been some deaths from dengue.

There has been no death recorded here from the disease, Dr Persaud
asserted, and of the positive cases, 65 are from Region 4, 27 from
Region 9, and of that number, 14 were visiting Brazilians. Region 3
saw 8 cases; Regions 5 and 6 had 3 cases, while Regions 7, 8 and 10
had no cases.

The Berbice area that borders Suriname has been closely monitored, as
according to Dr Persaud, Suriname has seen some cases of DHF, the
deadly dengue fever. He said while no DHF has so far been recorded in
Guyana, the ministry wants to ensure that it remains that way.

Dr Persaud disclosed that the ministry has also reinforced its port
health regulations and that aircraft coming from certain countries,
such as Trinidad, have to be sprayed. The empty spray can has to be
collected by the port health official at the airport, and the flight
attendants are also asked to report any cases of fever that may have
been brought to their attention.

"We are actively going after dengue fever, and we are doing a lot
more community-wise by following up on cases and visiting homes to
sensitize other occupants of the household. We also advise people who
have dengue to sleep under nets even during the day," Dr Persaud said.

[Spraying arriving aircraft is likely to be of limited value in
preventing ongoing dengue virus transmission or introduction of the
virus into the country. The arrival of infected and viremic
individuals poses much greater risk. Focusing on household efforts is
the most productive approach to dealing with local dengue virus transmission.

There has been a 20.5 per cent increase in the incidence of petechial
fever [dengue fever] nationwide, compared to the same period last
year [2008], with about 3000 people affected already this year [2009].

Mosquitoes are the main carrier of the disease, which is dangerous
for babies and overweight children. It can lead to respiratory and
digestive problems.

Prolonged rain and poor living conditions, such as dirty houses
surrounded by lakes, ponds, and stagnant water, create favourable
breeding conditions for mosquitoes.

Ministry of Health spokesman Nguyen Huy Nga said southern Dong Nai
Province was the hardest hit, with more than 300 cases, followed by
Mekong Delta Tien Giang province with 290 cases.

Although the number of petechial fever [dengue fever] patients
increased, other diseases had fallen, including encephalitis (down 47
per cent), typhoid (20 per cent), and malaria (13.7 per cent).

The Public Health Ministry has set up a national war room to control
the spread of dengue fever across the country after learning the
situation will be far worse than last year [2008].

So far, 1675 people have fallen victim to the fever this year [2009],
said the Minister, Witthaya Kaewparadai.

The ministry's deputy permanent secretary, Dr Paijit Warachit, will
chair the war room, teaming up with agencies including the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration's Health Department, the World Health
Organisation (WHO), and a joint activity of the Ministry of Public
Health of Thailand and the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to monitor the spread of disease within Thailand and
neighbouring countries. They will meet at least once a week to keep a
close watch on any possible outbreak.

Witthaya added he has assigned all provincial public health offices,
local administration organizations, and health volunteers to strictly
control and monitor the transmission of dengue fever in local areas.

Local authorities have been advised to spray insecticide to eradicate
the adult _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which bites humans in the daytime.

Residents should drain off any stagnant water to prevent mosquitoes
from breeding and use abates sand, a pesticide, to destroy their larvae.

Citing Bureau of Epidemiology records, Paijit said in January this
year [2009], 1675 people had been infected with dengue fever and 2
had died. The figure for the same period last year [2008] was 1553
dengue fever cases reported and 2 lives lost.

The Central region was the hardest hit with 886 patients, the
Southern region suffered the 2nd worst outbreak with 546 patients,
and Bangkok, 303. Songkhla, Pattani, and Yala were the worst affected
provinces. Nearly half the patients this year [2009] were over 15 years old.

Last year [2008] saw a total of 91 003 patients, with 65 581 cases in 2007.

In a bid for early detection of dengue fever infection, Witthaya said
he has asked the Department of Medical Services to study a test kit
to screen patients.

This month [February 2009], the Department of Disease Control will
organize meetings to brainstorm on prevention and control planning in
30 high risk areas nationwide.

Witthaya has asked the public to keep a close watch on people in
their households and nurseries. If anyone develops a high fever over
a 2-day period, they should be taken to a doctor.

The number of dengue fever cases in north Queensland has passed 400,
as authorities fight 3 strains of the disease [dengue virus].
Queensland Health says 21 new cases were confirmed over the weekend,
17 in the Cairns area and 4 in the Townsville area.

Port Douglas in the state's far-north still has only one case of the
mosquito-borne disease, while no further cases of the troubling
dengue [virus] type 2 have been confirmed.

Last week, 2 Cairns patients were diagnosed with dengue type 2 [virus
infection], meaning authorities are fighting 3 strains of the disease
[dengue virus].

It has heightened concern around the outbreak, as people who have had
dengue are at risk of serious illnesses, even death, if they contract
another strain of the virus.

The number of dengue fever cases confirmed since the 1 Dec 2008
outbreak now stands at 418.

but the 3rd dengue virus type involved in the Queensland outbreak has
not been mentioned.
