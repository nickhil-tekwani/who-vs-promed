Health experts confirmed [Fri 19 May 2017] the discovery of 3 birds that tested positive for West Nile virus in Michigan -- the earliest detection of the virus in the past decade.

The 1st detection of positive birds in the state this early into the year indicates a higher risk for human West Nile cases later in the summer, said Ned Walker, a researcher of mosquito-borne diseases at Michigan State University.

"Early bird positive means early season transmission activity and heightened early seasonal risk," Walker said. "More virus early, more human cases later."

West Nile virus was identified this week [week of Sun 14 May 2017] in one turkey found in Barry County and 2 crows -- one from Kalamazoo County and one from Saginaw County, said Jennifer Eisner, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

Although it's the 1st time in 10 years West Nile virus has been found in birds this early in the year, Eisner said it's important to note the detection process largely relies on the public to report dead birds for testing.

Because Barry and Kalamazoo counties have no mosquito control authorities, Walker said findings of the virus in those counties this early suggest widespread, early mosquito transmission.

"Every once in a while there is an early bird infection but having 3 spread out across the state like that is a bit unusual," Walker said. "The warm weather is key and it hasn't been that warm in Michigan, rather on the cool side."

Last year [2016], there were 43 serious illnesses in people and 3 deaths related to West Nile virus [infection] in Michigan, Eisner said.

The majority of human cases were in Southeast Michigan, according to the department.

The 3 West Nile-positive birds this year [2017] were found sick or dead early in May and were tested this week at Michigan State University, Eisner said.

West Nile is transmitted to humans most often through mosquito bites, Eisner said. The mosquitoes themselves become infected after feeding on a bird carrying the virus.

About 2 in 10 people bitten by an infected mosquito experience any illness, said William Stanuszek, director of the Saginaw County Mosquito Abatement Commission. For those who experience illness, it typically comes on about 3 - 15 days after being bitten and carries mild symptoms of fever, headache and body aches, Stanuszek said. About one in 150 people will suffer severe illness, Stanuszek said. Those most at risk for severe symptoms are people over the age of 50.

Kelly Straka, a wildlife veterinarian with the state, said it's important the public reports all sick and dead birds to help experts better understand and take measures against the virus.

"As with many wildlife diseases, vigilant observation and reporting from the public are critical in helping health and wildlife experts better understand and contain the transmission of West Nile Virus," Straka said in a statement.

"We ask residents to contact us if they find sick or dead crows, blackbirds, owls or hawks, or any other bird exhibiting signs of illness."

[West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the lower 48 states of the USA. Finding WNV infected birds in Michigan is not unusual, but finding them this early in the season is. Whether they are harbingers of an above-average WNV transmission season to come remains to be seen, and depends on vector mosquito and susceptible bird abundance through the summer and early autumn transmission season. It would be wise for Michigan horse owners to vaccinate their animals now. Unfortunately, there is no commercially available WNV vaccine for humans. Avoiding mosquito bites and targeted mosquito vector control are the only currently available measures for prevention of human infection. - Mod.TY
