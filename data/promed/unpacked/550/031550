[1] Bacterial wilt, rhizome rot - Jamaica

The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries [MAF] has been providing support for ginger cultivation and made a commitment to plant some 150 acres [60 ha] of ginger and 350 acres [140 ha] of turmeric this year [2012]. Jamaican ginger production declined from some 900 mt per year during the 1990's to 298 mt in 2008, largely due to the impact of 2 major plant diseases -- bacterial wilt and rhizome rot.

The national short-term production target of 21 000 mt of fresh ginger requires approximately 3000 cultivated acres [1200 ha, as well as] disease-free ginger planting material of about 2700 mt per year. Given the impact of diseases on the industry, MAF has been evaluating the production of disease-free planting material using a combination of tissue culture, protected environment and hydroponic technologies. These trials have performed credibly.

For 2012, the ginger development project will specifically target acreage expansion in areas with minimal disease impact; husbandry improvements in areas that show signs of disease; and commercial production of disease-free ginger planting material.

[2] Soft rot, leaf spot - India (Karnataka)

Farmers walk along disease-ridden ginger plots near Banavasi [Uttara Kannada District, Karnataka]. This year [2012], soft rot disease along with the decline in prices has [dashed] their hopes. Incessant rainfall during the monsoon is considered to be the [reason] for the disease [as well as] over-application of fertiliser, [which] leads to quick vegetative growth and also increases the possibility of infection. According to farmers, leaf spot disease and shoot borer attack were also noticed.

[Wilt diseases of ginger (_Zingiber officinalis_), often associated with rhizome (soft) rots, due to a number of bacterial (_Ralstonia solanacearum_, _Erwinia_ species) and fungal (_Fusarium_ or _Pythium_ species) pathogens have been reported. They are serious diseases which may lead to total crop losses. Symptoms generally include yellowing and wilting of leaves, rotting of leaf bases and rhizomes, and eventually death of the plants. The pathogens are mostly soil borne and also spread with infected plant material (including seed rhizomes), water and by mechanical means. Rhizome rots are favoured by humid conditions and high soil moisture. Disease management may include the use of well-drained planting sites, crop rotation, preventative chemical treatments of rhizomes for planting and use of certified disease free planting material. However, in affected areas, even plants derived from disease-free rhizomes have a very high risk of being infected from local pathogen reservoirs.

In India and the surrounding region, _Pythium_ species are most commonly reported as the cause of soft rot of ginger (as well as related crops like cardamom). All of the commercial ginger germplasm available today is highly susceptible to _Pythium_ soft rot, but the related ornamental _Z. zerumbet_ was identified as a potential
source of genetic resistance.

Leaf spot of ginger is caused by the fungus _Phyllosticta zingiberis_. Symptoms include water soaked leaf spots, which develop dark brown margins and later coalesce to form necrotic areas. The pathogen is spread mainly by rain splash and consequently disease incidence is often severe under exposed conditions. Disease management usually relies on fungicide applications, but spraying may need to be repeated following wet periods.

The shoot borer (_Conogethes punctiferalis_; also called yellow peach moth) is considered one of the most important pests of ginger.
