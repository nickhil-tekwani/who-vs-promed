The infectious bird flu disease (H5N8) has spread to 2 new governorates in the province of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. New cases of the avian influenza were discovered at Al-Quaiya and Dharma.

The H5N8 disease was 1st discovered at Al-Aziziya Market before hitting the governorates of Al-Kharj and Huraimila.

The Ministry of the Environment, Water and Agriculture reported 8 new cases at a poultry project in Riyadh, which led to the culling of 85 627 birds. The authorities have also culled 1232 birds at 12 locations in the region of Mazahmiya.

Saudi Arabia had confirmed an outbreak of highly contagious bird flu in Riyadh that led to the culling of nearly 16 000 ducks, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said last Friday [22 Dec 2017].

Earlier this week, the United Arab Emirates suspended imports of live and frozen as well as table eggs and chicks from Saudi Arabia. This was followed by the Kingdom of Jordan, which banned all imports from Saudi Arabia of poultry, frozen poultry, and poultry meat which didn't undergo thermal processing (see http://www.promedmail.org/post/5527272). - Mod.AS
