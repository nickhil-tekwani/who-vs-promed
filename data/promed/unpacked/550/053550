Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) is advising parents to ensure
their children are fully vaccinated against measles, following a
massive outbreak of the illness throughout Europe. Almost 10 percent
of measles cases in Ireland this year [2011] were contracted abroad.

Since the beginning of this year [2011], there have been more than 21
000 measles cases in Europe, with 7 fatalities. Many of the cases have
occurred in popular holiday destinations such as France, Spain,
Belgium and Italy.

In Ireland, some 110 cases have been reported since January 2011. The
HSE has urged parents to check that their children have had the MMR
[mumps, measles and rubella] jab before travelling. Their current
immunization rate stands at 91 percent but needs to increase to 95
percent, the HSE added.

Ongoing measles outbreak in Romania, 2011
---------------------------------
[Citation style for this article: Stanescu A, Janta D, Lupulescu E,
Necula G, Lazar M, Molnar G, Pistol A. Ongoing measles outbreak in
Romania, 2011. Euro Surveill. 2011;16(31)]

Summary:
--------------
Since January 2011 up to June 2011, Romania has been experiencing a
measles outbreak, with 2072 cases notified in 29 of the 42 Romanian
districts. Most cases occurred in the north-western part of the
country among unvaccinated children, with the highest number of cases
(893 cases) registered in children aged one to 4 years. This report
underlines once more the need for additional measures targeting
susceptible populations to achieve high vaccination coverage with 2
doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. No measles-related deaths have
so far been notified in 2011.

Abbreviated text:
---------------------
[Interested readers are referred to the full text at the source URL to
view the data, tables and references cited.]

An outbreak of measles was 1st noticed in late August 2010 in the
north-eastern part of Romania [1], and by the end of the year, 193
cases were registered in the whole country.

Measles is a statutorily notifiable disease since 1978 in Romania, and
medical practitioners have to immediately report all suspected measles
cases to the local public health authorities. At national level, the
National Centre for Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control in
Bucharest collects and analyses all notifications of measles cases.
National case-based notification was initiated in 1999, and the
European Union (EU) case definition and case classification have been
adopted since 2005 [2].

The monovalent measles-containing vaccine was introduced in 1979 in
the Romanian immunisation schedule for children aged 9-11 months. In
1994, the 2nd measles vaccine dose was introduced for children aged
between 6-7 years (1st school grade). The combined
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine replaced the monovalent measles
vaccine in 2004 and was recommended as a 1st dose for children aged
12-15 months. The 2nd MMR vaccine has been recommended for children
aged between 6 and 7 years since October 2005.

Between 2000 and 2008, the national measles vaccination coverage for
children aged between 18 and 24 months with the 1st dose of
measles-containing vaccine was estimated at 97-98 percent, and for
children aged 7 years, the vaccination coverage with the 2nd dose of
measles-containing vaccine was estimated at 96-98 percent [3]. In the
last 2 years, a constant decrease could be noticed in the measles
vaccination coverage for children aged 12 months. According to the
vaccination coverage reports, in 2009, the coverage for the 1st MMR
vaccine dose was 85.1 percent (95 percent CI: 82.4-87.8) at the age of
12 months and reached the target of 95 percent (95 percent CI:
93.4-95.8) coverage for children aged 18 months. A high number of
children remain unvaccinated not only in the hard-to-reach communities
but also in the general population, due to parental refusal and
scepticism regarding the benefits of the vaccination.

Vaccination coverage for the 2nd dose of MMR vaccine is reported every
year by the school medical staff to the local health authorities after
the school vaccination campaign. In 2010, the reported coverage for
the 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine, calculated using the
number of doses administrated divided by the total number of eligible
children aged 7 years was 93.4 percent (95 percent CI: 90.7-95.0).

Here, we report an ongoing measles outbreak in Romania by analysing
measles data available from 1 Jan to 30 Jun 2011. From the beginning
of 2011 until 30 Jun 2011, a total number of 2072 measles cases were
notified by the local public health authorities. The highest number of
cases was registered among children aged between one and 4 years (893
cases), followed by the 5-9 year-olds (445 cases) and the infants
under one year of age (303 cases). Among the 10-14 year-olds, there
were 189 cases identified, 150 cases in those aged 20 years and above
and 92 cases were registered among adolescents aged between 15 and 19
years.

Among the total number of cases, approximately half occurred in
hard-to-reach communities. The monthly incidence increased from 131
cases registered in January 2011 to a peak of 515 cases in May 2011
and decreased in June 2011, when the number of notified cases was
437.

The laboratory confirmation was performed by detecting measles IgM
antibodies in serum samples. Due to many local outbreaks, the
laboratory confirmation was performed only in some of the 1st cases
identified in a particular area until D4 genotype was confirmed. For
those cases with a clear epidemiological link with the outbreak, the
epidemiological confirmation criteria were used. Of the 2072 notified
measles cases, 898 were laboratory-confirmed; 1161 were probable cases
with documented epidemiological link, and 13 were clinical measles
cases for whom sera could not be obtained due to parental refusal.
RT-PCR techniques to detect measles virus nucleic acid were also used
to confirm the 1st cases from some affected districts. Twelve viruses
were genotyped by a nested RT-PCR reaction which targeted a 450 nt
region at the C-terminus of the N protein (Nc region). All of them
belonged to D4 genotype currently circulating in Europe [4].

Of the total number of 2072 measles cases, 800 (38.6 percent)
presented complications: 582 (72.8 percent) cases developed pneumonia,
203 (25.4 percent) diarrhoea, 8 (one percent) malnutrition, 5 (0.62
percent) convulsions and 2 (0.25 percent) encephalitis.

Most cases occurred among unvaccinated children, representing 72.8
percent from the total number of cases registered during period
mentioned above. Of these, only 19.8 percent were not eligible for MMR
vaccination due to their age (under 12 months).

Several control measures have been implemented by the local health
authorities in their efforts to stop this outbreak. An additional MMR
vaccination campaign started in the affected areas targeting all
children aged between 7 months and 7 years, irrespective of their
measles vaccination status.

Discussion and conclusions
-----------------------
Despite the high national immunisation coverage with MMR vaccine
reported during the last 10 years, this outbreak highlights the
presence of pockets of individuals vulnerable to measles and
particularly those members of hard-to-reach communities, but not only.
We observed that more parents, even among highly educated persons,
lost their confidence in vaccination benefits for their children, and
this became an important problem that needs to be addressed.

The current measles outbreak in Romania and in other European
countries reveal the need for increased awareness on the declining
confidence that people have in vaccination benefits for their children
and for public health intervention focused in hard-to-reach
communities. In addition, after the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009, a
constant scepticism and refusal regarding vaccination in general could
be noticed, not only in hard-to-reach communities, but also in the
general population.

In areas and communities where vaccine coverage remains sub-optimum,
large cohorts of susceptible people accumulate and represent a
potential for large outbreaks. The large proportion of cases observed
in infants suggests an intensely circulating measles virus [7].

[The continued existence of pockets of individuals vulnerable to
measles virus infection in both hard-to-reach [e.g. Roma] communities
and a declining confidence of the benefits of vaccination in others
are hurdles that will have to be overcome before measles can be
eradicated from Europe.

This problem has been considered in detail in a recent article
entitled: "Addressing the vaccine confidence gap," published in The
Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9790, Pages 526-535, 6 Aug 2011, by Dr Heidi
J Larson
(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60678-8/abstract?rss=yes).
Among other things, the authors conclude that: "Although provision of
accurate, scientifically based evidence on the risk-benefit ratios of
vaccines is crucial, it is not enough to redress the gap between
current levels of public confidence in vaccines and levels of trust
needed to ensure adequate and sustained vaccine coverage. More
research is needed not just on individual determinants of public
trust, but on what mix of factors are most likely to sustain public
trust."

Measles cases in the West Midlands have more than doubled in the past
year. The Health Protection Agency has confirmed 30 youngsters caught
the potentially deadly virus in the 1st 6 months of 2011 compared to
just 13 in the whole of last year [2010]. The majority of the new
cases have involved schoolchildren, but 8 of the infections have hit
people in their 20s and 30s.

Nationally, there have been 654 victims of measles since January 2011,
compared to the 374 in 2010. Health bosses say the surge is linked to
high numbers of infections in Europe and warned that families jetting
off for summer holidays should have their children immunised as soon
as possible.

Dr Musarrat Afza, in charge of immunisation in the West Midlands,
said: "We're very encouraged to see that MMR (mumps, measles and
rubella vaccine) uptake is continuing at high levels in the region,
indicating increasing levels of trust by parents in the immunisation
programme. "We're on the way to reaching our goal of 95 per cent
uptake across the region, and already some of our Primary Care Trusts
have achieved this. But anyone who missed out on MMR as a child will
continue to be at risk of measles, which explains why we are seeing
these new cases in a broad age range. It's that time of year when
children are travelling on school trips and family holidays, and we
are reminding parents and young adults of the importance of
immunisation before they travel."

Some parents were reluctant to have their children inoculated with the
MMR vaccine following a now-discredited 1998 report by British doctor
Andrew Wakefield. He had raised concerns that the triple jab could
cause health problems, including autism. However, Dr Wakefield was
struck off for serious misconduct last year [2010] after serious flaws
were identified in the accuracy of his research, and the uptake of the
vaccine in the UK is now at almost 93 per cent.

The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said Saturday [6 Aug 2011] that it was
alarmed by a suspected measles outbreak in south-east Ethiopia's Dollo
Ado camps, where thousands of famine-hit Somalis have sought refuge in
recent weeks. "UNHCR fears the outbreak could lead to high mortality
and serious illness in an already vulnerable refugee population whose
overall health was already fragile," said the office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees in a statement. On 4 Aug 2011, health
workers reported 25 deaths in the Kobe camp, of which half were
suspected to have arisen from measles, said the UNHCR. Other cases
have also been reported in other camps in the surroundings.

Measles rarely kills healthy individuals but can be fatal to
malnourished people. "This situation is alarming, and we cannot afford
to wait," warned Moses Okello, UNHCR Ethiopia representative. "We must
act now, urgently and decisively, to arrest and turn around this
situation," he said, adding that a campaign to vaccinate children was
essential.

A team of experts are expected to arrive in Dollo Ado on Sunday [7 Aug
2011] to support a vaccination campaign which is to begin Tue 9 Aug
2011. The Dollo Ado camps host 118 400 Somali refugees, including 78
000 who arrived this year [2011] after fleeing violence and what the
UN has described as the region's worst drought in decades.

Health officials are stepping up efforts to curb an upsurge in measles
cases in Capiz. Provincial Health Information Officer Joeffry Espiritu
said that Dr. Renelyn Reyes, Expanded Program on Immunization
coordinator of the Department of Health in Western Visayas, was here
to take part in formulating measures to curb the increasing measles
cases in Capiz. Espiritu revealed that as of 29 Jul 2011, Capiz had 43
recorded measles cases. 41 of the patients were Capicenos, while the 2
others came from Aklan and Iloilo, but were confined in the hospitals
here.

He added that of the total cases, 22 are from Roxas City, followed by
Dao with 4 cases, 3 cases each in Pilar and Panay, 2 cases each in
Ivisan and Jamindan, and one case each in Dumalag, Mambusao, Panitan,
President Roxas and Sigma. The highest number of cases was registered
in June 2011, numbering 25, [followed by] May 2011 with 9 cases, and 3
cases each in January, February and April 2011, Espiritu said.

Among the measures to be undertaken are mapping activities for
children who missed the recently conducted measles immunization
campaign, Dr. Reyes said. He added that the mapping-out activity will
employ a house-to-house review to ensure that all those children are
immunized.

According to him, during the last week of August 2011, nurses who were
employed under the Registered Nurses for Health Enhancement And Local
Service (RN HEALS) program [in Roxas] city will conduct a rapid
coverage assessment to validate mapping out activities in every
barangay [district].

In April to May this year [2011], a nationwide anti-measles campaign
was initiated to free the country from measles cases.

Ontario's chief medical officer says recent cases of mumps and measles
should serve as reminders for everyone to get their vaccine shots.
Health officials say 2 people from Quebec were sick with infectious
measles recently while at Canada's Wonderland and a [Lake] Simcoe
resort. Meanwhile, Toronto Public Health says it's still investigating
a July 2011 outbreak of the mumps at Ki, an upscale sushi restaurant
in the city's financial district.

Symptoms of measles include rash, high fever and watery eyes. Those
infected with the mumps experience fever, headache and swelling of
glands in the mouth and neck, among other symptoms.

Dr. Arlene King says 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine
are enough to protect someone from both infectious viruses. Anyone who
wants to receive the free vaccine should see their doctor.

Secretary of Health of Guanajuato Jaime Ramirez Barba reported the 1st
case of measles in the state, a man of 45 years [in] the city of
Celaya who had caught [the infection] on a journey made to the United
States and Canada.

The Guanajuato [resident] acquired measles in transit through New
York, Boston and Canada, health officials said. The patient was
hospitalized [with measles] symptoms last Wednesday [3 Aug 2011] after
a private physician notified the Ministry of Health. The victim has
been released but remains under medical supervision. Ramirez Barba
said yesterday [Fri 5 Aug 2011] that the Federal Ministry of Health
had confirmed the diagnosis of measles virus infection. To prevent the
spread of the virus, he said vaccination had been intensified in
Celaya, where the victim resided.

This is the 3rd confirmed case of measles in Mexico. The other 2,
identified in the city of Mexico, were a one-year-old girl from France
and a young Mexican woman who had arrived from London. Three weeks
ago, the Ministry of Health reinforced vaccination of children under
12 years of age who had not been vaccinated and people under 39 years
[who had not been completely immunised]. For this purpose, 57 000
doses were distributed in the 8 jurisdictions of the state territory.

At Guanajuato International Airport, a team from the National
Epidemiological Surveillance System is on alert for possible cases and
will be reporting them immediately and establishing quarantine.
Ramirez Barba advised Guanajuato citizens traveling to the United
States, Canada and Europe to make sure that they have been adequately
vaccinated.

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service (RPHS) can confirm 94
cases of measles in the Auckland region as of this morning [1 Aug
2011]; 8 contacts are in quarantine; 5 cases have required
hospitalisation during this outbreak. Most cases have occurred in West
Auckland with some spread to Central Auckland, North Shore, and
Manukau.

Medical Officer of Health, Dr Richard Hoskins says: "Measles is a
serious and highly infectious disease that can make people very sick.
In addition to the 5 cases that needed hospital care, many more have
visited emergency departments and had short stays. Some people with
lower immunity, including children too young for immunisation and
people with cancer, have been treated in hospital after contact with
people with measles to help lower their risk of developing measles."

"The latest rise to 94 confirmed cases has included several cases
associated with the Ranui Baptist Church, where a number of
un-immunised people have developed measles. Almost all the cases in
this outbreak have been in un-immunised people; it's a testament to
the MMR vaccine protecting people who have received it."

"Immunisation is the only protection from this potentially serious
disease. By getting immunised, you will not only be protecting
yourself or your child, you'll be also be stopping this disease from
spreading in our communities. If you do come into contact with a
person infected with measles, if you have not been immunised or have
not had the disease, then you may be advised to be isolated; to stay
at home and away from all public places, school or work for 14 days
after coming into contact. If you suspect you or your child has
measles, call your doctor before visiting a waiting room, as measles
is highly infectious, and people with measles can infect others they
come in contact with."

Waikato health authorities have confirmed an extra 2 cases of measles
in the past 2 days. A 3-month-long outbreak of measles in Auckland is
thought to have spread to Waikato.

It had 10 confirmed cases on Monday [1 Aug 2011] and was analysing a
further 5 cases. Waikato Medical Officer of Health Anita Bell says
there are now 12 confirmed and a further 3 suspected cases. Dr Bell
says one of the confirmed cases is a secondary case, and Waikato
regional public health officials are expecting more such cases.

A secondary case occurs when a person who has not been immunised
catches measles from an earlier case before that person knew they had
the disease, she says.
