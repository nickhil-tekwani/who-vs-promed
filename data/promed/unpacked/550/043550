Cowlitz County and state officials are alerting residents and health
professionals about an increase in cases of a rare disease that is
sometimes tied to bioterrorism. There's no need to panic, and the number of
cases is still low, but officials want people to be aware and take simple
precautions such as not handling dead rodents or [other] animals and
reporting them to the health department.
Tularemia, also called "rabbit fever," is caused by naturally occurring
bacteria. The state averages between 2 and 4 cases a year. From 28 May to 2
Aug 2005, however, 7 cases have been reported in Western Washington --
including 2 in Cowlitz County.
"We rarely have any cases around here and then, boom, we had several," said
Hilary Gillette, Cowlitz County's epidemiologist. "And with other cases
reported, that got (state officials) interested." It's unclear whether
something happened to introduce the disease to the area or if it's always
been here and was just undetected, Gillette said. There is some evidence
the disease has been here for awhile. An unrelated statewide veterinary
study this winter found that 4.3 per cent of Cowlitz, Clark and Lewis
county pets showed exposure to the disease, compared to the state average
of 1.9 per cent. "So maybe it's always been here," Gillette said.
The 2 Cowlitz County cases were found in a man in his 50s and a young boy.
Officials believe the man was exposed while using a riding lawn mower. The
boy was bitten by an insect while on a trip to Canada, but officials don't
know if that caused his disease.
The man was hospitalized at Oregon Health Sciences University, another
patient in Clark County also was hospitalized, and had a serious
bloodstream infection. All 7 of the known Washington patients, 2 each in
Clark, Cowlitz and Thurston counties and 1 in King County, have recovered.
The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy lists tularemia along
with anthrax, botulism, plague, and smallpox as bioterrorism threats. In
1969, the World Health Organization estimated an aerosol dispersal of 110
pounds of virulent tularemia in a city of 5 million would cause 250 000
illnesses, including 19 000 deaths.

[The manifestations of _Francisella tularensis_ infection are not clearly
stated here. Many cases of tularemia involve lymph node infection with
(ulceroglandular) or without (glandular) a local skin infection draining to
the lymph node. Cases associated with lawn mowers, as has been described on
Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, are often pneumonic, related to
inhalation of bacilli. Unlike human plague infection, pneumonic tularemia
does not spread from person to person. Bloodstream infection (bacteremia)
can be associated with different forms of disease or may be the only
manifestation (typhoidal form). - Mod.LL]
