Malaysia: Dengue Fever Cases Continue to Rise
---------------------------------------------
There has been an increase in the number of cases involving dengue fever
(as well as HIV, cholera, and tuberculosis) in Malaysia despite various
measures taken to contain their spread. Diseases such as malaria,
dysentery, diphtheria, leprosy, gonococcal infections (all forms),
syphilis, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, viral encephalitis, viral
hepatitis and myocarditis have not shown any remarkable decline over the
years. According to the Health Ministry statistics for the period between
1997 and last year, the number of people dying from some of these diseases
was still high. [As regards dengue fever the number of cases of] dengue
fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever rose from 19 429 with 52 deaths in 1997
to 16 263 cases and 43 deaths last year. Between January and last month,
there were 17 341 cases of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever
reported nationwide with 34 deaths. Health department officials attributed
the increase in cases to a stretch of wet weather followed by a short dry
spell recently.

Hong Kong SAR: First Case of Locally-acquired Dengue Fever Reported
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong has reported its first locally-contracted case of dengue fever
after a construction worker became stricken with the mosquito-borne
disease. The man was hospitalised last week, Hong Kong's Department of
Health said, and is currently in a stable condition.
Inspectors have visited the construction site where the man worked in Ma
Wan island, after blood samples taken from two of the man's co-workers
showed they, too, had contracted the disease but had recovered. The site is
also to be fumigated and the rest of the man's co-workers to be put under
medical surveillance.
"The risk of contracting dengue fever can be effectively minimised should
anti-mosquito measures be strictly observed," Dr Tse Lai-yin from the
department of health told the Associated Press news agency.
Dengue fever, a viral disease transmitted to humans via mosquitoes,
inflicts various symptoms on the sufferer, including headaches, rashes,
cramps and severe back and muscle pains. It is particularly prevalent in
populated areas surrounded by standing water. The World Health Organisation
estimates that there are around 20 million cases of dengue fever each year
worldwide, with around 24 000 of those cases proving fatal.
Although 10 cases of the fever have been reported previously in the
territory, all the sufferers had contracted the disease while travelling
abroad. Various countries in Asia, including Bangladesh and Taiwan have
been battling to control outbreaks of the disease, which has also hit
countries in the Americas such as Venezuela and particularly Brazil.

Hong Kong SAR: Fears Rise Over Dengue Fever Outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
Locally acquired cases of dengue fever have been detected in Hong Kong for
the first time, with an outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease among
builders working on the Park Island development on Ma Wan Island.
Authorities face an uphill battle to eradicate mosquitoes carrying the
occasionally fatal disease before they become established in Ma Wan, or
spread further afield in Hong Kong.
A construction worker, 21, who is in a stable condition in Tuen Mun
Hospital, last week became the first person known to have contracted the
disease in Hong Kong. Preliminary test results indicate two of his
colleagues, aged 28 and 38, also probably came down with dengue fever this
month, but recovered without treatment. Final test results are expected in
a few days.
Dr Tse Lai-yin, of the Disease Prevention and Control Division of the
Department of Health, said the government was making an "all-out" effort to
prevent the spread of mosquitoes and to eradicate dengue fever. However,
she warned that she was not aware of any country which had succeeded in
stopping the disease. "Once infecting mosquitoes get a foothold in Hong
Kong it will be very difficult to eliminate them," she said. The department
was hopeful that the mosquitoes carrying the disease would be restricted to
Ma Wan, she said.
The developer of Park Island, Sun Hung Kai Properties, played down the
possibility that the dengue fever cases could diminish the value of units
in the complex, which has been heavily promoted as an outdoor family
paradise. Sun Hung Kai yesterday sprayed the site with insecticide. It also
said there was no proof the construction workers contracted the disease on
Ma Wan. The corporate effort came in addition to a mission by 60 public
servants on Friday to spray insecticide and destroy mosquito breeding
grounds on the island, but officials acknowledged it was impossible to wipe
out the entire mosquito population on Ma Wan. Mosquitoes can pass the
disease to their offspring, with one pair capable of multiplying to 1000
pairs over a three-week period.
Dr Tse was not critical of the delayed diagnosis of the 21-year-old man in
Tuen Mun Hospital, saying the disease was usually only suspected if a
patient had been abroad. Dr Tse said dengue fever was fatal in less than
one per cent of cases. Dengue fever occurs in many tropical and
sub-tropical countries, including parts of mainland China, but Dr Tse said
it was not practical to screen people entering Hong Kong for it.

Texas: Dengue Fever Could Cross the Rio Grande from Tamaulipas
--------------------------------------------------------------
BROWNSVILLE: As the Texas Department of Health confirms seven of 24
suspected cases of dengue fever in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, [Mexico]
officials in Brownsville fear the mosquito-borne illness could easily make
its way across the Rio Grande to the city. "The majority of the cases were
detected in low-lying colonias in the outskirts of the city because some of
those areas have poor drainage, which attracts mosquitoes," said Ernesto
Chanes, Matamoros' public health director. So far, the disease has not
crossed into Brownsville, where officials said it has been three years
since a dengue case was reported. That case resulted in the death of one man.
The confirmed cases in Matamoros are [the classic form of] dengue fever,
and no deaths have been reported, Chanes told The Brownsville Herald in its
Friday editions. Brownsville's Public Health Director Josuecq Ramirez said
mosquitoes carrying dengue could easily bring it across the border. "The
risk is there. There are no barriers. The mosquitoes can easily migrate to
this side of the Rio Grande," Ramirez said. "There's no wall or screen that
would stop them."
A binational spraying effort is ongoing in response to the West Nile virus
outbreak. Officials expect it to intensify as dengue concerns increase. [On
the Mexican side of the border] officials continue to spray about 200
colonias where the dengue cases were detected. Matamoros has more than 400
colonias. Matamoros health Department officials reported 6 confirmed
classic dengue cases of 34 suspected cases in the city last year.
