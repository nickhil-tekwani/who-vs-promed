Two horses in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, have tested positive for the vesicular stomatitis virus. One affected animal was moved to its owner's nearby property prior to the investigation; as a result 3 properties and all the animals residing on them are under quarantine.

The horses involved have no history of widespread travel, and other livestock located on the quarantined premises are showing no signs of disease. A USDA official launched the investigation before bringing the Arizona Department of Agriculture into the investigation. The investigation is ongoing to detect disease and prevent further spread.

"Vesicular stomatitis virus mainly affects equids and to a lesser extent cattle and swine," said Arizona state veterinarian Perry Durham, DVM. "It can be painful for animals and costly to deal with."

Other susceptible species include bison, sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids. The clinical signs of the disease include vesicles, erosions, and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats, and above the hooves of susceptible livestock. Vesicles are usually only seen early in the course of the disease. The transmission of vesicular stomatitis is not completely understood but components include insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and livestock movement.

Veterinarians and livestock owners who suspect an animal could have vesicular stomatitis or any other vesicular disease should immediately contact state or federal animal health authorities. Livestock with vesicular stomatitis are isolated until they have recovered and authorities determine the animals present no further threat for disease spread.

On 7 Jan 2015 the USDA had posted a notice (now updated; http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/downloads/animal_diseases/vsv/Sitrep_010715.pdf) that all vesicular stomatitis cases had been resolved. Now we have this latecomer to the disease. Or perhaps these few cases are simply an early start on the next round of the virus.

The transmission of vesicular stomatitis, and the relative importance of the different transmission routes for each virus, is incompletely understood.

Insect vectors seem to introduce vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) into populations of domesticated animals. Important biological vectors include sand flies (_Lutzomyia_ sp.) and blackflies (family Simuliidae). _Culicoides_ midges may also be biological vectors. Blackflies can transmit VSV-NJ (vesicular stomatitis virus, New Jersey serotype) to uninfected blackflies feeding at the same time on an uninfected host. Transovarial transmission has been demonstrated in sandflies and blackflies, and it may be possible in _Culicoides_. VSV has also been isolated from _Aedes_ mosquitoes, Chloropidae (eye gnats), and flies in the genus _Musca_ or family Anthomyiidae; these insects may act as mechanical vectors. In addition, grasshoppers (_Melanoplus sanguinipes_) can be infected experimentally, and cattle that ingest experimentally infected grasshoppers develop clinical signs. There is also some speculation that VSV could be a plant virus found in pastures, with animals at the end of an epidemiological chain.

Once it has been introduced into a herd, vesicular stomatitis can spread from animal to animal by direct contact. Broken skin or mucous membranes may facilitate entry of the virus. Infected animals shed VSV in vesicle material, saliva, and to a lesser extent, in nasal secretions. In experimentally infected horses, VSV has been found in the saliva of animals with or without oral lesions. Fecal shedding has been reported occasionally in experimentally infected swine, but it has not been seen in horses. VSV does not appear to be shed in milk. Animals can also be infected by exposure to contaminated fomites including food, water, and milking machines. VSV in saliva can survive for 3-4 days on fomites; however, this virus is inactivated by sunlight, and does not remain viable for long periods in the environment except in cool, dark places. Experimental infection of livestock by aerosols has been demonstrated, but this route did not result in skin lesions in most species. VSV does not appear to cross the placenta or cause fetal seroconversion.

The reservoir and amplifying hosts for VSV are unknown. Viremia sufficient to infect insect vectors has not been reported in any domesticated or wild animal; however, insects could become infected by feeding on lesion material or contaminated secretions. Overwintering has been reported in some but not all outbreaks in the US.

Humans may be infected by contact with the lesions or secretions from infected animals, particularly vesicular fluid and saliva. Aerosol transmission occurs in laboratories. In addition, some people are probably infected through insect bites.

Because of the insect involvement, it is likely that a frost will kill off some of the insect vectors and decrease the outbreaks of this virus.
