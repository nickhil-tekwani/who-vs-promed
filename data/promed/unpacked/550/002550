Agriculture Minister VS Sunilkumar will visit Nadapuram [Kozhikode district], where a large number of coconut trees have perished due to an unknown disease. Scientists from Kerala Agriculture University will accompany the Minister to find a scientific solution to the crisis.

Several farmers had sought reasonable compensation for the loss. The infestation is not confined to any particular plantation or area. It is visible even in small plots, doubling farmers' concerns.

Officials will discuss steps for resumption of coconut procurement with the Minister.

[A range of diseases of coconut palms have been reported in India, including a number of fungal rots and wilts. In addition, a phytoplasma disease of the lethal yellowing (LY) group, 'Kerala wilt' (or root wilt; spread by plant hoppers), has been spreading for many years in parts of Kerala and neighbouring Tamil Nadu (more information via ProMED-mail post 20150902.3614963 and links below).

It is stated above that the symptoms are widespread, apparently without discernable foci or direction of spread. This may be due to a rampant epidemic of a fast spreading infectious disease, but alternatively could also point towards insect pests or even environmental problems. In order for management strategies to be able to be designed for the area, it will be vital to determine the cause of the problems, in particular if it is infectious and which pathogen(s) may be involved.
