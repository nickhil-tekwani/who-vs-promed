Three people have been hospitalized in Chuka, Kenya, after eating tainted meat. The individuals are being treated for suspected anthrax and are in critical condition, according to a local news report. In addition, some 10 others were treated at other facilities and discharged. It is believed they ate anthrax-infected cow, and officials sent livestock officers to affected areas to investigate the situation.

[In the December [2018] report on Meru (ProMED-mail archive no. 20181214.6209483), we had Igembe deputy county commissioner (DCC) James Kosgei cautioning area residents against consuming uninspected meat during this festive season. Obviously, over the 2019 New Year's celebration, his advice was forgotten in the need to have some beef to bring in the New Year. It happens, and if nothing else, it reminds people of the wisdom of that official caution. And it tells us that risk of the disease is still active in that area in spite of any attempts at vaccination.

Chuka is a town on the eastern slopes of Mount Kenya, in Kenya about 65 km [40 mi] south of Meru Town (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuka,_Kenya). It is in central Kenya (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharaka-Nithi_County). - MOD.MHJ
