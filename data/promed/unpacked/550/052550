More than 43 cases of typhoid have been reported in the last one week
at General Hospital, Sector 6, forcing them to gear up to handle the situation.

These cases have been reported from urban as well as rural areas, and
the figures are on similar lines as the previous week's, when about
45 cases of typhoid had surfaced.

Diarrhea too is on the rise, as nearly 40 cases have been reported in
the past 3 days alone. Doctors blame it on rains and contamination of
water. As a combat measure, the hospital has decided to crackdown on
colonies, which they claim are the breeding grounds for these
diseases. Teams of health officials have been visiting various
colonies every fortnight to assess the situation. The main colonies,
including Rajiv, Indira and Azad Colony [slums in the city of
Panchkula], are the ones that the hospital is keeping a close watch
on [Unhygienic conditions in these slums were cited in a recent news
release <http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090725/cth1.htm#9>.].

[Typhoid fever is caused _Salmonella enterica_ subtype Typhi, and at
times by _Salmonella paratyphi_ A and B. Typhoid fever is transmitted
from a human intestinal carrier, usually by means of contaminated
food or water. For a discussion of typhoid fever, see ProMED-mail
postings Typhoid fever - USA: (TN) cluster 20090608.2120 and Typhoid
fever update 2009 (01) 20090710.2472.

Panchkula is a planned city in the northwestern Indian state of
Haryana, with an estimated population of in 2006 of 200 000
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchkula>). It is located adjacent to
Chandigarh, the capital city of both the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana.
