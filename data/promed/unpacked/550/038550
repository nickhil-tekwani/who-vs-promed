Acute illness in a German tourist on returning from South Africa,
update on laboratory findings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bernhard-Nocht-Institute (BNI), Hamburg, and the
Robert-Koch-Institute Berlin, Germany, recently released a
preliminary report on a German tourist with acute illness after
returning from South Africa (ProMED-mail Archive Number
20100505.1450, 5 May 2010).

An acute-phase blood sample tested positive for Rift Valley fever
(RVF) virus-specific IgM and IgG at BNI, and therefore it was
considered likely that the case-patient acquired infection with RVF
virus while travelling in South Africa. Additional laboratory
analyses, conducted both in Germany and in South Africa, however,
could not confirm this preliminary diagnosis.

Testing of a 2nd, convalescent serum sample at BNI did not reveal an
increase in anti-RVF virus antibody titres indicating that the
antibodies are not related to the illness following the travel to
South Africa. The serum samples, which were sent to and investigated
at the Special Pathogens Unit, National Institute for Communicable
Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service (SPU NICD-NHLS),
Sandringham, South Africa, tested negative for RVF virus-specific
antibodies in different tests, including ELISA and virus neutralizing assays.

While the reason for the discrepant findings remains unclear, in 3
laboratories, including BNI and SPU NICD-NHLS, seroconversion to
Rickettsia-specific IgM and IgG was detected, indicating recent
infection with _Rickettsia_ sp. We conclude from these new findings
that the acute illness in the case-patient after returning from South
Africa was caused by infection with _Rickettsia_ and not with RVF virus.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professors Stephan Gunther and Janusz Paweska for
providing this information concerning the revised diagnosis of the
acute illness suffered by a tourist recently returned to Germany from
a visit to South Africa.

This incident may provide some reassurance for visitors to South
Africa that the probability of contracting Rift Valley fever virus
during recreational travel in that country is low. Nonetheless
visitors should avoid contact with diseased livestock and protect
themselves from mosquito bites. Likewise diagnostic services in
Europe should remain vigilant. - Mod.CP]
