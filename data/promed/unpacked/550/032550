Highly pathogenic avian influenza, USA
--------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 26 Aug 2016 from Dr John Clifford, official delegate, chief trade advisor, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, USA

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 12 Aug 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 25 Aug 2016
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 24 Mar 2016
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Aug 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Mallard: _Anas platyrhynchos_ (_Anatidae_) / - / - / - / - / -
Affected population: wild mallard duck

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments
The sample, from a wild mallard duck, was collected during a live bird banding program at a wildlife refuge in Alaska. Genome sequencing results show that the Alaska isolate is an Eurasian/American (EA/AM) H5N2 HPAI strain. The partial genome fragments that have been analyzed thus far are over 99 per cent similar to the virus isolated from a northern pintail duck in Washington State in December 2014. The H5N2 outbreak viruses from 2015 were all over 99 per cent similar to the northern pintail index case (A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 H5N2). Efforts to obtain sequence data for the full genome are under way. This is the 1st detection of HPAI in a wild bird this year [2016]. This detection of HPAI (EA/AM) H5N2 virus in a wild bird is NOT associated with any commercial poultry in the United States.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Mallard / gene sequencing / 25 Aug 2016 / Positive
Mallard / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 25 Aug 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following information comes from "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and North American Wild Birds: Frequently Asked Questions," published by the USDA-APHIS at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/downloads/animal_diseases/ai/faqs.pdf:

What avian influenza surveillance has been done in wild birds?

In an effort to learn more about the impacts of HPAI on wild birds and the role wild birds may play in the spread of the virus, experts from the US Department of Agriculture, US Department of the Interior and state natural resources/conservation departments are gathering samples from live captured and hunter-harvested dabbling ducks, as well as from morbidity and mortality events of all wild bird species.

Between December 2014 and June 2015, HPAI was confirmed in wild birds in California, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

Also, there was evidence of HPAI H5 genetic material from a wild waterfowl sample collected in New Mexico.

Between July 2015 to March 2016, state and federal agencies tested more than 45 000 apparently healthy wild birds for avian influenza in targeted areas throughout the United States. Only 2 of these samples tested positive for the presence of HPAI genetic material, and neither of these was confirmed positive. Details regarding wild bird HPAI detections are available on the USDA website (December 2014-June 2015, see http://tinyurl.com/jbc2uva; July 2015-June 2016, see http://tinyurl.com/h5dxgow).

State and federal scientists continue to monitor for HPAI viruses through the Interagency National Avian Influenza Surveillance Program. Between July 2016 and June 2017, state and federal agencies will test more than 30 000 apparently healthy wild birds for avian influenza in targeted areas throughout the United States.

Wildlife managers should continue to be alert for morbidity and mortality in wild birds and immediately report observations to state or federal wildlife health professionals.

Wildlife management agencies that investigate morbidity and mortality events independently or in collaboration with other diagnostic laboratories are strongly encouraged to report these events to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center using this reporting form (http://tinyurl.com/jhx22r8) so that information can be captured on a national scale and displayed on WHISPers, https://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/whispers/, a wildlife health information sharing website, to increase situational awareness.

Continued surveillance for HPAI in wild birds will facilitate early detection, situational awareness, and appropriate response to these viruses.

Wild bird surveillance, in particular the investigation of wild bird mortality events, provides an important early detection mechanism that alerts agencies and producers to the presence of viruses of concern in the environment.

When initial detections in wild birds occur, federal agencies work with state natural resource/conservation departments to conduct enhanced morbidity/mortality and hunter-harvest surveillance in wild birds. - Mod.CRD
