Increase in Melioidosis cases in Pahang
----------------------------------------------
Cases of melioidosis are on the increase in Pahang with already 21 cases detected during the first 2 months of 2015, from 16 cases throughout 2014. Pahang Health director Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar said out of the 21 cases reported in 2015, 7 were detected in the Jerantut district, Bera (5), Maran (3), Temerloh (2) and 1 each in Kuantan, Lipis, Pekan, and Rompin.

"The increase in the number of cases could be due to the extraordinary floods which hit the state in December 2014 through January 2015," he said in a statement [in Kuantan] today, 9 Mar 2015. He said melioidosis is caused by bacteria known as _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, often found in the soil.

The disease can spread through direct contact with the contaminated soil and water, inhalation of the soil dust and drinking of the contaminated water, he added.

"Those with diabetes and a weak immune system have a high risk of getting the disease. The symptoms include fever, muscle pain, headache, infection of the lungs, and breathing difficulties," he added.

He advised the public to take the necessary precaution to avoid getting the disease, such as wearing water-proof gloves and shoes for those working in estates and plantations.

[Melioidosis mainly affects people who have direct contact with contaminated soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, or excess kava consumption. (Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.) HIV infection, however, does not appear to be a major risk factor for more severe disease. Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

In acute severe melioidosis, there is characteristically a rapid progression of respiratory failure that is due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or pneumonia. It has been suggested that the ARDS to melioidosis sepsis is more rapid in progression than with other bacteria and may be related to the intracellular interactions of the bacillus and the leukocyte. Bacteremia without shock/hypotension has a substantially better prognosis.
