The unexplained deaths of 4 moose in a Northeastern Minnesota study
this past year has biologists baffled. The biologists are consulting
with colleagues as far away as Sweden in an effort to understand the
deaths.
"I'm concerned and a bit disturbed by it," said Mike Schrage,
wildlife biologist with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior
Chippewa. Biologists caution that only one year of the planned 5-year
study has been completed, and that the study's sample size -- 24
moose -- is small.
Still, it is unusual to find that 5 of 17 cow moose in the study of
radio-collared animals died in the past year. That's a mortality rate
of almost 30 percent, explained Mark Lenarz, leader of the Forest
Wildlife Populations and Research Group for the Minnesota Department
of Natural Resources at Grand Rapids. The normal nonhunting moose
mortality is 8 to 12 percent, he said.
"It's definitely a surprise," Lenarz said. "I am concerned about it.
Assuming it's some sort of disease, there's nothing we can do about
it."
Last February, the Minnesota natural resources department and 3 other
agencies teamed up to capture 24 moose and place radio collars on
them. The moose were captured in a large area between Silver Bay and
Isabella. Biologists planned to track the moose for 5 years to
determine the herd's mortality level.
Researchers had planned to put collars on 60 moose, but they found it
difficult to net them from helicopters in the thick woods. Later this
month, crews will try to put collars on up to 42 more moose, Lenarz
said. This time, crews will shoot tranquilizer darts into the moose
from helicopters rather than trying to net them.
The $488 000 study is a cooperative project of the state of
Minnesota, the Fond du Lac Indian band, the 1854 Authority
(representing the Bois Forte and Grand Portage bands of Lake Superior
Chippewa Indians) and the U.S. Geological Survey.
In all, 6 of the original 24 moose died in the first year of the
experiment. One bull was killed by moose hunters. Another moose was
killed by wolves. And the other 4 simply laid down and died in the
woods between May and December.
"In each case (of last 4), when we got to the animal it was still
intact. All 4 of them had very low fat reserves and were very
emaciated," Lenarzsaid. Two of the animals also had significant hair
loss, he said, which may be the result of the moose rubbing against
trees to soothe the itch caused by winter ticks. But moose that die
of hair loss usually die during the winter rather than in milder
months, Lenarz said.
Among theories being checked as a possible cause of the deaths are a
virus of some kind, micro-nutrients, chronic wasting disease, and
West Nile virus, Lenarz said. He does not expect the cause to be
chronic wasting disease, which has never been found in wild animals
other than deer or elk.
In recent years, Sweden has lost about 1000 moose from a large
population estimated at 50 000 to 60 000. The cause of those deaths
has not been determined. One theory is a virus. Moose in some parts
of Sweden were found to have abnormal micro-nutrient levels, such as
low levels of copper and high levels of molybdenum, Lenarz said.
Some deer in northern Minnesota carry a parasite commonly called
brainworm, which doesn't affect deer but can kill moose. It isn't
known whether the 4 moose in the study suffered from brainworm,
Schrage said. It also isn't known whether moose can contract West
Nile virus.
Biologists are still in the early stages of having these 4 moose
tested. "We're trying to see what (samples) we need to collect and
see where we can have it analyzed," Lenarz said.
Biologists also are checking out 2 other moose, not part of the
study, that died of unknown causes, said Andy Edwards, a biologist
with the 1854 Authority in Duluth.
A 30 percent mortality rate among cows would be a problem in the
Northeastern Minnesota herd, Edwards said. "If mortality is that
high, we're going to have to take another look at how we're managing
the population," he said.
Biologists say these first-year results could be merely an anomaly.
"Is what we're seeing just an artifact of a small sample size? Is it
just something we see in the first year and it never crops up again?
We don't know if this is a serious problem yet," Schrage said.
Northeastern Minnesota's moose population is below DNR goals. It has
been steady at about 4000 to 5000 over the past several years, but it
was as high as 6000 from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. Wildlife
officials can't explain the apparent decline in moose numbers.
The annual hunt in the northeast zone will open 4 Oct 2003 and the
state will issue about the same number of permits as it did last
year, when 208 parties killed 141 moose.
"We've kept our hunting permits at a very conservative level," Lenarz said.
In addition to the state hunt last fall, tribal hunters took 78 moose
