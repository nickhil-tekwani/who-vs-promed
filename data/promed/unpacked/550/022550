COLUMBIANA, Ala. One person died and nearly 140 people have been treated at
hospitals in connection with a _Salmonella_ poisoning outbreak that began
over the weekend.
The source of the infection appears to be a barbecue restaurant that was
voluntarily closed Monday.
The one death was a woman who dies from multiple organ failure caused by
Addison's Disease, that was likely aggravated by the vomiting, diarrhea,
and stomach cramps from the [infection].

Alabama: One woman has died, and 150 people have become ill apparently due to
Salmonella in pork. The outbreak is reported to be one of the largest in
Alabama history according to officials of the Shelby County Health
Department. Preliminary investigations link the largest number of cases to
a local barbecue restaurant, although definitive test results are not
expected until early next week. To date 40-50 specimens of pork are
reported to have yielded positive test results for the presence of
_Salmonella_ bacteria. Officials suspect that the method of food
preparation was a factor in the outbreak.
