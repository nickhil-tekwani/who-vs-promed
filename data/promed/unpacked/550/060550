- Mon 22 Jun 2020. Equateur (Bikoro): new case
[7 sur 7; in French, machine trans., edited]
https://7sur7.cd/2020/06/23/equateurebola-un-nouveau-cas-confirme-bikoro

The health zone of Bikoro recorded this Mon 22 Jun 2020 a new confirmed case of the Ebola virus disease, precisely in Ikoko-Bonginde in the province of Equateur.

According to the national multisectoral committee for the response to the Ebola virus disease, which confirms this information, the cumulative number of cases of this epidemic in Equateur since its resurgence on 1 Jun 2020 increases to 24, of which 21 cases are confirmed and 3 likely. However, the number of deaths linked to Ebola is still 13, including 10 confirmed and 3 probable.

Only 1 case of recovery has so far been recorded. This is a nurse who received last Sunday [21 Jun 2020] from the hands of Governor Bobo Boloko his certificate of completion of medical care.

As a reminder, 5 health zones in the province of Equateur are already affected by this epidemic. These are: Bikoro health zone with 6 confirmed cases including 4 deaths; Bolamba with 4 confirmed cases including 1 death; Iboko with 3 confirmed cases; Mbandaka with 6 confirmed cases including 4 deaths and 3 probable cases; and Wangata 2 with confirmed cases including 1 death.

The good news there, I think, is that more recent cases have been outside Mbandaka, with is a large city (approximately 1M) on the Congo River. More remote cases makes for a difficult response but less risk of spread."]

[WHO/AFRO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, edited]
http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/7utbhbpzb6dq720bx6nkml

Situation update; data reported as of 21 Jun 2020
-------------------------------------------------
In Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, no new confirmed cases of EVD have been reported since 27 Apr 2020.

As part of ongoing epidemiological data confirmation exercise, 7 historic probable cases were validated by the Ministry of Health in the past week with onset dates reported between March 2019 and November 2019. 6 of these 7 probable cases were reported in North Kivu province across 3 different health zones; 3 in Kalunguta, 2 in Manguredijipa, and 1 in Mabalako. The 7th probable case was reported in Ituri province in the Mambasa health zone. The ages of these 7 probable cases ranged from 1.5 months-60 years.

From 14-21 Jun 2020, an average of 2871 alerts were reported and investigated each day. Of these, an average of 331 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. In the past week, a high level of reported alerts has been sustained throughout active sub-coordinations. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from 8 laboratories. From 15-21 Jun 2020, 3332 samples were tested, including 2665 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 323 swabs from community deaths; and 344 from retested patients. None of them tested positive. The number of samples tested by the laboratories increased by 4% compared to the previous week.

As of 21 Jun 2020, a total of 3470 EVD cases, including 3317 confirmed and 153 probable cases have been reported, of which 2287 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%), and 1171 have recovered. Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1970) were female, 29% (n=1002) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were healthcare workers.

Handover of the coordination of the response activities to the Provincial Health Division of North Kivu Province, which started on 1 Jun 2020, is ongoing.

Week 25: 15-21 Jun 2020; data reported as of 21 Jun 2020
Ebola virus disease Democratic Republic of the Congo (Equateur Province)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event description
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, continues to evolve. Since our last report (Weekly Bulletin 24 [8-14 Jun 2020]), 6 additional confirmed EVD cases and 2 new deaths have been reported. 2 of the new confirmed cases were in the Iboko Health Zone. As of 20 Jun 2020, a total of 23 EVD cases [as of 22 Jun 2020, 24 cases] (20 [now 21] confirmed and 3 probable) with 13 deaths (case fatality ratio 57%) have been reported in 5 health zones: Mbandaka (6 confirmed, 3 probable, 7 deaths), Bikoro (5 [now 6] confirmed, 3 deaths), Wangata (2 confirmed, 1 death), Bolomba (4 confirmed, 1 death) and Iboko (3 confirmed). The case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 57% (10 deaths/20 confirmed cases). 2 health workers are among the confirmed cases since the start of the outbreak, 8.7% of all cases.

Preliminary information on the 2 newly confirmed cases in Iboko Health Zone indicates that these people may have been in contact with the 1st confirmed case in this health zone, reported on 5 Jun 2020. However, only 1 case patient was listed as a contact. 22 (96%) confirmed and probable cases have been reported in the last 21 days, between 31 May 2020 and 20 Jun 2020. There are 5 out of 18 (28%) health zones and 11 out of 281 (3.9%) health areas affected since the start of this 11th EVD outbreak. A total of 51 new contacts were recorded as of 20 Jun 2020, with 11 in Bikoro, 33 in Bolomba, and 7 in Iboko. There are 1751 contacts under follow-up, of which 1464 (84%) have been seen in the past 24 hours. On 20 Jun 2020, 119 alerts, including 72 new, with 6 deaths were reported. Of these, 86 (72%) were investigated and 23 (27%) were validated as new suspected cases

Situation interpretation
This new outbreak of EVD continues to evolve, with new confirmed cases and deaths and unfortunate incidences of suspected cases absconding into the community. However, all pillars of response are active in the affected areas and contacts are being followed up where possible. Community engagement is underway and there are few incidences of resistance to the response. Public health measures, particularly a strong and robust surveillance system, required to detect, isolate and treat new suspected cases as early as possible is required to break any new chains of transmission, along with full community engagement with response measures. Response to COVID-19 should complement and not detract from EVD response activities.

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
------------------------------------------------------
[This report does not cover the new outbreak in Equateur Province. - Mod.LK]

No new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 27 Apr 2020 (Figure 1). While this is a positive development, there remains a risk of re-emergence of EVD. It is critical to maintain surveillance and response operations in the period leading up to the declaration of the end of the outbreak, as well as after the declaration -- as outlined in the WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-recommended-criteria-for-declaring-the-end-of-the-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak.

From 11 to 16 Jun 2020, an average of 2939 alerts were reported per day, of which 2788 (about 95%) were investigated within 24 hours. Of these, an average of 453 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule-out EVD. The number of reported and validated alerts has remained stable in recent weeks. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from eight laboratories. From 8 to 14 Jun 2020, 3219 samples were tested including 2513 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 324 swabs from community deaths; and 382 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, the number of samples tested by the laboratories increased by 3% compared to the previous week.

As of 16 Jun 2020, a total of 3463 EVD cases, including 3317 confirmed and 146 probable cases have been reported, of which 2280 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%), and 1171 have recovered. Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1970) were female, 29% (n=1002) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were healthcare workers.

For information about the EVD outbreak in Equateur Province see the WHO Regional Office for Africa Weekly bulletins on outbreaks and other emergencies (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/332416/OEW24-0814062020.pdf).

The Airbus Foundation together with the French Red Cross (FRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have flown a medical team and 14 tons of humanitarian aid to the Republic of the Congo, using an Airbus A330neo test aircraft.
The cargo will help in the fight against both the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ebola crisis in the Republic of the Congo and the DRC.

The A330neo departed from Vatry, France, on 19 Jun 2020 and landed at Brazzaville airport, Republic of the Congo, the same day with personnel from the IFRC and FRC on board to support logistics on arrival. Also on board was personal protective equipment needed to create an administrative base for a treatment zone for FRC.

- Sat 20 Jun 2020. Traditional healers
[WHO/AFRO, edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/how-traditional-healers-became-allies-ebola-response

How traditional healers became allies in Ebola response
-------------------------------------------------------
At the entrance to the Centre de medecine tradi-moderne du village [village traditional-modern medicine centre], a health centre offering conventional and herbal treatments, in Beni town [North Kivu], a painted mural shows a man and a woman washing their hands. "Plants are life, handwashing saves lives" a caption reads. In a smoke-filled room inside, a woman cooks green fruits on a charcoal stove and crushes them into a black powder to treat hernia. In the 3-bed clinic next door, patients can choose to be treated with plant remedies or with modern medicine by nurses who are trained in both.

When Ebola erupted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) northeastern Ituri and North Kivu provinces, traditional practitioners in small clinics such as this were the 1st port of call for many who fell ill in rural communities. While it was the DRC's 10th outbreak of the disease, it had never been seen in this part of the country before. Most traditional healers did not triage patients or have basic protection for themselves or their patients. Infection prevention and control was next to nothing. The virus was passed from patient to healer and on to the next patient, with disastrous effects on the mortality rate.

"When a sick person came, we just treated them straight away," says Oscar Ngabia, the secretary of the traditional healer's association in Beni. "When Ebola came here, we didn't believe in it, that's why we continued to treat people as we had done before." He says people here had heard of Ebola but associated it with the dramatic late-stage symptoms, rather than the 1st signs, which can easily be confused with other illnesses. When people came for treatment and died very suddenly, they assumed it was witchcraft.

To break the chain of transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Ministry of Health and other partners worked with traditional healers, providing them with kits to protect themselves. They were also trained and received support in infection prevention and control. But it took some persuasion for the measures to be adopted.

"People learn through experience unfortunately," says Abdoulaye Ouedraogo, WHO Infection Prevention and Control Team Lead in Beni. "We started training and told them: 'any sick person who comes to you, be careful, do not touch them with your bare hands, you must wear gloves. At first, they thought it was nonsense. But when they began to get Ebola, and sadly some of them died, then they began to realize that what we were telling them could be true. Little by little, we got them to understand that when you're treating someone, it's not just so that you can exchange your life for theirs."

The 1st steps were to practice triage, so that any suspect patients could be sent to an Ebola transit centre, and to use protection for themselves and for their other patients. The association of traditional practitioners also attended meetings of local health officials, where they reported deaths or other concerns from their members' clinics to the authorities, and relayed important developments back to their members. Anything used to treat suspect Ebola patients needed to be safely disposed of and replaced. This new way to treat patients has now been integrated into traditional practices, its effectiveness proven through the toughest of challenges.

"Infection prevention and control categorically changed the way traditional practitioners care for patients," says Mr Ngabia. "It's the only way to protect ourselves from illness: protective equipment like gloves, boots, soap, protective clothing. It saved a lot of lives."

This new way to treat patients has now been integrated into traditional practices, its effectiveness proven through the toughest of challenges.

Summary
-------
The PALM trial [Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (Swahili for "Together save lives"; PALM) study] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified a statistically significant survival benefit for 2 monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics in the treatment of acute Ebola virus disease; however, substantial gaps remain in improving the outcomes of acute Ebola virus disease and for the survivors. Ongoing efforts are needed to develop more effective strategies, particularly for individuals with severe disease, for prevention and treatment of viral persistence in immune-privileged sites, for optimisation of post-exposure prophylaxis, and to increase therapeutic breadth. As antibody-based approaches are identified and advanced, promising small-molecule antivirals currently in clinical stage development should continue to be evaluated for filovirus diseases, with consideration of their added value in combination approaches with bundled supportive care, their penetration in tissues of interest, the absence of interaction with glycoprotein-based vaccines, and filoviral breadth.

Key messages
------------
- The PALM randomised controlled trial in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the first to identify 2 effective antibody-based therapeutics for Ebola virus disease, but substantial room to improve outcomes remains.
- Combinations of therapeutics, including mechanistically independent antivirals bundled with a high level of supportive care, might improve outcomes in severely ill patients at highest risk of dying.
- Therapeutic penetration into immune-privileged sites might mitigate public health risk and improve clinical sequelae associated with viral persistence in Ebola virus disease survivors.
- Consideration of post-exposure prophylaxis requires understanding of the potential interactions between glycoprotein-based vaccines and therapeutic strategies.
- Anticipation of future filovirus disease outbreaks requires consideration of therapeutic breadth.

- Tue 23 Jun 2020. Local testing benefits
[WHO/AFRO, abridged, edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/how-local-testing-sped-response-new-ebola-outbreak

How local testing sped up response to new Ebola outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------
When a young man in his town died of a haemorrhagic fever, Fabien Impanda Boliko had to act fast. The 56-year-old laboratory technician in Mbandaka tested and identified the 1st case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) 11th Ebola outbreak in the western Equateur province.

The sudden death caused concern among local health officials who raised an alert: perhaps the haemorrhagic fever was Ebola or, maybe it was caused by another disease. Boliko accompanied a rapid response team to obtain a sample and find out.

"I could feel the pressure. As soon as I got back to the laboratory in Mbandaka, I started to do some tests," said Boliko. "The results came back positive [for Ebola]." On 1 Jun 2020, just one day later, the DRC government officially declared a new outbreak and response efforts began.

Boliko credits his swift actions to a training he and 25 other laboratory technicians received in 2018 following an outbreak of Ebola there, DRC's 9th. They were trained by World Health Organization (WHO) on sample collection and testing possible Ebola cases. They learned how to use a GeneXpert machine, which can provide test results in just under 2 hours.

"The training strengthened our ability to use the GeneXpert machine and test. Otherwise, if we didn't know how to test here in Mbandaka or didn't have the technology, the city could have experienced several weeks of uncertainty," Boliko explained.

The DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB), based in the capital of Kinshasa, is responsible for verifying the results of such tests. But, as Boliko pointed out, it can take time for a sample to reach the INRB's more-equipped laboratories.

"Equateur Province is able to use local resources to collect, handle, and test samples in strict compliance with biosafety rules. This is ideal," said INRB medical biologist and laboratory expert, Dr Meris Matondo. Being able to provide accurate preliminary results at the provincial level means that local health authorities can take immediate preventive precautions even before there is a national, official declaration of a new public health emergency.

Boliko's quick identification of the disease translated into a swift response. Just 4 days after the outbreak was declared, the Ministry of Health and WHO began vaccination to stem the spread of Ebola. As of 22 Jun 2020, more than 4700 people had been vaccinated. Screening for travellers at designated points of control had also been ramped up.

"DRC has often been confronted with Ebola outbreaks. I know that this one in June 2020 won't be our last," Boliko said. An outbreak of Ebola between May and July 2018 in the same province was the 3rd in the Grand Equateur region (Yambuku in 1976, Tandala in 1977, and Djera in 2014]. The 2018 outbreak claimed 33 lives, but 21 patients survived.

In the current outbreak, 5 health zones in Equateur province have so far been affected (Bolomba, Bikoro, Iboko, Mbandaka, and Wangata). To Boliko, beating Ebola is a matter of preparedness. He feels that he and his colleagues are already more prepared than they were during the last outbreak. This time around, all the laboratory technicians trained in 2018 are working to test samples of possible case-patients.

There are also 3 GeneXpert machines -- 2 in Mbandaka and one in Bikoro health zone -- available locally to provide rapid test results.

Improving the capacity of health workers in Mbandaka during the 2018 outbreak is paying off, says Dr Amedee Prosper Djiguimde, WHO Officer in Charge in the DRC. "This response is being handled differently and much more at the local level because the expertise already exists. WHO is here only to advise and fill critical gaps where needed."

WHO has deployed experts to Mbandaka, Bolomba, Bikoro, and Iboko. Additional teams have been sent to other rural communities that are reporting cases. Most of the experts are coming from North Kivu where an ongoing Ebola outbreak is winding down. The team includes experts in epidemiology, vaccination, community engagement, infection prevention and control, laboratory, case management, logistics, and data management.

The Organization has also shipped supplies including vaccines, testing kits, and personal protective equipment. Over 114 000 travellers have so far been screened at strategic points of control to help detect and stem further spread of the virus.
