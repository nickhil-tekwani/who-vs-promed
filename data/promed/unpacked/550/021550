Deadly Seal Virus Returns to Europe
-----------------------------------
STOCKHOLM: More than 600 dead seals have washed up on beaches in Denmark,
Sweden and the Netherlands in a new outbreak of a virus that ravaged
populations in 1988.
The distemper virus, which does not affect humans, has been confirmed in
harbor seal carcasses tested in Denmark and neighboring Sweden. So far,
Denmark has reported 461 dead animals and Sweden 150. Health officials on
Thu 20 Jun 2002 also confirmed a case in the Netherlands.
In 1988, the virus killed seals in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the
Netherlands, Germany and Britain -- threatening the entire population in
the North Sea. Scientists cannot explain what caused that outbreak, which
Swedish scientists said killed 18 000 seals. There now are about 15 000
seals in Kattegat, the strait separating Denmark and Sweden. Another 5000
live in Dutch waters.
Experts say it is too early to tell the scope of the current outbreak,
which first was detected in May [2002] in Denmark. "The number is not as
high (as in 1988), but we don't know where we are in the course of the
epidemic," said Hans Henrik Dietz, a senior researcher at the Danish
Veterinary Institute. "We look at the situation very seriously."
Researchers do not know what triggered the latest outbreak or why it took
14 years for the virus to reappear. The virus has spread quickly from
Denmark up the Swedish west coast.
Scientists also said they are puzzled by the relatively low number of
deaths in the latest outbreak. It is possible the current seal population
has a stronger immunity to the virus than the population in the 1980s,
Dietz said. "That's Darwin for you -- survival of the fittest," he said.
The virus, which can be spread in shallow water, usually causes severely
matted eyes, runny noses and pneumonia, spreading from animal to animal
through direct contact with body fluids or by scratching, clawing or biting.
The 1988 epidemic triggered loud protests from environmental groups, who
said pollution of the North Sea was to blame. Public outrage in Sweden
fueled support for the Green Party, which entered parliament for the first
time that year. This year, also an election year in Sweden, some
environmentalists are more hesitant to make the same connection. Greenpeace
spokesman Frode Pleym said the group will wait for scientific evidence of
possible causes before taking a stance. The Swedish Green Party also has
been less vocal about the seal deaths this time because it takes for
granted that people see a connection between environmental pollution and
immune deficiencies in animals, party spokeswoman Gudrun Lindvall said.
"Back then it was news that the sea was sick. Today it's not news anymore,"
she said.

Seals virus reaches the Waddenzee
-----------------------------------
The Hague: The first seal with the so-called phocine distemper virus or
"Seal disease" has been found in Vlieland. This virus is very infectious
for seals, but is not dangerous for humans; this has been announced by The
Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries on Wed 19 Jun 2002.
The seal was found on Sun 16 Jun 2002 by a collaborator of the Seal
Rehabilitation and Research Center, Pieterburen, and brought over to the
Center. Following a virological investigation it was shown on Wednesday
that the virus is the same one which has been causing,since May
2002,harbor-seal mortality in Danish and Swedish waters.
Since seals can swim 150 km a day, it was expected that the virus would
emerge in the Waddenzee. The same virus caused in 1988 major mortality in
European seals.
The seal from Vlieland has died in the meantime.

[Vlieland is one of the five inhabited Dutch "Frisian" isles separated from
the mainland by the Dutch Wadden Sea (Waddenzee). During the previous major
outbreak in 1988 and thereafter, the Center in Pieterburen was one of the
institutes actively involved in the research, cooperating with other North
European centres.
An examination of the long-term dynamic consequences of the 1988 epizootic
of phocine distemper virus (PDV) infection in Northern European common seal
populations, carried out by the Department of Zoology, Cambridge
University, UK [See "Quantitative investigations of the epidemiology of
phocine distemper virus (PDV) in European common seal populations" by
B.T.Grenfell, M.E. Lonergan and J.Harwood in Sci Total Environ 1992 Apr
20;115(1-2):15-29], led to the conclusion that a reintroduction of the
virus would be unlikely to cause an outbreak on the scale of the 1988
epizootic until the seal population had recovered for at least 10 years. -
