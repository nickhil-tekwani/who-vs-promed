A case of the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus involving a 7-year-old boy was reported in Sarawak, said Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam.

He said the child from Taman Sentoria, Jalan Stakan in Kota Samarahan was hospitalized at Sarawak General Hospital on 25 May [2017].

"We (ministry) received the report regarding the case yesterday [Thu 6 Jul 2017] from the Sarawak Health Department (SHD) and we will continue to monitor it. "

"We will inform if there is a new case. It is only an isolated case which may be related to the lifestyle of the community in the area," he told reporters after officiating the 11th International Symposium on Paediatric Pain.

He said the child suffered the symptoms of fever, headache and behavioural change before he was confirmed with JE positive through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood tests.

Subramaniam said the SHD will continue its control and prevention actions through fogging and larviciding activity to kill mosquito larvae in the area. In addition, JE vaccine would be given to children below 15-years-old.

The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Culex_ mosquitoes from infected pigs [and birds] but the transmission did not occur from humans to other humans.

[This is the 1st report of Japanese encephalitis that ProMED has ever posted for Sarawak. However, cases of Japanese encephalitis occur sporadically in Malaysia. South East Asia, including Malaysia, is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). There were reports that a total of 16 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases occurred nationwide since the start of 2014, including 4 deaths, according to the Malaysia Health Ministry. There was a significant outbreak of JEV infections in 1998-1999. The current case is well within the endemic area.

In JE virus-endemic areas, birds, especially ardeids (herons and relatives), are reservoir hosts of the virus, which is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_. Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts.

Sarawak is one of 2 Malaysian states on the island of Borneo. Located in northwest Borneo, Sarawak is bordered by the Malaysian state of Sabah to the northeast, Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of Borneo, to the south, and the independent country of Brunei in the north.
