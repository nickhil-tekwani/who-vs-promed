An online UK study finds that about 70% of 181 adult COVID survivors had memory and concentration problems several months after infection, 75% reported persistent symptoms so severe that they couldn't work, and 50% said that medical professionals didn't take their symptoms seriously.

In the ongoing COVID and Cognition study, published as 2 papers today [17 Mar 2022] in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, a team led by University of Cambridge researchers report on the baseline characteristics and cognitive test performance of 181 long COVID patients and 185 never-infected peers.

Participants were recruited from the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, although 70% were White UK patients. Most COVID-19 survivors were infected 6 or more months before, and only a few had been ill enough to be hospitalized. Data collection on patients infected from March 2020 to February 2021 (when the delta and omicron variants were uncommon in the study countries) took place from October 2020 to March 2021.

Long COVID can be debilitating, affecting multiple organ systems, including the brain, and causing highly individual symptoms in the months after infection. Neurologic symptoms may include "brain fog," disorientation, headache, and forgetfulness.

In the 1st paper, the team found that the severity of acute illness was a significant predictor of the presence and severity of long COVID symptoms (https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2022.804922). Six initial symptoms were associated with progression to long COVID, including limb weakness, brain fog, chest pain or tightness, dizziness, cough, and breathing problems. Those with more severe fatigue and neurologic symptoms such as dizziness and headache during infection were more likely than others to have severe lingering symptoms.

Among the 126 participants with long COVID, 77.8% reported problems with concentration, while 69% reported brain fog, 67.5% cited forgetfulness, 59.5% reported tip-of-the-tongue word-finding problems, and 43.7% said they struggled with saying or typing the correct word.

Participants who had been ill for longer were more likely to report having had cognitive symptoms throughout the ongoing illness and to still have them.

Among those with ongoing symptoms, upwards of 54.6% had experienced long periods in which they were unable to work, while 34.5% had lost their job due to illness, 63.9% reported difficulty coping with day-to-day activities, 49.6% had had difficulty getting medical professionals to take their symptoms seriously, 43.7% felt that they had experienced a trauma, and 17.6% had experienced financial problems owing to their illness.

Among the 109 participants who sought medical care, the most common diagnoses were hypoxia (low oxygen levels, 14.7%), blood clots (5.5%), and inflammation (4.6%). Number of weeks since infection was positive correlated with severity of ongoing cardiopulmonary symptoms and fatigue.

While the exact pathways haven't been elucidated, the study authors said that a dysfunctional or outsized immune response may lead to chronic inflammation and long COVID. "There are a number of mechanisms by which COVID-19 infection may lead to neurological symptoms and structural and functional changes in the brain, and it is reasonable to expect that many of these may translate into cognitive problems," the researchers wrote. "Indeed, cognitive problems are one of the most commonly reported symptoms in those experiencing 'long COVID' -- the chronic illness following COVID-19 infection that affects between 10 and 25% of patients."

In the 2nd paper, the researchers evaluated participants' performance on multiple tasks related to areas such as memory, language, and executive function (https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2022.804937). They identified a significant negative influence of COVID-19 infection on memory, even after adjusting for age, sex, country, and education level, with poorer performance and slower reaction time on the Word List Recognition Memory Test than the non-COVID group. A much weaker pattern was seen with the Pictorial Associative Memory Test, which suggested poor performance among COVID group members but no difference in reaction time.

Pairwise analyses showed that participants with severe ongoing symptoms scored significantly lower on the percentage of correct answers and reaction time. Pairwise tests also revealed that those with severe ongoing symptoms had fewer correct words on the category fluency test than recovered participants, but no pairwise comparisons were significant for word repetitions. There was no difference on executive function testing.

"Given these findings, we suggest that, as others have found...'objective' cognitive differences do exist between those that have and have not experienced the COVID-19 infection," the authors wrote. They added that accumulating evidence, including previous findings of a loss of gray matter in the temporal lobe of the brain and reduced memory performance in this study, suggests that COVID-19 survivors may be at increased risk for future neurodegeneration and dementia.

"It is thus notable that, in this study, self-reported memory issues were associated with measurable reductions in memory ability and that these are linked with other neurological symptoms," the researchers wrote. "This suggests that neurological and neuropsychological assessment should be made more widely available to patients with long COVID reporting cognitive deficits."

The researchers said that the results indicate that long COVID cognitive symptoms need to be taken seriously. "This is important evidence that when people say they're having cognitive difficulties post-COVID, these are not necessarily the result of anxiety or depression," study coauthor Muzaffer Kaser, MD, PhD, said in a University of Cambridge news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/946155). "The effects are measurable -- something concerning is happening."

Senior author Lucy Cheke, PhD, said that long COVID has garnered little political or medical attention, which belies its potential long-term impact on the workforce. "When politicians talk about 'living with COVID' -- that is, unmitigated infection, this is something they ignore," she said. "The impact on the working population could be huge."

[B] Emergency visits

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/emergency-visits-mental-health-followed-covid-surges


A study of mental health (MH)-related emergency department (ED) visits during the pandemic found fluctuating patterns of visits relative to COVID-19 case surges, with increases after surges and variations both within and across racial and ethnic groups, researchers reported yesterday [16 Mar 2022] in JAMA Psychiatry (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790337).

Using data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program from January 2019 to 14 Aug 2021, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compared MH-related ED visits for 10 mental health disorders the following ways:

- During a period of high delta variant circulation (18 Jul to 14 Aug 2021) with the pre-delta period (18 Apr to 15 May 2021)
- After a COVID-19 case peak (14 Feb to 13 Mar 2021) with during a COVID-19 case peak (27 Dec 2020 to 23 Jan 2021)
- During the delta period and the period after a COVID-19 case peak with the respective corresponding weeks during the prepandemic period

The MH disorders included anxiety, depressive, bipolar, schizophrenia spectrum, trauma- and stressor-related, obsessive-compulsive, eating, and tic disorders.

The study included more than 107 million ED visits among adults aged 18-64 years; 55% were among adults aged 25-49 years, 30% were 50-64-year-olds, and 15% were 18-24. After a decline in MH-related ED visits in March 2020, visit counts for most disorders rose in the spring, peaked from summer to mid-fall, then declined in late fall 2020.

All MH-related ED visit counts (-3.3%), as well as counts for most specific disorders, stabilized in all ages between the delta and pre-delta periods (percentage change, -1.4% to -7.5%), except for eating disorders (-11.9%) and tic disorders (-19.8%) and after a COVID-19 case peak compared with during a peak (0.6% to 7.4%). Most MH-related ED visit counts declined in the delta period relative to the prepandemic period (-6.4% to -30.7%), and visits fluctuated by disorder when comparing after a COVID-19 case peak with the corresponding prepandemic period (-15.4% to 11.3%).

Accounting for ED visit volume, MH-related ED visits were a smaller proportion of visits in the delta period compared with the pre-delta period (visit ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 0.86) and prepandemic period (0.80; 95% CI, 0.79-0.80). After a COVID-19 case peak, MH-related ED visits were a larger proportion of ED visits compared with during a peak (1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04) and the corresponding prepandemic period (1.11; 95% CI, 1.11-1.12).

In the race and ethnicity analysis, which included more than 2.5 million ED visits, the CDC researchers found that MH-related ED visits varied by race and ethnicity and by pandemic period examined. For example, Asian adults had moderate to high increases in ED visit counts for anxiety disorders (18.3%), depressive disorders (20.5%), schizophrenia spectrum disorders (18.2%), and trauma- and stressor-related disorders (11.8%). Increases in selected disorders after COVID-19 peaks were also observed in adults aged 18-24 years.

The study authors say that, given the effect that poor MH can have on lifelong health, it's critical for patients to have access to flexible MH services that are tailored to individual needs and account for differences in service availability.

"Results of this cross-sectional study suggest that EDs may have increases in MH-related visits after COVID-19 surges, specifically for young adults and individual racial and ethnic minoritized subpopulations," they wrote. "Public health practitioners should consider subpopulation-specific messaging and programmatic strategies that address differences in MH needs, particularly for those historically marginalized."

[Improving mental health care key to COVID-19 pandemic recovery: "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp increase in mental ill-health issues, especially among the young, unemployed and those facing financial insecurity. Countries should provide adequate support to those affected, while urgently scaling up investment and quality of care to reduce the high social and economic costs of mental ill-health, according to a new OECD [Office of Economic Cooperation and Development] report" (https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/improving-mental-health-care-key-to-covid-19-pandemic-recovery.htm).

However, it is much more than an economic issue. People suffer first through the illness, then continue to suffer months later. It is important that society and doctors recognize these post-COVID sequelae as a real problem. - Mod.LK]

South Korea today [17 Mar 2022] reported a massive jump in COVID-19 cases, which topped 600 000, as omicron surges continue in a handful of Asian hotspots. South Korea today reported its highest single-day total, which at 621 328 was up sharply from 400 714 the previous day [16 Mar 2022]. Officials also reported a daily high for deaths, with 429 more fatalities.

Lee Sang-won, with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, said daily cases are tracking far higher than officials expected, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-reports-record-new-daily-covid-cases-deaths-kdca-2022-03-17/). The country is known for its strong public health response, especially contact tracing and testing. Though testing is still widespread, contact tracing and some other measures have been scaled back. Officials will consider scaling back measures tomorrow [18 Mar 2022]. Officials also said high vaccine uptake, with 63% of people boosted, has limited deaths.

In Hong Kong, the pace of new infections and deaths continued at a very high level, with 21 650 new cases and 202 more deaths. The country is experiencing one of the world's highest death rates, partly linked to vaccine gaps in vulnerable older groups.

Officials today [17 Mar 2022] announced plans to scale up mortuary capacity and speed the processing of bodies. Currently, 1500 bodies are stored in an expanded facility with room for 2300 bodies.

Elsewhere, China -- experiencing its biggest spike in 2 years -- reported 2462 new cases, which include 1206 people with asymptomatic infections. Almost half of the new cases are from hard-hit Jilin province, especially Jilin City. The whole province is currently on lockdown, and health officials have been conducting rounds of mass testing.

In other global developments:

- Africa's vaccine uptake increased 15% in January and February [2022], as immunization programs ramped up in some larger countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said yesterday [16 Mar 2022]. Currently, about 15% of the region's adult population is fully vaccinated, well behind other parts of the world, and officials said vaccination needs to increase 9-fold to reach the target of vaccinating 70% of the population by June [2022].

- Italy today [17 Mar 2022] announced phased plans to wind down most of its restrictions, including phasing out vaccine passes on 1 May 2022, ending a color-coded regional risk system, requiring workers over 50 to be vaccinated, and indoor masking.

- The United Nations-based Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) today [17 Mar 2022] announced that it has signed agreements with 35 manufacturers to make a generic version of Pfizer's oral COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, which is given with a low dose of ritonavir, to help supply 95 low- and middle-income countries. The sublicenses follow a voluntary deal between MPP and Pfizer that was signed in November [2021].

President Biden today [17 Mar 2022] named Ashish Jha, MD, MPH, the new White House COVID-19 coordinator, replacing Jeff Zients. In a statement, Biden credited Zients with managing the rollout of vaccines and boosters and putting the infrastructure in place to deliver not only vaccine but also tests, treatments, and masks. "The progress that he and his team have made is stunning and even more important, consequential. Lives have been saved," Biden said.

Jha is dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. Biden said Jha is well known among Americans for his wise and calming public presence and is perfect for the job, as the nation enters the next phases of the pandemic, Biden said.

["Ashish will bring...an unrivaled commitment to improving public health equitably, effectively, creatively, with heart and a commitment to science," Brown University President Christina H. Paxson said in a statement (https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/17/biden-ashish-jha-covid19-czar-00018086). - Mod.LK]

In other federal developments, the Biden Administration unveiled new standards for ventilation of schools and businesses. The guidance from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the first to address air filtration in these settings, is part the nation's new COVID-19 plan.

In releasing the new guidance today [17 Mar 2022], the EPA issued a "Clean Air in Buildings Challenge," which focuses on creating a clean indoor air action plan, optimizing fresh-air ventilation, enhancing air filtration and cleaning, and conducting community engagement.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-scan-mar-17-2022


Four-dose efficacy of mRNA vaccines against symptomatic omicron COVID-19 infection is modest, according to a research letter yesterday [16 Mar 2022] in the New England Journal of Medicine that described a small study in Israel (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202542).

Of 1050 eligible Israeli healthcare workers, 154 received a 4th dose of Pfizer and 120 received a 4th dose of Moderna. The researchers selected 2 age-matched controls from the remaining eligible participants for each person vaccinated.

The 4th dose produced a robust immune response and caused no concerning adverse events. Overall, 25.0% of the volunteers in the control group were infected with omicron, compared with 18.3% in the Pfizer group and 20.7% in the Moderna group.

The researchers reported vaccine efficacy of 30% for Pfizer and 11% for Moderna for any SAR-CoV-2 infection, but neither vaccine achieved statistical significance for this measure. Vaccine protection against symptomatic COVID-19 was 43% for Pfizer and 31% for Moderna. Omicron accounted for 100% of circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Israel at the time of the study.

The authors note, "Our cohort was too small to allow for accurate determination of vaccine efficacy. However, within the wide confidence intervals of our estimates, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was 65% at most."

They conclude, "A 4th vaccination of healthy young healthcare workers may have only marginal benefits. Older and vulnerable populations were not assessed." Also, they did not assess a 4th dose against severe COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from mother to baby before, during, and after childbirth about 1.8% of the time, and vaginal births and breastfeeding do not raise the risk, finds a meta-analysis today [17 Mar 2022] in BMJ (https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj-2021-067696).

An international research team led by the University of Birmingham's World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Global Women's Health analyzed data from 140 studies from around the globe that included 14 271 babies born to mothers with COVID-19. They found an overall COVID-19 infection rate of 1.8% (95% confidence interval, 1.2%-2.5%), as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

Of the 800 COVID-positive fetuses or babies with outcome data, 20 were stillbirths, 23 died during the first 28 days of life, and 8 were early pregnancy losses; 749 babies (93.6%) were alive at the end of follow-up. The authors conclude, "Severe maternal COVID-19 may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in babies, but not vaginal delivery, breastfeeding, or mother-baby contact after birth."

Senior author Shakila Thangaratinam, MD, PhD, professor of maternal and perinatal health at the University of Birmingham, said in a university news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/946306), "Ours is the 1st study to use the World Health Organization's stringent methods to show that it is possible for the virus to be spread from the mother to baby while in the womb, during childbirth, and after delivery. However, parents and healthcare professionals can be reassured that only a very small proportion of babies born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 test positive."

An editorial on the study in the same journal highlights widely varying quality of data among the studies analyzed but echoes Thangaratinam: "Overall, findings from this review seem reassuring" (https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o593.short).

Over the last 7 days, 20 282, 1559, 4028, 321, and 2519 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 32 167, 3033, 4082, 517, and 6506 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the sharp decline in cases in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal over the last 5 weeks or so, a sharp decreasing trend in Sri Lanka over the last week, and a state of stability in Pakistan compared with the previous week. The daily case positivity against the number of people tested is now around 1.7% in Bangladesh, 0.4% in India, and 1.3% in Pakistan, as indicated in items [A], [B], and [D] above.

In the last 3 consecutive days, there were no COVID-19 deaths reported from Bangladesh, and just only one death was reported from Nepal over the course of the last 7 days. As of 18 Mar 2022 at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) since yesterday (17 Mar 2022) there was not a single COVID-19 death reported from 23 out of the 36 states and union territories in India (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). Just 2 persons died of the disease in Pakistan on 16 Mar 2022, and only one on 15 Mar 2022 in Sri Lanka, as indicated in items [D] and [E] above.

As extracted from item [B] above, as many as 8 158 043 COVID-19 cases were detected across India from 1 Jan-17 Mar 2022, and in this window of 76 days, 35 016 people died due to the disease, suggesting a case fatality rate of 0.43%, grossly meaning that if 1000 people were confirmed with the disease by laboratory testing, around 4 of them died eventually. This rate of mortality is around 2.8 times lower compared with the overall death rate of 1.20%, recorded in India due to the disease, but 3.1 times lower compared with the death rate (1.32%) recorded on 21 May 2021, 2 weeks later from the highest number of total daily cases (414 433) recorded on 6 May 2021, during the peak of the previous surge in the country believed to be caused by the delta variant (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/).

As of 18 Mar 2022, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 809 794 588 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 16 Mar 2022, 105.94% have received the 1st dose and 76.19% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 6.08% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk. As of 18 Mar 2022 at 07:30 PKT (GMT+5), a total of 219 368 557 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the country (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

As of 13 Mar 2022, Nepal has administered at least 42 119 439 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np).

Sri Lanka has administered at least 38 982 099 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that is enough to have vaccinated about 89.4% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).

- The Americas region reported 5.6% of cases and 38.3% deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 149.30 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region. Brazil reported 52 094 cases, followed by the USA and Chile. An additional 7 countries reported more than 1000 cases (Argentina, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Martinique, and Uruguay) in the past 24 hours. Additionally, Peru, Colombia, and Cuba reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The European region reported 40.2% of cases and 33.0% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 190.91 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Belgium (11 cases), Portugal, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 32 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours -- 2 countries reporting more than 100 000 cases, 10 reporting more than 10 000, and 20 reporting over 1000 cases -- and 2 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 0.36% of daily case numbers and 2.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.47 million cases.

The low reported numbers may not be a true reflection of the prevalent COVID-19 situation in the region as vaccine coverage remains low.

- The Western Pacific region reported 51.7% of daily case numbers and 19.1% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 35.93 million cases. South Korea (621 328) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours, followed by Viet Nam, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, China, Singapore, and Brunei.
