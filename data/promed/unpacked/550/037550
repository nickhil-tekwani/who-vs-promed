The contribution by Paul R. Epstein from the Harvard Medical School to the
report of the power failure on Plum Island (PMD#1-2003) is very
interesting. The fuel cell technology is certainly something to be
considered for an emergency power supply.
However, the latest problem at Plum Island is quite different, it is not a
technical one. The failure of the emergency power supply was caused
intentionally (see PMD#363-2002). There is a 5-month-old strike going on
at Plum Island.
Plum Island had several power failures in the 60's and 70's. One for
instance was caused by the cutting of the undersea power cable from Orient
Point (on Long Island) to Plum Island by a fishing vessel. But there was
never a problem as long as the operations on Plum Island were totally run
as a government installation and with government employees. The
maintenance and engineering department of Plum Island worked very well and
had a good esprit de corps.
They kept the emergency generators (submarine diesel engines) in good
shape. The generators were tested routinely and always started when needed.
In the 80's USDA wanted to save money and began to contract private
companies for the maintenance and engineering needs of the laboratory
installations. The old and experienced crew of government employees was
dispersed. New people, inexperienced in the needs of the laboratory
installations, came to the island.
The question is: Can the maintenance of such a high-security installation
be left reliably to a private company, whose main objective is to make
money? It is to be expected that any disagreement between management and
the [private employees] could compromise the safety and security of
operations. The problem at Plum Island in December of 2002 proves the point.
