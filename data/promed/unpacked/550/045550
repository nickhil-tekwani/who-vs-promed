Bluetongue, domestic ruminants - Spain (Andalusia): OIE
---------------------------------------------------
The following details (summarised) on bluetongue in Spain, which are
additional to the information included in OIE alert message 050726ESP, can
be found in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ministerio de
Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentacion, MAPA) website, under the link
"Confirmacion de Lengua Azul - Julio".
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 22 Jul 2004, by the Central Veterinary
Laboratory, Algete.
Diagnostic test used: RT-PCR.
Affected population: A beef farm in Encinasola (Huelva, 38:08:07 Latitude
North) in northwest Andalucia, about 10 km from the Portuguese border.
The virus was first detected on 19 Jul 2005 by a preliminary test (ELISA
for antibody detection? PN) made as part of the surveillance policy
established in the area.
Control measures undertaken: Movement control for ruminants in a 20-km area
around the infected premise, and 2 restricted areas of 100 and 150-km
radius from the outbreak.

[3 main questions may arise:
1. Have the cattle shown any clinical symptoms, or is this a detection of
infection rather than disease?
2. Which BTV serotype was detected?
3. Has the sheep population in Andalusia been vaccinated?
The animal movement control measures will not prevent the seasonal spread
of the virus by culicoides vectors. - Mod.AS]
