AVIAN INFLUENZA, POULTRY VS MIGRATORY BIRDS (12)

The Moderator wondered whether a survey in the United States reached
similar findings to the Canadian wild bird survey that did not find
any evidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Our Center
participated in the US program, and perhaps I can summarize the
results.
The 2006 program in the United States involved the collaboration
between the federal Departments of the Interior and Agriculture along
with numerous state, tribal, local governments and other partners.
The program was unprecedented in scope in terms of the range of
species of birds sampled, which included waterfowl, shorebirds, gulls
and terns, among others; the number of birds tested; and the
geographical coverage, which included all states as well as
freely-associated states and territories in the Pacific Basin. As of
today [14 Feb 2007], the testing of over 74 506 samples in wild birds
from across the United States has been completed, and no highly
pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been found. For those
interested, up to date information on the US wild bird surveillance
program, including the number of birds tested, the distribution of
samples collected from across the country, and information on the low
pathogenic H5N1 isolated thus far, please see:

[Our thanks to Hon for the update. The US wild bird survey has tested
some 74 506 birds, with 17 609 from Alaska alone. The 2006 sampling
season is due to finish on 31 Mar 2007. I think one can safely say,
"So far, so good," in fact very persuasively if one is not tempting
fate by so saying. They are to be commended for the extensive and
very hard work involved. - Mod.MHJ]
