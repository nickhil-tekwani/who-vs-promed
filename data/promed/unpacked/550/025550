Virus 'threatening red squirrels'
----------------------------------
A virus is placing Scotland's dwindling red squirrel population under
threat, conservationists have warned. Squirrel pox is said to have been
carried over the border by grey squirrels migrating north from Cumbria.
Red squirrels with the virus will suffer skin ulcers, lesions and scabs,
with swelling and discharge around the eyes, mouth, feet and genitals.
The Moredun Research Institute near Edinburgh found the virus after taking
blood samples from grey squirrels.
Grey squirrels are seldom harmed by the virus, but red squirrels have no
immunity and usually die within 15 days.
Scientists say it is the 1st evidence of squirrel pox virus in southern
Scotland and has serious implications for the endangered red squirrel
population.
Infected animals resemble rabbits with myxomatosis and are sometimes found
shivering and lethargic.
Roger Cook, the chief executive of the European Squirrel Initiative, urged
people to report any sightings of sick or dead red squirrels.
Elly Hamilton, a red squirrel conservation officer from the Scottish
Borders, said this was the first convincing case of the pox crossing the
border.
She said: "All we know is that the grey squirrels carry it. They are
unaffected clinically by it so they act as a reservoir host for the
disease. They pass it into red squirrels, who once they have caught it, die
within 2 weeks."
The disease was first confirmed in grey squirrels in East Anglia in the
1980s, Ms Hamilton said. It had been working its way north since, she added.
"It is believed that where grey squirrels are carrying antibodies to this
virus that they replace red squirrels 20 times faster than they would do
normally."
