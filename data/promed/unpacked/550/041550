[The new cases reported over the past week with the graphs of the epidemic curves, continue to indicate that the peak number of cases nationally has passed. However, the Lassa fever period can be expected to continue for another 1-2 months, into June 2018. New cases have occurred over the past few days in several states. As noted in previous comments, providing adequate surveillance and timely treatment over such a large geographic area is challenging. Fortunately, there is international help participating in treatment and surveillance. No additional health care people have been infected during this week.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the source URL above.
