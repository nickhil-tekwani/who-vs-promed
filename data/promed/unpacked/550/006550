Laboratory tests have confirmed that a dead swan found in the
Krasnodar Territory was infected with H5 bird flu virus, but not with
the N1 strain, a source in the local administration said Monday [10 Sep 2007].
This is the only case of bird flu detected in the territory since 410
chickens died from the virus and 22 000 birds were culled at a local
poultry farm in southern Russia.
A regional laboratory identified the lethal H5N1 virus in the dead
chickens, and took steps to contain the spread.
The losses from the outbreak are estimated at 20 million rubles (USD 702 000).

[Laboratory results pertaining to the identity of the N
(neuraminidase) component of the swan virus, and details of the
exact species of the affected swan, will be welcomed.
A map of Krasnodar is available at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/?action=selmap&country=241_8053_6&language=1>.
The case should be reported to the OIE (World Organization for Animal
Health), since all H5 avian influenza viruses, even of low
pathogenicity, are regarded as NAI (notifiable avian influenza).
The earlier Krasnodar outbreak in poultry was covered in ProMED-mail
posting 20070906.2938. - Mod.AS]
