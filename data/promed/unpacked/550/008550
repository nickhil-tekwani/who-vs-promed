New data from the Provincial Congress of Infectology shows that the number of congenital syphilis cases in the province [Cordoba] has risen by 68 percent in 2021 compared to last year [2020].

So far this year [2021], 358 babies were born in Cordoba with congenital syphilis. This compares with 213 cases reported in 2020. The difference between 2021 and 2019 is even starker -- 377 percent compared to 2019 (when 75 were registered).

According to official data, the [incidence] rate of congenital syphilis this year [2021] stood at 16.21 new cases per 1000 live births, a number much higher than that reported in previous years: 7.7 in 2017, 5.93 in 2018, 2.96 in 2019, and 9.64 percent [per 1000 live births?] in 2020.

Why the significant increase? Doctors say it is a multicausal phenomenon. On the one hand, it increased surveillance, notification, and detection of cases. On the other hand, the circulation of syphilis has been growing in the region. One of the explanations could be the decrease in condom use, especially in young people.

Congenital syphilis is an infectious disease transmitted by an infected mother to her baby in the womb. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact but mothers can transmit the infection to their baby in the womb or through the birthing process. The disease can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, death shortly after birth, prematurity, and birth defects. A woman can be treated and cured for syphilis during pregnancy, but it is important for women to be tested in time for treatment to be effective. Babies who test positive for syphilis at birth must be treated immediately to prevent serious health issues.

[Cordoba, located in central Argentina, about 700 km (435 mi) northwest of Buenos Aires, is both the 2nd most populous city in Argentina after Buenos Aires (pop, 1.3 million residents in 2010) and a province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Córdoba,_Argentina). A map showing the location of Cordoba can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Córdoba,+Cordoba,+Argentina.

Argentina now joins countries that report a rise in the incidence of congenital syphilis. The US, after syphilis reached historic lows in 2000, with less than 6000 reported cases and an incidence rate of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people, has since experienced a rising incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/2017-STD-Surveillance-Report_CDC-clearance-9.10.18.pdf). Initially, during 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men, specifically men who have sex with men (MSM). More recently, syphilis also increased among women every year since 2012. This is of particular concern because congenital syphilis cases tend to increase as the rates of P&S syphilis increase among women (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/CDC_2016_STDS_Report-for508WebSep21_2017_1644.pdf).

Transmission of _Treponema pallidum_, the organism that causes syphilis, from a mother with untreated early syphilis to the fetus in utero occurs via the bloodstream. Transmission may also occur during delivery if maternal genital lesions are present. Late abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death may result from congenital infection in untreated pregnancies. Among survivors, manifestations that develop in the 1st 2 years of life are called "early" and are similar to adult secondary syphilis; manifestations that develop after age 2 years are called "late" and include tooth abnormalities (Hutchinson teeth), bone changes (saber shins), "Clutton's joints" (bilateral painless swelling of the knee joints), neurological involvement, blindness, and deafness.

We are not told in the news report above about the factors responsible for the changing epidemiology of syphilis in Argentina that could account for the increasing incidence of congenital syphilis. In the US and Canada, the recently increasing incidence of syphilis in heterosexual men and women has been linked to illicit drug use, which is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially crack cocaine, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

Control of congenital syphilis is achieved by antenatal screening and treatment of infected mothers. Routine serologic screening should be done at the 1st prenatal visit in all pregnant women, and, for pregnant women who are at high risk of contracting syphilis during pregnancy, serologic testing should also be done early in the 3rd trimester (between 28 and 32 weeks) and again at delivery. Groups at high risk include uninsured women, women living in poverty, sex workers, illicit drug users, women diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases, having multiple partners, a new partner, or a partner with STIs, and those living in communities with high syphilis morbidity (http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf09/syphilis/syphpgsum.htm). No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been documented at least once during pregnancy and, if the mother is considered high risk, also at delivery.

More information on the syphilis outbreak in Cordoba would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
