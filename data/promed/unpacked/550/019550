Health authorities in Malawi's northern district of Karonga, which borders Tanzania, are closely monitoring 3 patients who are showing signs of cholera a few days after they received an alert from Kyera, a neighboring district in Tanzania, about a cholera outbreak there.

District Health Officer Michael Kayange told Nyasa Times that they received an alert message 2 days ago about a cholera outbreak in Kyera Township that has so far claimed the lives of 3 people, while 21 others are admitted at the hospital.

"It was on Tue 9 Jul 2013 when we received the news that our neighboring country has a cholera outbreak, and it is obvious that the disease will be transferred to Karonga because most Karonga people go to Kyera for shopping," said Kayange. Adding that, "so far, we have 3 suspected cases which have symptoms of cholera, and we are now managing them as cholera cases, but we are yet to confirm them." He added that the 3 suspected cases are said to have eaten food bought from Kyera.

Foreign tourists are also recommended to refrain from staying in crowded places.

18 people have died since March [2013], victims of a cholera epidemic that is affecting the region Tombali in southern Guinea-Bissau, UNICEF reported.

According to a statement issued in Bissau, the data were revealed by the Ministry of Public Health, Guinea. Since March [2013], there have been 156 cases of cholera in the Tombali region.

To help the government fight the epidemic, UNICEF is preparing a prevention campaign that will unfold throughout the country. Both UNICEF and the Guinean authorities now want to work for prevention of the spread of disease to other regions.

UNICEF is sending materials needed to assemble cholera treatment centers in Catio and Komo in response to difficulties revealed by the regional hospital Catio.

[4] Diarrhea - Sudan (South Darfur State)

Reports from Kalma camp for displaced persons near Nyala, capital of South Darfur, say that cases of acute diarrhea are on the increase among residents of the camp.

Dr Abdulkarim Abdullah, a physician at one of the camp's clinics, says that at least 250 people visit the clinics each day complaining of acute diarrhea. "Another cause for concern is vomiting and malnutrition among the children, all a result of the deteriorating sanitary environment and a lack of medicines," he stated. "This is aggravated by the influx of displaced persons and the rainfall at the camp. Antibiotics just can't treat them anymore."

[5] Cholera - India (Maharashtra)

Eight Mumbaikars have tested positive for cholera in just 8 days this month [July 2013], raising concerns of the civic authorities who have asked citizens to take precautions, though they maintain there is no need to panic.

While not entirely uncommon during monsoon, the surge in cholera cases has worried civic officials, given the fact that only 12 people had tested positive in the entire month of June 2013.

"We are slightly concerned about the cholera cases this month [July 2013]," said Additional Municipal Commissioner Manisha Mhaiskar, who has urged Mumbaikars to take preventive measures by boiling water before drinking and avoiding roadside food.

According to Mhaiskar, 3 of the positive cases diagnosed this month [July 2013] are from B ward, which includes the areas of Dongri, Pydhonie, Yellow Gate, etc. Two cases are from E ward, which comprises Byculla, Agripada, Sewree and Kalachowkie areas, while the remaining 3 are isolated cases in other parts of the city.

The BMC's health workers, she said, have already begun the process of screening people with symptoms from across the city. Meanwhile, experts have cautioned people suffering from gastroenteritis, as they are more prone to cholera. This month [July 2013], the city has already recorded 686 cases of gastroenteritis.
