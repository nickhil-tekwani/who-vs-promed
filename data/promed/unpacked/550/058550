Another suspected bird flu patient dies in Indonesian
hospital. "The man died yesterday after just a few hours at
the hospital," said Dr Ilham Patu, spokesman for Jakarta's
Sulianti Saroso hospital, where most suspected victims of
the outbreak are being treated. The man showed symptoms of
bird flu but the results of tests were not yet available.
"For the moment, he is only suspected of having contracted
the avian influenza virus," Patu said on Tuesday [11 Oct
2005].
Indonesia has confirmed 3 deaths from bird flu, based on
local tests and confirmation from World Health Organisation
(WHO) facilities in Hong Kong, since the 1st case of human
infection was found in the country in June 2005. There have
been another 2 confirmed human infections in Indonesia,
including a 21-year-old man in hospital in Lampung in
Sumatra island. Officials quoted by the state Antara news
agency said on Monday the man has been confirmed by the WHO
laboratory in Hong Kong as positively infected.
The man's 4 year old cousin is also suspected to have
contracted bird flu and blood tests have been sent to Hong
Kong for confirmation.
Jakarta's Ragunan zoo, which had been closed down since 19
Sep 2005 after some of its birds tested positive for bird
flu, reopened on Tuesday [11 Oct 2005]. "The zoo is now
perfectly safe for visitors. The birds have been cleared of
the virus, the entire zoo disinfected and birds still
carrying the disease have been put in isolation and off
limits to the public," said spokesperson Titisari Puntorini.
Indonesia has been fighting the outbreak largely by
vaccinating poultry flocks. But state prosecutors are
investigating alleged corruption by local vaccine
manufacturers involving the supply of sub-standard doses.

[This new suspected case is identified as an avian H5N1
influenza virus case on the basis of symptoms. No local
laboratory tests have been completed, and clinical samples
have not been referred to the WHO-reference laboratory in
Hong Kong. Therefore the number of cases of avian influenza
in Indonesia confirmed by laboratory testing remains
unaltered at 5 (3 of which were fatal). - Mod.CP]
