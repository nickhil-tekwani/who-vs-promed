National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. has just renovated and reopened
their existing P-4 facility. It is intended for use on multi-drug-resistant
tuberculosis.
Also, I believe that Southern Research Institute in Frederick, MD. is in the
process of building a P-4 lab for biological warfare defense research and/or
vaccine development. This section is headed by Dave Franz and can be, I
assume,
confirmed by him.

----
My former chief at the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL), Dr David
Brown, has advised on the current state of UK category 4 virology
fascilities:
Three P4 labs are presently functioning, namely at:
- CPHL [Central Public Health Laboratory (London),
- Centre for Applied Microbiology & Research (CAMR, Porton Down) and
- National Institute for Biological Standards & Control (NIBSC, Potters
Bar).
Two new P4 labs are also being built at:
- the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR, London) and
- the Ministry of Defence facility at the Chemical & Biological Defence
Establishment (CBDE, Porton Down).
An occasional error made by both lay people and professionals (ie
scientists/medics) is to confuse the two institutes at Porton Down: Despite
their close proximity, CAMR and CBDE are separate organisations.

The Soviets had a suspected facility at Lakhta near St Petersburg, and a P4
hood line at the Institute of Dangerous Pathogens at Minsk.
The Swedes are building one at the Institute for Infection Control at Solna.
