Detection of cattle with bluetongue antibodies delivered from Germany in Kaluga Oblast
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Within monitoring activities the All-Russian Scientific and Research Institute for Veterinary Virology and Microbiology detected bluetongue seropositive cattle delivered from Germany to OOO "Kaluzhskaya Niva", settlement of Khokhlovka, Peremyshl' Rayon [district], Kaluga Oblast [region] last year [2011]. The number of seropositive cattle is 35 animals out of 57 delivered (61 percent).

As it was reported previously, bluetongue was detected in Smolensk Oblast also in animals exported from Germany. Due to this fact Sergey Dankvert, head of the Rosselkhoznadzor sent a letter to Paola Testori Coggi, director general of the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers of the European Commission. In it he expressed his deepest concern about this event and addressed to the EC a request to send EU veterinary experts to Russia for sampling blood from infected animals as soon as possible and to test these samples immediately in the World Reference Center for bluetongue in Pirbright Laboratory, United Kingdom.

The Rosselkhoznadzor request was not considered by the European Commission. The Rosselkhoznadzor is studying the current situation attentively and reserves the right to take any appropriate measures.

[This is the 2nd Russian statement on the possible introduction of BTV with cattle imported from Germany; for the previous Russian allegation, see archived post 20111203.3524 as well as Russia's notification to the OIE with details of the lab tests applied (archive no. 20111231.3723). The positive reactions recorded in other species (sheep and goats) of the same outbreak, in addition to cattle, may be interpreted as suggestive that the (allegedly) introduced BTV circulated within the involved premises.

This event deserves further elucidation. Preferably, the Russian samples be investigated also by an OIE BT reference laboratory, to confirm -- or negate -- the suspected international spread and particularly the assumption that a novel serotype is involved.

Germany has presented, during the last meeting of SCFCAH (Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) (11-12 Jan 2012) in Brussels, its document "Bluetongue in the Federal Republic of Germany: final report" in which epidemiological data suggestive of this country's freedom from BTV were included, concluding: "Germany requests the free status of bluetongue from xy.01.2012 (to be agreed with BE, NL, LU) and will lift the restriction zone". The presentation is available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1112012012_bt_germany_en.pdf.

For Russia's history of BTV, please refer to the detailed commentary in ProMED-mail archive no. 20111203.3524. - Mod.AS]
