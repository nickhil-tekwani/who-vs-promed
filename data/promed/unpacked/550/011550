Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 23 Mar 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 30 Mar 2019
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2002
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: RHDV2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Reykjavik, Gullbringu [Southern Peninsula]
Date of start of the outbreak: 23 Mar 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 140 / 104 / 104 / 0 / 0
Affected population: feral rabbits

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rabbits / 74.29 / 74.29 / 100 / 74.29
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comment: Sudden death in a flock of feral rabbits in one area. Number of susceptible rabbits in the area is estimated to be around 140. 104 carcasses have been found, 22 rabbits have been saved, and about 10-15 live rabbits are still in the area. Signs of the disease have not yet been detected in other areas. Rabbit owners have been advised to avoid the area and apply biosecurity measures in caring for their rabbits. Vaccination of domestic rabbits will be advised when vaccine will be available in the country. There has only once been an outbreak of RHD before in Iceland, it was in 2002. The serotype of the virus at that time is not known.

Control measures
Measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Laboratory of Sweden, SVA (foreign laboratory) / Rabbits / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 31 Mar 2020 / positive
Institute of experimental pathology at Keldur, University of Iceland (National laboratory) / Rabbits / histopathological examination / 27 Mar 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality of 70-90 percent for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70 percent for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1-3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15 to 20 days of age onwards."

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is endemic in Australia, New Zealand, Cuba, parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. The viral subtypes circulating in each region can differ. As of 2016, RHDV2 has been found in a number of European countries and Australia. There is no indication that RHDV infects humans." Source: Spickler, Anna Rovid. "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease."
