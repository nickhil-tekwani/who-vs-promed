[The new case was confirmed in the Dumfries & Galloway region. This is the
1st case there since 2 were reported on 22 Mar 2010, a month ago. Dumfries
& Galloway is due south of Glasgow on the border with England; it is the
area of origin of the song "Old King Cole" (or Coel). This was a Brythonic
speaking part of southern Scotland and northern England at the time of the
Roman occupation collapse, and Coel has a mythology similar to King Arthur.

Readers in southern England may have seen recent reports in their local
papers of a "new" case in London. This was premature. Careful cultural and
genomic investigations have not confirmed it. - Mod.MHJ]
