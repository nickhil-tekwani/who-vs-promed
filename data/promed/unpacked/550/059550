Anthrax outbreak kills 24 animals in South Africa
-------------------------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak has killed 24 animals in South Africa's Northern Cape
province, agriculture officials said on Thursday [4 Dec 2008]. Department
of Agriculture spokeswoman Priscilla Tsotso Sehoole said 21 sheep and 3
blue wildebeest had died from the outbreak. The animals had not been
vaccinated for anthrax this year [2008]. Sehoole said there were no reports
of people having been affected.

"A vaccination campaign is under way to prevent further spread," the
department stated. It said that anthrax was endemic in the area, with the
last outbreak having occurred there around the same time last year [2007],
though details of how many animals had died then were not available. The
department said the anthrax outbreak was unrelated to one in Zimbabwe,
which Save the Children last week [week of 24 Nov 2008] said had killed 3
people and could wipe out at least 60 000 livestock.

[Anthrax in livestock, wildlife, and people is regularly reported in the
Northern Cape Province. For example: 2001 -- cattle outbreak in
Schmidtsdrift with 15-23 people hospitalised; 2002 -- sporadic cases
involving kudu (_Tragelaphus strepsiceros_); 2003 -- sporadic cases
involving roan antelope (_Hippotragus taurinus_); 2004 -- Greater Kudu (_T.
strepsiceros_); 2005 -- 4 men hospitalised, 1 died, with accounts of a
further 50 treated after exposure to meat from dead cows; 2006 -- cattle
outbreak; 2007 -- 5 outbreaks involving cattle, goats, horses, and
unspecified wildlife. And so it goes on. Vaccination of wildlife is
difficult and expensive. But routine annual vaccination of livestock is
straightforward and very cost effective especially in a province with a
record of repeated human cases, even deaths. - Mod.MHJ
