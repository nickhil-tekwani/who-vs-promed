[2] Cholera, prisoners - India (Goa State)

It was not food poisoning that left the 128 inmates of central jail at Aguada and the judicial lock-up at Mapusa sick 2 weeks ago. It was a cholera outbreak. Senior sources at the Goa Medical College and Hospital, Bambolim, where 15 prisoners from the central jail were admitted on 31 May 2013, told STOI that all the prisoners displayed symptoms of cholera and were treated accordingly.

Speaking to STOI, albeit on condition of anonymity, a senior doctor said, "It was not a case of simple food poisoning as is being made out, nor was the sickness caused by _E. coli_ bacteria. The initial clinical examinations of the prisoners pointed towards cholera."

Sources further said that the prisoners who complained of diarrhea were brought to the GMC only after jail authorities realized the seriousness of what was happening following the death of a prisoner.

Central jail prisoners are presently being given bottled water and are being served food from the Sada sub-jail, while the Mapusa judicial lock-up authority has appointed a contractor to supply food to the prisoners.
