More Illness Linked to Texas Oysters
Another 58 people have been identified as victims of bacteria-tainted
oysters from Galveston Bay. Doug McBride, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Health, said the cases confirmed Thursday bring the national
total since June 1 to 245, including 206 in Texas, 36 in Florida and three
in Tennessee. The number surpasses a similar outbreak last year involving
208 people in the Pacific Northwest where one person died.
Fishermen have agreed to stop harvesting from Galveston Bay and recall
in-the-shell oysters taken from seven of the bay's 43 commercial lease
sites. Oysters harvested and shipped for *cooking* are not included in the
recall.
Health authorities blame the problem on _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, which is
killed by thorough cooking. Symptoms range from diarrhea to nausea and fever.

[In outbreaks in Louisiana involving this and other Vibrio sp. it is
interesting how the cases are densely clustered along the southern border
of the state, essentially south of the I-10 Highway, that runs from Florida
to Los Angeles. This nicely demarcates those Cajuns who tend to undercook
their seafood in appreciation of the improved taste. The Presbyterians and
Baptists further north are rarely so afflicted as they have different
culinary habits. - Mod.MHJ
