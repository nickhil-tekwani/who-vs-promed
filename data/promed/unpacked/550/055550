Disease threatens cats and dogs
------------------------------------
Pet owners have been urged to vaccinate their animals against leptospirosis.
Dr. Beto Yaldin, a vet with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (SPCA), said, on Fri 25 Jun 2004, that 5 percent of pets -- mainly
cats and dogs -- brought in over the past 2 weeks showed signs of
leptospirosis.
The signs are a yellow pigment in the mucus under the eyes, in the ears,
mouth, and on skin areas without hair. "The other signs are vomiting,
lethargy, and loss of appetite. These signs can be indicators for other
illnesses as well and are not confined to leptospirosis only, so it is
safer to bring in your pets for vaccination whether they are sick or not,"
Dr. Yaldin said.
Vaccination costs USD 25 per pet.
Dr. Yaldin said that the society was ill-equipped to determine whether the
illness was really leptospirosis. "We are thinking of sending the samples
to Australia for testing. If not, we might send them to the animal control
unit at the Ministry of Agriculture, or to other science laboratories, to
determine what it was. The process may take time."
Dr. Yaldin said that it was rare for humans to contract the disease from
cats and dogs.

[Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease and can be prevented by vaccination.
It seems that leptospirosis is certainly a re-emerging concern in a number
of areas. - Mod.TG]
