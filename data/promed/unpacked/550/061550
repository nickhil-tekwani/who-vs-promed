Rising rabies deaths alarms health department
---------------------------------------------
The Health Department of the Philippines Government reported 264
[suspected] human rabies cases between 1 Jan and 23 Oct 2010. Of
these, 206 died due to the virus that is transmitted by the infected
saliva of animals, especially dogs, through bites or licking of open
wounds. Health officials say that it is during school vacation time
that cases of rabies are on the rise because children play with
unvaccinated animals. [However, these figures figures are encouraging
in the light of the 5658 cases recorded in 2008 -- see the list of
comparative figures cited in the penultimate paragraph of this press
report. - Mod.CP]

With the Christmas vacation coming, health officials are alarmed of
the possible surge in the number of cases. For this year, the
following areas had the highest reported cases of rabies [i.e.,
encounters with rabid animals]: Region IV-A (49); Region III (36);
Region V (29); and Metro Manila (20), 16 of whom succumbed. Human
rabies is a deadly disease and more than 99 percent of people who
develop the symptoms of the disease die.

The symptoms of human rabies are trivial such as fever, cough or sore
throat, pain, burning of itching sensation at the site of the bite,
abdominal pain, and anxiety and agitation. Later, symptoms become
more distinctive such as hallucinations, delirium, fear of water
(hydrophobia), fear of air (aerophobia), muscle spasms in the face
and neck, seizures, paralysis, coma, heart and respiratory failure.

The disease is also preventable through adequate vaccination of
warm-blooded animals [mammals] and pets like dogs, cats, and monkeys.
Bats, elephants, rabbits, rats, and horses may harbor the rabies
virus, too. Birds, chickens, fishes, and reptiles cannot transmit the
disease.

Once bitten, it is strongly advised that the bite wound be thoroughly
washed with soap and running water for 15 minutes. Immediately go to
the doctor for medical advice. Do not kill the offending animal.
Capture the animal and observe for 10 to 15 days for behavioral
changes. Ask a veterinarian or any authorities for further action
toward the animal.

In 2008, the 10 countries with highest human deaths due to rabies were:
India -- 244 478
Bangladesh -- 22 900
China -- 13 995
Philippines -- 5658
Vietnam -- 5183
Pakistan -- 2843
Sri Lanka -- 2042
Myanmar -- 1683
Thailand -- 1377
Indonesia -- 1208

Some of the countries that have successfully eradicated rabies are
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. [In these
island communities once rabies has been eradicated by vaccination and
control orders, rabies-free status can be maintained by the
implementation of strict quarantine regulations. The island geography
of the Philippines would also allow step-by-step eradication of
rabies by a combination of animal vaccination followed by the
imposition of strict quarantine regulations. - Mod.CP]
