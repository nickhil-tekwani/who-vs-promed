Paeroa [Hauraki district, Waikato region] vets are warning owners to make sure vaccinations are up to date after several dogs have been infected with canine parvovirus.

Paeroa Veterinary Services veterinarian Danielle Thomson said one dog had died and 2 others were successfully treated for the deadly virus in the past few weeks.

There were also several more dogs diagnosed with parvo at other vet clinics throughout the region, she said.

"We've also had a few people come in talking about signs resembling parvo but they haven't been able to afford treatment for it, so we've given [medicine] across the counter," she said.

It can cost anywhere from NZD 1500 [about USD 1100] or more to treat an infected dog, depending on the size of the dog and severity of its clinical presentation. It takes about week of round the clock care, including intravenous fluids and medications, with no guarantees the dog will survive.

"Vaccination is far cheaper in comparison or compared to losing a dog," Thomson said.

The virus causes severe gastroenteritis, affecting mainly black and tan breeds, such as Rottweiler, Doberman, pitbull, and German shepherd dogs. [In the United States, it affects any breed of dog- Mod.TG]

"It causes really severe damage to the gut," she said. "They get profuse vomiting, then diarrhoea after a day or so, a bloody, foul smelling, disgusting diarrhoea, and then because it damages the tract so much, they're predisposed to getting bacterial infections."

The disease also affected bone marrow cells, reducing the manufacture of white blood cells which lowered the immune system, she said. "It's just awful, they're just absolutely flat. And it's very contagious."

Thomson urged dog owners to vaccinate dogs and puppies against the virus, which stays in the environment for months or years.

"If they are vaccinated it should at least mean the disease isn't as bad, they're going to have a much better chance of being protected. "If they're not vaccinated, they shouldn't go anywhere where other dogs have been."

Regular worming was also important as a high worm burden made dogs more susceptible, she said. [I am not sure about more susceptible so much as it can put them in a negative energy state as well as decrease their overall resistance. - Mod.TG]

Thomson said she wasn't sure why there were so many dogs affected by parvo at the moment, but the ongoing hot, humid weather may have played a part.

"We just have years that are bad and some that aren't. The last few years have been really good but as soon as you have some [dogs infected], because it's so contagious, it just gets passed on."

[This is not a new disease in New Zealand. There are papers published on this topic, However, this is perhaps one of the 1st outbreaks or supposed outbreaks not associated with a shelter that we have been made aware of.

Some of the signs of parvovirus include lethargy; loss of appetite; abdominal pain and bloating; fever or low body temperature (hypothermia); vomiting; and severe, often bloody, diarrhea. Persistent vomiting and diarrhea can cause rapid dehydration, and damage to the intestines and immune system can cause septic shock.

If your puppy or dog shows any of these signs, you should contact your veterinarian immediately.

Most deaths from parvovirus occur within 48 to 72 hours following the onset of clinical signs. If your puppy or dog shows any of these signs, you should contact your veterinarian immediately https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/canine-parvovirus.aspx.

Parvovirus infection in dogs is prevalent throughout New Zealand. Dogs infected with parvovirus excrete infectious virus in their faeces from 10 days to 21 days after the onset of the disease. It can be spread from one dog to the other through water and food contaminated by faeces. Parvovirus can survive freezing temperatures, and most household disinfectants will not kill it. This virus can also be spread on shoes and clothing; dog kennels, parks, river banks and show grounds are all major sources of infection.

In the majority of cases, untreated dogs contracting parvovirus will die. Treatment relies on replacing lost body fluids and correcting disturbed electrolyte balance. Both the severity of the challenge and the timing of when treatment is started will affect the outcome. Treatment usually involves intensive care for several days in the veterinary hospital and can be very expensive.

Vaccinating your dog is the best way to prevent canine parvovirus infection.

Vaccination will help protect your dog against this serious infectious disease that can kill very quickly. The vaccine stimulates the dog's immune system to produce antibodies against parvovirus.

During the 1st day or 2 of life, pups usually receive some immunity (antibodies) from their mother's first milk (colostrum). This natural immunity allows the puppy to resist disease and will help protect the pup for its 1st 6 weeks of life. After this time, the level of immunity drops off, and the pup can no longer be sure of protection. Puppies should, therefore, be started on their vaccination programme from 6-8 weeks of age to ensure that their risk of infection is greatly reduced. It is extremely important that puppies complete their vaccination programme so they are protected against this disease. They will also need regular vaccinating throughout their lives for continued protection.

Until your puppy is fully vaccinated -- 10 days after its final puppy vaccination -- do not walk or put it down in any park or public place, including footpaths. Stay home and restrict any contact with soil to a minimum until your puppy is fully vaccinated.

Vaccination programmes may vary depending on disease risk, geographical area, age, and the health and lifestyle of your dog. Your veterinarian is the best person to advise you about your dog's vaccination and health requirements.
