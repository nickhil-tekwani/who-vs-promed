Oatly recalls drink because of _Bacillus cereus_; 2 sick with 27 other complaints filed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oatly has blamed a quality issue for recalling an oat drink in 2 European countries. The company has received 29 complaints and 2 people reported stomach illness. Detection of _Bacillus cereus_ led to the recall of Oatly 1 liter in Finland and Estonia with a best before date of 1 Dec 2022 and lot code 1335T4. The drink, made in Sweden, had been on sale in Finland since late January [2022] in certain stores and online.

Oatly advised people not to consume the affected batch.

A company spokesperson told Food Safety News that the health and safety of consumers is a top priority. "We have identified a quality issue with one specific batch of Oatly Kaurajuoma 1 liter sold in Finland and Estonia, in which the bacteria _Bacillus cereus_ has been detected," said the spokesperson.

"As soon as we became aware of the issue, we initiated a recall of the products potentially affected from specific stores, and began additional investigations, working closely with the relevant authorities and partners. Oatly is taking every possible precaution and following all internal and external protocols, working to investigate the root cause and ensure that quality routines are of the highest standards. We have full traceability for our products, and this is not anticipated to have any impact on our product supply in general."

The Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) and Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) did not take the opportunity when asked to provide further details about the incident or those sick.

_Bacillus cereus_ is acquired through contaminated products that have not been cooked or warmed to a high enough temperature to kill the bacteria, or through cooked foods not stored at low enough temperatures to prevent the bacteria from multiplying.

[_Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning is the general name used for the illness. However, the organism has 2 recognized types of foodborne illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis between 0.5 and 5 hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of _Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is caused by a high molecular weight protein while the emetic or vomiting type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is caused by a low molecular weight and heat-stable protein. In some outbreaks there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the emetic types of illness [as in the report above].

The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, rectal tenesmus, moderate nausea that may accompany diarrhea, seldom vomiting, and no fever. Symptoms develop within 6-15 hours and can persist for 24 hours. This syndrome is rather mild and tends to mimic the symptoms of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. The diarrheal syndrome is caused by enterotoxins that are produced during growth of _B. cereus_ in the small intestine.

Generally, symptoms are transient and mild, possibly contributing to underreporting. Large numbers of cells are needed to cause illness and can occur when the food product (often rice) is held at a temperature inadequate to prevent growth. Despite the illness's usual mild symptoms, fatalities have been described associated with liver failure (Mahler H, Pasi A, Kramer JM, et al. Fulminant liver failure in association with the emetic toxin of _Bacillus cereus_. N Engl J Med 1997; 336(16): 1142-8; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199704173361604).

"Abstract
--------
_Bacillus cereus_ is widespread in nature and frequently isolated from soil and growing plants, but it is also well adapted for growth in the intestinal tract of insects and mammals. From these habitats it is easily spread to foods, where it may cause an emetic or a diarrhoeal type of food-associated illness that is becoming increasingly important in the industrialized world. The emetic disease is a food intoxication caused by cereulide, a small ring-formed dodecadepsipeptide. Similar to the virulence determinants that distinguish _Bacillus thuringiensis_ and _Bacillus anthracis_ from _B. cereus_, the genetic determinants of cereulide are plasmid-borne. The diarrhoeal syndrome of _B. cereus_ is an infection caused by vegetative cells, ingested as viable cells or spores, thought to produce protein enterotoxins in the small intestine. Three pore-forming cytotoxins have been associated with diarrhoeal disease: haemolysin BL (Hbl), nonhaemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) and cytotoxin K. Hbl and Nhe are homologous three-component toxins, which appear to be related to the monooligomeric toxin cytolysin A found in _Escherichia coli_. This review will focus on the toxins associated with foodborne diseases frequently caused by _B. cereus_. The disease characteristics are described, and recent findings regarding the associated toxins are discussed, as well as the present knowledge on virulence regulation."

Some reports of anthrax-like illness related to _B cereus_ strains containing anthrax toxin genes have been reported (see the "See Also" section). - Mod.LL
