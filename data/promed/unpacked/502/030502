After the ISP [Public Health Institute] analyzed the samples, the O'Higgins Health Seremi [regional health ministerial secretariat], Dr. Carolina Torres Pinto, confirmed this Tuesday [8 Nov 2022] the discovery of the 1st case of hantavirus [infection] this year, 2022 [in the region]. The person is a "39-year-old agricultural worker, resident of the Chépica commune".

Dr. Torres explained that "according to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, from a visit to the workplace and after interviewing family members, it was possible to identify that exposure to the virus could have been associated with cutting firewood, weeding , and cleaning canals without taking preventive measures."

Immediately afterwards, the regional head of Health specified that initially the patient was "admitted to the ICU of the Santa Cruz Hospital where, despite the efforts, his situation was not favorable, for which he was transferred to the National Thorax Institute, where he is in stable condition and progressing favorably".

Finally, the Seremi Carolina Torres, pointed out that under [regulations for] protecting people's health "the protocols are activated", adding that "the Epidemiology Unit and the Department of Sanitary Action", according to their public division [of responsibility], "are carrying out environmental investigations and epidemiological surveillance".

To avoid attracting the long-tailed mouse (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), that is associated with the hantavirus, it is recommended to keep food in airtight containers, wash kitchen utensils immediately after use, quickly dispose of garbage; only drink potable, bottled or boiled water. If you live, work or walk in an area with the presence of rodents, do not enter rooms, sheds or cabins that have been closed for some time without first ventilating them for at least 30 minutes.

[Hantavirus infections occur in a broad Andean region of Chile every year. This case is in the O'Higgins region. Although not specified in this or previous reports from this and other regions, the hantavirus involved in this case no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile. The patient likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region, which is why the O'Higgins Health Seremi is advising the residents of the area take measures to prevent contact with the rodent or its excrement.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly from person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
