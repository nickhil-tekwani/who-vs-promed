Thousands of Southland and Otago [South Island] sheep have died on dozens of farms from a bacterial outbreak.

_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Brandenburg is a bacterial infection which causes abortions in late pregnancy and illness and death in some ewes.

It is of the same family as _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Hindmarsh which caused depression and severe diarrhoea killing hundreds of sheep earlier this year [2013].

Clutha Vets Animal Health Centre veterinarian John Smart said he knew of up to 30 farms affected by _S._ Brandenburg around Balclutha [Otago], which was more than last year [2012].

Hundreds of ewes had been affected with one farmer having 10 to 15 of his ewes aborting each day for a period of about 2 weeks.

However, some farmers did not report cases making reported figures a "gross under representation", he said.

More cases are expected during lambing next month [September 2013].

Gore VetSouth veterinarian Joel Hughes said the number of reported cases was "not out of the ordinary". Mr Hughes said he dealt with about 12 affected farms and hundreds of affected sheep. "It could well be going rampant but we don't get told about it. We hear about 20 per cent of cases in the area," he said.

Cases that veterinarians knew about were "the tip of the iceberg", he said.

VetSouth director Mark Bryan said hundreds of sheep on about 20 farms around Winton [Southland] had been affected. The number of cases was slightly higher than last year [2012], he said.

A wintry blast forecast tomorrow [28 Aug 2013] could place extra stress on ewes and worsen their reaction to the bacteria, he said.

Southern District Health Board medical officer of health Dr Marion Poore said there had been 6 cases of _S._ Brandenburg in humans this year [2013]. "Each month we expect to be notified of a number cases of salmonella. So far this year [2013] there have been 104 confirmed cases of salmonella in the district, including 6 that have been identified as _S._ Brandenburg. This is in line with the same point in previous years," she said.

This time last year [2012] there had been 92 cases of salmonella reported, with 5 being _S._ Brandenburg, Dr Poore said.

It was important people remembered basic hygiene and infection control both at home and on the farm. The key was to wash and dry hands frequently, especially before preparing food, she said.

_Salmonella_ Brandenburg at a glance
------------------------------------
It is a bacterium spread by direct contact with aborted foetuses or by ingestion of contaminated feed. Causes abortion in ewes in late pregnancy and kills about half of the affected ewes. Black backed gulls can also spread the bacteria from one farm to another. It can survive in the environment for 4 plus months. It can be identified by aborted foetuses that are putrid, and dead or sick ewes. Antibiotics can prevent ewe death but will not prevent abortion. Vaccinations early in pregnancy can prevent abortion. It can spread from animals to humans. Prevented in humans by basic hygiene such as washing hands when preparing food. Source: VetSouth

_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Brandenburg is a bacterium, which affects the intestinal tract of animals. Those animals that survive become carriers. Salmonellas can survive for 9 months or more in the environment in sites such as moist soil, water, faecal particles, and animal feeds. The disease can be spread by anything that takes mud and faeces from paddock to paddock, like gumboots and vehicle tires.

Since _S._ Brandenburg was first diagnosed in a mid-Canterbury (New Zealand) sheep farm, the bacterium has caused widespread abortions and deaths in pregnant ewes in mid and South Canterbury, coastal Otago, and Southland. _S_. Brandenburg abortions occur from about 80 days of gestation with a peak from 100 to 120 days (Bailey 1997, Clark 2000).

In cattle, the same strain of organism has also caused diarrhoea and dysentery in calves and adult cattle, and abortions and deaths in 1st calvers and to a lesser extent in 2nd calvers (Clark 2001). The bacteria have also been isolated from a one-month-old and 10-month-old foal with diarrhoea, goats with diarrhoea, and dogs with diarrhoea, metritis, and an infection in the male reproductive tract. The disease is an important occupational hazard, as a number of farmers, their families, including children and farm workers have contracted the disease as well as 3 veterinary practitioners (Clark 2001).

The Occupational Safety and Health Service (OSH) is concerned about the danger to human health following the spread of sheep infection with _S._ Brandenburg. The disease is potentially fatal to sheep and has now spread to dairy herds causing diarrhoea and abortions in cows, and diarrhoea, dysentery and deaths in young calves. The disease can also cause serious illness in humans, with victims laid low for up to 6 weeks with severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps, and fever, with periodic relapses for months after.

Additional information on _Salmonella_ Brandenburg may be found in ProMED-mail post 20090919.3285. All indications are this is becoming a major problem in New Zealand, and the Brandenburg strain seems to be spreading geographically and through various species. Clearly, producers are urged to vaccinate. - Mod.TG]
