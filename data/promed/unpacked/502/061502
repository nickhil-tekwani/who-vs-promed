The bubonic plague season arrived in Madagascar earlier than usual in 2013, and with it an apparently greater prevalence of a more deadly manifestation of the disease.

Between September and December 2013, the health ministry reported 42 known deaths and 84 cases from the illness in 4 of the country's 112 districts. The cases have been recorded at various geographical locations: Mandritsara in the north, Soanierana Ivongo in the [northeast], Ikongo in the southwest, and Tsiroanomandidy in the central highlands.

Dr Voahangy Ravaoalimalala, vice-director of the Malagasy Institut Pasteur, which performs pathogen tests for the health ministry in Antananarivo, told IRIN: "Bubonic plague can be treated easily with antibiotics, but this time some cases of pneumonic plague have also been identified. This form of plague is harder to treat, as it can kill people within 3 days."

Most cases of the 3 common plague forms are bubonic. Between 2 and 8 days after exposure, the patient develops fever and chills, as well as the [painful] swelling of lymph nodes -- the buboes -- to which the bacteria move and where they multiply. The 2nd is septicemic plague, with a fatality rate of 50 percent -- higher than bubonic --, and the 3rd is pneumonic plague, which is fatal in all cases unless the patient is given antibiotics as soon as the symptoms appear.

The health ministry notes that between 300 and 600 cases of bubonic plague occur annually in Madagascar, usually between October and March. Despite some anxiety in the capital, Antananarivo, and local media reports that there was a suspected case of plague in Manjakandriana, 20 km [12.4 mi] from the densely populated city, the cases and fatalities have occurred in fairly isolated areas. 2 weeks ago, officials announced Antananarivo's coffers were empty and there was no money to spare for rubbish collection. Refuse has been piling up in the city, encouraging the spread of rats and mice. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union (EU) have donated money and equipment, and have mobilized volunteers to assist in clearing the city of garbage.

According to the WHO, 21 725 persons were infected with plague worldwide in the 1st decade of the 21st century, accounting for 1612 deaths and a case fatality rate of 7.4 percent.

In many countries the disease has retreated as a result of access to medication, rodent-proof housing and better urban hygiene, but living conditions in Madagascar's highland villages -- where people often store their rice crops in their homes -- attract rats and make the country more prone to plague outbreaks. According to WHO, bubonic plague is endemic in many parts of Africa, and "the most heavily affected African countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique, Uganda and Tanzania."

Plague is thought to have arrived in Madagascar in 1898, carried by infected rats on ships from India. As a result of vaccination campaigns, improved housing and public hygiene, and the discovery of streptomycin and the use of insecticides, plague was brought under control in the 1950s.

During the next 30 years, only 20 to 50 cases per year were reported in Madagascar, but since 1989 the number of suspected cases has increased steadily.
