Suspected mosquitoborne encephalitis has killed 36 children in Bihar
in the past week, but the state government is yet to identify the
disease and its health officials are still guessing to diagnose it. 20
children died at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital in
Muzaffarpur followed by 10 in Kejriwal Hospital in Muzaffarpur. One
died at a private clinic in Motihari and 2 at Patna Medical College
and Hospital in Patna. Besides, 4 children died in different villages
in Muzaffarpur. "10 children died in last 48 hours at SKMCH and
Kejriwal hospitals in Muzaffarpur. With this, the death toll of
children rose to 36," a health official said.

After 3 dozen children died, mostly belonging to poorest families in
Muzaffarpur, Motihari, Gopalganj, and Patna districts, state
government decided to identify the villages affected and carry out
intensive spraying of DDT to kill mosquitoes, which are responsible
for the suspected disease. Bihar health minister Ashwani Kumar Choubey
told rediff.com in Patna on Wednesday [22 Jun 2011] that health
officials have been directed to start spraying DDT in villages. "All
such villages from where children died due to mysterious disease and
children have been admitted in hospitals will be identified to spray
DDT," Choubey said.

It must be recalled that it was Choubey who described heat-stroke as
the cause of the deaths 4 days ago. To date the state government has
not confirmed officially the real cause behind these deaths. Doctors
in Muzaffarpur treating children in different hospitals suggest that
the symptoms are similar to encephalitis.

Even state BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president Dr CP Thakur, a
renowned kala azar [visceral leishmaniasis] expert, disclosed that
test result of one of the 4 blood samples conducted by Patna-based
Rajendra Memorial Research Institute, has confirmed [Japanese]
encephalitis. But principal health secretary Amarjeet Sinha said that
disease was not diagnosed and test samples of blood would be sent to
the National Institute of Virology in Pune for confirmation. "Even
though the disease had not been diagnosed, the government was
providing symptomatic treatment to the patients," Sinha said.

Choubey has made it clear that state government is serious to handle
the situation. "We will bear expenses of all patients undergoing
treatment and teams of doctors will visit villages to provide
immunisation and proper treatment," he said.

Nearly 40 children still suffering from high fever are being treated
at the SKMCH and other hospitals including private clinics in
Muzaffarpur. "Some new patients complaining of high fever, severe
headache, vomiting were admitted to the hospital in the last 24
hours," a staff of SKMCH said. Dr AK Singh, civil surgeon,
Muzaffarpur, denied that encephalitis had claimed the lives of the
children, but admitted that the symptoms were similar. "Medical
authorities have collected samples which have been sent for tests in
virology laboratories at Pune and Kolkata. The medical reports were
still awaited," Singh said.

2 expert teams -- one from Pune-based National Institute of Virology
and another from Union health ministry in New Delhi -- visited SKMCH
and Kejriwal hospital in Muzaffarpur on Tuesday and Wednesday [21 and
22 Jun 2011]. The team members will visit villages hit by the disease
to identify the disease that had killed several children in last one
week. "The expert would also collect samples of local animals to
identify the cause of the disease for which the department of forest
has been approached," Sinha said.

Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar earlier directed health officials
to take preventive measures to check spread of the unknown disease.
Kumar had also requested Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad to
immediately send a central team to Bihar to find out the reasons
behind the disease outbreak.

[The number of deaths in this outbreak have increased from 26
children on 20 Jun 2011 to 36 fatalities and an additional 40
undergoing treatment in the current report.

The reports of the diagnosis of these cases are still not clear. The
previous report stated that JE virus infection was suspected, but
later in that same report stated that, "the disease has now been
identified as Japanese encephalitis" (see ProMED-mail archive no 20110621.1896). The identification of JE virus as the etiological
agent involved in these cases is presumably the result of laboratory
tests on the sera of 4 patients submitted to the laboratory previously
(see ProMED-mail archive no 20110619.1879).

The 23 Jun 2011 edition of The Times of India
(http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Its-encephalitis-confirms-central-team/articleshow/8956481.cms)
quotes the senior most member of the 3-member central team from Union
health ministry and associate professor in pediatrics department of
Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, Dr IP Chaudharatna, investigating the
outbreak, saying, "It is definitely encephalitis. Only the type of the
virus of the disease is to be identified now."

Apparently, the earlier diagnosis of heat exhaustion has been
discarded. One of the physicians in the current report indicated that
the cases are not encephalitis, yet DDT spraying is being conducted,
implicating a mosquito-borne disease, despite the absence of a
diagnosis. Because DDT is not a target-specific insecticide, is a
stable, bioaccumulative organochlorine compound with potential adverse
environmental effects, the wisdom of its use in area application in
the absence of a diagnosis is questionable. If this is a Japanese
encephalitis outbreak, the _Culex_ mosquito vectors are almost
certainly widespread and likely to be abundant, hence difficult to
control with ground spraying of insecticides.

The current report mentions that physicians will be visiting villages
and vaccinating people, but does not mention which vaccines will be
applied (perhaps Japanese encephalitis virus vaccines?). ProMED-mail
would appreciate receiving more information about the results of the
laboratory tests and the establishment of a definitive diagnosis in
patients and presence of virus in the putative mosquito vectors.
