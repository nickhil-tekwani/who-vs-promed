[Regarding the] report of an 'undiagnosed potato disease' called 'potato cancer [ProMED-mail post 20121119.1414862]:

This expression is not usual in English, but is [likely to be] the English translation of 'Kartoffelkrebs', the German name for potato wart due to _Synchytrium endobioticum_ (http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartoffelkrebs).

[We are most grateful to Dr Andrivon for this plausible explanation of the term used in the original report (ProMED-mail post 20121119.1414862).

Potato wart disease caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_ is considered one of the most important pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and also reported from a number of other locations. The pathogen can be spread with soil and infected potato tubers and can survive in soil for up to 40 years. It has been included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). For more information on potato wart, see links and previous ProMED-mail posts listed below.

Diagnosis of potato wart generally requires laboratory confirmation as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens. The suggestion above therefore still needs diagnostic verification.
