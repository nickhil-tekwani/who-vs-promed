North-East Provincial Ministry of Health has warned of a major outbreak of
dengue fever in Trincomalee and its suburbs if prompt steps are not taken
to remove accumulated garbage immediately. "Our survey has revealed that
dengue vector mosquito density is significantly high in all parts
Trincomalee town," said provincial health ministry officials in a letter to
Provincial Chief Secretary.
Trincomalee is top on the list of 48 urban areas identified island-wide by
the Central health Ministry and being considered as a high risk for the
outbreak of dengue fever, NEPC health officials said. Recently 3 persons
affected by dengue fever were detected by health inspectors in the
Trincomalee town and admitted in the hospital.
Dengue vector mosquitoes are plentiful in the surroundings of almost all
schools in the town and its suburbs, according to a survey conducted by the
health officials. Schools' administrations have been asked to clear
accumulated garbage from their premises immediately.
2 local government authorities, Trincomalee Urban Council and Trincomalee
Pradesiya Sabahas, say they need additional funds to remove accumulated
garbage, as they are in short supply of vehicles and manpower. The extent
of the urban council limit of the Trincomalee town is nearly 7.8 sq km, and
the population is about 100 000. About 15 000 residential units and 525
commercial units are located in Trincomalee. The town is densely populated
and residential units are congested, health officials in a survey said.
According to health officials, 50 000 kg of garbage is removed daily from
the Trincomalee town alone but the production is about 80 000 kg. Every day
about 30 000 kg of garbage is accumulated.
Trincomalee Urban Council, which has its office in the town itself, has
requested the provincial health authorities for special found to remove the
accumulated garbage. Trincomalee Pradesiya Sabah, which has its
administrative office in Uppuveli, about 3 km north of Trincomalee town,
covers 3 villages: Palaiyootu, Chinabay and Uppuveli. It also wants funds
for the removal of accumulated garbage.

Dengue fever serotype 1, which [had been absent from] Sinaloa, surprisingly
reappeared, and caused 3 confirmed cases of the disease.
This situation, according to Health Secretary, Dr. Ernesto
Echevarria-Aispuro, means a health alert, since other 20 cases suspected to
be dengue fever occurred during this month in Sinaloa State. Confirmed
cases, he said, are from Navolato, Culiac , and El Rosario. The
Epidemiological Surveillance National System sent guidelines in order to
strengthen the effort against this _Aedes aegypti_ threat, Dr Echevarria
confirmed. He also pointed out that the greatest danger with serotype 1 is
that it did not occur in Sinaloa for more than 8 years, consequently, there
is a whole generation that had not developed antibodies against it. He
explained that this means a high likelihood for the occurrence of cases of
dengue hemorrhagic fever, since the majority of Sinaloan people have been
exposed to dengue serotypes 2 and 3.
Dr. Echevarria clarified that there is no difference with respect to the
effects from one serotype to another, but each one can cause the disease
only once in a lifetime of any person. In other words, when a person is
infected by a determined dengue fever serotype (there are 4), this person
acquires immunity against this specific serotype, but not against the other 3.
This is the reason why so many Sinaloans are at risk for developing
serotype 1 dengue fever; which, according to the epidemiological studies by
Health Secretariat, is currently circulating in the state. Apparently the
occurrence of this serotype may be a consequence of the increased presence
of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in the southeast area of the country after
devastation caused by hurricanes Stan and Wilma, he commented. He said that
this is a mere supposition, but this is not [unreasonable] because of the
intensive migration occurring in Sinaloa.
There is justified fear that this year the frequency of dengue fever may
have a sharp increase in the state, Dr. Echevarria warned, so he urged the
population to take extreme preventive and mosquito eradication measures,
especially cleaning yards and roofs and using abate in water reservoirs.
It has also been proven that the mosquito is resistant to cold
temperatures, he pointed out. At temperatures below 15 degrees (Centigrade)
it becomes lethargic and stops reproducing itself with the same intensity
compared to being in a warm environment; nevertheless, _Aedes aegypti_ lays
its eggs, which may remain dormant for years, waiting for a single drop of
water that may trigger their development.
The Health Secretariat is already designing an attack plan against the
mosquito, though this plan will have to be reinforced and urgently
implemented, Dr. Echevarria affirmed. He also pointed out that, according
to directions given by State Governor, Mr. Jesus Aguilar-Padilla, there is
a permanent program against dengue fever, and this year fumigation and
abate-use campaigns will be intensified, and blood bank supplies will be
assured in case of any emergency.
Sinaloan people are in danger because of an outbreak that might have
serious consequences, if people do not become aware of cleanliness and
eliminating rubbish, he added. So, it is the responsibility of everybody,
both authorities and society, to prevent dengue fever from becoming a
health problem once again, he concluded. The presence of a new and
dangerous dengue serotype and _Aedes aegypti_ proliferation alerted the
health sector. Because of concern for the likelihood of a new outbreak of
hemorrhagic dengue fever, programs for fighting this infection are already
active. Health Secretary, Dr. Alberto Echevarria-Aispuro, announced that
already 3 persons have been infected with dengue serotype 1 in Vaolato,
Culiacan, and Rosario. It is suspected that this new variety comes from the
southeast, as a consequence of hurricanes Stan and Wilma. The officer urged
the population to take every preventive measure in order to eliminate
mosquito breeding sites.

At least 2 people have died in a spreading outbreak of dengue fever in Rio
de Janeiro in the past 5 weeks, authorities said on Thursday, as the city
prepared for its famed annual February Carnival celebration.
With the number of cases rising sharply in 2 districts of Brazil's
2nd-biggest city, health officials fear a repeat of a 2002 epidemic that
killed more than 100.
They said an autopsy showed a 45-year-old woman died this month [January
2006] from dengue and doctors were analyzing 2 more deaths possibly related
to the disease. Dengue also killed a 52-year-old man in late December 2005,
when the outbreak started.
Health authorities in Rio said 217 people had contracted dengue so far this
month [January 2006], nearly 4 times the amount for all of January 2005.
"We have a very localized hyperepidemic in 2 Rio districts," Aloysio
Ribeiro, head of Rio State government's Epidemiology Vigilance Center, told
Reuters.
"We are doing everything to contain it there, and we think we started
containment measures in the nick of time, but there is still a chance that
the outbreak may explode, as mosquitoes can fly far," he said.
The affected districts include Barra da Tijuca, an upscale oceanside
neighborhood, and the humbler Jacarepagua area.
Dengue is carried by mosquitoes and causes severe muscle and joint pain,
high fever and headaches. Larvae breed in stagnant water collected in
various containers, from abandoned swimming pools to empty flowerpots and
car tires.
On Thursday, 600 firefighters joined local and state health service workers
inspecting houses and yards to find and destroy larvae. Vehicle-mounted
insecticide sprayers were also out.
The outbreak hit as the popular city prepared for hundreds of thousands of
visitors for its annual pre-Lenten Carnival.
Because dengue is common in the area, residents are more likely to contract
more than one of its 4 strains, increasing the chance of a potentially
deadly hemorrhagic form of the disease, health officials said.
A total of 134 Brazilians [case fatality rate of 18.1 per 100 000] died
from that type of dengue in 2002, 80 percent [592 000 cases] of them in Rio
state. About 740 000 people contracted dengue across the country that year.

The mosquito-born disease dengue fever has resurfaced in north Queensland.
4 probable cases of dengue were identified yesterday in Townsville, just a
month [in 2005] after the city's last outbreak was declared over.
Damien Farrington from the Tropical Public Health Unit says investigations
are already under way because the disease can spread quickly.
"We actually have had teams out on the ground doing houses around the
suspect cases and we have notified the Townsville City Council because
these cases are in Cranbrook in Townsville city and they will also be going
out and doing houses," he said.
18 people were infected in the last outbreak of dengue fever in Townsville.

4 probable cases of the mosquito-borne disease, all from the same Cranbrook
household, were reported yesterday. Townsville residents are being urged to
brace for a possible dengue outbreak.
The potentially fatal fever, carried by the 'cockroach of all mosquitoes',
has no vaccine and no cure.
Townsville City Council Environmental Health acting director Damien
Farrington urged residents in the Cranbrook area to take immediate action
to avoid contracting dengue fever.
"We will undertake an immediate search of the area surrounding the house,"
Mr Farrington said. "The search will be to ensure there are no potential
breeding grounds in the area for mosquitoes. A 200-m radius around the
suspected infection site will be covered to place traps and to provide
residents with advice on the dangers of dengue fever."
Mr Farrington said that while the results of tests on the 4 Cranbrook
residents would not be confirmed for a few days, it was never too soon to
warn people about the disease.
Mr Farrington said the best form of control was to clean up mosquito
breeding hot spots around the home. "Obviously the recent rain will provide
a better breeding environment for mosquitoes," he said. "Townsville
residents need to take immediate action to prevent a dengue outbreak."
Dengue does not occur naturally in North Queensland, but the dengue
mosquito is common, and outbreaks can occur when the virus is transmitted
to the local mosquito population by infected international travellers or
residents.
"These people have no recent travel history, so it appears these are all
local transmissions," he said. "The virus was most likely bought into the
city from someone who has recently been overseas. We may see other cases of
dengue appearing in random areas around the city. Residents in the
Cranbrook and Kirwan areas should be on alert. We will be leaving calling
cards at all the homes we visit."
A far northern woman died from dengue fever last year [2005], with 18
people confirmed with the disease in Townsville in 2005.
In 1992-93 there was an epidemic in Townsville with 900 people infected.
There were 58 cases in Townsville during a 2003-04 outbreak.
The dengue mosquito does not breed in rivers, swamps, creeks or mangroves
and does not travel far from breeding sites.
To avoid being bitten, residents are urged to use insect repellants,
plug-in zappers, to screen sleeping and living areas, and use cockroach
surface sprays indoors in dark places such as behind cupboards and under beds.
Symptoms include a sudden onset of fever lasting 3-7 days, intense
headache, muscle and joint pain, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, a
fine rash as fever subsides, severe itching, minor bleeding in the nose or
gums and extreme fatigue. People with these symptoms are urged to see a doctor.
Dengue is most common in older children and adults.
