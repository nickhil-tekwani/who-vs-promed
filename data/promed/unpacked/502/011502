Around the same time that an unexplained event wiped out 95% of sea-dwelling life off the coast of Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka peninsula earlier this month [October 2020], a yellow foam covered an area of water so large it could be seen from space.

That's the clue prompting some of Russia's leading marine biologists to blame the catastrophe on a harmful algae bloom, a rapid growth of naturally occurring algae that can produce toxins lethal for marine life and even humans.

"From my point of view in this case, the version of harmful algal bloom looks more reliable than chemical pollution," Yulia Polyak, a senior scientist at the Scientific Research Center for Ecological Safety at the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, told The Moscow Times.

Over a week after locals grabbed national attention by posting shocking images of dead marine animals on Khalaktyrsky Beach on Russia's Pacific Coast, experts are still trying to pinpoint the cause of the mysterious mass die-off.

Scientists have ruled out a volcano-related earthquake, while Kamchatka region governor Vladimir Solodov has rejected a popular explanation that it could have been caused by rocket fuel leaking into the water from a nearby military base. He said a laboratory in Moscow did not find the chemical unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine in the water, which would have been present if there had been spillage.

Solodov has nonetheless said that he believes the most likely explanation is a spill of some sort of man-made toxin. Tests have shown petroleum levels 4 times higher than usual and phenol levels 2.5 times above the norm. On Wednesday [7 Oct 2020], Russia's Investigative Committee opened a criminal case linking the pollution to the disaster.

Those levels of petroleum products in the water, though, "are unlikely to lead to such catastrophic consequences," said Polyak, who believes investigators should be testing the water and the dead animals for "microalgae toxins."

On Thursday [8 Oct 2020], Russia's Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources said it had not found any toxic substances in the water.

Scientists say lethal algae blooms are becoming more common and increasingly toxic worldwide as a result of climate change. In Florida, an algae bloom that ended last year [2020] killed 589 sea turtles, 127 dolphins, and over 100 manatees.

Russia's meteorological service Roshydromet for the Ministry of Natural Resources said in a report on the disaster seen by the VTimes news website that "even a sharp release of some metal from an unknown source would hardly cause poisoning over such a vast area."

The document, according to VTimes, also mentions harmful algae blooms, noting that one in the same area in the 1980s led to a mass die-off of fish.

"A feature of this cause of death is the almost unlimited affected water area, since phytoplankton blooms can cover very large areas," the report says.

Another clue, Polyak said, may be the symptoms local surfers began reporting in mid-September 2020 before the dead animals started turning up on shore, including burns to the eyes, scratchy throats, and nausea.

According to the U.S.' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms in humans exposed to harmful algae blooms include skin, eye, nose, or throat irritation; stomach pain; headaches; neurological symptoms such as muscle twitches; vomiting; and diarrhea.

That Russian authorities are looking so thoroughly at what took place is a credit to the surfers who 1st reported those symptoms. When dead crabs, fish, octopuses and sea urchins, among other marine animals, began washing up on shore late last month [September 2020], they called for governor Solodov to respond.

Not all government bodies took the problem seriously at first. Kamchatka's Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology responded with a video of its own captioned: "The color of the water is normal, the smell of the air is regular, the beach is absolutely clean."

In response, local surfer Anton Morozov sent a message and photos of the dead marine life to popular blogger Yury Dud, who posted it to his nearly 4.5 million followers on Instagram.

"A month has already passed," Morovov wrote in the message. "There was no reaction to prevent the disaster and save the situation."

Solodov has since revved into action, inviting journalists and locals to regular updates and discussions, said Katya Dyba, 30, who works at the local Snowave Surf School and helped bring the disaster to national attention.

"We have to admit the investigation is happening quite transparently, which, in my view, for Russia is very rare," said Dyba, who is part of an unofficial working group trying to determine the cause of the disaster. "I think our work in making a big fuss about it played a big role."

She also noted the unofficial working group is getting support from all over the country. "People from all over are sending us useful information," she said. "Clearly, this topic struck a chord. You can look at it as a local problem, but it's also a burning issue for a lot of other regions in Russia."

In recent years, Russians have begun to worry about ecological dangers. In 2018, a poll conducted by the Presidential Human Rights Council found respondents felt environmental safety was their right most often violated by authorities. Last month [September 2020], 22% of respondents to a poll published by the independent Levada Center pollster said that the problem that most concerned them was the deteriorating environment, above rising prices, poverty, and corruption. And when Levada earlier this year [2020] asked respondents to identify humanity's greatest threats in the 21st century, 48% named environmental pollution...

[The photos attached to the original article, the symptoms in the surfers, and the marine life deaths make me think the situation is due to a toxic algae. There are a number of organisms causing these algal blooms. The specific organism may depend upon the temperatures of the water, the available nutrients, etc. At this point, it is not possible to ascertain which algae may be involved.

The fact that some chemicals were found may have a profound influence on the organism and cause them to react differently, such as producing yellow foam instead of red sea foam.

"Harmful algal blooms, or HABs, occur when colonies of algae -- simple plants that live in the sea and freshwater -- grow out of control and produce toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals and birds. The human illnesses caused by HABs, though rare, can be debilitating or even fatal.

Ranging from microscopic, single-celled organisms to large seaweeds, algae are simple plants that form the base of food webs. Sometimes, however, their roles are more sinister. Under the right conditions, algae may grow out of control, and a few of these "blooms" produce toxins that can kill fish, mammals and birds, and may cause human illness or even death in extreme cases. Other algae are non-toxic but eat up all of the oxygen in the water as they decay, clog the gills of fish and invertebrates, or smother corals and submerged aquatic vegetation. Still others discolor water, form huge, smelly piles on beaches or contaminate drinking water. Collectively, these events are called harmful algal blooms, or HABs.

These blooms are a national concern because they affect not only the health of people and marine ecosystems, but also the "health" of our economy, especially coastal communities dependent on the income of jobs generated through fishing and tourism.

Studies show that many algal species flourish when wind and water currents are favorable. In other cases, HABs may be linked to "overfeeding." This occurs when nutrients (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen) from sources such as lawns and agriculture flow into bays, rivers, and the sea, and build up at a rate that "overfeeds" the algae that exist normally in the environment. Some HABs appear in the aftermath of natural phenomena like sluggish water circulation, unusually high water temperatures, and extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and drought.

Although all coastal areas experience HABs, different organisms live in different places and cause different problems. Other factors, such as the structure of the coast, runoff, oceanography, and other organisms in the water, can also change the scope and severity of HAB impacts."

Any additional information from a knowledgeable source on the cause(s) of the die-off as well as the results of any testing done would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.JH
