Malaria outbreak in Osh region (Kyrgyzstan)
------------------------------------------------
According to Osh oblast center on state epidemiological surveillance, from
25 Aug to 1 Sep 2004, 40 cases of malaria were registered in Aravan rayon
of Osh region. There were 52 cases registered in the whole Osh region.
Altogether in Kyrgyzstan there were 100 cases registered.
It is already time to talk about epidemics of malaria in Kyrgyzstan. The
situation with malaria started to worsen in 2002, when there were 2400
registered cases, while in 2001 there were only a few cases. In 2003, only
480 cases were recorded due to improved management of this disease. In
2003, according to the predictions of the Sanitary Epidemiological
Surveillance Center, an acute rise in infections can be expected. One of
the reasons for such a rise is active migration from bordering Tajikistan,
where there were 1/2 million malaria cases (according to unofficial
statistics).

[ProMED commented extensively on a single _P.falciparum_ malaria case in
Kyrgyzstan on 15 Aug 2004 [Malaria, falciparum - Kyrgyzstan (Osh)
20040815.2263]. According to ProMED sources the current outbreak is also
_Plasmodium falciparum_. If this is confirmed it is the first known larger
outbreak of falciparum malaria north of Afghanistan for decades and with so
many cases it must be autochthonous i.e. local transmission and local
reservoir. - Mod.EP]
