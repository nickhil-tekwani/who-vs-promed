Viscera samples of dead monkeys, collected from Shantigrama in Koppa taluk in Chikkamagaluru district, have tested positive to Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD).

The ticks from 10 different places in Koppa taluk, including Shantigramma, Heruru and Kunduru, were collected and sent to the laboratory. The presence of KFD virus was confirmed in the samples of infected ticks collected from Shantigrama.

District Surveillance Officer Dr. Manjunath said that the ticks collected during December [2019] were sent to the Viral Diagnostic Laboratory in Shivamogga. The report, confirming the presence of KFD virus, reached them on [9 Jan 2020], he said. The outbreak of KFD begins from January. Vaccination is being given to people residing in Malnad, where the infected ticks were found. Awareness is being created on the precautionary measures. People who come across dead monkeys should immediately alert the health department, he said.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was 1st identified in 1957 after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka State, India. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

The above report indicates that infected ticks have been found in the areas that have reported KFD, and the presence of the virus indicates that the risk is still present. Treating forest floor with gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane can control tick population. Tick repellents such as N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP) oil can be used to avoid tick bites. Injection of ivermectin to the cattle post-monsoon in September/October may reduce the tick burden on cattle stocks. Since 1990, in all KFD-endemic areas of Karnataka, the State government has initiated a vaccination campaign using formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine. Vaccination is usually carried out within a range of 5 km (3.1 mi) of the affected area. The schedule for vaccine is 2 doses at baseline and one month to all persons aged 7-65 years and with a booster dose at 6-9 months. Vaccine efficacy was low with 62.4% for first 2 doses and 82.9% with booster dose after receiving the first 2 doses. Hence, there is a need for booster doses annually for 5 years. There is an urgent need to understand the validity of the current vaccination schedule and look for reasons for poor vaccine effectiveness (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206778/?report=printable). - Mod.UBA
