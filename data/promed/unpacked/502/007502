---------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are 1350 lactating animals, bulk milk testing may not be effective at early detection of brucellosis because of the dilution factor. If I remember correctly, there is a maximum number of animals that should be included in the pooled sample (that is, the bulk milk) and I think I remember that this was around 250. 12 per cent infection would seem to breach this 1-in-250 detection level, but it may be some time since the last bulk milk test. It is possible that pooled samples are taken from sub-groups of cattle but if not, this might be at least a partial explanation.

[Nic Honhold's comment on the bulk milk testing sensitivity is appreciated. In the referenced posting we addressed the need to review the history of the testing regime in the affected herd. Such information, as well as details of the sampling regime applied in this and other dairy herds in Israel, is requested. In particular, concerning the adjustments applied to compensate for the dilution factor from bulk milk samples from large herds. - Mod.AS
