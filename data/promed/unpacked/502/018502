Doctors fear outbreak of 'Awakenings' disease
British doctors have discovered 4 new cases of a mysterious disease which
swept the world in the Twenties, affected five million people and killed
one million. Tens of thousands were left in a seemingly permanent and
bizarre twilight state.
Some patients developed psychosis combined with jerky movements similar to
Parkinson's disease. Others are unable to talk, have uncontrolled eye
movement, or become frozen in statue-like poses, while others suffer
extraordinary body movements with hallucinations. The last new cases were
reported in 1928.
Now, Dr. Stavia Blunt, a neurologist at Charing Cross Hospital, London, has
recorded four cases in the past five years.
It has never been established whether encephalitis lethargica -- the Sleepy
Plague -- was caused by a virus, was the result of the influenza epidemic
that swept the globe at the end of the First World War, or if there was a
genetic link.
John Oxford, professor of virology at the Royal London Hospital, recently
discovered in the vaults of his hospital samples of brain taken from
patients who died in the Twenties from encephalitis lethargica. Genetic
tests failed to find any trace of the influenza virus, although this could
be due to the poor state of the tissue.
The next hope is a Birmingham man thought to be the only survivor of the
Sleepy Plague still alive. His sister has now given permission that, after
his death, his brain can be tested in an attempt to find the virus.
