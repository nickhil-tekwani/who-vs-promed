1st Report of Cucumber mosaic virus in Banana from Iran.
T. Ghotbi and K. Bananej, Plant Virus Research Department, Plant Pests and
Disease Research Institute (PPDRI), P.O. Box-19395-1454, Tehran, Iran.
Plant Dis. 89:914, 2005; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0914A.
Accepted for publication 10 May 2005.
Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), Banana streak virus (BSV), and Cucumber
mosaic virus (CMV) (genus _Cucumovirus_, family _Bromoviridae_ [2]) cause
widespread economic losses on banana (_Musa_ sp.) throughout the world and
have been reported on banana in different countries including Pakistan
along its southeastern border with Iran (1).
A survey was conducted from 2004-2005 to identify viruses infecting banana
in greenhouses in different growing areas in northern Iran, Mazandaran
Province (Sari, Babol, Behshahr, and Ghaemshahr cities).
A total of 180 samples from 7 banana-growing greenhouses with symptoms of
mosaic, chlorosis, stunting, and fruit malformation were collected. All
samples were tested for CMV with polyclonal antibodies using
double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) (CMV
strain D subgroup I; gifted by H. Lecoq, INRA, Avignion, France). For sap
inoculation onto indicator test plants, selected ELISA-positive leaf
samples were ground in chilled 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing
0.15 percent 2-mercaptoethanol.
Chlorotic and necrotic local lesions developed on _Chenopodium
amaranticolor_ and _Vigna unguiculata_ (cv. Mashad local) 10 and 12 days
postinoculation, respectively. _Cucumis sativus_ and _Nicotiana rustica_
also developed systemic mosaic symptoms (3). All indicator test plants were
rechecked for the presence of CMV using DAS-ELISA.
On the basis of serological tests and indicator host plants reactions, CMV
was identified in 32 percent of samples including Sari (13.8 percent),
Babol (2.7 percent), Behshahr (10 percent) and Hahemshahr (5 percent),
respectively.
55 samples did not react with CMV antiserum but the presence of symptoms
resembling BBTV and BSV (4) emphasizes the need for further investigations
to confirm the presence and identities of other viruses.

[CMV, the type member of the genus Cucumovirus (family _Bromoviridae_), is
worldwide in its distribution, has the largest host range of any plant
virus, infecting more than 800 species, and is transmitted by more than 60
aphid species in a nonpersistent manner. Virus strains can be subdivided
into 2 major subgroups, I and II (by serological and molecular methods),
but all yield essentially the same subdivisions of isolates. Subgroup I,
typified by isolate DTL, occurs predominantly in the tropics and
subtropics, while subgroup II, typified by ToRS, is prevalent in temperate
regions. Both subgroups, however, occur on bananas.
Strains on banana vary from those that are symptomless to those inducing
mild to severe symptoms. The heart-rot strain found in Morocco is
particularly severe. The virus may cause chlorosis, mosaic, and heart rot,
and is the etiological agent of infectious chlorosis disease in banana. In
general, CMV does not have a major impact on banana production, but serious
outbreaks have occurred. Bunch weight reductions of between 45 and 62
percent have been reported.
CMV has been reported as an emerging threat to the cultivation of banana in
Kerala, India, especially where cucurbitaceous vegetables are cultivated as
intercrops in banana. It is especially important to control CMV where mass
propagation of in vitro banana material is employed, as levels of CMV in
these plantings can be high.
While considered worldwide in its distribution, CMV and CMV strains have
been reported for the 1st time on bananas in a number of developing
countries recently, probably due to the availability of efficient detection
and identification methods. Disease management include planting CMV-free
source plants, ensuring plants for propagation are free of virus,
deployment of sensitive diagnostic procedures, and elimination of weed
hosts from plantations and surrounding areas to control the virus and
banana plantations should not be close to crop hosts of CMV (e.g.,
cucurbits, tomatoes, and tobacco).
Research has been directed to a program of virus elimination in the Plant
Pathology Unit (FUSAGx, Belgium) in collaboration with the Laboratory of
Tropical Crop Improvement (K.U.Leuven, Belgium). Different in vitro
techniques, including thermotherapy, chemotherapy, electrotherapy or
meristem culture, and cryotherapy were tested for their virus elimination
capacity.
