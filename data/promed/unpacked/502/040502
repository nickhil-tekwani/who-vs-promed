An epidemic of Lassa hemorrhagic fever now affecting several West
African countries, has reached Sierra Leone and so far has been
responsible for 2 deaths according to a statement from the Sierra
Leone Health Authorities issued on Monday [27 Sep 2010].

A 45-year-old woman and her 6-year-old son died in a private hospital
in the town of Kameni (Northern region) stated Dr Yankuma Bah who has
responsibility for health services in the region. He stated that: "On
the basis of laboratory tests, we have concluded that the deaths were
a consequence of Lassa virus infection." Another 7 people have
contracted Lassa hemorrhagic fever and 3 are in critical condition.

Rats are the source of Lassa fever infection. The disease is named
after a town in Nigeria where the 1st cases were observed in 1969.
Lassa virus is transmitted among humans by direct contact with the
blood, urine, and other biological secretions of an infected person.
Percy Blango, on behalf of the health services in the region, advised
that rats, which are often used as a food source in northern Sierra
Leone, should not be eaten.

The principal clinical signs of Lassa virus infection (fever,
vomiting, abdominal pain) are similar to those of malaria, dysentery,
and yellow fever, which complicates initial diagnosis of the
condition. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) between
300 000 and 500 000 people are affected by Lassa fever in West Africa
each year, and 5000 die as a consequence. Lassa fever is endemic in
parts of Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and sporadically
affects other countries such as Senegal.

[Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa
virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the
"multimammate rat." _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become
ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta. A photograph of a
multimammate rat can be viewed at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mastomys.jpg>.

About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining
cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects
several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys.
The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. Further
information can be accessed at
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/index.html>.

The admonition in the report above that rodents should not be used as
a source of food does not imply that Lassa fever is a food borne
disease; it is contact with living and dead animals and their
surroundings that provides exposure to the virus.
