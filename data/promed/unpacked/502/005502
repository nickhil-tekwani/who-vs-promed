I copied the ASTMH Advocacy Network on your most compelling "treatise"
regarding ribavirin (un)availability. A member of that network, Dr. Emmet
Dennis, sent the following response to you, via me. Thank you for your
persistent, insightful (and witty!) coverage of such pressing issues as this.

Thanks for your write-up regarding the limitation of the antiviral medicament
for treatment of Lassa Fever in Sierra Leone. I am a Liberian who is
currently a Dean and Professor of Biological Sciences at Rutgers University
[New Jersey]. I founded and ran The Liberian Institute for Biomedical
Research in 1975 and worked with John Frame from Columbia University on the
Lassa Fever problem in Liberia.
Given the breakdown of the health infrastructure in Liberia amidst the civil
conflict, I am afraid that a similar outbreak might be a possibility in
Liberia around the Zoror area. The sensitization you provided is absolutely
appropriate. Thanks.

[Zorzor, the site of an historic outbreak of Lassa more than two decades ago,
is near the Liberian-Guinean border, southeast of Sierra Leone. Why Dr.
Dennis thinks there might be an outbreak of Lassa fever in that place in
particular is unknown to me. However, no one can predict where civil unrest
(which is what people call small wars, just as mammalogists call fighting
"intraspecific agonistic behaviour") will lead, particularly in an area
unstabilized in other ways. -- Mod CHC]
