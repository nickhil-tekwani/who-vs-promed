It has been established through an investigation by Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] of Dagestan that 6 residents of Akhvakh district were taken ill with anthrax because of contact with the meat from an infected animal.

It should be remembered that on 28 Jun 2012, 6 residents of the settlement of Karat, Akhvakh district of Dagestan, with symptoms of anthrax requested medical aid, and were hospitalized. Among them was a pregnant woman, and she was moved to the hospital of Makhachkala. Today [2 Jul 2012] experts confirmed that the 6 residents of Akhvakh district of Dagestan were ill with the cutaneous form of anthrax.

Accordingly the experts of Rosselkhoznadzor carried out a preliminary inspection onsite and established that part of the infected meat was sold to the kindergarten.

"Part of the meat [of the infected animal] was sold to the kindergarten but because the refrigerator there was out of order, the manager returned part of the meat to its venders and some was bought by the kindergarten staff. They are among those taken ill." Ruslan Ozdemirov, head of the department of state veterinary surveillance of Rosselkhoznadzor , said to the "Caucasian Knot" correspondent.

According to Ozdemirov, protocols were drawn up concerning the woman vendor of the infected meat, which she had sold right from a car without any accompanying documents and the manager of the kindergarten who bought the meat; this was done in the absence of any documents or stamps certifying [prior] veterinary sanitary examination. They may be fined 500 to 1000 rubles [USD 15.5 to 31].

"The experts examined the whole livestock herd where the infected animal had pastured but no other animal with symptoms of anthrax was found. In addition the animals were vaccinated which is mandatory when the disease is detected," Ruslan Ozdemirov said.

Gennady Onishenko, head state sanitary doctor of the Russian Federation and head of Rosselkhoznadzor, earlier declared that there was no threat to the people's lives and the situation was under the experts' control, according to RIA "Novosti" reports.

On 29 Jun 2012, Magomed Gazimagomedov, head of the Veterinary Committee of Dagestan, reported that according to the data of Anti-contagious [Disease] Service, the condition of all those hospitalized with suspected anthrax was satisfactory. "4 of them are practically ready to leave hospital and the [pregnant] woman who underwent treatment in the Republican Central infectious diseases hospital has already left it," RIA "Dagestan" quotes Gazimagomedov.

[This adds little more than circumstantial colour to what was initially reported. But one can wonder at how many more people, including children, might have got infected if the kindergarten refrigerator had not been out of order.

Dagestan is on the west bank of the Caspian Sea; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/caucasus_region_1994.jpg and http://healthmap.org/r/1A-r. Gimry is due west of Makhachkala at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/17/Gimry.html. - Mod.MHJ]
