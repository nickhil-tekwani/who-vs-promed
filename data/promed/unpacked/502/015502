[The woman] thought her 2-year-old son had an ear infection when he
woke up with a high fever one morning in June [2009]. It didn't occur
to her that the tiny tick she had pulled from his arm 3 days earlier
could be to blame for his sudden illness. But within days, [the boy]
was diagnosed with ehrlichiosis, a bacterial infection transmitted
through tick bites. Cases like [his], though rare, are on the rise in
Tennessee.

The state health department reports 17 confirmed cases of
ehrlichiosis this year [2009], compared with 14 for the same period
last year [2008]. Another tick-borne illness, Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, has risen to 65 cases this year, up from 46 in 2008.

The Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt [University in
Tennessee] has confirmed 2 deaths from tick-borne illness this summer
[2009]. Both children died in June, and both had ehrlichiosis, said
Dr John Williams, assistant professor of pediatric infectious
diseases at Vanderbilt. "In [this] case, if his family doctor had not
thought to treat him for tick-borne illness shortly after he got
sick, he could have died," said Williams, who treated [the boy] at Vanderbilt.

Doctors and scientists theorize about why tick-borne illness is on
the rise, but many admit they aren't sure why the number is growing.
Williams said he thinks an increase in the tick population may be to
blame. Dr John Dunn, a public health veterinarian at the Tennessee
Department of Health, said Williams' theory could be correct, but the
state can't say that for certain. "We have no way to measure the tick
population," Dunn said. "We're getting more reports from citizens
saying they're seeing more ticks or finding more ticks on them, but
there is no real way to quantify those reports."

But, after 9 years at Vanderbilt, Williams remains convinced. We see
these cases every year," Williams said. "This is a great year for
bugs, and we know we've had more than a half-dozen severe cases this
summer [2009], which is more than we've had in the past."

All 3 of the victims' homes were within about 150 miles [241 km] of
Nashville [The boy lives in Park City, Kentucky and the 2 children
who died of ehrlichiosis lived in, respectively, Paducah, Kentucky
and Bellevue (the state is not mentioned in the article, but this is
likely to be Tennessee, where there is a neighborhood within
Nashville, Tennessee, called Bellevue, as the distance between
Nashville and Bellevue, KY is much more than 150 miles)]. "We were
later told the whole Southeast was at risk," [the boy's mother] said.

For [the boy's mother], the road to Vanderbilt began on a Wednesday
morning, when her son woke up with a 103.7 deg F [39.8 deg C] fever.
Fatigue was his only other symptom. A trip to the family physician,
Dr David German, ruled out the ear infection [she] was sure the boy
had. [She] mentioned that she had found a tick on [the boy] a few
days earlier, but German assured her that illness from tick bites is
rare. "I thought it was a virus," German said. The next day, [the
boy] suffered a fever-induced seizure and was rushed to a local
hospital. "About an hour after we were admitted, Dr German came into
our room and said, 'It's the tick,' " [she] said.

[The boy] was given antibiotics, but his condition continued to
deteriorate. By Saturday morning, the boy's white blood cell count
was critical. "It was so low he could have died," German said. "If he
had stayed home, he would have died." By Saturday night, [he] was at
Vanderbilt. 2 days later, he was released. In the end, the
antibiotics German prescribed saved the boy's life, Williams said.
Today, [the boy] is fully recovered.

"I almost feel like I owe it to the parents whose kids didn't make it
to make sure people are warned," [the woman] said. "If you see an
unexplained high fever in the summer, it could be a tick, and you may
never even see it, but always ask your doctor if it's a possibility.
I was so sure [my son] had an ear infection. Acting fast made a huge
difference."

[Ehrlichiosis is a name that is frequently used for several different
zoonotic infections caused by obligate intracellular rickettsia-like
bacteria that are transmitted by the bite of ticks and cause similar
clinical manifestations
(<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/235839-overview>).

Specifically, _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ is transmitted by the tick
species, _Ixodes scapularis_ in the northeastern and upper Midwestern
regions of the USA and _I. pacificus_ along the west coast of the
USA, where these tick species are endemic; _I. ricinus_ is the
primary vector for _A. phagocytophilum_ in Europe. Most of the
recognized cases infected with _A. phagocytophilum_ have originated
from states that also have a high incidence of Lyme disease,
particularly Connecticut, Minnesota, New York, and Wisconsin. This
distribution is consistent with the fact that the vector, _I.
scapularis_, also transmits _Borrelia burgdorferi_. Indeed, patients
may be co-infected by both these pathogens.

_Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ is transmitted by the lone star tick
(_Amblyomma americanum_) in southeastern and lower Midwestern regions
of the USA, especially the states of Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia,
where this tick species is endemic
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/ehrlichia/epidemiology/epidemiology.htm>).

These rickettsia-like bacteria parasitize white blood cells: _A.
phagocytophilum_ infects granulocytes and causes human granulocytic
anaplasmosis (HGA); _E. chaffeensis_ infects monocytes and causes
human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). Inclusion bodies, called morulae,
are visible in the cytoplasm of 25-80 percent of granulocytes after
5-7 days of infection with _A. phagocytophilum_, but morulae are much
less commonly observed in monocytes after infection with _E. chaffeensis_.

Occasionally, cases of HGA and HME are reported from areas outside
the distribution of their respective tick vectors. In most instances,
these cases have involved persons who traveled to areas where the
diseases are endemic, and who had been bitten by an infected tick and
developed symptoms after returning home
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/ehrlichia/q&a/q&a.htm>).

Symptoms of both HGA and HME are non-specific and include fever,
headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Laboratory findings indicative
of HGA and HME include low white blood cell count, low platelet
count, and elevated liver enzymes. The diagnosis of HME or HGA can be
confirmed by serology or detection of the organism with polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), but only a few laboratories are currently
capable of performing this assay. The infecting organisms are
extremely difficult to culture from blood. Both HGA and HME are
treated with doxycycline.

The geographic location of the children in the news release above
suggests that they may have been infected with _E. chaffeensis_ (see
GE Schutze et al: Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis in Children. Pediatr
Infect Dis J. 2007; 26(6): 475-9; abstract available at
<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/557493>). The tick pictured in
the news release above does appear to be the lone star tick that
transmits this pathogen.

Pictures of _I. scapularis_ and _A. americanum_ can be found at
