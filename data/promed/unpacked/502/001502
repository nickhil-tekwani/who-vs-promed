1st report of Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) on tomato crops in Cyprus
-----------------------------------------------
L.C. Papayiannis <L.Papayiannis@arinet.ari.gov.cy>, Agricultural
Research Institute, P.O.B. 22016, 1516 Nicosia, Cyprus; N. Ioannou
(as for Ioannou); C.I. Dovas, National Agricultural Research
Foundation (NAGREF), Plant Protection Institute of Thessaloniki,
P.O.B. 324, Thermi 570 01, Thessaloniki, Greece; V.I. Maliogka,
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Agriculture, Plant
Pathology Laboratory, P.O.B. 269, 54 124 Thessaloniki, Greece; and
N.I. Katis (as for Maliogka). Accepted for publication 16 Dec 2005.
In the summer of 2004, yellowing symptoms similar to those caused by
nitrogen and magnesium deficiency were observed in field- and
greenhouse-grown tomatoes (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) in the
Parekklisia area of Cyprus. Initially, lower leaves showed extensive
interveinal yellowing with necrotic flecks, brittleness and
occasional upward leaf rolling before, finally, the whole plant
turned yellow. Similar symptoms were observed during 2005 in
greenhouse tomatoes grown in areas located on the southwest coastal
region of the island.
The abundance of whiteflies on the affected plants suggested the
involvement of the whitefly-transmitted Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV)
and/or Tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV); both of the genus
_Crinivirus_ (Wisler et al., 1998).
Leaves of 18 symptomatic plants were collected; total RNA was
isolated and RT-PCR was performed in a single tube using primers
HS-11 and HS-12, followed by a multiplex nested-PCR with primers
TIC-3 / TIC-4 and ToC-5 / ToC-6, for the detection of TICV and ToCV,
respectively (Dovas et al., 2002). A PCR product of 463 bp,
corresponding to the HSP 70 gene of ToCV, was amplified for all
tested samples.
The sequences of 4 cloned PCR products were identical (EMBL accession
number AM158958) and showed 99 percent nucleotide identity to a ToCV
isolate from Florida (accession number AY903448). ToCV is vectored by
_Bemisia tabaci_ [Bt] (biotypes A and B), _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_
and _T. abutilonea_. Although there have been no systematic studies
on Bt incidence and distribution in Cyprus, it seems that it is the
predominant species present, as Tomato yellow leaf curl virus
(Ioannou, 1985) and Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus
(Papayiannis et al., 2005), vectored by this species, are prevalent
in tomatoes and cucurbit crops, respectively. On the other hand, the
incidence of Beet pseudo-yellows virus (transmitted by _T.
vaporariorum_) is much lower.
To our knowledge this is the 1st report of ToCV in Cyprus.

[Criniviruses are an emerging genus worldwide, containing new species
that have evolved over time and are now evident as causal agents of
new plant diseases. Their symptoms are easily mistaken for those of
physiological or nutritional disorders or pesticide phytotoxicity,
thus confounding their identification. Criniviruses remain confined
to cells associated with the plant phloem, and symptoms are
considered to result from plugging of the phloem with large viral
inclusion bodies, thus likely interfering with normal vascular
transport in infected plants. Both TICV and ToCV were 1st reported
during the 1990s in the United States, and ToCV has been reported to
occur in the Mediterranean countries, Portugal, Spain, and Italy.
ToCV and TICV are commonly restricted to tomato greenhouse production
systems. Fruit size and number appear reduced by ToCV infection.
Disease management involves raising and maintaining Bt-free tomato
transplants. To prevent entry of the various vectors into production
sites, greenhouses and screenhouses have to be constantly monitored
for the presence of vectors. Use of approved chemical insecticides
can reduce disease incidence. Florida producers can obtain
recommended information from the latest Insect Management Guide.
