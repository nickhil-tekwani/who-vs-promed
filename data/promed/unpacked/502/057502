1st report of onion (_Allium cepa_) naturally infected with iris yellow
spot virus in Peru

Onions have become an important export crop for Peru in the past few years.
The onions produced for export are primarily short-day onions and include
Grano- or Granex-type sweet onions. The 1st of 2 growing seasons for onion
in Peru occurs from February/March until September/October and the 2nd
occurs from September/October to December/January.
Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV [family Bunyaviridae, genus Tospovirus]),
primarily transmitted by onion thrips (_Thrips tabaci_), has been reported
in many countries in recent years, including the United States (1,2). In
South America, the virus was reported in Brazil in 1999 (3) and most
recently in Chile in 2005 (4). In 2003 an investigation of necrotic lesions
and dieback in onions grown near the towns of Supe and Ica, Peru led to the
discovery of IYSV in this region.
Of 25 samples of symptomatic plants collected from 5 different fields near
Supe, 19 tested strongly positive and an additional 3 tested weakly
positive for IYSV using double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) (Agdia Inc, Elkhart, IN). None of the
samples tested positive for Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). A number of
onions with necrosis and dieback symptoms were also observed in 2004 and
2005. In September 2005, 25 plants with symptoms suspected to be caused by
IYSV or TSWV in the Supe and Casma valleys were collected and screened for
both viruses using DAS-ELISA. All plants screened were positive for IYSV.
There was no serological indication of TSWV infection in these samples. The
positive samples were blotted onto FTA cards (Whatman Inc, UK) to bind the
viral RNA for preservation and processed according to the manufacturer's
protocols.
The presence of IYSV was verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) using (5(prime)-TCAGAAATCGAGAAACTT-3(prime)) and
(5(prime)-TAATTATATCTATCTTTCTTGG-3(prime)) as forward and reverse primers
(1), respectively. The primers amplify the nucleocapsid (N) gene of IYSV,
and the RT-PCR products from this reaction were analyzed with gel
electrophoresis with an ethidium bromide stain in 0.8 per cent agarose to
verify the presence of this amplicon in the samples. After the September
2005 sampling, 72 additional samples from regions in northern and southern
Peru were analyzed in the same manner. The amplicons obtained were cloned,
sequenced, and compared with known IYSV isolates for further verification.
Onions have become a significant export crop for Peru, and more research is
needed to determine the impact of IYSV on the Peruvian onion export crop.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of IYSV in onion in Peru.

[This is the 1st report of the tospovirus iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) in
onions (_Allium cepa_) in Peru. The samples tested were collected in 2003
and 2005 near the towns of Supe and Ica (see maps) in Peru, extending the
range of the virus in South America from previous reports in Brazil (1999)
and Chile (2005). See link to the disease distribution map for other
countries, including USA, Spain, and Australia. It causes disease in the
crop plants onion and leek and in the ornamental plant iris (where it was
first detected). Affected onion plants show numerous eyelike spots on the
leaves and flower stalks resulting in flower abortion. The economic impact
of iris yellow spot virus can be severe in Brazil, where up to 100 per cent
loss has been observed in onion fields.
_Thrips tabaci_ can transmit the virus, but _Frankliniella schultzei_ and
_F. occidentalis_ are not thrip vectors. Recent studies showed that onion
bulbs and seeds did not transmit the virus to progeny. Further studies are
needed to better understand the epidemiology of the disease in the field.
In order to manage the disease, infected plants should be removed and
destroyed, along with cull piles and volunteers. Other management practices
include maintaining good soil fertility and adequate irrigation
supplemented with good management of thrips and weeds. Onion thrips are
best managed with chemical insecticides. Although no onion cultivars are
known to be resistant to IYSV, research has shown that cultivars vary in
their susceptibility to both the virus and the thrips vector.
