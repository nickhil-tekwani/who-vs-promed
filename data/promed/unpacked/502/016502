Health alert: Kigali (Rwanda), Rift Valley fever outbreak in Eastern province
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: Ngoma, Kirehe, and Kyonza districts, Eastern province, Rwanda

Event: The US Embassy in Kigali wishes to inform American citizens that the Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture has recently confirmed an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in cattle in 3 districts of Eastern province: Ngoma, Kirehe, and Kyonza.

RVF is a viral disease that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans. While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the disease, including lesions in the eye, meningoencephalitis or haemorrhagic fever.

The 3 districts of Kayonza, Ngoma, and Kirehe have been placed under close monitoring following an outbreak of the deadly Rift Valley fever [RVF] disease.

Livestock in these districts are under quarantine and thus not allowed to be moved to other places.

The Agriculture Ministry has urged all herders across the country to immediately report any suspected cases of livestock including; goats, cattle, and sheep that show signs and symptoms.

Dr Gerardine Mukeshimana said, "all livestock in these districts are not allowed to be moved for purposes of slaughter, sell, or herding."

She said tests conducted by the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB) laboratory have confirmed positive the RVF disease.

The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.

[During its periodic upsurges (usually, once per 10-15 years), the RVF virus is known to initially affect susceptible animals which become its disseminators, infecting additional animals and, often, humans as well. Infected animals are the source for subsequent human infection.

So far, during the current RVF event, no diagnosed human cases have been reported from Rwanda. This is in contrast with the situation seen in other African countries, where RVF epidemics have traditionally been heralded by human cases, with animal cases diagnosed belatedly.

RVF is currently circulating in at least 2 other countries in eastern/southern Africa, namely Kenya and South Africa.
