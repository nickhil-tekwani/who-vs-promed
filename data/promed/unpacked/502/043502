Strictly Orthodox rabbis met a senior Hackney public health official on Thursday [2 May 2013] to discuss the rising number of measles cases in the community. Statistics released by Public Health England (PHE) this week record 41 cases of measles within the capital's strictly Orthodox population since the beginning of the year [2013]. A PHE spokesperson said the cases were predominantly in Hackney and Haringey, the boroughs covering Stamford Hill and South Tottenham, with a few in Barnet. Low vaccination rates were to blame.

Thursday's [2 May 2013] meeting was between Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregation ministers and the deputy director of public health for the City and Hackney, Jose Figueroa. It was organised by leading Orthodox community figure Rabbi Avraham Pinter, who is urging senior rabbis "to strongly endorse the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] to their communities. We are taking it very seriously." Rabbi Pinter attributed a combination of factors to the MMR vaccine being taken up by an estimated 70 to 80 percent of the community -- a 90 percent take-up is considered necessary to prevent an outbreak.

"First, the perception that measles is a 'healthy illness'. It's not seen as a great danger to health. What people don't realise is that for most people it's nothing, but you might get a person who is pregnant or elderly. We need to do that education." He further cited the now discredited autism scare over vaccinations and practical problems particularly relevant to the strictly Orthodox. "When you've got a large family, waiting times in surgeries is an issue. "There has been tremendous coverage of encouragement in the Charedi press but it has been soft encouragement. That's why I'm going down the line of asking the rabbis," Rabbi Pinter added.

There are now 41 reported cases of measles in Shropshire -- with more than half in the Oswestry area, new figures showed today [6 May 2013].

Meanwhile, health bosses across the border in Mid Wales say up to 3000 youngsters aged between 10 and 18 in the region have still not been vaccinated against the disease. Bosses at Public Health England West Midlands say from January to 2 May [2013] there have been 35 suspected cases of measles in Shropshire and 6 diagnosed cases in the county. They say therefore the total number of reported cases for Shropshire as of [2 May 2013] was 41. 5 out of 6 six confirmed cases were reported in Oswestry. 18 out of the 35 suspected cases were also reported in Oswestry.

Cases of measles continue to rise in Scotland with the number of patients falling ill climbing by more than 60 percent. GPs have notified officials of 66 cases of the virus so far this year [2013] compared to 25 for the same period in 2012. Last week [week of 1 May 2013] another 15 people were diagnosed with measles, according to the latest up-date. In the same week last year [2012] just 3 cases were reported.

The surge follows an outbreak of measles in England and Wales in which thousands have fallen ill. It has prompted a drive to vaccinate young people against measles who missed out on the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Uptake of the triple vaccine dropped in the late 1990s amid concerns about a link with autism, which has now been discredited. Rates in Swansea, which is currently a measles hotspot, fell to 70 percent, but in Scotland remained relatively high at 87 percent. Experts believe this should prevent an epidemic of cases north of the Border. Health Protection Scotland, which monitors infectious diseases, has said heightened awareness of measles given the current publicity may have prompted GPs to report more suspected cases.

The Public Health department says they have investigated 5 confirmed cases of measles in Ayrshire [southwest Scotland] within the last 3 weeks. All 5 cases are thought to be linked and appropriate public health measures have been taken. The news will surely concern parents but health bosses at NHS Ayrshire and Arran are refusing to confirm where in Ayrshire the outbreak has occurred. They have confirmed, however that the families and close contacts of the cases and offered advice and MMR vaccination or immunoglobulin as required.

NHS bosses say there is no known connection to the measles outbreak in Ayrshire to those cases in Wales and England.

NHS [National Health Service] Fife has revealed that they are investigating a number of suspected and confirmed measles cases. The public health department is working with local GPs and community health partnerships to find un-vaccinated people who have been in contact with people suffering from the illness. Dr Charles Saunders, consultant in public health medicine said, "MMR is a safe and effective vaccine that prevents measles, mumps, and rubella. We are currently working to identify individuals who would benefit from this vaccination on the back of a number of suspected and confirmed measles cases."

http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/10406932.Measles_cases_rise_across_Hywel_Dda_Health_Board_area/


MMR jabs are now being offered in Pembrokeshire secondary schools. Figures released by Public Health Wales today show that there have been 7 new cases of measles in the Hywel Dda Health Board area in the last 6 days, bringing the total number of cases in Hywel Dda in 2013 to 81.

Meanwhile there has been a further increase in cases in the measles outbreak centred on the Swansea area, where 1061 cases have been reported since the beginning of November 2012. Teresa Owen, Director of Public Health for Hywel Dda Health Board, said: "7 new measles cases in just 6 days may not seem many but is a cause of concern when you consider how this compares to previous years. The simple, safe, and effective way to stop measles is to have 2 MMR jabs. Parents appear to understand this well. The number who have contacted their GP or attended our drop-in clinic has been very encouraging. But there is still much to do. Young people, especially, are likely to have missed the MMR jabs when they were young and we know there are around 6000 in Hywel Dda between 10 and 18 years old who are under vaccinated and therefore vulnerable to measles. Vaccination sessions are continuing in schools across the health board and I urge pupils and their parents to take advantage of these."

Also, during Whitsun week between 27 May to 1 Jun [2013], the Urdd National Eisteddfod, one of Europe's biggest youth festivals that attracts around 100 000 visitors, will be held in Boncath in Pembrokeshire. Teresa added: "The Urdd National Eisteddfod will attract a significant number of visitors to the county and we advise that anyone visiting, competing, or working at the festival should be vaccinated immediately. Those who are not vaccinated and are exposed to measles are likely to catch it. Measles is highly contagious. We need everyone planning to or considering a visit to the event to think very seriously about the genuine risk of contracting measles and make the responsible decision to protect themselves and others from the disease."

Public Health Wales is warning that, as cases of measles continue to be reported in the Swansea area and across Wales, not enough children are being vaccinated to prevent further outbreaks. There have been 22 new cases of measles across the area affected by the outbreak since last Thursday [2 May 2013] and another 32 in other parts of Wales. The figures remain 'worryingly high' says Public Health Wales as only 19 cases of measles were reported across Wales in 2011.

The numbers of unvaccinated people aged 10 to 18 across Wales remains high, particularly in the Gwent area where more than 10 000 still remain in need of vaccination. On Sat 11 May, clinics will be held at Singleton and Morriston Hospitals in Swansea, the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, and Neath Port Talbot Hospital between 10 am and 4 pm. No appointment is needed.

The Orange County Health Department believes people attending 2 Hillsborough Youth Athletic Associate baseball games last week [3-4 May 2013] may have been exposed to measles. Health Department officials are asking anyone who attended either of the games to be on the alert for symptoms of measles such as fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that begins on the head and moves down. One of the games was held [Fri 3 May 2013] at 6 p.m., at the Cedar Park in Cedar Grove and the other at the Exchange Club Park in Hillsborough on [Sat 4 May 2013] at 4:30 p.m. A person who attended the game developed measles on [Sun 5 May 2013], which means he or she may have been contagious while attending the game on Friday and the one on Saturday.

The person who came down with measles had been fully vaccinated and had no reason not to be in public, officials said in a news release. They said people who have been vaccinated against measles are considered to be more than 99 percent protected and only develop measles in rare cases. Officials are asking anyone who develops symptoms to stay home and call their medical provider to be tested.

Measles is a viral illness that is spread through respiratory droplets. Officials said people born before 1957 are likely immune due to having had the disease as a child and that most others are protected due to having received a measles-containing vaccine (MMR). One dose of MMR has been required for childcare, school, and university entry for many years. 2 doses of MMR are recommended and have been required for childcare, school, and university entry in North Carolina for anyone entering after 1 Jul 1994. Officials are urging people born 1957 or later and do not have confirmation of having received 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MMR) to consult their medical provider or local health department to receive the vaccine. They said getting vaccinated now will not provide protection for this specific exposure, but would provide future protection.

A measles outbreak in North Carolina, including in Orange County, was first reported in mid-April [2013].
