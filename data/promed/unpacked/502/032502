--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The Asian longhorned tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) was reported for the 1st time in the United States of America in 2017 and has now spread across 12 states. The potential of this invasive tick vector to transmit pathogens will be determined through its association to native hosts, such as the white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_) which is the primary reservoir for the causative agent of Lyme disease (_Borrelia burgdorferi_). We placed larval _H. longicornis_ on _P. leucopus_, 65% of the larvae moved off the host within a short period of time and none attached. In contrast, larval black-legged ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_) did not move from the site of placement. We then conducted a laboratory behavioural assay to quantify the interaction of _H. longicornis_ with _P. leucopus_ and other potential mammalian host species. _H. longicornis_ larvae were less likely to enter the hair of _P. leucopus_ and humans compared to the hair of domestic cats, domestic dogs, and white-tailed deer. Our study identifies a tick-host hair interaction behaviour, which can be quantified in a laboratory assay to predict tick-host associations and provides insights into how ticks select a host.

Discussion
----------
We observed that host-seeking _H. longicornis_ larvae exhibited aversion to the hair of white-footed mice. Our finding indicates that this newly invasive tick is unlikely to select the white-footed mouse as a host in the natural environment of the USA. The findings of our laboratory-based study help explain why the recent USA passive and active field studies of _H. longicornis_ did not find _H. longicornis_ of any life stage on white-footed mice, despite collection of host-seeking _H. longicornis_ ticks in the same regions [3, 11]. The aversion of _H. longicornis_ to the white-footed mouse means there is a lower likelihood for them to be a vector of the most important tick-borne pathogens (such as _B. burgdorferi_, _Babesia microti_ and _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_) in the USA, for which white-footed mice are the main reservoir host [12].

[The full report with references is available at the source URL above. It provides an interesting approach to quantifying host aversion in the laboratory. Presumably, _H. longicornis_ would find _P. maniculatus_ a host of Sin Nombre hantavirus, equally aversive. However, apparently _H. longicornis_ is attracted to white-tailed deer hair, a species that also is a host of _Ixodes scapulars_, an efficient vector of Lyime borreliosis. Whether _H. longicornis_ is a possible vector of other North American tick-borne pathogens such as _Powassan virus_ remains an open question. It will be interesting to learn if any longhorned ticks are found in the future on _P. leucopus_ or P. maniculatus_ captured in the field as the geographic range of this tick expands, or if they remain free of these ticks. - Mod.TY]
