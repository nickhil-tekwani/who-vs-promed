A mystery illness that left 12 people dead in northern Angola late in
2006 was caused by intestinal parasites and was not a recurrence of
the Ebola-like Marburg virus, said the health ministry on Wednesday.
The spate of deaths in Uige province had raised fears that the
Marburg virus, which claimed the lives of more than 220 people during
an outbreak which began in late 2004, had flared up again in the region.
However the country's deputy health minister said that tests carried
out in the United States had ruled out such a possibility. "We have
received the results of the analysis conducted in a laboratory in
Atlanta and we now know that it was an illness caused by intestinal
parasites. It was not the Marburg that we saw in Uige," said Jose Van Dunem.
Public health is a major problem in Angola, with large parts of the
southern African country's infrastructure in a state of ruin after a
27-year civil war which ended in 2002.

[The article probably relates to the outbreak reported in December
2006 as suspected yellow fever. In these reports intestinal
hemorrhage (dysentery) was reported, and ProMED speculated that it
could have been anthrax or typhoid fever. Uige province regularly
reports cholera cases, but cholera does not give dysentery. Uige
province has previously reported a high prevalence of
trypanosomiasis, but the present outbreak does not seem to be related
to this. The information on a "parasitic" etiology is very vague, but
it could be a rare outbreak of waterborne _Entamoeba histolytica_.
For the time being the etiology is unknown, and ProMED will be happy
to post any further information on the cause of the disease. - Mod.EP]
