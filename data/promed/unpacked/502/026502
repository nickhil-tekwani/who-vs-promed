Here follow excerpts from the most recent official press release on the
current dengue fever epidemic in Fiji.
To date there have been an estimated 4,500 suspected cases of dengue fever.
Many of these have shown signs of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), a more
serious form of the disease. There have been seven deaths due to suspected
DHF to date, all reported from CWM hospital in Suva.
The island of Viti Levu is currently in the midst of a dengue fever
epidemic. In the past week, at least 300 cases were reported from the
Western Division. All six medical subdivisions are currently affected -
Nadi, Lautoka, Ba, Rakiraki, Tavua and Sigatoka. Up to 1,000 cases were
seen in the Central Division in the last week, with all five subdivisions
affected - Suva, Rewa, Serua / Namosi, Tailevu and Naitasiri. Additional
staff have been mobilised at CWM Hospital as the General Outpatient
Department was kept open over the weekend to attend to the 340 cases of
suspected dengue who sought treatment.
In the Northern Division [Vanua Levu and Taveuni, there have been at least
nine confirmed cases of dengue reported from Labasa Hospital in the last
week. In addition, there have been at least two suspected cases seen at
Nabouwalu Hospital. In the Eastern Division, Kadavu, Levuka, Lomaloma, and
Lakeba all reported suspected cases in the past week.
Dengue fever is highly infectious, and is spread by only two of the several
mosquito species in Fiji, _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. These
mosquitoes breed primarily in artificial containers around places where
people live and work.

[Writer's note: I have received a large number of enquiries from travellers
concerned with the dengue situation in Fiji. Unfortunately I cannot respond
individually to all of the requests that have come in via E-mail.
Travellers are advised that the outbreak, though widespread, is limited
primarily to peri-urban areas of the major coastal towns and cities of
Fiji's two largest islands. Most of these are not major tourist
destinations, which tend to be the small islands and rural coastal areas of
the large islands. In addition, the tourism industry as a whole has shown
concern and has taken precautions to ensure that facilities are
mosquito-free.
Visitors to Fiji with plans to venture into the peri-urban areas of the two
cities of Suva or Lautoka, or the towns of Nadi, Sigatoka, Ba, Tavua,
Rakiraki, Navua, or Nausori on Viti Levu, and Labasa, Savusavu or Nabouwalu
on Vanua Levu are advised to take the normal precautions against the
mosquitoes that carry dengue viruses, namely:
1. Wearing protective clothing (long pants, shirts, skirts and dresses like
the locals wear) and mosquito repellents during daylight hours.
2. Asking local advice ahead of planned visits regarding the current dengue
situation in a given area. This may be particularly useful for those with
plans to visit villages, or the homes of local relatives, friends or
acquaintances.
3. Choosing accommodations with adequate screening, and free of mosquitoes.
Do not be afraid to ask the proprietors. Travellers planning longer stays
for business or otherwise, should take particular care to avoid
mosquito-infested areas. In practical terms, this should not be a problem
for most visitors. Further, while the main airport is located near Nadi, it
is well out of town, as are most of the hotels used by visitors arriving on
night-time flights.
To date, there have been no reports from health care providers or the
media, rumours, or other indications that there have been any visitors to
Fiji affected to date. It appears to remain a local epidemic.
Travellers are also advised that health facilities have been provided with
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of dengue and DHF which
emphasise:
1. Aggressive rehydration
2. Avoiding aspirin or aspirin-containing products
Fatal dengue (due to DHF or Dengue Shock Syndrome) should in all but the
most extreme cases (where the victim is likely to be suffering from other
factors) be prevented by treating and preventing shock through rehydration,
and the health services in Fiji are well aware of this.
