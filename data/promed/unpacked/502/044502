The medical authorities of Kenya are working to contain the spread of a
mysterious disease which has already killed more than 40 people and
hospitalized many others in the districts of Laikipia and Wajir, near the
Somali border. A team of medical experts was dispatched this week to
Laikipia, where about thirty people have died in the past two weeks. In
addition, 10 people, most of them children, are in a critical state at the
hospital of Nyahururu, some 200 km to the North-West of Nairobi. Medical
staff of this hospital reported that this disease was probably typhoid. The
symptoms of the disease included diarrhea, severe headaches, abdominal pain
and vomiting. In Wajir, where 10 people have died, patients also complained
of severe pains in the hips and legs. In addition to the fatalities in this
region, more than 500 others are thought to be affected.

[It is unclear whether this outbreak is related to the undiagnosed
illnesses reported on ProMED-mail previously (see reference cited above).
The diagnosis appears to be unconfirmed, and it is possible that the term
"typhoid" is used in this report as a generic description of severe
gastrointestinal disease. ProMED-mail would appreciate confirmation of the
diagnosis in this outbreak. This report was also received from M. Cosgriff.
