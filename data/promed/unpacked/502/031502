Chuadanga potato farmers: late blight disease
---------------------------------------------
Late blight disease has attacked potato plants on vast tracts of land in Chuadanga district [Khulna division], much to the concern of the farmers. The disease was caused by recent rain in the district.

A number of growers said potatoes planted on several hundred acres of land are rotting in the fields. They cultivated the [crop] on about 1360 hectares in the district this year [2014]. The disease has now turned into [a] nightmare. Another farmer said the disease was spreading fast, [and] spraying pesticides is not bringing the desired results.

A grower said, though they were extremely worried, DAE [Department of Agriculture and Extension] had yet to provide necessary assistance. DAE said they were providing advice to the farmers.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers, and in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems, and fruits. The disease can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material (potato seed tubers, tomato transplants), and fungicide sprays of crops. However, more virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. In the report above fungicides are claimed to be ineffective, and it is possible that this is either due to a new strain or an inadequate spray regime.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide, and seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries as an important part of PLB management. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen. Clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are therefore considered vital to control PLB outbreaks in the future.
