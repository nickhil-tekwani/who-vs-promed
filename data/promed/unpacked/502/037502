Dog owners should make sure their pets' vaccinations are up to date, a veterinarian is warning, after an unusually high number of coyotes with canine distemper have been found in Saskatoon.

A total of 6 juvenile coyotes have been found dead or very sick since November [2012]. Autopsies have confirmed the disease, which can be transmitted to dogs but not to cats, said wildlife veterinarian Trent Bollinger, of the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Centre at the University of Saskatchewan Western Veterinary College.

There is no treatment for the disease. Vaccinations should be done yearly for adults. Puppies also need a booster shot.

Canine distemper cycles through populations of coyotes, wolves, foxes, and members of the weasel family, such as skunks, badgers, and minks, and among raccoons.

The virus can remain infectious for weeks or months after they've been shed, especially in cold weather, and can be transmitted by animal waste.

"Domestic dogs, if they're not vaccinated, can be exposed at dog parks ... Even if they're on a leash, they'll go out and investigate where some other animal has peed. A lot of dogs will eat feces of other dogs," Bollinger said.

The high number of infected coyotes discovered this winter [2012-13] may be a result of greater awareness of coyotes as new homes are built outside the city, encroaching on wildlife habitat, Bollinger said. Coyotes have been sighted well within the city, including downtown. Coyotes are not particularly uncommon in Canadian cities, he said, noting Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver have seen an influx. They often hide out in river valleys or parks and live off garbage and sometimes even cats or small dogs. They've been known to hunt in packs and attack sheep. "They're pretty effective predators," Bollinger said.

Coyotes usually avoid people and can be left alone, unless they're showing signs of sickness, in which case observers should call the SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals], the City of Saskatoon or Saskatchewan Environment conservation officers, he said.

The virus affects the central nervous system and brain, causing the infected animal to become disoriented or aggressive or to stay lying down or unresponsive. Some of the symptoms are similar to rabies, which is another reason to report the animal, Bollinger said.

More canine distemper cases could also be caused by a recent period of low infection resulting in less exposure to the virus by pups, who thus have not developed antibodies, he said.

Bollinger doesn't know if there has been a surge in coyote population because no one keeps a close count of them.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of "shyness", they can seem "dumb" and/or "friendly". Rabid coyotes also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date, including both rabies and distemper.
