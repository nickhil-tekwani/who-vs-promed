The Ministry of Health in Djibouti has confirmed the country's 1st case of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The patient is a 2
year old girl from a small rural village in Arta district. She is the 1st
case of human infection with the bird flu virus reported in the Horn of
Africa. The girl developed symptoms on 23 Apr 2006. She is presently in a
stable condition with persistent symptoms.
Three tests conducted on 10 May by the Cairo-based US Naval Medical
Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) confirmed the child's infection with the H5N1 virus.
Three of the child's siblings are under investigation for possible
infection and are also receiving care. Samples have been taken and are
being sent to NAMRU-3 for testing. At the request of the Ministry of
Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) is arranging urgent support for
the country's investigation and response to the outbreak. Health
authorities in Djibouti began surveillance for human cases following
reports of a small number of chicken deaths in early April 2006.
NAMRU-3 has also confirmed the presence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird
flu virus in samples from 3 chickens. NAMRU-3 has modern research
laboratories and is the only laboratory in Africa with an animal facility
credited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care.
In Djibouti, surveillance for additional human and animal cases is
presently under way, but is hindered by the country's lack of resources and
of epidemiological and laboratory capacities. The search for human cases
has been further complicated by a concurrent outbreak of dengue fever,
which can mask the occurrence of other febrile illnesses with abrupt onset
of symptoms, including H5N1 infection.
The situation in animals is poorly understood. Most of the country's
population is concentrated in the Djibouti district, where many households
keep small numbers of poultry. Poultry production in other parts of the
country is limited. High mortality in poultry flocks has not been detected
to date.
To date, there have been 208 human cases of H5N1 avian flu since the latest
outbreak began in December 2003. Of these, 115 people have died. Most of
the human cases, 93, have occurred in Vietnam, which also has the highest
number of deaths, 42. But there have been no new human cases in Vietnam
this year, and health officials are cautiously optimistic that the epidemic
may be coming under control.
Animal health technicians are disinfecting a farm in Tien Giang province,
near Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where carcasses of ducks that died of or
were culled because of avian flu have been burned and buried. Overall, the
H5N1 virus is still spreading. The total number of nations that have
detected H5N1 in either wild or domestic birds now comes to 51. More than
half those nations have found their first cases since the beginning of
2006. The virus emerged in the West African country of Cote d'Ivoire for
the first time on 11 May.
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) weekly accounting of animal
disease confirmed 2 outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in
Abidjan district, occurring among free-ranging chickens and ducks. The Cote
d'Ivoire Ministry of Animal Production and Fish Resources reported that
some control measures are already under way, and further steps are to be
taken. Also on 11 May, Sudan reported further outbreaks of disease in birds
across a broad stretch of the country, both north and south of Khartoum.
The virus has been confirmed in 5 other African nations -- Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Egypt, Niger and Nigeria. In late April, a minister from the
southern African country of Malawi told a 19-nation bird flu conference
that Africa is not ready to fight bird flu. Still, there have been some
successes in the battle against bird flu.
The OIE and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization have organized an
International Scientific Conference on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds for
30-31 May 2006 in Rome. Scientists will exchange information the role of
wild birds, assess the risk of the introduction of the H5N1 viral strain to
areas as yet uninfected, as well as propose mitigation and preventive measures.

The following report has been cobbled together from a combination of news
sources, some local to Sumatra and others international.
A large cluster of H5N1 cases among an extended family in the Indonesian
province of North Sumatra, on the island of Sumatra, has health officials
around the world concerned. Reports from the location have been incomplete
and conflicting, but the following is the best information available as of
Sunday evening.
In a village about 175 kilometres south of the provincial capital of Medan,
7 or 8 members of an extended family were hospitalized more than a week ago
with suspected bird flu. On 12 May 2006, Pengendalian Breakingprep
Penyakit, director general of the North Sumatra Department of Health and
Environmental Sanitation, confirmed that at least 5 of the 8 suspected bird
flu cases had tested positive for the H5N1 virus in local testing. Samples
have been sent to a WHO-affiliated lab in Hong Kong for verification.
Some local news sources stated that the family lived in the same small
home, while other sources indicate that they lived close to one another in
the same village, but in different homes. In any case, the family was taken
to Medan (the provincial capital) for hospitalization at the RSUP (Central
Public Hospital) Adam hospital.
The first death to come to the attention of the international community was
[a 19 year old man, the index victim], who died Tuesday, 9 May 2006, 11
days after first showing symptoms. His mother, [40 years old], had died on
4 May.
On Wednesday, 4 May, a woman aged 29 died at the hospital at about 5 a.m.
local time. Her relationship to the others has not been clearly stated,
though there is some indication that she may have been an aunt of the 19
year old man. She was identified by some local sources as living in
Kabanjahe, the capital of the Karo Regency (district), and not in the
village where the others lived, but the accuracy of this last statement is
not known.
A 18 year old man, brother of the index victim, died on 12 May.
A boy, age 8 (some sources said 10), died Saturday, 13 May, at about 2 p.m.
local time, at RS Elizabeth hospital, also in Medan. This may be the
individual identified by some news sources as a cousin of the index man, a
child aged 8. This also may be the source of reports that 8 members of the
family were hospitalized, rather than the 7 for whom we have identification.
A baby boy aged 18 months was originally reported as having died on Friday
12 May, but it was later learned that he did not die until Sunday 14 May.
This date of death was confirmed Sunday by I Nyoman Kandun, director
general of disease control at the health ministry.
On 13 May, local media reported panic in the region (but, if there were
panic, it likely was in the Karo district rather than in Medan itself).
They also reported that the 2 surviving members of the original family were
transferred to RS Elizabeth after they attempted to flee the hospital. The
accuracy of these reports of attempted flight have not been verified, but
it is known that the 2 survivors (not the toddler) were transferred to RS
Elizabeth, where one of them died on 13 May. Other sources reported that
the 2 were released from hospital, but hospitalized again after their
conditions became worse. This last report seems far more unlikely than that
they attempted to flee.
Both local and international media reported that one or more family members
originally contracted the disease from contact with contaminated
fertilizer. According to local sources, the family often bought manure from
2 unidentified vendors whose poultry had recently been found positive for
the H5N1 virus.
On 12 May, in addition to reporting 2 deaths (one of which did not happen),
local sources also reported that 12 people remained hospitalized in RSUP
Adam with suspected bird flu symptoms. It was not stated if these people
were other relatives, friends and neighbors, or just what their exact
association with them was.
These sources also reported that, worried by the spread of the disease, the
provincial government of North Sumatra ordered the Karo district health
service to sterilize the family's home along with an area of 1 kilometre
radius surrounding it. This also means culling or vaccinating all poultry
in that area.
WHO officials in Indonesia said Sunday that tests of livestock in the
village showed positive results for the H5N1 virus and now poultry and
swine in the village are being tested. No indication was given if by
"livestock" the WHO meant cattle, nor why (if it does mean cattle) these
animals were tested before poultry and swine, both of which have stronger
indications for infection than do cattle.
This outbreak is the largest familial cluster reported in Indonesia to
date. It also may be the largest familial cluster ever reported for the
H5N1 virus and has international health officials worried that the disease
may be mutating to become more easily transmitted between humans.
H5N1 has been in Indonesia since 2003. The first human infections, however,
were only reported in 2005.
There are many issues involved in getting news of this outbreak out of
Medan and North Sumatra. First, is the problem that local news sources are
all in Indonesian, which not only is a different language, but even has a
different character set (alphabet) from English. Second, the accuracy of
local news sources is highly questionable. Third, both hospital and
government officials may not always be forthcoming with information about
victims or the course of the disease.
Readers also should be aware of the following language issues with reports
coming out of the North Sumatra area: Karokaro is sometimes transliterated
as Karakar or as Karo-karo; Beru is sometimes transliterated as Boru, and
is often abbreviated as Br.

Indonesia is investigating the source of H5N1 avian flu infection in a bird
flu case which involved 8 members of an extended family, the agriculture
minister said on Monday. Four of the 8 people from a North Sumatra family
have died of bird flu, according to local tests, while one person who has
tested positive is undergoing treatment.
Of the other 3, 2 have died of suspected bird flu, but there is no
confirmation from local tests yet. The last person is alive and is being
tested for bird flu.
"So far, an examination of chickens, ducks and pigs around the victims'
houses has turned out negative," Apriyantono told reporters on the
sidelines of a Food and Agriculture Organisation meeting in Jakarta.
"But we still have to thoroughly investigate it as it's a complicated
case." Experts have in the past said that cluster cases or possible bird
flu cases among family members do not mean the virus is mutating but could
be caused by close contact normal in families.
A health ministry spokeswoman said blood samples from the 5 people who had
tested positive locally had been sent to a WHO-affiliated laboratory in
Hong Kong for confirmation. Locals tests are not considered definitive.
WHO has also sent a team to North Sumatra to investigate the case since
last week, said Sari Setiogi, a spokeswoman for the agency in Jakarta. WHO
has confirmed 25 fatalities from avian influenza in the world's 4th most
populous nation, the 2nd highest number of human deaths after Vietnam.
The virus has spread in birds at an alarming rate in recent months,
sweeping through parts of Europe, down into Africa and across into South
Asia. It is difficult for humans to catch, but experts fear the virus could
evolve into a form passed easily from human to human, causing a pandemic
that could kill millions.
In Indonesia, the H5N1 virus has been reported in birds in about 2/3 of the
country's provinces. But Indonesia's government has resisted mass culling
of birds, citing the expense and impracticality in a country where keeping
a few chickens or ducks in the backyards is common.

An unusually big cluster of suspected bird-flu cases involving 8 members of
an extended family in Indonesia is attracting attention from local and
international health officials on guard against any sign the virus may have
evolved to spread easily among humans.
After attending a recent family gathering, the 8 people living in the
northern part of Sumatra island fell ill. Six of them have died in the past
week or so, according to Nyoman Kandun, director general of disease control
and environmental health at the Indonesian Ministry of Health in Jakarta.
Local tests, which have proved highly reliable, have shown that 5 of those
family members were infected with the H5N1 virus, a deadly bird-flu strain,
although a laboratory in Hong Kong is in the process of confirming those
results. Specimens from one of the 6 people who died weren't available.
With most similar, albeit smaller, human clusters in the past, health
officials have presumed that the family members all fell ill after
contracting the virus from the same sick birds -- perhaps during the
slaughter or preparation of infected poultry prior to a meal -- rather than
inferring human-to-human transmission.
It wasn't immediately clear whether the family members had been exposed to
infected poultry. Dr Kandun said that the family had at least a few
chickens, 2 of which died recently, although birds often die in small
numbers for reasons other than avian influenza. He said barbecued pig had
been served at the family gathering.
WHO has sent an official to the family's village to investigate. "The
investigation is still ongoing. It's still too early to say at this point,"
Sari Setiogi, a spokeswoman in Jakarta for the agency said last night,
adding that this was the largest cluster she has seen. "It's a huge number
of people that are living in the same place. But the possibility of
environmental exposure is also there."
A nurse who attended to some of the patients also came down with an
influenza-like illness, although she seems to have shown symptoms prior to
treating the patients, according to Dr Kandun. She and others in the
family's village are currently being tested for the virus. While there have
been no obvious signs of poultry infected with bird flu in the area where
the people died, according to Dr Kandun, the virus has been widespread
among the country's birds. Many human cases of bird flu have been confirmed
in places where there have been no reported infections among poultry. Birds
are known to harbor the virus without showing symptoms, and cases of the
disease in birds might go undetected.
Since 2005, the WHO has confirmed 33 human cases of bird flu in Indonesia.
Of those, 25 have been fatal. Globally since late 2003, a total of 208
people in 10 countries have been infected, of whom 115 have died.
Transmission among people has been suspected in several cases. An
investigation into one of those clusters from 2004 in Thailand led
scientists to conclude that an 11 year old girl who caught the virus and
eventually died likely passed it directly to both her mother and her aunt
while the 2 cared for her.
In that cluster, however, there was no sign that a fundamental shift in the
virus's genetic code had allowed it to pass easily between humans, leading
scientists to believe this was a rare, isolated case.
