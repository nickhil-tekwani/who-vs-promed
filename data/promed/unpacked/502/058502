_Erwinia chrysanthemi_ causes sudden decline of date palm in Saudi Arabia
------------------------------------------------
In Saudi Arabia, since spring 1995, a new and serious disease of date palm
(_Phoenix dactylifera_) has been observed in the Al Qassim region (Central
Saudi Arabia).
The disease, called 'sudden decline', starts with the appearance of a
wilted, ... unopened leaf which ... within 2 weeks [kills ... the ... tree
[and by a week later, suckers are also [dead. Usually, the disease
attacks only a few trees in an orchard, ... especially ... 3-7 year-old trees.
Biological and physiological tests of [an ...isolated bacterium suggested
that it is a form of _Erwinia chrysanthemi_ (Ec) (EPPO A2 quarantine pest).
The pathogenicity of Ec ... was confirmed by artificial inoculation to date
palm seedlings.
The EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the occurrence of Ec ... in
Saudi Arabia, nor on its pathogenicity to date palm.

[Date palm is native to northern Africa, southwest Asia, and India and is
especially adapted for cultivation in hot, dry regions throughout the
world. According to the authors, date palm has been highly valued in the
desert regions of Southwest Asia and North Africa as a food crop. There are
at least 2 resistant cultivars (Roshody and Helwa) available for planting
in Saudi Arabia. The following web sites contain information on diseases
of date palm.
