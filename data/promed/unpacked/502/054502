At least 30 people have been confirmed dead and many others hospitalized from cholera in Zamfara State. Multiple sources at the state Ministry of Health told Premium Times that the state and its health agencies have been battling to contain the outbreak. An official of the ministry said those affected have reached 2600 with Bakura, Bungudu, Tsafe, Gusau, Zurmi, Kaura Namoda, and Birnin Magaji local government areas of the state worst hit.

A project coordinator assistant for Médecins Sans Frontières in the state also confirmed the outbreak. "MSF Spain is already on the ground. We have opened a CTU [cholera treatment unit] at General Hospital Zurmi. All cholera cases have been asked to be referred to the centers," the source said, asking not to be named for lack of authority to talk to journalists. "Our major headache in this issue is Bakura local government area because the area is not covered by MSF."

With the outbreak, Zamfara State has joined neighbouring Sokoto where 23 people were confirmed dead on Tuesday [2 Aug 2021] following an outbreak of the disease.

No fewer than 23 people have died as a result of the outbreak of gastroenteritis, also known as stomach flu, in some communities in Sokoto State. The commissioner for health in the state, Mohammed Iname, confirmed the deaths to reporters at a briefing on Tue 3 Aug 2021. He disclosed that the outbreak has affected 13 out of the 23 local government areas of the state, adding that over 260 people have been infected with the disease. Some of the affected local government areas are Dange/Shuni, Kebne, Gwadabawa, Tangaza, Isa, Bodinga, Wamakko, and Silame.

Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines caused by bacterial toxins or viral infection and marked by diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever in an infected person. It is typically spread by contact with an infected person or through contaminated food or water. In Sokoto, authorities say Gwadabawa Local Government Area has recorded the highest infection rate with over 47 confirmed cases.

Iname asked residents to be very careful during this period as the disease is highly contagious and easily transmitted from person to person through casual contact. He advised them to limit the rate of visitation to affected areas as this has been discovered to be a major source of transmission. The commissioner also warned medical practitioners and other health workers to stop treating infected persons at home. He said the state government has made adequate provisions to tackle the outbreak and seeking help from experts and relevant agencies to curb the spread. Residents should go about their normal activities as the state government is monitoring the situation closely.

[Although the Sokoto post itself does not mention cholera, the deaths are certainly suggestive of the disease, and cholera is implicated as the cause in item [1] above.
