Lumpy skin disease (LSD) has affected 11.2-lakh [1.12 million] cattle, including 49 682 deaths, in 165 districts across a dozen states and Union Territories in the country till [30 Aug 2022], Union Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Sanjeev Kumar Balyan said on Wednesday [31 Aug 2022].

The LSD cases this year [2022] were reported from Andaman & Nicobar islands, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Goa, Balyan told The Indian Express, adding that Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana were the worst affected states.

Sharing details of the steps taken to contain the spread of the disease, Balyan said goat pox vaccine [see comment] is being administered to check the spread of the disease in several states, including Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Balyan said that around 25-lakh [2.5 million] doses of goat pox vaccine are available and the manufacturing companies have been asked to increase the production. As of now, about one crore [10 million] doses of the goat pox vaccine are required, Balyan said, adding that the Central government has floated tender for procuring more vaccine doses.

Balyan said that Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), a subsidiary of National Dairy Development Board, and a Gujarat-based private firm Hester are the 2 vaccine manufacturers and both have been asked to increase their production of the goat pox vaccine.

Besides, a control room has been set up at the ministry to monitor the situation and the Centre is providing all possible help to the states, he said, adding that the disease will be controlled soon.

Meanwhile, sources in the ministry said that a fresh case has been reported from Andhra Pradesh even as new cases are on a decline.

Sources said that about 68-lakh [6.8 million] goat pox vaccine doses have been administered so far across the country, 50.99 lakh [about 5.1 million] in Gujarat, 5.94 lakh [590 000] in Punjab, 4.74 lakh [474 000] in Haryana, and about 3.91 lakh [391 000] in Rajasthan.

[FAO's document "LSD paper No. 183 'Qualitative risk assessment and management' (Rome, November 2020)", chapter "vaccination" (pages 29-31) includes the following comment about the Indian goatpox virus:

"In India, the GTPV Uttarkashi strain is being evaluated for level of protection against LSD as compared to the LSDV vaccine and is already used for emergency vaccination. In Bangladesh, GTPV vaccine was used in Chattogram and found to be effective against LSD."

"With successful testing, validation, and approval, the GTPV Uttarkashi strain vaccine could be a more affordable option that is more quickly available and useful for large-scale immunization programmes."

According to the recommendations of EU's (AFSA) expert panel (20160812.4410864), it is necessary to implement vaccination of the entire susceptible cattle population in regions at risk for LSDV introduction or affected by LSDV. This is in order to minimise the number of outbreaks. High vaccination coverage at animal and farm levels, should be achieved. Diseased animals should not be vaccinated.

On top of commercial cattle/buffalo farms (dairy, beef), small holders and goshalas (see item 2), India is signified by a population of over 5 million stray cattle, according to the livestock census data released in January 2020. One wonders if they are included among the candidates for vaccination. - Mod.AS]

Cattle owners, public representatives and gaushala caretakers [see comment 1 below] [have been] assured by the Rajastan Chief Minister, through online mode, [that] there is no shortage of medicines [see comment 2] to deal with the problem.

Gehlot stated he has written to the Centre [central government] that the problem be declared a national calamity [see comment 3] and Union minister Parshottam Rupala has assured full cooperation to the state.

Control rooms have been set in all districts and public awareness campaigns are being conducted to deal with misconceptions in the public about the disease, he said.

State Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Minister Lalchand Kataria said continuous monitoring of the situation is on in all districts for effective prevention of the disease. He said saving cows is the government's priority.

The minister said so far around 8 lakh [800 000] cows have been infected, of which 7.40 lakh [740 000] have been treated [see comment 2]. The rate of infection is decreasing rapidly in western Rajasthan, Kataria said.

According to the Animal Husbandry Department, till now 34 243 cattle have died due to the disease in the state.

[1. Gaushala (or Goshala) is a sanctuary/abode for cows, calves and oxen. More than 4000 goshalas are considered to be located in India. The largest goshala is situated in the small town of Pathmeda in south Rajasthan, with over 85 000 cows being sheltered.

2. The use of medicines may, at best, alleviate the suffering of animals but since LSD is a viral disease, symptomatic treatment will not cure them and does not replace timely vaccination (see item 1 and its commentary).

3. In India, declaring an event as a 'natural calamity' will allow states to use the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to provide individual benefits to the affected. - Mod.AS
