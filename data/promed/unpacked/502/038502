Ebola Epidemic Coordinator General deplores and condemns the killing of Papy Mumbere Mahamba in Ituri
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The general coordinator of the epidemic response to Ebola virus disease [EVD], Prof Steve Ahuka, deplored and strongly condemned the assassination of one of the members of the response teams working in the Mandima Infection Prevention and Control Commission, specifically in Lwemba, [Mandima], Ituri, who was also a journalist;
- for Prof Ahuka this action is not only against the laws of the Democratic Republic of Congo but also helps to perpetuate the 10th epidemic of EVD;
- expressing his condolences to the family of the victim, the general coordinator of the response, while regretting this murder, declared that this attack comes at a time when all the efforts of the response are beginning to bear fruit, with a sharp decline in cases. "At the moment, when we are recording this murder, we have had almost 2 days without any cases in the whole extent of the epidemic zone," he said;
- confirming the dedication of all the response teams, with determination and mobilization to help the people affected by this epidemic to get rid of it, Prof Ahuka assured that this kind of behavior will have no influence on the will of the people in Ituri and North and South Kivu to continue to assist teams in the response to the disease in their communities.

Vaccination

[The brutal murder of Papy Mumbere Mahamba in Ituri is a sad reminder that even as cases are decreasing, violence is still very much present. The murder was a deplorable act. ProMED's condolences go out to his family and the community. The loss of this individual who was a journalist working to make the community aware of Ebola and also worked with Mandima Infection Prevention and Control Commission, is beyond sad.

DRC confirms 7 more Ebola cases, lifting total to 3282
------------------------------------------------------
After going 2 days with no new cases, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) today [5 Nov 2019] reported 7 new lab-confirmed cases and 1 additional probable infection, raising the overall outbreak total to 3282, which includes 118 probable cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard.

Health officials are still investigating [542] suspected Ebola cases.

No new deaths were reported, keeping the fatality count at [2187].

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said in its daily update yesterday [4 Nov 2019] that a 37-year-old woman who is a vaccinated high-risk contact was intercepted at a checkpoint in Kiwandja while traveling from Oicha to Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. It added that she was handed over to the surveillance team for follow-up.

[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccine lands in DRC
----------------------------------------------
Over the weekend [2-3 Nov 2019], officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed 11 000 doses of Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccine (known as the J&J vaccine) had arrived in the country, a development that's been in the works for months as that country battles the 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak in history.

The 11 000 doses are part of 50 000 to be used in a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the vaccine in an outbreak setting. The Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine will be given to adults and children over the age of 1 in 2 doses, spaced 2 months apart. The vaccine was developed by Janssen and Bavarian Nordics in 2014 to target the Ebola Zaire strain.

Use outside of outbreak areas
-----------------------------
The vaccine will primarily be used to prevent the spread of the virus outside of the outbreak zones, unlike Merck's VSV-ZEBOV vaccine, which has been used in a ring vaccination campaign geared toward close case contacts and frontline health workers.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said the vaccines arrived in Goma from Belgium, and training on use began yesterday [3 Nov 2019]. Earlier this year [2019] researchers in Uganda launched a 2-year clinical trial of the vaccine among healthcare and frontline workers.

According to news reports, the former health minister in the DRC, Oly Ilunga, resisted using the J&J vaccine for months because he did not want to introduce a 2nd vaccine into communities already hesitant about the outbreak response. Ilunga left his post in July [2019], paving the way for the vaccine's introduction.

The General Director of the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, MD, said the J&J vaccine would be used from mid-November [2019], in both the DRC and Rwanda.

As of yesterday [3 Nov 2019], 246 627 people in the DRC and surrounding countries have been vaccinated with Merck's vaccine.

No new cases in past 2 days
------------------------------------
Yesterday and today [3, 4 Nov 2019] the DRC confirmed no new cases of Ebola, leaving the outbreak total at 3274 according to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Ebola dashboard. A total of 513 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Of the 3274 cases, 2185 deaths have been recorded. The CMRE said the 2 most recent cases in the outbreak were in Mabalako and Mandima.

Also, over the weekend [2-3 Nov 2019] a community health worker and radio news host in Lwemba, Ituri province was killed. AllAfrica said the death was caused by stabbing.

"Authorities have begun an investigation of the murder and are looking into whether it is connected to the ongoing Ebola response," read a statement from the WHO's African regional office.

"Any act of violence against individuals involved with the response is unacceptable and compromises the ability of health workers to provide assistance to communities impacted by the devastating effects of Ebola."

The WHO said that, since 1 Jan 2019, there have been 300 attacks on healthcare workers and patients in the DRC, resulting in 6 deaths and 70 injuries.

- Tue 5 Nov 2019. Democratic Republic of Congo: Ebola virus disease - external situation report 66
[WHO/AFRO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, edited]
http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/1vzv7u57fu6q720bx6nkml

Situation update; data as reported by Sun 3 Nov 2019
----------------------------------------------------
In the past week, from 28 Oct to 3 Nov 2019, 10 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases were reported from 5 health zones in 2 affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Though the number of new confirmed EVD cases reported is lower this week, compared to the 20 cases reported last week, security issues and poor access continue to slow response activities in certain health zones. This can prevent the detection of cases in these hard to reach areas.

Violence this week in Lwemba Health Area in the Mandima Health Zone caused the death of an Ebola response community health worker and left his spouse critically injured with multiple wounds. WHO and partners condemned the attack, adding that acts of violence against individuals involved with the response are unacceptable and compromise the ability of health workers to provide assistance to communities impacted by the devastating effects of Ebola.

In Biakato Mines, strengthening of community engagement through community dialogue between local leaders and youth groups may have contributed to the improvement of response activities.

The majority (90%) of newly confirmed cases are still being linked back to chains of transmission in Biakato Mine Health Area, and 80% of confirmed cases were registered as contacts. Cases with a history of travel through or a stay in Biakato Mines have been reported in other health areas of Mandima health zone, as well as other health zones, such as Mabalako and Beni. Secondary transmission in these health zones can be expected in the coming weeks. With evidence of population movement eastward from Mambasa to Komanda and towards Bunia, and southward between Mambasa and Mangina, and further south-east through Beni, all the way to Kasindi, into Uganda, the importance of remaining vigilant and enhancing screening along these major transit roadways and border points is essential.

In the 21 days from 14 Oct to 3 Nov 2019, the number of affected health areas has fallen slightly, with 14 health areas and seven health zones reporting cases. During this period, a total of 51 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Mandima (51%; n=26 cases), Mabalako (25%; n=13 cases), and Mambasa (12%; n=6 cases). Nyankunde Health Zone cleared 21 days without a new confirmed case of EVD.

As of 3 Nov 2019, a total of 3274 EVD cases were reported, including 3157 confirmed and 117 probable cases, of which 2185 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1843) were female, 28% (927) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (163) were healthcare workers.

[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/31-october-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a stabilization in the number of new cases this past week, with 19 confirmed cases reported in the past week (23-29 Oct 2019), essentially equivalent to the 20 confirmed cases the week before. The majority (63%) of newly confirmed cases link back to chains of transmission in Biakato Mine Health Area, Mandima Health Zone, including a further 3 cases detected outside of Mandima in individuals who recently travelled from Biakato.

Onward local transmission has been observed in a limited number of towns and villages within family/social networks or health centers where cases visited prior to their detection and admission to treatment. In Mabalako, 7 new cases were reported, of which 2 were linked to Biakato, 2 reported local family contact, and 2 were contacts within local health facilities, suggesting possible nosocomial exposure; investigations are ongoing for the remaining case. In Mambasa Health Zone, one additional case was reported, linked to a large cluster of cases. In Butembo, after over 21 days with no cases, 2 were reported this week. Both were residents of Kalunguta Health Zone where they were likely exposed. Thus far, there is no evidence of onward transmission in Butembo; nonetheless, these events demonstrate the high risks of reintroduction and resurgence in previously cleared health zones.

During the past 21 days (from 9-29 Oct 2019), 59 confirmed cases were reported from eight active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1) with the majority reported in three health zones: Mandima (49%, n=29), Mabalako (20%, n=12), and Mambasa (10%, n=6). As of 29 Oct, a total of 3269 EVD cases were reported, including 3152 confirmed and 117 probable cases, of which 2182 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1841) were female, 28% (n=926) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.

[3] Response
- Sun 3 Nov 2019. Anti-Ebola fighter killed
[AllAfrica, DW report, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201911040007.html

A journalist involved in the fight against the Ebola virus in Congo has been stabbed to death. Health experts blame violence and distrust in some areas for worsening the spread of the deadly disease.

A radio host who helped warn the public about the deadly Ebola virus has been stabbed to death at his home in northeast Congo, the army said on Sun.

The motive for the killing of Papy Mumbere Mahamba in the town of Lwemba, in the troubled Ituri region, remains unknown. It came as health authorities were set to introduce a new vaccine against the disease.

The Observatory of Freedom of the Press in Africa (OLPA) also confirmed the death of the 35-year-old reporter, saying Mumbere was "savagely murdered, on the afternoon of 2 Nov 2019 at his home, by unidentified individuals with white weapons [knives].

"After having mutilated the journalist, the assailants also wounded his wife before setting his residence on fire," the organization said.

- Mon 4 Nov 2019. World Bank
[Bloomberg, edited]
https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/world-bank-ready-to-spend-5-billion-in-congo-with-conditions-1.1342383
[Byline: Michael J Kavanagh]

The World Bank could provide as much as USD 5 billion to the Democratic Republic of Congo over the next 5 years if its new government commits to raising more revenue, fighting corruption, and opening up its economy.

The financing would be a welcome boost for Congo's new president, Felix Tshisekedi, who has promised a bold series of costly social programs, including free primary-school education for more than 20 million children. Last month [October 2019], the International Monetary Fund said it's considering resuming lending to the country after a 7-year hiatus.

The World Bank is offering to support parts of the government's agenda, "but not at any price," Jean-Christophe Carret, the World Bank country director for Congo, said in a [30 Oct 2019] interview in Kinshasa, the capital. "We will help if they are credible in their will to reform a lot of things in the economy."

Aid from the Washington-based lender will be conditioned on government commitments to increase revenue and improve management of everything from health and education to Congo's burgeoning mining industry, Carret said. The World Bank is also pushing the government to reduce the number of tax exemptions it gives to various businesses, he said.

Congo is the world's largest cobalt producer and Africa's biggest miner of copper and tin. It's also rich in deposits of gold, oil and other natural resources.

IMF Program
-----------
Despite its immense mineral wealth, Congo's 81 million people are among the poorest in the world. The nation annually ranks near the bottom of the most difficult places to do business. Some of the World Bank's demands will focus on liberalizing the economy, particularly in opening up the supply of water, electricity, and internet coverage, Carret said.

"The private sector needs to want to invest," he said. "That is the only condition under which we can bring the population out of poverty as quickly as possible."

A new IMF loan program would also open the door to US D1.5 billion of budget support from the World Bank over 3 years, Carret said. The IMF halted its last program with Congo in 2012 amid worries about corruption in the mining industry.

Any new financing for Congo must first be approved by the World Bank's board of directors, which already agreed to a USD 500 million program to fight childhood malnutrition in May [2019]. The bank has about USD 1 billion left in its most recent program that ends 30 Jun [2020].

Part of that money is destined for Tshisekedi's free primary-school initiative, which should cost about USD 1.1 billion per year, Carret said. The Bank will contribute about USD 400 million a year for 3 years if the government takes steps to make the program sustainable.

Rail failure
------------
"It's a governance program for the education sector," Carret said. Congo's constitution guarantees free primary education, but mismanagement and the country's tiny budget, with only about USD 5 billion in revenue, have never allowed it. One-quarter of Congo's population is primary-school age.

World Bank results have been mixed in Congo, which is still recovering from years of war.

Carret called a World Bank plan to fix the country's bankrupt national rail system "a failure" after it spent USD 380 million through last year. In 2016, the lender pulled USD 73 million in funding for Congo's Inga III hydropower plant over worries about transparency.

The development of the USD 14 billion project has stalled, as the country has yet to find a way to finance feasibility studies. The World Bank has no more interest in Inga III, Carret said. It will instead focus any new funding on smaller energy projects that are quicker to launch, like micro-hydro plants and solar power, he said. Only about 10% of Congolese have access to power.

World Bank funding to Congo is half grant and half "highly concessional" loans.
