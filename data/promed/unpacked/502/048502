Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Canada
---------------------------------------------
Information received on 28 Sep 2007 from Dr Brian Evans, Chief
Veterinary Officer, 59 Camelot Drive, Room 146 W, Canadian Food
Inspection Agency, OTTAWA, Canada
Summary
Report type Immediate notification
Start date 23 Sep 2007
Date of confirmation of event 27 Sep 2007
Report date 28 Sep 2007
Date submitted to OIE 28 Sep 2007
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence 2004
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Avian influenza virus
Serotype H7N3
Nature of diagnosis Clinical, Laboratory (basic), Laboratory (advanced)
Report pertains to: Entire country
New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (CAN-AI-2007-01) Regina Beach, Regina, SASKATCHEWAN
Date of start of outbreak 23 Sep 2007
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not submitted)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species Birds
Susceptible 49100
Cases 560
Deaths 560
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0
Affected population Chicken broiler breeder flock. The operation
consists of 10 barns. There are 1100 roosters housed within 2 barns.
In close proximity are 3 barns which house a total of 16 000
10-week-old broiler breeder pullets. Approximately 400 metres [437
yards] away are 4 laying barns which house a total of 16 000
52-week-old broiler breeders and 16 000 29-week-old broiler breeders.
Approximately 540 roosters have died in one barn containing
approximately 600 birds (approximately 90 percent mortality). There
are currently fewer than 60 birds remaining in this barn.
Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 1
Species Birds
Apparent morbidity rate 1.14 percent
Apparent mortality rate 1.14 percent
Apparent case fatality rate 100.00 percent
Proportion susceptible removed* 1.14 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population either through death,
destruction or slaughter
Epidemiology: Source of infection -- Unknown or inconclusive; Contact
with wild species suspected but not confirmed
Epidemiological comments The 100 rooster had been moved from the
affected barn into the 52-week-old breeder flock 2 weeks previously.
Additionally, 160 rooster were moved to the 29-week-old breeder flock
on 17 Sep 2007. No signs of illness have been noticed in any of the
breeder barns; however, the 29-week-old breeder flock has not
performed well; they did not peck as expected and production is not
as good as anticipated.
On 25 Sep 2007, ancillary genetic results indicated the presence of
an H7N3 virus in swab and tissue samples taken from the rooster barn.
As of 26 Sep 2007, further test results indicate that birds in that
barn were exposed to the virus several days prior to the findings as
serology titers are demonstrated towards the virus. H7N3 active
infection was further demonstrated with the presence of live virus in
tissues from dead birds and swabs. Initial virus molecular
pathotyping indicate that the virus has a high pathogenic molecular
pattern. All samples tested to date from birds located in the other
barns on the same premise do not indicate the presence of avian
influenza viruses. Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) officials
continue to proceed with the investigation according to the
Notifiable Avian Influenza - Hazard Specific Plan (NAI-HSP).
CFIA will apply restrictions on the movement of poultry and poultry
products within 3 kilometres [1.86 miles] of the infected premises.
As an additional safeguard, any poultry operations within 10
kilometres [6.2 miles] of the infected premises will be closely and
regularly monitored for signs of illness.
Control measures: Measures already applied -- Movement control inside
the country; Screening; Quarantine; Vaccination prohibited; No
treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); Stamping out

[This is a most interesting situation since it seems as if the
poultry farrm is quite isolated and the question of the how the farm
got infected always begs an answer. If the farm is isolated and near
water, then the link to waterfowl is one immediate hypothesis.
However, we should not forget that it is just one possible mode of
entry of the avian influenza virus onto the farm and previous
surveillance in wild ducks should provide some caution in this regard
(see 20070929.3221 kindly provided by Dr. Emily Jenkins and Dr.
Catherine Soos and referenced below). It would be wonderful if the
outbreak investigation yielded more definitive results as to the
origin of the avian influenza virus in this case.
Details of the location can be seen on the map attached to the OIE
WAHID report referenced above. The location can also profitably be viewed at
<http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Regina+Beach,+SK,+Canada&sa=X&oi=map&ct=title>
where it can be seen that Regina Beach is at the southern end of the
elongated, slim Last Mountain Lake. - Mod.PC]
