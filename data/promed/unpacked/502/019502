The Indonesian Ministry of Health has another announcement of a fatal
case of bird flu on its website -- again from West Java province
(<http://www.depkes.go.id/index.php/component/content/article/43-newsslider/1436-tambahan-kasus-flu-burung.html>).

This refers to a 31 year old woman from Bekasi district, West Java,
who developed symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath on 23
Feb 2011, was treated in hospital, and died.

[ProMED-mail thanks Irene Lai for providing this translation of
information from the Indonesian language website of the Indonesian
Ministry of Health. If this case (and the previous report from West
Java) are confirmed by the World Health Organization, it will become
the 3rd human case of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection, and the 3rd
fatality in Indonesia during 2011 (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2011_03_10/en/index.html>).
