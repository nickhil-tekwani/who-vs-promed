Anthrax scare has again gripped a village in Koraput district. One person has been hospitalised and 6 others have been affected by the disease in Bondaguda village under Mastiput panchayat of the district. A health team from District Headquarters Hospital has rushed to the village to provide preliminary treatment. The [7] affected [have been identified and one] has been shifted to hospital for better treatment.

According to sources, villagers dry beef for 3 months from April to June and store it in their houses for consumption. Due to consumption of the stale meat, people often fall prey to the disease, a team member said, adding that awareness is the need of the hour. Meanwhile, the Koraput Citizens' Forum urged Collector Anupam Saha to conduct massive awareness camps through veterinary department on giving up the habit of consuming beef in the villages.

Koraput is one of the southernmost municipalities of Odisha state. For a description and map go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koraput.

If the source was dried beef the affected animal may have been butchered any time in the previous 3-4 months. Also excess jerky (US)/biltong (South Africa)/uppu kandam (Tamil Nadu) would have been given to relatives, friends and neighbours, and sold in nearby street markets. In regions where a poor relative will be managing a farm for a rich cousin or sibling in a nearby town, any sick or dead animal will be skinned and butchered, the carcass meat converted to jerky and stored, and the head put somewhere safe -- usually on a roof. Thus when the rich relative visits the farmer can show that the animal was not stolen and give his relative all the easily transported bits to deal with as he likes. This report only hints at jerky being the source. The 7 affected might have been the butchering team.
