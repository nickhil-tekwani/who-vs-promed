Pickering Park carp catch deadly virus
--------------------------------------
Two thirds of the carp in Pickering Park lake [Hull, England] have
been killed after a devastating virus spread through the population.

The fish at the west Hull park will now have to be monitored for up to
4 years by Government agencies before the lake can be given the
all-clear.

Notices have been put up around the park, warning people of the
disease but park officials have stressed the virus cannot spread to
other animals or people.

Mike Brigden, parks manager for the Hull City Council, said: "We
discovered some of the fish looked sick and then they started dying.
"We contacted the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (DEFRA) who confirmed it was koi herpesvirus.

"It only affects the carp population but there is no cure. We are not
sure how it came here. It could have been passed on through
contaminated fishing gear or perhaps someone has put unwanted fish
into the lake."

Working with the DEFRA, the council has put in control measures,
including using a different disinfectant for dipping all fishing
tackle and asking anglers to ensure they dip their equipment before
and after using the lake.

DEFRA will monitor the water in the lake, taking samples regularly for
at least the next 2 years [2011-2013] and until 4 consecutive negative
re-tests are recorded, before restrictions are lifted.

Mr Brigden said: "We are making sure we take all steps necessary to
eradicate this. There are 15 percent of the carp affected left but we
have lost 30 percent.

"We have had no new cases for a more than 2 weeks now so we hope that
it [is over]. We have to now make sure we improve the water quality
and ensure anglers disinfect their equipment.

"We have to put the warning signs up but people shouldn't be alarmed
as it doesn't affect anything other than the carp.

"There is nothing to suggest this disease has affected any of our
other lakes but Risby Park in Beverley lost most their carp to the
disease last year [2010]."

Park ranger Paul Coggin is confident the fish numbers will bounce
back. He said: "The carp have been affected by a parasite which blocks
up the gills and suffocates them. It is not a very nice thing to see.

"Now, I just have to keep the water in good condition and hope for the
best. They breed quite well so I think they will recover before long.

"We have plenty of other fish in here, such as rudd, bream, pike,
perch, and tench. None of them have been hit.

"I have a good relationship with the anglers here and they will do all
they can to help and keep an eye out for anything that might be
wrong."

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) is caused by a herpesvirus capable of
inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_) including carp ornamental varieties such as koi carp and
ghost carp.

KHD was first recorded in Israel in 1988, later found in Europe and
the USA, and have subsequently been reported throughout the world. In
the UK, the virus has caused increasing numbers of mortalities in
angling waters as well as in ornamental dealers and hobbyists fish
stocks.

The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also
possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets,
and other equipment. Transmission of the virus through ova cannot be
ruled out. The virus is thought to be shed through faeces, and urine,
and also possibly via gills and skin.

KHV may have the capacity to remain latent in its host for long
periods of time before becoming active, stress is often the "trigger"
before an outbreak of the disease.

More information on KHD is found in ProMED-mail post Koi herpesvirus -
