https://www.diariolibre.com/mundo/america-latina/2022/06/09/confirman-primer-caso-de-viruela-del-mono-en-brasil/1879904


The Brazilian health authorities confirmed the 1st monkeypox case in Brazil, diagnosed in a 41-year-old patient who arrived in São Paulo after a recent trip to Spain, authorities announced this Thursday [9 Jun 2022]

The case was confirmed by the Mayor's Office of São Paulo, the largest Brazilian city, that is also watching the situation of another patient, a 26-year-old woman, suspected of having contracted the disease despite the fact that she has not traveled abroad or been in contact with possible infected.

According to the municipality, the man now diagnosed with monkeypox, whose health status was not detailed, has been isolated in the Emilio Ribas municipal hospital since he presented the 1st symptoms upon arrival from Spain, one of the countries most affected by the outbreak of the disease recorded this year [2022] in non-endemic regions.

The mayor of São Paulo, Ricardo Nunes, told reporters that the family members, relatives, and neighbors of the woman suspected of having contracted the disease are being monitored by the municipal health authorities.

According to the Ministry of Health, as of Monday [6 Jun 2022] throughout Brazil, there were at least 7 suspected cases of contagion in people residing in the states of Santa Catarina, Ceará, Mato Grosso do Sul, Río Grande do Sul, Rondônia, and São Paulo.

According to the Ministry of Health, which set up a situation room to centralize surveillance of the possible spread of the disease in the country, all suspected patients are "isolated and recovering, and under the supervision of health surveillance teams."

The agency added that it has already sent samples of all patients to the laboratory to carry out the respective diagnostic tests.

Faced with suspected monkeypox [virus infections] the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) of Brazil has recommended resuming prevention measures applied during the coronavirus pandemic and relaxed in recent months after the Government repealed the "state of emergency" declared by the COVID-19 crisis. Among other proposals, Anvisa suggested that the use of masks and social distancing at airports and flights be resumed.

The 2nd case of monkeypox was confirmed in Brazil in São Paulo. This is a 29-year-old man who is isolated at his home in Vinhedo, in the interior of the state. The information was confirmed by the State Department of Health.

According to the note, the case is considered imported, as the patient has a history of travel to Portugal and Spain and had the symptoms and the 1st rashes on the skin while still in Europe.

The man had landed in Brazil on [8 Jun 2022], but confirmation was made this Saturday [11 Jun 2022]. The Epidemiological Surveillance of the municipality, in partnership with the State, informs that it is monitoring the case and their respective contacts.

The Ministry of Health was notified about the case on Friday night [10 Jun 2022]. The folder points out that, through the Situation Room and Strategic Information Center for Health Surveillance (CIEVS), it is also in direct contact with the state to monitor the case and trace the patient's contacts.

According to the Ministry, the control measures were adopted immediately with the support of the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa), and 3 people who had contact with the patient are being guided and monitored.

Cases under investigation in Brazil
-----------------------------------
In addition to the 2 confirmations in the state of São Paulo, Brazil still has 10 suspected cases of the disease, according to a survey by the CNN Agency. In the states, Santa Catarina has 2 suspects and Roraima also has 2 ongoing investigations. Maranhão, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul Ceará, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro each investigate one case.

The Ministry of Health confirmed, on Sunday night [12 Jun 2022], the 3rd case of monkeypox in Brazil. The patient is a 51-year-old man who arrived in the country through Porto Alegre after a trip to Portugal. The case had been under monitoring since [27 May 2022], according to the Department of Health (SES) of Rio Grande do Sul. SES reported that the results were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR by the Adolf Lutz Institute in São Paulo (IAL/SP).

The patient is in home isolation, together with his contacts; is in stable condition without complications; and is being monitored by SES and the Secretariat of Health in the capital. The man is a resident of Portugal.

The SES reported that the man sought medical attention on [19 and 23 May 2022]. The patient is unaware of contact with people in Portugal who are confirmed or suspected of monkeypox disease.

Ottawa Public Health (OPH) is reporting the 1st lab-confirmed case of monkeypox in an Ottawa resident. This individual has recovered and OPH has followed up with close contacts. The risk to the general public at this time is very low.

OPH works closely with the Ontario Ministry of Health and Public Health Ontario, local infectious disease experts, and health care providers to respond to cases of monkeypox in the community. OPH has communicated with local physicians to provide information on symptoms, lab testing and diagnosis, infection control practices, treatment, and reporting requirements for monkeypox.

In accordance with guidance from the Ministry of Health, OPH has administered Imvamune as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to individuals who have been identified as a high-risk contact with a confirmed case of monkeypox.

Monkeypox virus can be transmitted through contact with body fluids, such as fluids from the monkeypox lesions, or from dried-up scabs, contaminated clothing or bedding, or through respiratory droplets following prolonged face-to-face contact. Monkeypox does not generally spread easily between people; however, since the virus has been detected in Ottawa, residents should be aware of the symptoms described above and report to their healthcare provider as soon as possible if they suspect they have the virus. So far, most transmission in Canada has occurred between close contacts like intimate partners or household members.

OPH will continue to assess the risks to residents of Ottawa, respond to the evolving situation and continue to provide updates to the public as new information becomes available.

Another monkeypox case has been identified in Wales to bring the total to 4. This news comes as the number of infections has increased across the UK.

Another 43 cases of monkeypox have been detected in England in the space of 2 days, experts have said. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Scotland and Wales have each seen one extra case.

As of [Thu 9 Jun 2022], there are 366 infections across the UK, with 348 in England, 12 in Scotland, 4 in Wales and 2 in Northern Ireland. It comes after the virus became a "notifiable disease" in England, meaning all medics must alert local health authorities to suspected cases.

UKHSA's Wendi Shepherd said the move was "key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of monkeypox". The UKHSA has previously said the outbreak is "disproportionately" affecting gay or bisexual men who have sex with men, although officials have stressed that anyone can get it. The virus can be passed on by sexual activity, coughing or sneezing, or contact with monkeypox scabs - including via bedding, towels or clothing. Most people recover within several weeks, although some can suffer a severe illness.

The UKHSA said that monkeypox does not usually spread easily and the overall risk to the population remains low. People who have a rash with blisters, and have been in close contact with a monkeypox carrier, or have travelled to West or Central Africa in the last 3 weeks, are urged to contact a sexual health clinic.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/monkeypox-cases-confirmed-in-england-latest-updates


Latest updates on cases of monkeypox identified by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has detected 104 additional cases of monkeypox in England.

This brings the total number confirmed in the UK to 470, as of (12 Jun 2022). There are currently 452 confirmed cases in England, 12 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland, and 4 in Wales.

Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. Currently, most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men.

Contact a sexual health clinic if you have a rash with blisters and you've been either: in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they've not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks.

This first publication includes updated epidemiological data, with evidence from anonymised detailed interviews with patients which are helping us to understand transmission and to determine how to target interventions. Of the cases interviewed, 81% were known to be London residents and 99% were male. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 38 years old.

There were 152 cases that participated in more detailed questionnaires. In this data, 151 of the 152 men interviewed identified as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men, or reported same-sex contact. Recent foreign travel, within 21 days prior to symptom onset, was reported by 75 cases, with 59 of these reporting travel within Europe.

We also share a preliminary assessment of the genomic differences between the outbreak virus and previous monkeypox viruses. In any emerging infection outbreak, we assess the virus or bacteria for any changes. We will be working to investigate the significance of the mutations identified so far to determine if they will have any impact on the virus' behaviour.

Dr Meera Chand, Director of Clinical and Emerging Infections, UKHSA said, "We are working, both in the UK and together with global partners, to progress the investigations that we need to help us better understand the virus, its transmission, and the best use of mitigations such as vaccines and treatments. We use the new data rapidly to inform the public health response and we continue to work to reduce transmission.

"We are grateful to all those who have come forward for testing and the patients who continue to help us understand the outbreak through participating in studies and investigations.

"UKHSA has identified a number of aspects of this outbreak which require further investigation. We will release the results of our ongoing investigations in subsequent technical briefings - these will be published regularly."

On [Thu 9 Jun 2022], health officials in the Community of Madrid recorded 25 additional monkeypox cases, bringing the cumulative total to 275.

The incubation period (interval between infection and onset of symptoms) for monkeypox is usually 6 to 16 days, although it can range from 5 to 21 days. Based on these intervals, the department headed by Enrique Ruiz Escudero considers that the peak of the epidemiological curve has been reached, although the General Directorate of Public Health of the Ministry of Health continues with the work of epidemiological surveillance and tries to reach the 'patient zero' for the location and control of transmission.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/06/cdc-director-monkeypox-may-be-tricky-diagnose


Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said clinicians should not rule out a monkeypox diagnosis if a patient presents with a sexually transmitted infection (STI).

"It's important to be aware that monkeypox cases may present similar to some sexually transmitted infections and could be mistaken for other diagnoses," she said during a media call. "Healthcare providers should not rule out monkeypox just because a patient has another diagnosis or another STI."

Walensky said some of the 45 confirmed patients in the United States were also diagnosed as having herpes, gonorrhea, or chlamydia at the same time as the monkeypox diagnosis. The CDC also said that, among those 45, at least 75% had traveled internationally before contracting the disease.

Only a small number of patients are unsure of where they contracted the poxvirus.

"In all likelihood, they acquired it from someone who recently traveled, but they're just not sure," said Jennifer McQuiston, DVM, the deputy director of the Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology at the CDC.

[A (10 Jun 2022) report indicated that in new cases, "...what we're hearing is that those [pre-rash] symptoms might be really mild or not even noticed at all," said Dr. Agam Rao, medical officer of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, during an interview with the medical journal JAMA. For clinicians unfamiliar with the virus, it may also be hard to differentiate some monkeypox infections from chickenpox -- or certain sexually transmitted infections like herpes and syphilis.

"Monkeypox can masquerade as other conditions," said Dr. Rosamund Lewis, a Canadian physician and the technical lead at the World Health Organization (WHO) for the monkeypox outbreak.

Bodily lesions tied to this virus are also typically thought to start around the head, before progressing down toward the arms and legs, yet Rao said U.S. patients have been experiencing rashes in the genital or perianal regions first, including some people who've suffered from inflammation of the rectum (https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/monkeypox-symptom-severity-1.6483488). - Mod.TY]

[12] Routes of transmission
Date: Fri 10 Jun 2022
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/health/monkeypox-airborne.html


Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on [Fri 10 Jun 2022] pushed back against the idea that the monkeypox virus can spread through the air, saying the virus is usually transmitted through direct physical contact with sores or contaminated materials from a patient.

The virus may also be transmitted by respiratory droplets expelled by an infected patient who comes into physical contact with another person, they said. But it cannot linger in the air over long distances.

Experts on airborne transmission of viruses did not disagree, but some said the agency had not fully considered the possibility that respiratory droplets, large or small, could be inhaled at a shorter distance from a patient.

The World Health Organization and several experts have said that while "short-range" airborne transmission of monkeypox appears to be uncommon, it is possible and warrants precautions. Britain also includes monkeypox on its list of "high-consequence infectious diseases" that can spread through the air.

"Airborne transmission may not be the dominant route of transmission nor very efficient, but it could still occur," said Linsey Marr, an expert on airborne viruses at Virginia Tech. I think the WHO has it right, and the CDC's message is misleading," she added.

The CDC said on [Thu 9 Jun 2022] that monkeypox "is not known to linger in the air and is not transmitted during short periods of shared airspace." The statement followed a New York Times article on [Tue 7 Jun 2022] in which scientists described uncertainties about transmission of the virus.

"What we do know is that those diagnosed with monkeypox in this current outbreak described close, sustained physical contact with other people who were infected with the virus," Dr. Walensky said on [Fri 10 Jun 2022]. "This is consistent with what we've seen in prior outbreaks and what we know from decades of studying this virus and closely related viruses."

But monkeypox is poorly studied, other experts said, and occasional episodes of airborne transmission have been reported for the closely related smallpox virus. In a 2017 outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria, infections occurred in 2 health care workers who had no direct contact with patients, scientists said at a recent WHO conference.

A few patients in the current outbreak do not know when or how they contracted the virus, CDC officials acknowledged.

The agency is right to reassure the public that the outbreak is not a threat to most people, because monkeypox is not nearly as contagious as the coronavirus, said Dr. Donald Milton, an expert on airborne virus transmission at the University of Maryland. Airborne transmission is unlikely to be a risk for anyone other than immediate caregivers, Dr. Milton said, but cautioned that denying the possibility entirely "is the wrong way to do it."

When a virus is present in saliva or in the respiratory tract, as monkeypox has been shown to be, it can be expelled in respiratory droplets when talking, singing, coughing, or sneezing, Dr. Milton and other experts said.

The droplets may be heavy and quickly fall onto objects or people, or they may be small and light, lingering in the air for long periods and distances. The CDC's assessment hinges in part on whether the virus is present only in large droplets or also in the very small ones, called aerosols.

A similar debate unfolded at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic when the agency and the WHO focused on large droplets as the main route of transmission. But aerosols turned out to be a major driver.

The new CDC guidance on monkeypox described the respiratory droplets emitted by patients as "secretions that drop out of the air quickly."

But the virus "can be present in respiratory particles of any size," not just large droplets, said Lidia Morawska, an air quality expert at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. "In my view, there is no basis to the statement that the virus is transmitted only by large droplets and presenting infection risk only on close distances," she wrote in an email.

Patients in the current outbreak seem to have become infected through close, sustained contact, CDC officials said on F[ri 10 Jun 2022]. But this can be difficult to determine.

Happi C, Adetifa I, Mbala P, et al. Urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing nomenclature for monkeypox virus

Current classification
----------------------
In the current classification of MPXV genetic diversity, only 2 clades of MPXV are recognized - referred to as the "West African" clade and the "Central African" or "Congo Basin" clade. However, these historic MPXV clade names are counter to the best practice of avoiding geographic locations in the nomenclature of diseases and disease groups. The recent and prompt example implemented for SARS-CoV-2 should be the norm. Given the increasingly rapid communication of, and attention to, the international human MPXV outbreak, it is important to consider an appropriate, non-discriminatory, and non-stigmatizing nomenclature and classification of MPXV clades. In recent publications and symposia, including the WHO Research and Development (R&D) symposium, it was highlighted that the current global outbreak was caused by MPXV of the "West African" clade. Some genome sequences on the NCBI Genbank database use "West African" for the field "strain" or "genotype" (including the NCBI reference genome: NC_063383 3). Like many previous geographic labels of infectious diseases based on locations of first detection, it is misleading and inaccurate because very limited surveillance and limited diagnostic capacity mean that the full range of the pathogen is not known. This is crucially demonstrated by the discovery in May [2022] that MPXV has been circulating in over 44 countries without detection and is likely to be present in many more.

Proposed Classification
-----------------------
Here, we propose a novel classification of MPXV that is non-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing and aligned with best practices in the naming of infectious diseases in a way that minimizes unnecessary negative impacts on nations, geographic regions, economies and people and that considers the evolution and spread of the virus.

We propose the classification of 3 main clades; MPXV clades 1, 2 and 3, named in order of detection. These include viral genomes from Western African, Central African, and localized spillover events in global north countries and from both human and non-human hosts (Figure 1A). Here, clade 1 corresponds to the prior "Congo Basin clade", while clades 2 and 3 correspond to the prior "West African clade". These 3 clades represent deep MPXV diversity, accumulated over many years of evolution in the animal reservoir. Further sequencing of MPXV from the animal reservoir may potentially uncover further clades 4, 5, 6, and so forth.

We also suggest naming a new clade, containing genomes sampled between 2017-2019 from the UK, Israel, Nigeria, USA, and Singapore and genomes from 2022 global outbreaks (Figure 1B). Since viruses in this clade have been transmitting from person to person in dozens of countries and potentially over multiple years, we propose that this represents transmission route distinct from that of previous MPXV cases in humans and should be afforded a distinct name so that it can be referred to specifically in both scientific discourse and the general media. Whilst the formal naming of virus species is the purview of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we believe this is an opportunity for a break with the name monkeypox and the historical associations attached to that name. However, we believe that a distinct and convenient name for the virus causing this epidemic would facilitate communication without further negative connotations. Here we use the placeholder label 'hMPXV' to denote where we believe this now human virus becomes distinct from MPXV [13] (Figure 1B), and urge a speedy decision and adoption of a new name.

Within the hMPXV clade there is already notable diversity even amongst the limited number of genomes so far described. Thus, we further propose that distinct lineages and clades within the epidemic are given neutral names and suggest a system similar to Pango nomenclature for SARS-CoV-2 [14] with lineages within the hMPXV clade given labels that encode genealogical relationships. To keep the labels short, we propose to introduce aliases after the 2nd subdivision, instead of after 3 as in the original Pango scheme. Under this nomenclature, the base of hMPXV would be denoted lineage 'A', the following clades would be named as 'A.1', 'A.2', 'A.1.1' and the current international 2022 outbreak would be denoted 'B.1' as the first detected descendent lineage of 'A.1.1' (Figure 1B). We urge the international community to adopt such a system to preempt the adoption of informal and potentially stigmatizing labels.

With the above suggestions, we encourage the community to adopt a principled and neutral naming scheme such as the one presented here. We believe that this new classification will be easily adopted and is supported by the Africa Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and we are in advanced discussion with the World Health Organization (WHO).

We hope that the world uses the current outbreak to advance our understanding, and provides the funding and focus for effective regional and global public health surveillance for emerging and re-emerging threats. By supporting a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing classification, we can encourage African and other researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to advance genomic surveillance, share sequence data, and minimize negative impacts. Failure to support and adopt the proposed nomenclature and classification may result in loss of interest in sustaining active surveillance and rapid reporting of pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potentials, by scientists and national public health institutions in Africa and other LMICs. Every case of MPXV infection should be treated with the same attention and sense of urgency as the ones now in European countries and North America. The entire epidemic of hMPXV regardless of the location needs to be halted, not just this Northern hemisphere outbreak. A practical and neutral system of nomenclature allows efficient communication without the risk of further misconceptions, discrimination, and stigmatisation.

[The source of this report, Virological.org, provides a discussion forum for analysis and interpretation of virus molecular evolution and epidemiology. The discussion here raises several interesting points about appropriate nomenclature for MPXV clades or variants. It is going to be interesting to see how different the genome sequences are and will become over space and time. While the virus taxonomists are at this evaluation, changing the name of the virus itself would be a good idea. Although the virus has infected monkeys and chimpanzees, there is no evidence that they are reservoir species in nature, making the monkey designation misleading. Rodents are the suspected reservoirs in Africa.
