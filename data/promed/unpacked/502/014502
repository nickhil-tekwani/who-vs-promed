So far this year [2012], 13 people have been infected with the virus that causes [Bolivian] hemorrhagic fever and 7 died as a consequence of the disease. In Beni [department; state equivalent], 5 municipalities have high populations of _Calomys callosus_ mice [the reservoir host of Machupo virus. Mod.TY], the government stated.

"For example, in the Huacaraje municipality it was shown that of the 10 rodents trapped, 8 were infected with the [Machupo] virus, that is to say 80 per cent. The places were the disease was reported are full of infected _Calomys callosus_," sated the person responsible for national Epidemiology, Johnny Rada, who was in the area.

The 1st death from the disease this year was registered on 29 Jan [2012]. This case was an adult from a rural area who could not come to the hospital in time and died; 3 days later a 12-year-old girl died and in April the 3rd victim was reported. From April up to now another 4 deaths are reported.

[Bolivian] hemorrhagic fever, know as "black typhus," is an infection caused by Machupo virus, the carrier of which is the mouse _Calomys callosus_. The symptoms [in humans] are fever, migraine headaches, myalgia and arthralgia and finally hemorrhage from various parts of the body.

Rada stated that the disease [virus] is acquired by breathing air contaminated by feces, urine and saliva from infected mice or by handling the mice or their food materials, water or places having dust where the infection is present [in the mice].

The virus is in the north, the Chaco in Tarija, across the tropics of Cochabamba, but cases have not been reported in these regions except in the Beni, where 5 municipalities have declared a health alert since June [2012] -- Magdalena, Baures, Huacaraje, San Joaquin and San Ramon.

The official explained that in the previous week physicians, nurses and health workers in Beni had a workshop about the management of the disease, as well as laboratory diagnosis on samples. For training, 2 technicians will go to Argentina.

[On 17 Jun 2012, there were 9 confirmed cases of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Then 10 days later, there were 12 confirmed cases and now the count is 13. It is curious that the above report says nothing about a vigorous rodent control campaign, which is the usual response of Bolivian health authorities when cases occur as was mentioned in the 27 Jun 2012 report (see ProMED-archive no. 20120629.1184513). However, there was some rodent trapping mentioned in the above report.
