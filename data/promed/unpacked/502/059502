According to media reports, the first human hantavirus infection has
occurred in Pennsylvania. The patient, a hunter, died. CDC has initiated
studies to determine the (rodent) vertebrate host and prevalence of the
virus in the area where the patient acquired his infection. It remains to
be determined which hantavirus is the etiologic agent. Further
information, from knowledgeable sources, would be appreciated.
