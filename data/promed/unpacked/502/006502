Doctors at the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH) are warning about a possible bad batch of synthetic marijuana in the Denver metro area.

University Hospital said its emergency department has seen more than 3 patients Thursday [29 Aug 2013] and more than 20 very ill patients within the last few weeks.

Denver Health reports seeing 3 patients Wednesday [28 Aug 2013] and 2 on Tuesday [27 Aug 2013].

Several of the patients arrived at the emergency room unresponsive. Each one of them was having a reaction to Spice and/or Black Mamba -- 2 forms of synthetic marijuana, according to Dr. Rich Zane.

Zane said other emergency rooms in the metro area are also seeing numerous patients with ill effects from the drugs.

"It's pretty clear that there's some very bad stuff out there right now," said Dr. Kennon Heard, a medical toxicologist [at] UCH.

"Patients come in and have no gag reflex and are not breathing on their own," said Amanda Puhal, charge nurse at UCH. "And we have to put a tube down their throat to breathe for them."

"They are hallucinating, they are very much not themselves," said Dr. Jeffrey Sankoff, an emergency department physician at Denver Health.

"The cannabinoid itself is not dangerous. The issue is that it's been contaminated or altered with other substances."

Synthetic marijuana hit the market several years ago, was banned and now appears to be back and worse than ever.

"Just out of the blue it's come back," said Sankoff.

"I've been in emergency medicine for the last 11 years, and I've never seen a problem like this before," said Puhal.

"In the past 2 weeks, in the hospitals throughout Denver, we've seen an outbreak of a large number of people who've gotten very severely ill," said Heard. "It's actually made in a lab and then sprayed on plant material and then people smoke it. And you never know exactly what you're getting."

Doctors at UCH say this potential bad batch, combined with a Phish concert this weekend at Dick's Sporting Goods Park could result in a particularly troubling spike.

"There have been reported fatalities in other states," said Sankoff. "In our cases, abusers have been out in traffic, they've jumped off buildings. Agitation to the point where they're totally out of mind."

"Psychotic episodes, suppressed breathing," said Puhal.

"The truth is that these people are sick enough that if they didn't get to health care, there's a good chance that some of them wouldn't have made it," said Heard.

Doctors say the marijuana substitutes sold under names like Spice, K2 and Black Mamba are typically made up of herbs, mixed with a powerful synthetic chemical that mimics the effects of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

While the packaging often calls these spices "incense" and says "not for human consumption," some people still smoke it.

Officials with the Rocky Mountain Poison Control Center (RMPCC) told 7NEWS most of the drugs have not been tested on humans and were never meant to be ingested.

The substance was created in medical labs by a Clemson University researcher as a way to study the effects of marijuana on lab animals. It has a different molecular structure than marijuana, but was designed to stimulate the same receptors, according to the RMPCC.

In 2011, it became a misdemeanor to possess the substance in Colorado.

[Marijuana contains THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, the pyschoactive component of the cannabis plant. However, the variety of synthetic marijuanas contain other ingredients and go by a variety of names. Among the names are K2, Spice, Mexxy, Black Mamba, fake weed, Yucatan Fire, Skunk, Moon Rocks and others.

Some of these synthetic compounds are promoted as herbal products, with label claims that they contain "natural" psychoactive material taken from a variety of plants. Spice products (and the others as well) may contain some dried plant material (not necessarily natural cannabis), but chemical analyses show that their active ingredients are synthetic (or designer) cannabinoid compounds. However, tests have shown that it is not a single product. For example, Black Mamba contains synthetic cannabinoid AM-2001 and oleamide and oleic acid.

The synthetic cannabinoids are not THC, but the body reacts to the synthetic cannabinoids as if it were reacting to the cannabinoids in cannabis. However, the synthetic variety can cause long-term problems, including long-term psychotic disorders.

The variety of synthetic cannabinoids is large and apparently constantly shifting to avoid detection and regulation by law enforcement. Consequently, it also makes it much harder on the physicians to stabilize and treat an individual who has had an overdose, or even a reaction to a synthetic hallucinogen.

The UK and the US have regulated a number of these substances, including cannabicyclohexanol, JWH-018, JWH-073, or HU-210. These substances are illegal to possess or use and are considered banned substances with jail terms of varying lengths, depending upon which country's laws are examined.

These synthetic products produce a longer lasting response, potentially in some people unexpected psychotic episodes for the remainder of their life, and apparently can "hook" people within seconds, despite near death experience.

Some states in the US have legalized the use of natural cannabis products. Therefore, in an effort to extend the natural product, and produce a desirable and longer lasting "high," the synthetic product may be added to the natural product and unsuspecting customers may suffer untoward effects and even death.
