Anthrax found in dead heroin user from Glasgow
----------------------------------------------
Anthrax has been found in 2 heroin users from Glasgow -- one of whom has
died in hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the man died in the
city's Victoria Infirmary on Wednesday [16 Dec 2009]. A woman being treated
there has also tested positive. A 2nd man with "serious soft tissue
infections" is being tested at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Police believe
contaminated heroin or a contaminated cutting agent may be responsible for
the infections.

Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in public health medicine, said: "I urge all drug
injecting heroin users to be extremely alert and to seek urgent medical
advice if they experience an infection. While this section of the community
need to be on their guard the risk to the rest of the population --
including close family members of the infected cases -- is negligible. It
is extremely rare for anthrax to be spread from person to person and there
is no significant risk of airborne transmission from one person to another."

The health board said it would investigate cases of drug injecting heroin
users who present with serious soft tissue infections now or [have done so]
during the last 4 weeks.

"We would appeal to drug users to come forward if they have any information
that may enable us to trace its source. We would like to reassure people
that our purpose is to recover this substance in the interests of public
safety. It is not about targeting drug users." Strathclyde police said it
was vital that if there was a contaminated batch of heroin on the streets
that it was traced and recovered. A spokesman added: "Our number one
priority is the safety and wellbeing of everyone in our communities."

Anthrax alert for drug injecting heroin users
---------------------------------------------
Blood tests from a drug injecting heroin user who died yesterday [16 Dec
2009] at the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow have shown the presence of anthrax.

Another patient being treated at the same hospital has had a positive test
for anthrax and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Public Health Protection
Unit are now working closely with the Procurator Fiscal's Office and
Strathclyde Police to identify the source of the anthrax.

A 3rd patient, who is being treated at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, is being
tested and we await the results early next week. All three potentially
linked cases presented at hospital with serious soft tissue infections in
areas of the body injected with heroin.

One avenue being investigated by Public Health and Strathclyde Police is
that contaminated heroin or a contaminated cutting agent mixed with the
heroin may be responsible for the infections.

[This news release has a useful series of informative questions and answers.

There was a similar case in Oslo in April 2000, in which one person died.
It is more common for heroin injectors to die of tetanus. It will be
interesting to learn the results of any forensic police investigations into
the common product used. As anthrax, whether in human or livestock, is now
essentially absent in Scotland how the spores got into the product can only
be a matter for speculation. However it should be remembered that Glasgow
is a port. In the Oslo incident we did not learn the outcome of the
Norwegian police investigation. - Mod.MHJ
