FBI: Confiscated Anthrax Non-Lethal
Following testing at Fort Detrick, MD, the biological
material suspected of being deadly anthrax turned out to be a safe form of
the bacteria used in animal vaccines. And one of the two men arrested in the
case was released from jail Saturday. "I absolutely have no hard feelings,"
a visibly shaken William Leavitt Jr. said at a news conference, calling the
circumstances that led to his arrest "misunderstandings and probably some
miscommunication."
The FBI insisted Saturday that arresting the men on biological weapons
charges was necessary to protect the public. The men were arrested Wednesday
outside a medical clinic on the outskirts of Las Vegas after a tipster
contacted the FBI. "Because of the potential serious threat to the
community, our actions had to be quick and decisive," said Bobby Siller,
special agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas office. "We had to act the
way we did."
Under an agreement his attorney reached with prosecutors, Leavitt will be
allowed to remain free on his own recognizance while authorities determine
whether to drop charges. "Legally, this means their case goes down the
toilet," said Lamond Mills, Leavitt's lawyer. "I would expect the U.S.
attorney to drop the charges. "Let them now 'fess up and say it was a
mistake," he said.
Siller declined to explain why charges would not be dropped immediately. He
defended the FBI's investigation, which was based on the informant's tip and
statements made by the suspects, and said it would have been "irresponsible"
not to follow up on the allegation.
The other man, Larry Wayne Harris of Lancaster, Ohio, who is on probation
for an earlier conviction, remained in jail and was scheduled to appear in
court Monday for a detention hearing. Even if the biological weapons charge
is dropped, Harris could still face penalties for violating probation.
Agents also seized other biological material in Ohio from houses owned by
Harris, a former Aryan Nations member. That material was still being tested
at Fort Detrick, and those tests will not be completed before Monday.
FBI agents searched Leavitt's home in Logandale, Nevada, again Sunday [22
Feb, even though the man was released from jail after tests showed he
possessed a harmless animal vaccine, not a biological weapon. More than a
dozen agents descended on his property in this small farming community 50
miles northeast of Las Vegas. Neighbors said the agents had been searching
the home and an adjacent shed since Wednesday, when Leavitt was arrested
along with Larry Wayne Harris.
Leavitt's attorneys contend he had no intention of using the material as a
weapon, but was instead planning to use it to test an unorthodox
disease-killing machine he was considering buying for $2 million from a man
who would become an FBI informant. That informant, Ronald Rockwell, has said
he turned in Leavitt and Harris last week when Leavitt claimed to possess
military-grade anthrax, which could kill thousands of people. Leavitt's
attorneys said Rockwell is a con artist who double-crossed Leavitt and
Harris when the deal to buy the machine turned sour.
Leavitt has a fire safety supply company in Las Vegas and has also been
involved in
nontraditional research seeking cures for AIDS and multiple sclerosis.

Anthrax happens to be the lethal microbe of the moment. But there are others.
"If you really want to kill somebody, you go for _Clostridium botulinum_,"
said Cornelius McWright, former chief of scientific research at the FBI, now
adjunct professor of forensic sciences at George Washington University.
And sometimes the greater weapon is not these microscopic killers
themselves, but the fear that they would be unleashed.
"It [anthrax can really induce terror," said Raymond Zilinskas, associate
professor at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute. "You should
never underestimate the possibility of inducing panic among the general
population."
