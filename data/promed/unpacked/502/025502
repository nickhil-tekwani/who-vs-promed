Poliomyelitis in The Dominican Republic: Advice for Visitors
------------------------------------------------------------
Tourists immunized against poliomyelitis do not run any risk of contracting
the disease in the Dominican Republic.
For more than 10 years, the Dominican Republic has been free from wild
poliovirus, and in 1994 it was certified internationally as free from this
disease. Neither the few suspected cases detected in recent months nor
those confirmed by laboratory are cases of wild poliovirus, but
vaccine-related virus that has modified its genetic characteristics. It can
only affect people who have not been immunized.
Up to now, 6 [vaccine-related confirmed cases have occurred. These cases
include 3 in the Municipality of Constanza (province of La Vega), one in La
Vega, one in Bonao, and one in Santo Domingo.
The health authorities of the Dominican Republic have already carried out
intense vaccination activities in the affected area to interrupt the
transmission at local level. They have programmed a national vaccination
campaign against poliomyelitis in children under 5, on 15, 16 and 17 Dec 2000.
The recommendation of international health authorities related to
immunization against poliomyelitis is vaccination with at least 3 doses of
polio vaccine. In most countries this vaccine is administered before school
enrollment, and a vaccination certificate is a requirement for school
enrollment in most countries.
If tourists or other international travelers to the Dominican Republic are
immunized against poliomyelitis, there is no reason for them to modify
their plans to visit the Dominican Republic. Immunity against poliovirus
lasts a lifetime. If a person does not remember being vaccinated,
re-vaccination is recommended. Every person should have a complete series
of immunizations.
