A doctor and a labourer of Bayad taluka [administrative division] in north Gujarat have tested positive for [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic] fever [CCHF virus], sending the health department into panic mode in the state.

Acting swiftly, the Gujarat government has pressed 4 teams from the animal vaccination, health, animal husbandry, and agriculture departments into service to check the spread of the virus. The doctor has been lodged at a private hospital in Ahmedabad for treatment.

The labourer was first moved to the Ahmedabad civil hospital but is now admitted to a hospital in Patan.

The 4 teams have been deployed in Bayad and surrounding areas from where the 2 cases have been reported, Dr Manish Fancy, Chief District Health Officer of Sabarkantha district under which the area was before it was included in the newly carved out Aravalli district, said.

He said the vaccination team had administered anti-virus vaccinations to around 300 domestic animals in the region, while a group of health officials was engaged in a survey of the villages there. On the other hand, an animal husbandry team has been tasked to carry out a health survey of domestic animals.

[CCHF has been an ongoing public health problem in Gujarat state over the past 3 years. Studies have shown that there is relatively high antibody prevalence in domestic animals in this area. A published study cited in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140920.2790245 stated, "this disease is asymptomatic in animals. CCHF was first confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak in 2011 in Gujarat State. Another notifiable outbreak occurred in July 2013, in Karyana Village, Amreli district, Gujarat State. Anti-CCHF virus (CCHFV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in domestic animals from the adjoining villages of the affected area, indicating a considerable amount of positivity in domestic animals. Antibodies were detected in all the 15 districts surveyed; with positivity of 12 per cent, 41 per cent, and 34 per cent in bovines, sheep, and goats, respectively."

As Mod.CP noted (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100810.2732), CCHF virus is tick-borne, and in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

[The source of the CCHF virus infection in the labourer was presumably a bite from a livestock tick, leading to infection of the doctor who treated him. It is sad that 3 years after the 1st reported cases in Gujarat there was still a doctor there who did not take adequate precautions around a hemorrhagic fever patient. There is no licensed human vaccine. - Mod.JW
