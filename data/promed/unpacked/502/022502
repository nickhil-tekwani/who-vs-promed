Hello from beautiful Watsa,
MSF/B team from Brussels well arrived on the full charter to
Kisangani.
Friday evening and whole Saturday to collect information on the
situation, and prepare the journey to Watsa, in terms of medical
messages, med and log material for the assessment mission, and
meetings with MIP, MSF/Belgium-Holland, in Kisangani and in Goma.
Sunday morning, the assessment team is composed of Pat (MSF/H
epidemiologist), Hilde (Ebola specialist), Manuel (MSF/B HoM), Dr
Olinda (Medecin Inspecteur Provincial MIP) et Christophe (WatSan/log).
Security : area looks quiet. Commercial exchanges are done by road
with Uganda (one day trip). UPDF was already told by General Kasini I
met yesterday and we were given 100% cooperation. We explained to the
Ugandan commander we had a satphone to be able to communicate the
medical data: no problem at all.
Logistics: we are provided accomodation, storage, transport, food
and so on by the mining company. The welcome by all civilian, military
and medical authorities was very warm. Therefore people seem to be
concerned. We do a second plane rotation tomorrow and try to get in
the sanitation stuff (c/c isolation).
Investigation at Durba
----------------------------
May 2: Depart from Kisangani. It was agreed that the MIP would continue
with the MSF team and that the OMS rep in Kisangani (Dr Kinuani Nbulu)
would arrive the following day via the ASF plane which would be made
available to him by MSF-B.
The equipe stopped at Isiro to speak with the MID (Dr. Nembouzo) &
others. The circumstances surrounding the death of Dr.B., MCZ of
Watsa who died on April 23, 1 week after becoming ill with fever were
discussed. He had stopped in Gomburi in transit to Isiro (? time) and
went on to Isiro where he arrived in grave condition. He was seen by
Dr. N. who denied having any direct contact with the patient. The nurse
caring for the deceased had used protective gear. Dr. B. had
exhibited signs of gingival bleeding, hematemesis, melena, bleeding
from puncture sites, fever, but was alert on arrival. He was treated
for gram negative sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
He died 7 hours after admission. Terminal events were marked by the
development of increasing agitation and shock. A blood sample was
obtained and was sent to Watsa. His family remains in Isiro.
The symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) were reviewed with the
physicians and protective measures were discussed. They were provided
with forms containing the definition of clinical and suspect (probable)
cases of VHF, surveillance forms and questionnaires for following
contacts of suspected or clinical cases. Case management was
briefly discussed as well. They were advised to send epidemiologic
data to the MIP.
Upon arriving in Durba, a meeting was held with medical personnel and
civilian authorities to explain the purpose of the inquiry and to
obtain additional information regarding the history of the
epidemiologic features of the so-called "Syndrome de Durba".
History:
----------
In 1993, an illness designated as the "syndrome de Durba" was first
identified. The symptoms were those of a hemorrhagic fever resulting
in the deaths of 50 persons. However, there is no official record of
this epidemic.
In 1994, Dr. W. and a nurse of the HGR in Watsa died and another
nurse became ill but survived. There were *no* hemorrhagic signs in the
3 people and there is no information regarding the occurrence of this
malady in the population at large. [** added here & below - Mod.JW
In 1996-1997, 11 cases of a syndrome characterized by fever *without*
hemorrhagic features resulted in the deaths of 10 persons. Only one of
the victims was male. Due to insecurity in the area, an investigation by
international agencies was not possible. All of the cases occurred
between January and May [1997.
In December 1998, 2 cases of VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever died.
On January 25, 1999, the first cases of the current epidemic occurred.
Up to the present time, 63 cases have been reported in the health
centers. 31 died in Durba and the 32 cases that were referred from
Durba to the HGR at Watsa also died. These latter cases were conveyed
to Watsa by public transport. Confirmation of this data will await further
investigation.
Among the cases only 2 were officially employed by the mining company.
Most of the victims were male adults between 30 and 50 years of age.
58 of the cases occurred among the orpailleurs (illegal mine-workers).
The miners live with their families. Only 2 women and 3 newborn babies
became ill. Both of the women were married to mine-workers. One of the
infants was the child of one of the sick women and the other 2 infants
had been breast fed by the sick woman while she was in the hospital.
*None of the infants manifested hemorrhagic symptoms.*
Further information will be required to ascertain the circumstances
surrounding the deaths of these newborn children.
The orpailleurs live in a primitive and unsanitary environment and the
working conditions are very unhygienic. Often they work as long as
several days in mines, located 400 meters underground, where there
are many rats, bats and insects. These mines have been abandoned and
those who exploit them are there illegally.
All of the victims live within 1 sq.km. surrounding the market place in
Durba where living conditions are poor. In 1996, all of the cases
came from the same restricted area. The population is "floating" due
to transients that work in the mines, but estimated by health
personnel at about 20 000. Religious persuasion includes 60%
Catholic, 10% Protestants and 2% Muslims. There is no official
registration of deaths and the local cemeteries, where all of the dead
are buried, do not keep records.
The following clinical pictures was provided by the health personnel
in Durba:
The duration of the illness from the first symptom until death is 5-6
days. The symptoms in order of appearance are as follows:
day 1
Muscle pain, malaise, headache
day 2, 3
High fever without fluctuation between 38-40 degrees C.
day 3
Thoracic pain, cough and respiratory distress
day 4
Simple profuse diarrhea (4-5 stools a day)
Biliary vomiting, asthenia, polyarthralgia, anorexia
day 5
Hemoptysis, bloody diarrhea, hematemesis
Agitation, profuse sweating, shock
day 5-6
Hiccoughs
day 6 ?
Death
All of the patients are described as having had the same symptoms in
the same order. No conjunctival injection has been noted.
At present there are 5 suspect cases in 2 different health centers. Blood
samples will be taken tomorrow.
The funeral rituals continue to be practiced as ever with significant
contact between the cadaver and the participants. Apparently none of
them have become ill. The population often seeks medical care from
traditional healers and it is probable that many cases have not
visited one of the health facilities in the area. Since the death of
the MCZ [doctor, the population has become fearful of visiting the health
centers. A number of residents have visited one of the zones near the
Sudan (Aba) to participate in rites devoted to enhancing their
chances of finding gold. The majority of the orpailleurs travel to
Uganda to sell their gold. Additional information is required regarding
potential cases in these areas.
One of the inhabitants of Durba departed for Faradje with his wife and
both of them died within one week. Faradje is 35 km from Durba. These
cases are not included with the 63 victims cited above.
Action Plan for May 3
---------------------------
-Obtain blood samples and evaluate suspect cases, collect blood sample

-Assess the C.S. Durba, which has 40 beds, for a potential isolation
site for VHF cases and install isolation facilities
-Demonstrate the use of protective clothing and management of
isolation unit to health personnel.
-Visit Watsa and Okima hospitals in Watsa
-Visit the area from which the cases have come in Durba
-Obtain populations of each aire de sante [health district and obtain
maps of geographical areas to be investigated
-Identify groups who will inform the population & determine the content
of the message be distributed
-Improve data collection procedures
-Confirm to the extent possible, the veracity of the foregoing information
That's all folks.
The Watsa team.
