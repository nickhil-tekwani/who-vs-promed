Herewith some updating/corrective remarks to the moderating notes to the
previous posting:
Firstly, the current version of the Office International des Epizooties
(OIE) Aquatic Manual is the 4th edition, published in 2003 (not in 2000).
(Also please note the name change of the Aquatic Manual).
Secondly, the OIE International Committee at their General Session in 2003
resolved to abolish the concept and use of 2 lists of aquatic animal
diseases (the previous "notifiable" and "other significant"). Therefore,
all aquatic animal diseases listed in the 2002 version (5th edition) of the
Aquatic Code in either of these 2 lists are now part of one single list. As
a consequence, there are not 3, but 8 diseases of crustaceans currently
listed by (and hence reportable to) the OIE.
Finally, the web references you provide are incorrect/not working. The
correct link to the white spot disease chapter in the current (2003)
version (6th edition) of the Aquatic Code is:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fcode/A_00061.htm>. The matching chapter in
the 2003 version (4th edition) of the Aquatic Manual is available at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00048.htm>.

[Dr Bernoth's authoritative comments and updates are very much appreciated.
"OIE Aquatic Manual" is now titled "Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic
Animals", 2003 <http://oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_summry.htm>. The OIE
