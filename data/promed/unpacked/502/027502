Ten members of the same family have died as a result of eating poisonous food in Jangeme village of Gusau local government area in Zamfara state.

A neighbour of the deceased family members, [MSS], informed newsmen that [the family members] were served with guinea corn food called "tuwon dawa" in Hausa, which was allegedly cooked by one of the members of the family, [AM].

According to [MSS], immediately [after] the family members ate the food, they developed stomach cramps and were rushed to a hospital in Gusau, where they later died.

"Immediately after eating the food, all of them began to feel serious stomach discomfort and were later rushed to the hospital in Gusau, but unfortunately they all died," [MSS] said.

Confirming the incident, the spokesperson of Yariman Bakura Specialist Hospital, Gusau, Auwal Usman Ruwan-Doruwa, said the victims died as a result of food poisoning.

Ruwan-Doruwa stated that doctors had tried to save their lives, but it was too late due to the quantity of the poison they ingested.

[Guinea corn is also known as sorghum. This variety is a cereal grain originating in Africa and eaten worldwide. It is especially resistant to drought and, therefore, is used frequently in arid and drought-prone regions. Guinea corn is a nutrient-rich grain often ground into flour to make bread, porridge, and pancakes.

Very few clinical signs, other than stomach pain, are provided in the report above. Therefore, it is difficult to understand if toxins were involved and, if so, which one(s). Is it possible that the grain was contaminated with a pesticide? Was some other agent in the meal adulterated? We are not told what the grain was mixed with or what it was made into. It is possible, of course, the grain was intended to be planted and was therefore covered in chemical to help deter weevils, but there is no information, and clinical signs of the affected individuals are too sparse to come to any conclusions.

ProMED would appreciate definitive information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.TG
