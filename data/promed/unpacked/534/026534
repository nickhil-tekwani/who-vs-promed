A number of citizens have passed away as a result of an unknown fever in Central Darfur during the past 2 days. The reports on the exact number of victims are conflicting; eye-witnesses say at least 10 people died, while a medical source from Zalingei confirmed the deaths of 2 people so far. One of the victims comes from the area of Doudou, west of Zalingei, and the 2nd victim was working in Jebel 'Aamer, North Darfur in the gold mines.

[A medical source] said the 2 victims died from injuries [?] caused by measles [virus infection]. The source disclosed they received several reports on the spread of the fever. The areas of Korley, Tur Kolmey, and Doudou have all seen cases of the fever.

The medical source told Radio Dabanga that a team was sent to Korley, south east of Zalingei, to determine the seriousness of the situation and to take samples from patients. Witnesses told Radio Dabanga that most of the victims of the unknown fever are Arab nomads and gold excavation workers. They added that the patients suffer from headaches, vomiting, and fatigue.

[Zalingei or Zalinjay is a town and district in western Sudan and is capital of the state of Central Darfur. It is an important hub for humanitarian agencies working in the troubled Jebel Marra area to the east and is itself the location of a large number of people displaced from their homes by fighting and other problems elsewhere in Darfur. The number of displaced persons in Zalingei surpasses the number of its residents. Zalingei also has 3 major Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camps in its vicinity.

The deaths of 2 people have been attributed to measles virus infection. In other cases, vomiting and fatigue are mentioned. Hepatitis E and visceral leishmaniasis are known to be prevalent in the region. Further information is awaited.
