Dutch to cull chickens on avian flu outbreak
---------------------------------------------
The Netherlands will cull chicken flocks at poultry farms in the centre of
the country after preliminary tests confirmed an outbreak of bird flu, the
Dutch agriculture ministry said on Sunday. "Preliminary Dutch tests showed
it was bird flu, we are still awaiting European-validated results, but they
will show the same," a spokeswoman at the agriculture ministry said. So far
13 farms are known to be affected.

Flocks on farms within a one-kilometre radius of those farms will also be
culled starting on Monday or Tuesday, she added. On Saturday the ministry
announced it was investigating "serious suspicions" 6 poultry farms were
infected with bird flu and imposed precautionary measures in a 10-km zone
surrounding the farms. The only way to eradicate the disease quickly in
commercial poultry is by destroying infected flocks and imposing a strict
quarantine. The Dutch poultry organisation, NOP (Nederlandse Organisatie
van Pluimveehouders), feared the measures did not go far enough. "I am
pleased that these measures will be taken, but I think that the
one-kilometre zone is not enough," Jan Wolleswinkel, head of the NOP, told
Reuters. The NOP independent organisation representing the interests of
about 15 000 poultry farms in the Netherlands. Wolleswinkel said that
according to some estimates, about one-third of the Dutch poultry livestock
was located in the Gelderland province, which spans from the centre to the
east of the country, where the disease was detected. The flu, an avian H7
virus or "classical strain" of the disease, is harmless to humans, a
spokeswoman for the Dutch food and non-food authority (VWA), told Reuters.

"In Europe there have been several cases of avian flu, and they have never
had any human consequences. Several cases have been described where avian
flu type H5 and H9 lead to serious influenza in humans resulting
fatalities," she said quoting from an advisory report the VWA issued on
Sunday. In Hong Kong, a highly contagious strain of bird flu has jumped to
humans and killed one man late last month, whereas the Exotic Newcastle
strain -- also harmless to humans -- infected its eighth farm in California
last month. A European committee for the food chain and animal health, in
which all European Union member states are represented, was slated to
review the situation on Wednesday.
