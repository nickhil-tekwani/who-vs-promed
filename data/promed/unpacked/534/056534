--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public health authorities across the world have been trying to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via public awareness and contact tracing -- that is, by identifying and isolating individuals at high risk of being positive./1 In many countries, regular mass swab testing is still inadequate. To reduce the number of infectious people in the community, it is therefore crucial to use the symptom combinations that can identify them.

Using self-reported symptoms data from 18 401 users of the COVID Symptom Study app, who underwent an official SARS-CoV-2 test (7104 testing positive, 11 297 testing negative), we previously reported that loss of smell and taste is a potential predictor of COVID-19, in addition to the most established symptoms of a high temperature and a new, continuous cough./2 The prevalence of loss of smell and taste was 3-fold higher in individuals testing positive (65.03%) than in those testing negative (21.71%),/2 suggesting that people with loss of smell and taste should self-isolate. In April 2020, WHO, along with many EU countries, the USA, and Australia added loss of smell and taste as one of the key COVID-19 symptoms, whereas the UK Government added it to its symptom list on [18 May 2020]. The reason quoted for the reticence was reportedly that anosmia by itself (without cough or fever) is responsible for less than 2% extra cases./3 Our data suggest this not to be the case.

As of [19 May 2020], of the more than 3.2 million UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app,/4 76 260 people have now been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and reported symptoms. 71.5% of the 13 863 individuals testing positive indicated fever or cough, suggesting that only isolating and screening those reporting fever or cough could have missed almost 30% of positive cases. Consistently with our previous results, /2 loss of smell and taste was reported overall by 64.5% of those testing positive; and by 15.9% of those not suffering from either fever or cough. These findings are depicted in a Venn diagram in the appendix. New onset loss of smell and taste is a symptom, which is particularly relevant for the young and working population who is likely to be ambulant and able to spread the disease. This 15.9% without classic symptoms could be very relevant to reducing spread.

We also quantified the sensitivity, specificity, positive predicted value, and negative predicted value of fever, cough, fever or cough, and loss of smell in 76 260 users of the COVID Symptom Study app who underwent the SARS-CoV-2 test (13 863 testing positive; 62 397 testing negative; appendix). We found the predictive ability of loss of smell and taste to be higher than fever or persistent cough, which is in line with our previous finding that loss of smell and taste was the strongest predictor of having the virus. /2 Moreover, we found that the median duration of anosmia symptoms was 5 days, whereas the median duration of fever was only 2 days.

As countries slowly emerge from lockdown measures, it is imperative to correctly contact-trace infected individuals. We believe that having added loss of smell and taste to the list of COVID-19 symptoms is of great value as it will help trace almost 16% of cases that otherwise would have been missed. Loss of smell and taste, together with fever or cough, should now enable us to identify 87.5% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases, although this is likely to be less in the early phases of the infection.

Our results also provide theoretical support for adding more symptoms to Public Health England's list of symptoms, as WHO and other countries have done. The danger is that, unlike loss of smell and taste, many symptoms might be non-specific and might need algorithms, as the ones used in the COVID-19 Symptom Study app, to increase predictive power.

Like all observational studies, our findings have limitations and rely on self-report of symptoms, as do most strategies outside of mass population testing. Direct self-testing for new onset loss of smell and taste could improve symptoms capture and should open doors to confirmatory testing. However, loss of smell and taste could be a less discriminating symptom in older people and by those who are less able to report symptoms, such as people in care homes.

We believe that loss of smell and taste is a common COVID-19 symptom and that infections could be reduced and lives saved now that this non-flu-like symptom is recognised. Our data suggest that low-cost so-called smell the difference screening tests, instituted in workplaces and entrances in some settings worldwide, might capture a larger number of positive cases than temperature sensors do.

Ultimately, all individuals have an interest in isolating if they have any symptoms of the disease, and less overtly symptomatic people might have unwittingly been silent spreaders.

[A thought provoking correspondence. While many countries have moved to "open testing" not requiring a symptom complex, others are still limiting testing to symptomatic individuals. It is now generally accepted that asymptomatic infections (some of which ultimately do progress to symptomatic, but many remain asymptomatic) are major contributors to community wide spread and difficult to identify chains of transmission to ultimately interrupt the transmission. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 8 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- A new technical note, Medical certification, ICD mortality coding, and reporting mortality associated with COVID-19, has been released that describes medical certification and classification of deaths related to COVID-19. The primary goal is to identify all deaths due to this disease in all countries.

- WHO welcomes crucial new funding for vaccines which was pledged at the Global Vaccine Summit. The new pledges will enable Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to protect the next generation and reduce disease inequality by reaching an additional 300 million children with vaccines by 2025. The Summit also highlighted how important a safe, effective and equitably accessible vaccine will be in controlling COVID-19.

In today's 'subject in focus' [at the source URL above], we provide an update on partner coordination activities. This includes the work of the Global Health Cluster, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, risk communications and community engagement, and the Emergency Medical Teams network.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 58.3% of the global newly reported cases and 69.5% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 37.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Brazil reported 35.4%, Chile 8.4%, Peru 5.7%, and Mexico 4.7%.

The European region reported 13.9% of the global newly reported cases and 11.2% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 49.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by Belarus 9.7%, the UK 7.3%, Turkey 5.0%, and Sweden 4.6%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 13.5% of the global newly reported cases and 8.0% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 26.6% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 17.2%, Iran 13.3%, Qatar 9.0%, Egypt 8.3%, and Iraq 7.1%.

The African region reported 3.1% of the global newly reported cases and 2.5% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 56.6% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon at 6.4%, Nigeria at 6.2%, Cote d'Ivoire 4.5%, Ghana 4.3%, and Kenya at 4.1%.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.79% of the global newly reported cases and 0.26% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 53.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 36.9%, South Korea 3.7%, Japan 3.2%, and Malaysia 1.8%.

The South East Asia region reported 10.4% of the global newly reported cases and 8.6% of global fatalities. India reported 73.1% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 20.1%, Indonesia 4.9%, and Nepal 1.6%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 8 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, who are both approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 7 193 787, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide The global case count increased by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.02 million confirmed cases, now represents 28.2% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 408 625 deaths have been reported, an increase of 2518 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, Spain, the UK, India, Italy, Peru, Germany, and Iran is number 10 -- unchanged since yesterday (7 Jun 2020). China is number 18. Argentina and Afghanistan have been accelerating from 51st and 60th to 38th and 40th place, respectively, in terms of cumulative cases since 5 May 2020 and 13 May 2020, respectively (Afghanistan has moved from 41 to 40 in the past 24 hours).

In terms of most daily newly confirmed cases, The USA is number 1, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, Pakistan, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Peru, Mexico, and Bangladesh reporting the 10th-highest 24-hour newly confirmed case numbers the same 10 countries just a changing of place number).

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region -- unchanged in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region.
