I disagree with the moderator's comments on the infectious disease issues
surrounding xenotransplantation.
First, retroviruses can be non-pathogenic
in their natural host yet cross-species infection can lead to diseases as
notable as AIDS. Some viruses including STLV can have very low oncogenic
potential which may not be seen for 10 years. It is not possible to state
unequivocally that a retrovirus is benign in humans based on 3 or 4 humans.
In addition, there can be strain-specific differences among retroviruses
that might influence pathogenicity and transmission. Xenotransplantation
may be much more dangerous. As Dr. Alexander noted, implanting an organ
composed of a variety of cell types on top of immunosuppressive agents may
result in outcomes not predicted from retrospective studies of accidentally
infected animal workers.
So while hopeful, we should be careful about conclusions about pathogenicity
and transmission in the xenotransplant setting.

The assumption that the cautious make is that a BIG dose of unknown virus in
a solid organ (i.e. possibly in an INTEGRATED form) given lots of TIME in an
IMMUNOCOMPROMISED host, could mutate or recombine with host viruses and
produce new strains of different infectivity, pathogenicity and range. Is
there evidence to support this view?

The issue of SV40 and human cancer was discussed at the International
Workshop sponsored by NIH and FDA in Washington in January 27-28 1997.
There is a concern over a possible association between cancer and infection
with SV40. SV40 has clearly been shown to cause a variety of tumors when
large doses of live virus are injected into newborn hamsters. Carbone,
Butel, Garcea, and others have found SV40-like DNA sequences in a
proportion of human tumors, including choroid plexus tumors, ependymomas,
mesotheliomas, and osteosarcomas. Intact SV40 has not been found in any
human tumor. Many of the patients with tumors in which SV40 DNA sequences
were detected were born after 1963. All polio vaccines, both IPV and OPV,
released since 1963 have been free of SV40.
There are, as yet, no data confirming an increased incidence of any form of
cancer in cohorts born during the period when SV40 containing IPV and OPV
were in use (1955-1963) compared to cohorts born after 1963.
1. A study in Ohio examined approximately 1000 infants who had received
Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) containing SV40 and 150 who had received Injected
Polio Vaccine (IPV) with SV40 in it. These children were followed for 17-19
years. No increase in the occurrence of cancer or death due to any special
cause was found. [Mortimer EA et al. Long-term follow-up of persons
inadvertently inoculated with SV40 as neonates. New England J Medicine
1981;305:1517.
2. A study in Germany followed 800,000 infants who had received OPV
contaminated with SV40. No increased incidence of brain tumors was found
after 22 years of follow-up compared to those not exposed to SV40
containing vaccine. [Geissler E, Staneczek W. SV40 and human brain tumors.
Arch Geschwulstforsch 1988;58:129-34. See also Geissler E. SV40 and human
brain tumors. Progr Med Virol 1990;37:211-22; Zimmerman W, Scherneck S,
Geissler. Quantitative determination of papovavirus IgG antibodies in sera
from cancer patients, lab workers, and several groups of control persons by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Zentral Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hug
[A 1983;254:187-906;Geissler E, Staneczek W. Sera collected before
introduction of contaminated polio vaccine contain antibodies against SV40.
Acta Virol 1985;29:430-3.
3. A study of approximately 700,000 children 4-11 years of age in Sweden
who had received IPV with SV40 in it in 1957 found there was no increased
risk of brain cancer, ependymoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer or
mesothelioma in exposed children compared to unexposed children followed up
to 1993, i.e. 36 years since exposure. [Presentation of Dr. Patrick Olin at
FDA-NIH Workshop.[Published in proceedings of the meeting.
4. Data from U.S. National Cancer Institute and from Connecticut Cancer
Registry shows that there is no increase in the rate of all cancers or
ependymoma, osteosarcoma, or mesothelioma or in deaths from cancers among
children born during the period of high exposure to SV40 containing
vaccines compared to children born before or after such exposure.
[Strickler HD, et al. Contamination of poliovirus vaccines with simian
virus 40 (1955-1963) and subsequent cancer rates. JAMA 1998;279:292-5

5. Data from patients with AIDS shows no increase in frequency of
SV40-suspect tumours such as osteosarcoma, ependymoma, choroid plexus
tumours, or mesothelioma even though a high proportion of such patients in
the U.S. were born during the period of high exposure to SV40. Patients
with AIDS do have increased rates of other cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma
and lymphoma. They also have greatly increased PML, a progressive,
invariably fatal brain disease caused by JC virus which damages myelin. JC
virus is a human virus that is closely related to SV40 virus. JCV does not
cause tumours in humans. SV40 has not been found in PML. [Presentation of
Dr. K Shah and discussion at NIH Workshop

In summary, there are no data showing that persons exposed to SV40 in live
or killed polio vaccines during the period 1955-1963 have an increased risk
of cancer. The studies are clearly large enough and have been carried out
for a long enough period to answer this question in relation to common
cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, cancer of the prostate, breast, and
colon. The studies are not large enough to detect a small increase in rare
forms of cancer and have not been carried out for long enough to address
the risk of mesothelioma in persons exposed to SV40. It remains to be
determined what significance the DNA-like gene sequences have in the tumors
in which they have been found and what role, if any, SV40 has in human
cancer.

[Thank you, Ronald, for a beautiful summary of the present state of
knowledge. As you state at the end, it's a puzzle what these
SV40-like gene sequences are doing in humans who never received it in
a vaccine. Anyone have any ideas? - Mod.JW
