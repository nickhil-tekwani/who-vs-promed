Natural occurrence of phytoplasma associated with chickpea phyllody
disease in Pakistan -- a new record
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During spring 2005-06 chickpea plants (cultivars Desi and Kabuli)
were found to be affected by a previously undescribed disease in
Pakistan. Symptoms consisted of proliferation of branches with
smaller leaflets, giving a bushy appearance to the plants (Fig. 1).
Affected plants were scattered in the field and were more easily
spotted at flowering and podding time. The flowers developed abnormal
green structures (phyllody) instead of normal flowers (Figs. 2 and
3). At the time of crop maturity when the healthy plants were drying,
the diseased plants in the field were conspicuously green (Fig. 1).

Tissue samples from infected and uninfected plants were examined
using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to ascertain if the
disease was associated with a phytoplasma. Typical pleomorphic bodies
(phytoplasma) mostly spherical to oval of a size ranging from 200-600
nanometers were observed only in the sieve elements of affected
samples. The bodies had opaque, low electron density cytoplasm that
contained ribosome-like granules, DNA-strand-like structures, and
lacked nuclear membranes (Fig. 4), similar to previously reported
phytoplasmas. Such bodies were absent from healthy samples as well as
from xylem cells, phloem parenchyma cells, and companion cells of
affected plants.

In addition, DNA was analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
products were characterized. All samples from infected plants gave a
profile associated with 16SrII phytoplasmas, and partial sequencing
confirmed that the phytoplasma had the greatest homology to 16SrII
phytoplasmas. Koch's postulates were fulfilled in a greenhouse.
5-week-old chickpea plants grown in pots were inoculated by grafting.
A set of control plants was kept without grafting. Phyllody symptoms
similar to those observed in the field started to develop after 25-35
days in graft-inoculated plants while no disease symptoms were
observed on control plants.

Chickpea has been grown in Pakistan for many years without any
reported incidence of phyllody. The presence of phytoplasma disease
in chickpea presents a new threat to the chickpea in Pakistan.
Previously the disease was found in Ethiopia, India, Myanmar,
Australia, and Oman. To the best of our knowledge this is the 1st
report of chickpea phyllody disease in Pakistan.

[Chickpea is an important crop in many developing countries because
of the high protein content (more than 25 percent) of its seeds. The
Kabuli type is grown in temperate regions while the Desi type is
grown in the semi-arid tropics. Seeds and straw are also used as animal feed.

Phytoplasmas are a unique taxonomic group of small, unculturable,
intracellular plant-parasitic bacteria within the group of the
Mollicutes. 16S ribosomal RNA sequences were adopted as a framework
for their formal taxonomic classification. There are still
uncertainties in phytoplasma taxonomy reflected in the genus name
_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma. At least 20 groups and numerous subgroups
have been resolved. The taxonomic rank of species has been proposed
to describe each of the primary phylogenetically coherent phytoplasma groups.

The 16SrII phytoplasma group is called the faba bean phyllody or
peanut witches broom group with type member _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma
aurantifolia (lime witches broom phytoplasma - 'witches broom' is
descriptive of abnormal proliferations of bundles of small twigs).

Phytoplasmas are located in the phloem and can spread within their
host via the sieve tubes. They are usually transmitted by insect
vectors (for example phloem-feeding planthoppers) and grafting. They
have been found to cause important diseases in a range of crops
including grapevine, papaya, rapeseed, rice, potato, citrus, pome,
and stone fruit. Yellowing, phyllody, and witches broom are symptoms
frequently associated with these diseases. Disease management relies
on the use of clean planting material and vector control.
Tetracyclines can inhibit phytoplasma growth but will not normally
eliminate the pathogens from the host.
