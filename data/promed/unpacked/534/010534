Recent vomiting is the main source of airborne norovirus and a likely cause of outbreaks in healthcare facilities, according to study results published in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

Common and highly contagious, norovirus is mainly spread via contaminated food or water or through contact with contaminated surfaces or people, Malin Alsved, MSc, a PhD student in the division of ergonomics and aerosol technology at Lund University in Sweden, and colleagues noted. But they said it also has been associated with airborne transmission.

"This study provides additional evidence that airborne [norovirus] can be present in concentrations that are high enough to cause infections, and in particle-size fractions that remain airborne for long periods and are easily inhaled," Alsved and colleagues wrote.

According to the researchers, norovirus "is acknowledged to spread by splashing droplets that generated, for example, during vomiting." In their study, the researchers investigated associations between gastroenteritis symptoms and the presence of airborne norovirus, and they also studied the size of norovirus-carrying particles, an important marker of how long they can remain in the air and how easily they are inhaled.

To do so, they repeatedly sampled the air near 26 hospitalized patients with norovirus infection and analyzed the samples for norovirus RNA by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR, according to the study. They recorded patients' most recent episodes of vomiting and diarrhea and performed size-separating aerosol particle collection in ward corridors.

In total, 21 (24%) of 86 air samples from 10 patients tested positive for norovirus RNA, all 21 of them having been collected during outbreaks or before a succeeding outbreak, according to Alsved and colleagues.

They reported a strong association between airborne norovirus RNA and a shorter time period since the last vomiting episode (OR = 8.1; P = 0.04 within 3 hours since last episode), with the concentration of airborne norovirus ranging from 5-215 copies/cubic meter. Detectable amounts of norovirus RNA were found in particles smaller than 0.95 micrometer and larger than 4.51 micrometer, according to the study.

"Our study is the largest study of airborne [norovirus], but still not large enough to conduct a multivariable analysis controlling for more than one confounding factor," the researchers wrote. "Nevertheless, we believe that the main findings are valid and generalizable."

"Abstract
---
Background
Noroviruses are the major cause of viral gastroenteritis. Disease transmission is difficult to prevent, and outbreaks in healthcare facilities commonly occur. Contact with infected persons and contaminated environments are believed to be the main routes of transmission. However, noroviruses have recently been found in aerosols, and airborne transmission has been suggested. The aim of our study was to investigate associations between symptoms of gastroenteritis and presence of airborne norovirus, and to investigate the size of norovirus-carrying particles.

Methods
Air sampling was repeatedly performed close to 26 patients with norovirus infections. Samples were analysed for norovirus RNA by RT-qPCR. The times since the patients' last episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea were recorded. Size-separating aerosol particle collection was also performed in ward corridors.

Results
Norovirus RNA was found in 21 (24%) of 86 air samples from 10 different patients. Only air samples during outbreaks, or before a succeeding outbreak, tested positive for norovirus RNA. Airborne norovirus RNA was also strongly associated with a shorter time period since the last vomiting episode (odds ratio 8.1, p=0.04 within 3 hours since the last vomiting episode). The concentration of airborne norovirus ranged from 5-215 copies/cubic meter, and detectable amounts of norovirus RNA were found in particles less than 0.95 micrometer and greater than 4.51 micrometer.

Conclusions
The results suggest that recent vomiting is the major source of airborne norovirus and imply a connection between airborne norovirus and outbreaks. The presence of norovirus RNA in submicrometre particles indicates that airborne transmission can be an important transmission route."

Airborne transmission has been noted in the past for norovirus:

"Abstract
Background:
Noroviruses are responsible for at least 50% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. Noroviruses GII can infect humans via multiple routes including direct contact with an infected person, fecal matter, or vomitus, and contact with contaminated surfaces. Although norovirus is an intestinal pathogen, aerosols could, if inhaled, settle in the pharynx and later be swallowed. The aims of this study were to investigate the presence of norovirus GII bioaerosols during gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare facilities and to study the in vitro effects of aerosolization and air sampling on the noroviruses using murine norovirus as a surrogate.

Methods:
A total of 48 air samples were collected during norovirus outbreaks in 8 healthcare facilities. Samples were taken 1 m [3.3 ft] away from each patient, in front of the patient's room, and at the nurses' station. The resistance to aerosolization stress of murine norovirus type 1 (MNV-1) bioaerosols was also tested in vitro using an aerosol chamber.

Results:
Norovirus genomes were detected in 6 of 8 healthcare centers. The concentrations ranged from 1.35 x 10(1) to 2.35 x 10(3) genomes/cubic meter in 47% of air samples. MNV-1 preserved its infectivity and integrity during in vitro aerosol studies.

Conclusions:
Norovirus genomes are frequently detected in the air of healthcare facilities during outbreaks, even outside patients' rooms. In addition, in vitro models suggest that this virus may withstand aerosolization."

Noroviruses may spread through the air
---------------------------

While other studies have looked into the possibility of airborne noroviruses, researchers say this is the 1st to quantify noroviruses in the air. "Sampling and analyzing viruses in the air represent several challenges, including large-volume air sampling, concentrating the sample, and detecting with high efficiency and specificity rare agents," lead author Caroline Duchaine, of the Universite Laval and the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute Research Centre, told CBS News. "Our lab is equipped to do this. Other studies have supposed it could be present because of epidemiological evidences, such as transmission of diseases with our droplets or direct contact."

For the study, Duchaine and her team gathered air samples at a distance of 1 m [3.3 ft] from patients, at the doors to their rooms, and at nursing stations at each healthcare facility. Noroviruses were found in the air at 6 of the 8 facilities studied. Researchers detected the viruses in 54% of the patient rooms, 38% of the hallways leading to their rooms, and 50% of nursing stations. Virus concentrations ranged from 13-2350 particles per cubic meter of air, which is significant, researchers said, because a dose of 20 norovirus particles is usually enough for someone to get sick with gastroenteritis.

Duchaine said these findings could explain why norovirus outbreaks can be so hard to contain. "The measures applied in hospital settings are only designed to limit direct contact with the infected patient," she said in a statement. "In light of our results, these rules need to be reviewed to take into account the possibility of airborne transmission of noroviruses. Use of mobile air-filtration units or the wearing of respiratory protection around patients with gastroenteritis are measures worth testing."

Yet, some experts say, while the study is significant, it may be too soon to make significant investments in preventing the spread of norovirus this way. "The research suggests another potential avenue for the viruses to be transmitted, but it is not definite," said Jeffrey S. Duchin, MD, interim health officer and chief, Communicable Disease Epidemiology & Immunization Section for Public Health - Seattle & King County - and professor in Medicine, Division of Allergy & Infectious Diseases, at the University of Washington. "It is not surprising that the virus may be suspended in the air, but it does not mean that it will infect other people this way."

Both Duchaine and Duchin say more research is needed to determine whether or not noroviruses can be acquired by the airborne route. In the meantime, Duchin said it's not a bad idea to take some extra precautions around people who are ill with gastroenteritis.

"When possible, it is always advisable to keep as much distance as possible from someone who is vomiting or has been infected with noroviruses," he said. "And it certainly wouldn't be harmful to increase ventilation by opening a window."
