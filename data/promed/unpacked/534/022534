Three hospital patients have died in an outbreak of _Listeria_ linked to pre-packed sandwiches. Public Health England (PHE) said the victims were among 6 patients affected in England and the deaths occurred in Manchester and Liverpool.

Sandwiches and salads linked to the outbreak have been withdrawn, and supplier The Good Food Chain has voluntarily ceased production. The BBC has approached The Good Food Chain for comment.

Two of the patients who died were being treated at Manchester Royal Infirmary. The 3rd patient was in the care of Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

PHE said the sandwiches and salads affected are no longer being produced while investigations continue. It added the products were withdrawn from hospitals when the links to the infections were first identified.

Dr. Nick Phin, deputy director at the National Infection Service at PHE said: "To date, there have been no associated cases identified outside healthcare organisations, and any risk to the public is low."

PHE said The Good Food Chain had been supplied with meat produced by North Country Cooked Meats, which subsequently produced a positive test result for the outbreak strain of _Listeria_. This business and North Country Quality Foods, which it distributes through, have also voluntarily ceased production.

The BBC has contacted North Country Quality Foods for comment.

[In the USA and Europe, clusters of related cases are identified based on clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid and placental or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes. The news report says that "meat", which was supplied by North Country Cooked Meats and used by The Good Food Chain to make sandwiches for hospitalized patients, was "positive" for this outbreak strain of _Listeria_, probably on the basis of matching genotypes.

Refrigerated ready-to-eat smoked salmon and cold cut meats, food that is not cooked before eating, are well-recognized sources for listeriosis. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient number to cause disease. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk, as well as milk and milk products contaminated with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization, are other sources of listeriosis. These types of food should not be served to hospitalized patients who are likely to be at increased risk for listeriosis, such as pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems.

Manchester (population 545 500 in 2017) and Liverpool (population 491 500 in 2017) are 2 cities about 31 miles (50 km) apart in northwest England. A map showing the location of these cities can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Manchester,+UK. - Mod.ML
