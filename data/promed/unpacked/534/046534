Fake marijuana likely contaminated with rat poison has killed 3 people in Illinois and caused severe bleeding in more than 100 others, including a few in 4 other states.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has alerted doctors nationwide that patients with severe, unexplained bleeding may be additional cases.

The CDC is helping Illinois authorities investigate the outbreak in that state, which began in early March 2018. Illinois reported 7 more cases on Tuesday [10 Apr 2018], bringing the nationwide total to at least 116.

Several patients and samples of so-called synthetic marijuana from Illinois have tested positive for a lethal ingredient often used in rat poison, the CDC and Illinois authorities said.

Symptoms include coughing up blood, blood in the urine, severe bloody noses, bleeding gums and internal bleeding. CDC's alert says outside Illinois, emergency rooms in Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin and Maryland have treated affected patients since 20 Mar 2018

Illnesses have been linked to fake marijuana before, but this is the 1st outbreak involving rat poison contamination, said the CDC's Renee Funk. Those sickened require hospitalization and treatment with vitamin K to control bleeding, she said.

"This is an unusual outbreak," Funk said Tuesday [10 Apr 2018], adding that it is unclear how the contamination occurred.

Fake marijuana, also called synthetic cannabinoids, contains man-made chemicals that produce a high similar to marijuana. It is sold in smoke shops and other stores as liquids that can be used in e-cigarettes or in dried plant material that can be smoked. Nicknames include K2, Spice and Kush.

"The number of cases continues to go up each day," Melaney Arnold, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public Health, said Tuesday [10 Apr 2018]. "Synthetic cannabinoids in general are not safe, and this is one example of not knowing what chemicals are in the product. We are telling people don't use synthetic cannabinoids."

The federal government and many states have banned some of these products or specific ingredients, but the CDC says manufacturers skirt these laws by creating new products or labeling them "not for human consumption."

Tests on fake pot bought at a Chicago convenience store by undercover agents detected the rat poison ingredient, the U.S. attorney's office said in a news release. Three store employees were arrested and face federal drug charges.

Illnesses from fake marijuana have increased in recent years; a CDC report noted at least 456 cases between 2010 and 2015. The products are up to 100 times more potent than the active ingredient in marijuana, and severe reactions have included seizures, coma and delirium.

[The rodenticide identified in Illinois is brodifacoum, a long acting vitamin K (clotting factor) antagonist anticoaugulant, which lethal. It is a coumarin derivative, specifically a 4-hydroxycoumarin. It is a very widely used anticoagulant rodenticide. The good news is brodifacoum can be treated with vitamin K and blood transfusions if caught early enough. However, there are rodenticides on the market today for which there is no treatment.

Brodifacoum is lethal, and if you have any signs of bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to a hospital. Notify them you may have been exposed to a rodenticide through synthetic marijuana.

For more information on synthetic cannabis, subscribers are requested to read the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail post Drug abuse - USA: (IL) synthetic cannabinoids, bleeding disorder 20180331.5720593. - Mod.TG

It appears as though this is now a multistate problem with reports from Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin and Maryland. In addition, prior reports have mentioned the identification of the brodifacoum in several patients, the above report mentions identification in the synthetic cannabinoids as well. - Mod.MPP
