Just so that subscribers are aware of what is going on, I am posting the
following report that was in today's (24 February) [London] Telegraph.

EU hygiene rules to be waived in 'BSE free' states
By Toby Helm in Brussels and David Brown
GERMANY and seven other EU nations could be given official "BSE free" status
as part of a plan to help break the deadlock over the British beef ban.
The idea - being discussed by the European Commission and the British EU
presidency - would involve waiving proposed new meat hygiene rules for
countries which have had no cases of mad cow disease in domestically bred
cattle. The plan follows warnings by the Bonn government that it will oppose
moves to ease the ban on British meat unless Germany is exempted from the
new scheme.
An agreed list of banned beef parts is supposed to be in place by April 1,
but Germany has made it clear it does not expect to be penalised for a mad
cow outbreak in another member state. It is leading calls from the non-BSE
nations to be exempted from any restrictions agreed by EU experts and the
Brussels Commission. With no hope of reaching an EU-wide deal, the
commission is believed to be planning a two-tier system, with tougher
measures against countries with a record of BSE. Britain has the worst
record but now has the toughest hygiene controls as a result - and exclusion
from the terms of any ban for the rest.
One EU diplomat said: "The Germans know the new rules will cost their
industry money and they are linking this to the British ban when there is no
link." The other EU countries which claim to have suffered no cases of BSE
in domestically bred cattle are Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy, Greece,
Spain and Austria.
Previously Britain had insisted that all countries be required to remove
so-called Specified Risk Materials - such as spinal cord and brain - from
meat before sale. But a British official in Brussels said the UK had decided
to examine the new proposals. "We are looking at this because things have
moved on," he said. Officials in the European Commission believe Brussels
may back a recommendation imposing a regional approach when it meets
tomorrow .
Meanwhile, the EU's Scientific Steering Committee has backed Britain's ban
on beef-on-the-bone - delivering a blow to farmers and butchers fighting to
end the restriction.

My comments
~~~~~~~~~~
The final paragraph, on a totally different topic, is science-based.
For the rest, while I do not get involved in political/commercial matters, I
can recognise unprincipled horse-trading when I see it, and the argument
about "exemptions" of certain EU countries certainly has nothing whatever to
do with science.
1. The distinction between "home bred" and "not home bred" is transparent
sophistry. If potentially infective SRMs are in a country's beef supply,
whether or not it came from a home-bred cow is completely irrelevant.
2. In any case, scientists recognise the reasons why it is scientifically
impossible for _any_ country to claim validly to be BSE-free.
3. Since Germany is apparently the driving force in this attempt to evade
the hygiene controls of Commission Decision 97/534, it is worth recalling
Roland's comment in reply to Oz only 3 days ago --
Oz --
>> .... the fact that I have probably seen the onset of BSE in more cases than
anyone in Germany.<<
Roland --
>>Fine if we now come to an understanding and i hope you have observed more
cases of BSE than anyone in Germany. I am not so sure, although there are
only 5 official cases. The German veterinarian Dr. Margit Herbst saw, if i
remember correctly, about 20 cattle with unusual, BSE like behavior in her
slaughterhouse. The histopathological diagnosis was inconclusive and has
been done without immunohistochemistry. I suppose you are not surprised that
the responsible minister for agriculture told the parliament, that they were
clearly negative. Whereas the lie of that minister was without any
consequence, the veterinarian who tried to protect the consumers, had to
resign and to defend herself against several libel charges. She is now
totally ruined, so that all German vets knows how dangerous it can be to
speak to the public about putative BSE cases.<<<<
