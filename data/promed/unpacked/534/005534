Extending time between mRNA COVID vaccine doses may boost efficacy
------------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection was 5% to 7% higher when the 2 primary doses were given at least 7 weeks rather than 3 to 5 weeks apart, according to an observational study of hospital and community healthcare workers (HCWs) in British Columbia published late last week in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.

Researchers from the BC Centre for Disease Control, Communicable Diseases and Immunization Services used a test-negative design to evaluate the odds of vaccination in HCWs and controls matched in a 6:1 ratio to COVID-19 test date. mRNA vaccination was considered receipt of the 1st dose 21 or more days before the test date or the 2nd dose at least 14 days before.

Tests were conducted from [17 Jan to 2 Oct 2021], a span that included the dominance of the delta variant. Mean follow-up was 49 days for the single-dose group and 89 days for 2-dose recipients. Over 80% of HCWs were women, and controls were about a decade older than cases. Among vaccinated HCWs, 92% of single-dose and 83% of 2-dose recipients were given the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

Of all vaccinees, 1265 received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 1246 received 2. Among 2-dose recipients, 12% received their 2nd dose 3 to 5 weeks after the 1st, while 31% did so at 6 weeks, and 58% at 7 or more weeks. Over the study period, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization changed recommended dosing intervals, ranging from 3 to 4 weeks to 16 weeks, as conditions evolved.

After adjustment, mRNA VE against infection was 71% for one dose at a median of 7 weeks and 90% for 2 doses at 13 weeks. Seven months after the 2nd dose, VE was still greater than 80%. Two-dose VE was consistently 5% to 7% higher when given at least 7 weeks apart than after a 3- to 5-week interval.

The study authors said the findings didn't suggest marked waning immunity, even in the delta era. "Such protection may have been facilitated by the Canadian decision to extend the interval between 1st and 2nd doses, reinforcing that option in other jurisdictions or for future cohorts in the context of vaccine supply constraints and/or where urgent top-up of already substantial one-dose protection is less pressing," they wrote.

Worldwide COVID-19 deaths increased 6% on weekends amid pandemic
----------------------------------------------------------------
A global analysis of nearly 6 million COVID-19 deaths over 2 years reveals that 6% more occurred on weekends than on weekdays in all countries except Germany, according to data to be presented at the annual congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) on [23-26 Apr 2022] in Portugal.

A University of Toronto researcher led the study, which involved analysis of all global COVID-19 deaths recorded in the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database from 7 Mar 2020-7 Mar 2022. The team also evaluated deaths in the 10 countries with the highest COVID-19 infections: The United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, India, Brazil, and Canada.

On average, 449 more people (8532 vs 8083) died per day on weekends than on weekdays, equivalent to a 6% relative increase (95% confidence interval, 3% to 8%). The highest absolute increases were in Brazil (1061 vs 823 [29%]), the United States (1483 vs 1220 deaths [22%]), Canada (56 vs 48 [17%]), and the United Kingdom (239 vs 215 [11%]). Only Germany saw fewer deaths on the weekends relative to weekdays (134 vs 187 deaths).

The rise was particularly large on Sundays relative to Mondays (8850 vs 7219) and Fridays vs Mondays (9086 vs 7219).

The study authors said the higher weekend death rate may have been due to lower hospital efficiency, uneven staffing levels, a different mix of personnel expertise, variable hours, reduced capacity, or delays in reporting. "The apparent increased COVID-19 deaths reported on weekends might confound projections and create a false sense of security on subsequent weekdays," they wrote.

The weekend increase was evident throughout the pandemic, regardless of pandemic severity. "What's more, our findings suggest that this problem is not resolving despite improved health system performance and awareness over the course of the pandemic," lead author Fizza Manzoor, MD, said in an ESCMID press release.

She added, "Bureaucratic delays on weekends alone do not explain why there are fewer documented COVID-19 deaths on Mondays compared to Fridays, and reporting lags alone cannot explain why the increase in weekend deaths was so substantial in the USA and not seen in Germany."

"Global study finds increase in deaths from COVID-19 at the weekend
• Worldwide analysis of nearly 6 million deaths from COVID-19 over 2 years finds an increase in COVID-19 mortality at weekends compared to weekdays.
• Findings are unlikely to reflect just bureaucratic and reporting delays but also shortfalls in hospital capacity, clinical staffing and expertise, researchers say.
• Among 10 countries with the highest COVID-19 counts, the USA, Brazil, and the UK had significantly higher deaths on Saturday and Sunday compared to weekdays throughout the pandemic.
• This "weekend effect" was not seen in Germany, where more COVID-related deaths were reported on weekdays. ..."

Global data reveal half may have long COVID 4 months on
-------------------------------------------------------
Worldwide, 49% of COVID-19 survivors reported persistent symptoms 4 months after diagnosis, estimates a meta-analysis of 31 studies published late last week in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.

University of Michigan researchers, who conducted a systematic review on 5 Jul 2021, also found the prevalence of long COVID at 1 month at 37%, while it was 25% at 2 months and 32% at 3 months. A total of 50 studies were identified in the review, and 41 were included in a quantitative synthesis, and 31 reporting overall prevalence were meta-analyzed.

The 50 studies included a total of 1 680 003 COVID-19 patients, including those who were hospitalized (67 161 patients from 22 studies), nonhospitalized (4165 from 5 studies), and any COVID-19 patients, regardless of hospitalization status (1 608 677 from 23 studies).

Impact on health, workforce 'enormous'
--------------------------------------
Estimated global prevalence of long COVID was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39% to 46%), although estimates ranged from 9% to 81%, which the study authors said may be attributable to differences in sex, region, study population, and follow-up.

Long COVID prevalence among hospitalized patients was 54% (95% CI, 44% to 63%), while it was 34% (95% CI, 25% to 46%) for outpatients.

Regionally, estimated pooled prevalence of lingering COVID-19 symptoms was 51% (95% CI, 37% to 65%) in Asia, 44% (95% CI, 32% to 56%) in Europe, 31% (95% CI, 21% to 43%) in North America, and 31% (95% CI, 22% to 43%) in the United States.

Worldwide, estimated prevalence of long COVID was 37% (95% CI, 26% to 49%) 1 month after diagnosis, 25% (95% CI, 15% to 38%) at 2 months, 32% (95% CI, 14% to 57%) at 3 months, and 49% (95% CI, 40% to 59%) at 4 months. The most common symptoms were fatigue (23%), followed by memory problems (14%), shortness of breath (13%), sleep problems (11%), and joint pain (10%).

Overall, the meta-analysis showed that a higher percentage of women reported long COVID symptoms than men (49% vs 37%, respectively) and that preexisting asthma was a predisposing factor for lingering symptoms. Risk factors identified in the studies that weren't meta-analyzed included severe initial illness, older age, and underlying conditions such as obesity and hypothyroidism.

Findings from the study show that the prevalence of long COVID is substantial, the health effects of infection seem to be prolonged, and the condition could stress the healthcare system, the researchers said.

"We recommend continued attention be focused on identifying patients at-risk of developing post COVID-19 condition and on quantifying duration of symptoms. With an estimated 200 million individuals affected, post COVID-19 condition's impact on population health and the labor force is enormous," they concluded.

"It is imperative that those affected are provided proper health, social, and economic protections."

Conclusions
Findings from this study provide insight into the empirical estimates of prevalence, symptoms, a limited set of risk factors, and duration of post COVID-19 condition, with an examination of differences by several factors including geography. We recommend continued attention be focused on identifying patients at-risk of developing post COVID-19 condition and on quantifying duration of symptoms. With an estimated 200 million individuals affected, post COVID-19 condition's impact on population health and the labor force is enormous. It is imperative that those affected are provided proper health, social, and economic protections. - Mod.LK]

Are New Omicron Subvariants a Threat? How Scientists are Keeping Watch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In South Africa, a network of researchers are studying whether new lineages BA.4 and BA.5 escape immunity from COVID-19 vaccines and prior infections.

... researchers are grappling with how to communicate their concerns and the uncertainty about variants openly, while not provoking unnecessary government policies and anxiety. ...

[Openness of communication is jeopardized by international response such as what happened to South Africa in 2021 when detection of the original omicron variant was announced. Countries invoked travel bans against South Africa. The variant spread in spite of the bans, and likely had spread before the bans were put in place. Unfortunately, they severely damaged the already struggling South African economy. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 8 countries: South Korea (118 445), USA (60 808), Vietnam (43 272), Australia (41 562), France (19 810), Germany (19 303), Italy (18 588), and Thailand (16 891) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1679 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 13 Apr 2022 to late 14 Apr 2022). This could be the weekend effect, and may become clearer later in the week.

A total of 23 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 12 of the 23 countries are from the European region, 4 are from the Americas region, 1 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and none from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 26.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 29.0%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 16.5% increase in daily reported cases and an 11.9% decrease in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases (the US has shown an increasing trend in cases over the last few days) and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.73 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 503.79 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.22 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
