[1] Bahrain ex Saudi Arabia, medical details
Date: Mon 11 2016
From: Manaf Alqahtani <drmanaf@gmail.com> [edited]


A 61-year-old Saudi patient presented in the hospital with exertional chest tightness and chest pain with SOB [shortness of breath] for the last 3 months. Referred to hospital in KSA for an angiogram, which was done on 6 Mar 2016, the result showed TVD [triple vessel disease]. The patient was referred to our hospital for CABG [Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts]. He was admitted to the Cardiac Centre on 29 Mar 2016.

On admission, the patient was afebrile and his chest was clear; coronavirus screening was done, as is routine for all Armco patients, at the same day following the Cardiac Centre Protocol; the result was negative. Patient underwent CABG X4 [4 vessel bypass grafts] on 3 Apr 2016; on 4 Apr 2016, the patient was transferred to HDU [High Dependency Unit (also known as "step down unit")] in stable condition, but he was connected to NCPAP [Nasal continuous positive airway pressure] since he did not tolerate a face mask (FM). He had metabolic acidosis, temperature of 37.8 C [100 F] and decreased air entry in both lung bases. On 5 Apr 2016, urea [BUN - blood urea nitrogen] and creatinine were increasing; dopamine infusion for renal dose was started. His temperature increased to 38.3 [101 F] with rigors and chills, so a septic workup was done (including a respiratory panel-Biofire for all common viruses and bacteria, which were negative, including H1N1 and other flu viruses), and all were negative.

At 12:40 hours, patient experienced rapid desaturation [blood oxygen levels decreased] and his temp went up to 40 C [104 F]; a chest X-ray was done and showed infiltrates on the right side. CPAP was changed to BIPAP [Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure]; IV tazocin was started by the cardiac team. On 6 Apr 2016, his [hemoglobin] Hb was 6.1, so one unit of blood was transfused. The patient passed large loose stool. The patient was referred to medical neurology, was evaluated with no changes in treatment. IV meropenam was added. On 6 Apr 2016 at 15:15 hours, patient was transferred to the CICU [Cardiac Intensive Care Unit]. He was intubated, but his saturation remained low.

On 7 Apr 2016, the patient's condition deteriorated further, so V-V ECMO [Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation] machine was started to support the patient's lungs. On 8 Apr 2016, CVVHD [continuous veno-venous hemodialysis] was started due to ARF [acute renal failure]. On 9 Apr 2016, a deep nasopharyngeal sample as well as a deep tracheal aspirate were sent to the Public Health unit in the Ministry of Health for coronavirus testing. The result for the 2nd nasopharyngeal [specimen for coronavirus] (with the patient symptomatic with an abnormal CXR [chest X-ray]) showed positive for ORF1a [open reading frame] but CT [cycle threshold] 38 BUT; the deep ET [endotracheal] aspirates showed positive for ORF1a CT 20 & upE genomic targets with CT 17) confirmed positive.

The patient was isolated, and all other patients in the CICU were transferred to other units to prevent cross infection. The patient's family confirmed that the patient deals with camels, which was not revealed on initial screening by the patient. His last known contact with camels before arriving to Bahrain was on 28 Mar 2016.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Manaf Alqahtani for sharing this information with us.

We have also learned from a reliable source that the location of the camel farm where the patient had contact is in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and that protocol involves the Ministry of Agriculture going to the implicated farm and taking specimens from camels for MERS-CoV testing.

It appears as though the patient may well have been incubating MERS-CoV infection at the time of surgery and developed clinical disease during his postoperative period, with a rapid downhill course including acute renal failure.

A patient suffering from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is to be transferred to a Saudi Hospital for medical follow-up. The Saudi medical team coordinated the move with the special committee in charge of following up the MERS-infected patient.

Royal Medical Services Commander Major-General Professor Shaikh Khalid bin Ali Al-Khalifa thanked the Saudi medical team for their cooperation and quick response to the demand of the BDF Military Hospital. He commended the support provided by the Health Minister, Undersecretary and all health personnel.

He also extended thanks to Dr. Badran Risan and all the personnel of the Mohammed bin Khalifa Specialist Cardiac Centre for the prompt medical and administrative procedures. Meanwhile, Major Dr. Manaf bin Mohammed Al-Qahtani said all people who were in close contact with the patient had been surveyed in less than 12 hours after diagnosis of the patient's disease and activating the preventive contingency plan. A number of people working at the Mohammed bin Khalifa Specialist Cardiac Centre and BDF Military Hospital who came close to the patient underwent comprehensive check-ups and tested negative.

[While the initial checks on exposed hospital staff and presumably other patients in proximity to this patient were negative, the collective sigh of relief will be after 14 days following exposure have passed without secondary cases. The use of CPAP (as mentioned in the medical report in section [1] above can be associated with aerosolization of excretions into the surrounding environment and may be associated with nosocomial spread of the virus. - Mod.MPP]
