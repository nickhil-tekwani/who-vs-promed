Veterinary inspection of the province of Saida urged farmers to vaccinate their animals against various diseases including foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. For this purpose, 34 vets were mobilized for the campaign.

Breeders will benefit from this vaccination free of charge. According to our source, FMD virus is still present although the province had no cases.

The operation was launched [in Nov 2015] for the 2015/2016 campaign and will be pursued until March [2016]. A total of 25 000 heads have been vaccinated and the operation involved 3544 [cattle] in the 16 districts of the province. Thus, since 2014, 36 000 animals were vaccinated.

[The vaccination campaign of cattle against FMD continues in Algerian provinces and each province seems to have its own specific control program.

The statement: "according to our source, FMD virus is still present although the province had no cases" attracts attention. It would be useful to know if FMD continues to be diagnosed in some provinces of the country or if there is only evidence that the virus is still present, circulating asymptomatically in the country. Has an epidemiological study been conducted to confirm the circulation of the virus?

Additional information on the above will be highly appreciated. - Mod.AB

During the 2014 FMD in Algeria, caused by the FMD virus serotype O of an Indian lineage (coined O/ME-SA/Ind-2001), sheep were not included in the vaccination campaign. In 2015, clinical FMD was observed in sheep in the province of El Bayadh and other provinces, prompting the Algerian veterinary authorities to vaccinate this animal species, on top of mass vaccinations in cattle. It would be interesting to note if the surveillance applied currently in Algeria, covers sheep as well and to obtain information on the vaccine strain applied. - Mod.AS
