A salmonellosis warning has been issued as 2 people have died in 9
outbreaks across the country, prompting the Health Protection Agency [HPA]
to launch a full investigation.

Around 130 people have fallen ill with the same strain of _Salmonella
enterica_ linked to poultry and eggs since August 2009 across England and
Wales. 5 outbreaks have been linked to Asian restaurants, 3 to other
restaurants, and the other was in a care home.

2 people with the infection died in the care home, which has not been named
by officials, but postmortem results have proved inconclusive about the
cause of death. 3 other people have been treated in hospital, a report from
the HPA said.

The HPA is investigating the outbreaks as it is thought a common food
source could be responsible, particularly because the cases involve the
same strain of the infection out of a possible 2500 types. Poultry and eggs
are considered the most likely source and officials are interviewing
patients to establish any patterns in what they have eaten.

The strain involved in the outbreaks, known as _S._ enterica serotype
Enteritidis PT14b NxCpl, is showing some resistance to antimicrobial
agents. Experts said the fact it is showing resistance is not important for
public health reasons but is being used as a way of identifying cases and
helped to confirm that the outbreaks of the infection are probably connected.

On top of the outbreaks there has been an increase in isolated cases of
salmonellosis in recent weeks, but HPA officials said this generally
happens at this time of year and the numbers are not unexpectedly high.
There have been a total of 259 cases in England and Wales since August
2009, 136 of which are connected to the 9 outbreaks.

Gastroenterologists and public health experts at the HPA are working with
the Food Standards Agency and environmental health officers to try and
establish if there is a one food source that has caused the outbreaks.

The report said: "Preliminary investigations have suggested putative links
to chicken and/or eggs in some outbreaks, and this is being actively tested
through analytical epidemiological studies and appropriate investigation of
supply chains."

[ProMED-mail awaits further evaluation of the scope of the outbreak and the
alleged vehicle. [_Salmonella_ enteritidis can silently infect the ovaries
of healthy-appearing hens and contaminate the eggs before the shells are
