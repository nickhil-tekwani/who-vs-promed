Cuba: 2017. 14 Dec 2018. A published study investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. The study found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, the study showed that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior.

Dominican Republic. 16 Jan 2019. (published). This study describes the Zika virus outbreak in pregnant women in the Dominican Republic during 2016-2017. The authors conducted multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with fetal losses and preterm birth. The Ministry of Health identified 1282 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus infection, a substantial proportion during their 1st trimester. Fetal loss was reported for approximately 10 percent of the reported pregnancies, and 3 cases of fetal microcephaly were reported. Women infected during the 1st trimester were more likely to have early fetal loss (adjusted odds ratio 5.9, 95 percent CI [confidence interval] 3.5-10.0). Experiencing fever during infection was associated with increased odds of premature birth (adjusted odds ratio 1.65, 95 percent CI 1.03-2.65). There was widespread morbidity during the epidemic. These findings strengthen the evidence for a broad range of adverse pregnancy outcomes resulting from Zika virus infection.

India (Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat states). 5 Jan 2019 (reported). Fully-sequenced MP's virus genome is Uganda strain of Zika, which is not a severe strain. Zika virus has drawn worldwide attention as it has been linked with fetal microcephaly. The NIV [National Institute for Virology] analysed Zika strain from a patient in Gujarat that was found to be close to a Malaysian Zika strain. Zika lineages African (AF) and Asian (AS) target the human placenta. Around 20 pregnant women in MP have been diagnosed for Zika virus. It is a strain of Zika in pregnant women that can cause subsequent birth defects.

[2] Zika detection
Date: Fri 22 Dec 2018
Source: Science Blog [edited]
https://scienceblog.com/504941/researchers-develop-rapid-inexpensive-test-for-zika/


Z Hugh Fan, PhD, a professor and George N Sandor Faculty Fellow at the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering's department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, and John Lednicky, PhD, a research professor at the College of Public Health and Health Professions' department of environmental and global health, [both at the University of Florida, UF] led a team that developed a miniaturized device for analysis of the virus in blood, saliva, and urine specimens. Using the device, they demonstrated the reproducible detection of Zika virus. The team has published the results of their current research in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition.

"Zika virus caused a widespread epidemic of disease in the Americas in 2016, and cases continue to occur because the virus has now become established in the Western Hemisphere. Simple to use, quick-working, and cost-effective devices that can be used to help diagnose Zika infections are sorely needed," Lednicky said. "In particular, many methods are beyond the reach of physicians and laboratories in resource-strapped countries, and when available, the results of the confirmatory tests often take weeks to reach the medical caregivers."

Because fever due to Zika virus is not specific, (countless viruses induce fever) and an infection by the virus can be misdiagnosed, it is important to have a point-of-care testing platform to accurately and quickly identify Zika virus infection for patient management and clinical diagnostics. In addition, because Zika virus generally causes mild or no symptoms, affected patients in an outbreak area may not seek medical care. The virus can then be transmitted through other non-vector-borne transmissions, including sexual activities and blood transfusion. A point-of-care testing platform could be useful for screening asymptomatic patients to prevent possible Zika virus transmission, as well as for safeguarding the blood supply at blood-donation sites.

Current Zika tests require special equipment, and results can take up to 3 weeks to be reported to the attending physician. "Our invention is designed as a point-of-care device that can be performed at the physician's office, and the test results are available within an hour," Lednicky said. "Apart from being cheap and easy to use, the device does not require expensive instruments to perform, and the results are easy to interpret and thus do not require extensive training."

The new UF device features innovative ball-based valves that enable the storage and sequential delivery of reagents, a mixing unit where the reaction (virus lysis) takes place, and a paper-based detection unit that allows for detection of the results by the naked eye or with the use of a cellphone camera.

"We use an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method rather than (the) often-used polymerase chain reactions (PCR) so that thermal management is simpler," Fan said. The paper unit is placed in a commercially available coffee mug that provides a constant temperature for the development of the resulting color.

The next step for Fan and Lednicky will be to do a large-sample validation test using their device.

virus seroprevalence studies. Virol J. 2018; 15(1): 192
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
-------
Here we propose a strategy allowing implementing efficient and practicable large-scale seroepidemiological studies for Zika Virus (ZIKV). It combines screening by a commercial NS1 protein-based Zika IgG ELISA, and confirmation by a cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-based VNT). In post-epidemic samples from Martinique Island blood donors (a population with a dengue seroprevalence above 90 percent), this strategy allowed reaching specificity and sensitivity values over 98%. The CPE-based VNT consists of recording CPE directly under the optical microscope, which is easy to identify with ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 at day 5 pi. Overall, considered that CPE-based VNT is cost effective and widely automatable, the NS1 protein-based Zika IgG ELISA+CPE-based VNT combination strategy represents a convenient tool to expedite ZIKV seroprevalence studies.

[Sensitivity and specificity are essential for reliable serological diagnosis and seroprevalence to document Zika virus infections. The cross-reactivity between Zika and dengue viruses presents a challenge to accomplish these goals. The authors of the report above indicate that a combination of IgG ELISA and virus neutralizations test meet the sensitivity and specificity requirements for reliable serology. A February 2019 report addressing specificity and sensitivity of Zika diagnostic tests stated that although limited by a small number of samples, their data highlight the attainability of more accurate Zika virus diagnostic testing by combining molecular and serologic tests using different antibody classes, antigens, and methods and by monitoring an increase of IgG titers in follow-up serum samples (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/2/18-0166_article). - Mod.TY]

ref: Pereira JP Jr, Nielsen-Saines K, Sperling J, et al. Association of prenatal ultrasonographic findings with adverse neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with Zika virus infection in Brazil. JAMA Netw Open. 2018; 1(8): e186529
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Question: Are prenatal ultrasonographic findings in maternal Zika virus infection associated with adverse neonatal outcomes?
Findings: In this cohort study of 92 women with confirmed Zika virus infection in pregnancy, 37 had an abnormal result on prenatal ultrasonography that was associated with adverse composite neonatal outcomes. However, 23 of 55 neonates who had normal results on prenatal ultrasonography still had adverse neonatal outcomes.
Meaning: Abnormal results on prenatal ultrasonography are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes; however, a comprehensive neonatal evaluation is recommended for all infants with suspected in utero Zika exposure.

Abstract
--------
- Importance: Congenital Zika virus infection causes a spectrum of adverse birth outcomes, including severe birth defects of the central nervous system. The association of prenatal ultrasonographic findings with adverse neonatal outcomes, beyond structural anomalies such as microcephaly, has not been described to date.
- Objective: To determine whether prenatal ultrasonographic examination results are associated with abnormal neonatal outcomes in Zika virus-affected pregnancies.
- Design, setting, and participants: A prospective cohort study conducted at a single regional referral center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1 Sep 2015, to 31 May 2016, among 92 pregnant women diagnosed during pregnancy with Zika virus infection by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, who underwent subsequent prenatal ultrasonographic and neonatal evaluation.
- Exposures: prenatal ultrasonography.
- Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome measure was composite adverse neonatal outcome (perinatal death, abnormal finding on neonatal examination, or abnormal finding on postnatal neuroimaging). Secondary outcomes include association of specific findings with neonatal outcomes.
- Results: Of 92 mother-neonate dyads (mean [SD] maternal age, 29.4 [plus or minus 6.3] years), 55 (60%) had normal results and 37 (40%) had abnormal results on prenatal ultrasonographic examinations. The median gestational age at delivery was 38.6 weeks (interquartile range, 37.9-39.3). Of the 45 neonates with composite adverse outcome, 23 (51%) had normal results on prenatal ultrasonography. 11 pregnant women (12%) had a Zika virus-associated finding that was associated with an abnormal result on neonatal examination (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 11.6; 95% CI, 1.8-72.8), abnormal result on postnatal neuroimaging (aOR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.1-38.9), and composite adverse neonatal outcome (aOR, 27.2; 95% CI, 2.5-296.6). Abnormal results on middle cerebral artery Doppler ultrasonography were associated with neonatal examination abnormalities (aOR, 12.8; 95% CI, 2.6-63.2), postnatal neuroimaging abnormalities (aOR, 8.8; 95% CI, 1.7-45.9), and composite adverse neonatal outcome (aOR, 20.5; 95% CI, 3.2-132.6). There were 2 perinatal deaths. Abnormal findings on prenatal ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 48.9% (95% CI, 33.7-64.2%) and a specificity of 68.1% (95% CI, 52.9-80.1%) for association with composite adverse neonatal outcomes. For a Zika virus-associated abnormal result on prenatal ultrasonography, the sensitivity was lower (22.2%; 95% CI, 11.2-37.1%) but the specificity was higher (97.9%; 95% CI, 88.7-99.9%).
- Conclusions and relevance: Abnormal results on prenatal ultrasonography were associated with adverse outcomes in congenital Zika infection. The absence of abnormal findings on prenatal ultrasonography was not associated with a normal neonatal outcome. Comprehensive evaluation is recommended for all neonates with prenatal Zika virus exposure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the class of flavivirus that can be transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The number of Zika virus caused cases of acute infections, neurological disorders and congenital microcephaly are rapidly growing and therefore, in 2016 the World Health Organization declared a global "Public Health Emergency of International Concern." Anti-ZIKV therapeutic and vaccine development strategies are growing worldwide in recent years, however, no specific and safe treatment is available till date to save the human life. Currently, development of peptide therapeutics against ZIKV has attracted rising attention on account of their high safety concern and low development cost, in comparison to small therapeutic molecules and antibody based anti-viral drugs. In present review, an overview of ZIKV inhibition by peptide based inhibitors including E-protein derived peptides, antimicrobial peptides, frog skin peptides and probiotic peptides has been discussed. Peptides inhibitors have also been reported to act against NS5, NS2B-NS3 protease and proteasome in order to inhibit ZIKV infection. Recent advances in peptide based therapeutics and vaccine has been reviewed and their future promise against ZIKV infections has been explored.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Objective: Evaluate gross motor trajectories and the frequency of cerebral palsy in children with congenital Zika syndrome.
Design: Cohort study applying the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and the Bayley III Scales in infants from 6 to 18 months of age.
- Setting: The SARAH network, Rio de Janeiro.
- Participants: There were 39 infants whose diagnoses were established through clinical history, serology tests, and neuroimaging findings. Main outcomes and measures: Congenital Zika syndrome is associated with severe motor delays and is a risk factor to the diagnosis of cerebral palsy.
- Results: The Alberta Infant Motor Scale mean raw score at 6 months was 9.74 (SD 4.80) or equivalent to 2 to 3 months of motor developmental age. At the age of 12 months, 14.13 (SD 11.90), corresponding to 3 to 4 months of motor development age; the Bayley III Scales results correlated to the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (P less than .001) at this age. At 18 months, 15.77 (SD 13.80) or a motor development equivalent to 4 to 5 months of age; 35 of 39 children (89.7 percent) met criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral palsy.
- Conclusions and relevance: Gross motor development marginally progresses from 6 to 18 months of age. These individuals also displayed a high frequency of cerebral palsy.

ref: Gordon A, Gresh L, Ojeda S, et al. Prior dengue virus infection and risk of Zika: A pediatric cohort in Nicaragua. PLoS Med. 2019; 16(1): e1002726
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
- Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in northeast Brazil in 2015 and spread rapidly across the Americas, in populations that have been largely exposed to dengue virus (DENV). The impact of prior DENV infection on ZIKV infection outcome remains unclear. To study this potential impact, we analyzed the large 2016 Zika epidemic in Managua, Nicaragua, in a pediatric cohort with well-characterized DENV infection histories.
- Methods and findings: Symptomatic ZIKV infections (Zika cases) were identified by real-time reverse transcription PCR and serology in a community-based cohort study that follows approximately 3700 children aged 2-14 years old. Annual blood samples were used to identify clinically inapparent ZIKV infections using a novel, well-characterized serological assay. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to examine the relation between prior DENV infection and incidence of symptomatic and inapparent ZIKV infection. The generalized-growth method was used to estimate the effective reproduction number. From 1 Jan 2016, to 28 Feb 2017, 560 symptomatic ZIKV infections and 1356 total ZIKV infections (symptomatic and inapparent) were identified, for an overall incidence of 14.0 symptomatic infections (95% CI: 12.9, 15.2) and 36.5 total infections (95% CI: 34.7, 38.6) per 100 person-years. Effective reproduction number estimates ranged from 3.3 to 3.4, depending on the ascending wave period. Incidence of symptomatic and total ZIKV infections was higher in females and older children. Analysis of the effect of prior DENV infection was performed on 3027 participants with documented DENV infection histories, of which 743 (24.5%) had experienced at least 1 prior DENV infection during cohort follow-up. Prior DENV infection was inversely associated with risk of symptomatic ZIKV infection in the total cohort population (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.81; p <0.005) and with risk of symptomatic presentation given ZIKV infection (IRR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.86) when adjusted for age, sex, and recent DENV infection (1-2 years before ZIKV infection). Recent DENV infection was significantly associated with decreased risk of symptomatic ZIKV infection when adjusted for age and sex, but not when adjusted for prior DENV infection. Prior or recent DENV infection did not affect the rate of total ZIKV infections. Our findings are limited to a pediatric population and constrained by the epidemiology of the site.
- Conclusions: These findings support that prior DENV infection may protect individuals from symptomatic Zika. More research is needed to address the possible immunological mechanism(s) of cross-protection between ZIKV and DENV and whether DENV immunity also modulates other ZIKV infection outcomes such as neurological or congenital syndromes.

Author summary
--------------
Why was this study done?
- Zika virus (ZIKV) was introduced into the Americas--a region with high levels of dengue virus (DENV) immunity -- in 2015.
- Immunity generated by infection with one DENV serotype impacts the outcomes of subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype.
- Because ZIKV and DENV are closely related flaviviruses, it is possible that pre-existing DENV immunity may also impact susceptibility to Zika.
What did the researchers do and find?
- In 2016, we followed the introduction and spread of ZIKV in a large, long-term cohort of children in Managua, Nicaragua, to determine who was infected with ZIKV and, of those, who developed symptomatic infection. For most of these children, the history of prior DENV infection had been well characterized.
- We found that children with prior DENV infection had lower rates of symptomatic Zika than children who did not have prior DENV infection.
- However, we found that prior DENV immunity did not affect the overall rate of ZIKV infection in children.
What do these findings mean?
- These findings support the idea that prior DENV immunity might cross-protect against symptomatic Zika.
- Future studies are required to address the immunological mechanisms of cross-protection observed, as well as to examine whether prior DENV immunity impacts severe ZIKV infection outcomes such as neurological or congenital syndromes.

[This study is an excellent example of the benefits that long-term, prospective studies with large numbers of participants can bring to epidemiological and virological understanding of the occurrence of virus diseases in defined populations in a way that short-term studies cannot. In this case, the study illustrated cross protection that prior dengue infection can provide for symptomatic Zika virus infection in a pediatric population. The general presumption is that severe disease is associated with high viremias. I am not aware of a published report that confirms that for Zika virus infections but that does seem reasonable. Because of the antigenic cross-reactivity between dengue and Zika viruses, it seems reasonable to assume that Zika infection with viremia is suppressed, but with enough antigenic stimulation by Zika virus to elicit an antibody response and clear the virus. The cross-reactive dengue antibodies may buy enough time for the Zika antibodies to clear the virus with little or no disease. - Mod.TY]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
- Background: Little is known about the prevalence or incidence of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in settings affected by the 2015-2016 Zika pandemic and associated risk factors. We assessed these factors among household contacts of patients with ZIKV disease enrolled in a cohort study in Puerto Rico during 2016-2017.
- Methods: Household contacts of index case patients completed a questionnaire and gave specimens for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing to detect ZIKV infection. We measured the prevalence of ZIKV infection among contacts and associated individual and household factors, examined sexual transmission using a sexual-networks approach, and assessed incident infection among initially uninfected household contacts 2-4 months later.
- Results: Of 366 contacts, 34.4% had evidence of ZIKV infection at enrollment, including 11.2% by RT-PCR. Having open doors and windows that were either screened (prevalence ratio [PR], 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.6]) or unscreened (PR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5-4.1]) was associated with increased prevalence. Sexual partners were more likely to both be RT-PCR positive relative to other relationships (odds ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.1-4.5]). At follow-up, 6.1% of contacts had evidence of incident infection.
- Conclusions: This study identified sexual contact as a risk factor for ZIKV infection. Persons living with ZIKV-infected individuals should be a focus of public health efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease associated with fetal microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) symptomatology. It was first identified in a Rhesus macaque in Uganda in 1947 and later in humans (Zika fever). In 2015, ZIKV was notified in Northeast Brazil where it was associated with CNS alterations and with rapid epidemic spread. Considering that ZIKV infects Old World monkeys, the aim of this study was to follow its potential in neotropical primates. Here, we show the detection of ZIKV in marmosets and capuchin monkeys captured in Ceara state, Northeast Brazil. Nine (9/132) samples were positive by quantitative RT-PCR assay. Neutralizing antibodies in primates for ZIKV were also detected by PRNT. The ZIKV-positive samples were obtained from peridomestic animals captured in proximity to humans in areas with reports of ZIKV-associated microcephaly cases during the epidemic period. These results reiterate the molecular evidence of ZIKV infection in neotropical primates, and the temporal detection suggests that detection in primates occurred during the epidemic period in humans. However, a continuous surveillance is necessary to exclude the possibility of virus circulation and transmission in wild environments.

[A previously published report also provided evidence of natural infections of non-human primates by Zika virus in nature. That report indicates that samples from sera and oral swabs from 15 marmosets (_Callithrix jacchus_) and 9 capuchin-monkeys (_Sapajus libidinosus_) captured in Ceara state in Brazil were tested for Zika virus. Samples were positive by Real time PCR and sequencing of the amplified product from a capuchin monkey showed 100% similarity to other ZIKV from South America. This is the 1st report on ZIKV detection among Neotropical primates.

Further field studies are necessary to determine if Zika virus now is being maintained and can persist in nature in a sylvan (forest) transmission cycle in the same way that yellow fever virus is maintained in Brazil.

Although the Zika virus epidemic in the Americas declined in 2018, cases occurred in new localities in Asia. It is clear that Zika virus has not disappeared and new cases can be expected in 2019. If the virus has become established in wildlife in Brazil or other tropical ecosystems, its eradication is not possible with current technology. Improved diagnostic methods will help with accurate surveillance and diagnosis. New control measures for _Aedes aegypti_ are promising for more effective control of this major mosquito vector.

New, effective vaccines are in the pipeline. One hopes that they will successfully complete all 3 clinical trials and become licensed in the countries where they are needed at a cost that individuals and agencies in these countries can afford.

An interesting overview of the current Zika situation in the world has been reported by Tatum Anderson and Gary Humphreys (Bull World Health Organ 2019; 97: 6-7; https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/97/1/19-020119.pdf. - Mod.TY]
