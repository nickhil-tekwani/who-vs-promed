Foot and Mouth Disease update: FMD confirmed at slaughter on suspicion site
Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) has now been
confirmed at the premises in Surrey where
slaughter on suspicion was announced yesterday.
This follows further clinical examination and
results of preliminary laboratory tests. This now
becomes the eighth Infected Premises (IP8).
Minor changes are being made to the FMD
Protection Zone and Surveillance Zone in the
area. Our objective remains to stamp out FMD in this area.
Following the confirmed case of FMD at this
premises near Wraysbury (IP8) and taking account
of the epidemiological advice on the nature of
the spread of spread of FMD in the northern part
of the Egham Protection Zone, veterinary experts
have concluded that a number of cattle on four
(4) premises in the vicinity of IP8 have been
exposed to infection of FMD to such a degree that
they are likely to develop disease.
In keeping with our strategy to stamp out FMD,
these cattle and any other susceptible livestock
on these four premises will therefore be humanely
culled as dangerous contacts. This action is
regrettable but necessary in order to eradicate
disease in this area as quickly as possible.
The programme of intense surveillance and blood
testing, through which the case at Wraysbury was
detected, will continue in this area.
It remains vital that animal keepers are vigilant
for any signs of disease and continue to check animals twice a day.
See www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth for further
information on Foot and Mouth Disease.
The Defra helpline (08459 335577) is open from
8am-8pm Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm Sat-Sun for calls
relating to Foot and Mouth Disease and Bluetongue.

[The latest information and an updated map of the
surveillance and protection zones for both Foot
and Mouth and Bluetongue can be obtained at
http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/. DEFRA is
stressing the importance of increased biosecurity
and immediate notification by farmers. The
intensive surveillance which identified this case
and rapid culling of exposed cases are also
extremely helpful. All such measures, especially
checking cattle twice a day, should continue
with the utmost rigor in order to contain further disease spread. - Mod. PC]

Another foot-and-mouth outbreak
Farmers have been hit with a further outbreak of
a disease thought to have cost the industry �250 million since August.
The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the new
case of foot-and-mouth at a farm in Surrey would
have severe financial implications.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Defra) confirmed the disease had been found on an eighth farm.
It follows the announcement that animals had been
slaughtered after showing symptoms of the virus.
Defra said cattle at four other farms close to
the latest outbreak, near Wraysbury, would also
be culled after being exposed to the infection to
"such a degree that they are likely to develop disease".
A spokeswoman said a programme of "intense
surveillance and blood testing"would continue in
a bid to identify any further cases.
She urged farmers to remain vigilant and check their animals twice a day.
Anthony Gibson, spokesman for the NFU, said the
industry had prepared itself for the confirmation that the disease had spread.
He added: "The longer we keep getting these
outbreaks, the longer it will take to get the
export ban lifted. And that's costing at least
�2m a day. Since the foot-and-mouth outbreak was
confirmed in August, we think the total cost to
the farming industry is around �250m. That's in
terms of lost exports and lower meat prices.
"I think the vets are going to have to do some
intensive surveillance of cattle in that area
because we really must knock the virus on the head as quickly as we can."

[Of course, economic considerations are highly
significant in the case of Foot and Mouth
Disease, cost some 9 billion dollars in the 2001
UK epidemic. It is also important to remember
that there are psychosocial costs to individual
farmers which continue as long as the present outbreak is threatening.
A study of the consequences of the 2001 outbreak
summarized the psychosocial costs as
follows: The disease epidemic was a human
tragedy, not just an animal one. Respondents'
reports showed that life after the foot and mouth
disease epidemic was accompanied by distress,
feelings of bereavement, fear of a new disaster,
loss of trust in authority and systems of
control, and the undermining of the value of
local knowledge. Distress was experienced across
diverse groups well beyond the farming community.
Many of these effects continued to feature in the
diaries throughout the 18 month period.
(Psychosocial effects of the 2001 UK foot and
mouth disease epidemic in a rural population:
qualitative diary based study Mort, M; Convery,
I; Baxter, J; and Bailey, C. BMJ. 2005 November 26; 331(7527): 1234.
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1289318
Not only did the first wave of outbreaks
undoubtably cause psychosocial effects but each
further outbreak repeats the psychosocial
challenges to the people of the rural communities
involved and probably to some extent the whole
nation. The dilemma is that a great deal of
patience and very good surveillance work is
required now before the threat of infection can
be declared null and void. Even then, as we have
learned, the country will have to hold its
collective breath for some time. Under such
trying circumstances all that can be done is
encourage good reporting and hope that the
uncovering of new cases is indeed a prelude to
eradication rather than a harbinger of a
degenerating outbreak. It is useful to remember
that you have to identify all the cases before
they can be dealt with and case identification is
difficult and painful to everyone involved. But
the more intensely you carry out the case
identification function the better off you are in the end. - Mod. PC]

[3] Surveillance considerations

Disease was 'at large' in Surrey when the all-clear was given
ON September 7, the Government said it was
satisfied foot-and-mouth had been eradicated from
Surrey and all livestock movement restrictions were lifted the next day.
However, it has emerged that when Defra announced
the all-clear, the disease was at large on at
least two further premises near Egham, Surrey,
where disease lesions on cattle had not been reported.
According to the Government's epidemiological
report, cattle on Klondyke Farm could have been
showing signs of disease as early as August 13,
but it wasn't until September 18 that routine
veterinary checks confirmed foot-and-mouth disease.
It is during this month-long window that the
disease spread to the four (at the time of going
to press) other premises around Egham.
Vets confirm that disease lesions on the cattle
tested from Klondyke Farm were up to four weeks
old, making it the third infected premises,
despite being the fifth to be reported.
It is this farm that provides the missing link
between the August and September outbreaks.
The most likely route of the disease to Egham is
on a contaminated vehicle or person that made the
16km journey up the road from the Pirbright
animal health laboratory or from one of the first
two infected premises next to Pirbright.
Chief vet Debby Reynolds said the failure to
report the disease has set the foot-and-mouth
recovery process back by many weeks.
"Where practical, all cattle will now be blood
tested for FMD in the conjoined August and
September surveillance zones and in a small
number of other areas. This will take some weeks to complete."
Mrs Reynolds again urged farmers to check all
livestock once a week and cattle twice a week and
to report any symptoms of disease immediately.
"We need to eliminate the possibility of other
undisclosed infection due to the failure to
report the disease. Speed in foot-and-mouth
disease is theoverriding priority to get the
industry back to normal," she said.
Across the industry farmers have expressed anger
that the disease slipped through the net.
"For lesions not to be picked out for three to
four weeks is pretty appalling. Most farmers
would have picked up on something at least after
three to four days," said David Handley, from Farmers For Action.
But he said the farmer responsible should not be
vilified. "I am not going to get into a witch
hunt for farmers. It is the Government that has
made a million mistakes and has to answer questions over the outbreak."
Indeed questions are being asked why Defra, and
not the farmer, missed the case.
The 10km surveillance zone looks to be inadequate
when clearly the disease can jump substantially further - in this case 16km.
