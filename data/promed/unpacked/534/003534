[4] CT imaging of clinical case

https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200236


A 33-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a 5-day history of fever and cough of unknown cause. She indicated that she worked in Wuhan, China (the center of novel coronavirus outbreak) but had traveled to Lanzhou, China, 6 days before presentation to the hospital.

At admission, her body temperature was elevated to 39C (102.2F) and coarse breath sounds of both lungs were heard at auscultation. Laboratory studies showed leucopenia (white blood cell count: 2.91 Ãƒ-- 109/L). The white blood cell differential count showed 70.0% neutrophils and 0.1% eosinophils. There were elevated blood levels for C-reactive protein (16.16 mg/L; normal range, 0-10 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (29 mm/h; normal range, less than 20 mm/h), and D-dimer (580 ng/mL; normal range, 500 ng/mL). Unenhanced chest CT showed multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Figure, A) that did not spare the subpleural regions. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient's sputum was positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid.

On the basis of epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, chest images, and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was made. After receiving 3 days of treatment, combined with interferon inhalation, the patient was clinically worse with progressive pulmonary opacities found at repeat chest CT (Figure, B).

Unenhanced CT images in a 33-year-old woman. A, Image shows multiple ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs. Ground-glass opacities are seen in the posterior segment of right upper lobe and apical posterior segment of left superior lobe. B, Image obtained 3 days after follow-up shows progressive ground-glass opacities in the posterior segment of right upper lobe and apical posterior segment of left superior lobe. The bilateralism of the peripheral lung opacities, without subpleural sparing, are common CT findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.

Abstract:
The response to the novel coronavirus outbreak in China suggests that many of the lessons from the 2003 SARS epidemic have been implemented and the response improved as a consequence. Nevertheless some questions remain and not all lessons have been successful. The national and international response demonstrates the complex link between public health, science, and politics when an outbreak threatens to impact on global economies and reputations. The unprecedented measures implemented in China are a bold attempt to control the outbreak - we need to understand their effectiveness to balance costs and benefits for similar events in the future.

[Topics raised by the authors as key lessons learned (and in some cases not learned as well as hoped include international coordination,
information sharing, working with journalist and risk communication, informal reporting, healthcare workers and infection control, and economics of the outbreak.

The authors praise the speed of information sharing, recognizing that the information available at the early stages of an outbreak is always less than wanted by the global community. They also noted that there were still shortages of communications with journalists and explanations of risk communication.

The authors mention the challenges of the binary nature of declaring a PHEIC, with no intermediate options, creating challenges to declaring such an event, and the repercussions and interpretations of such a declaration.

There is mention that in the speed of the response, very extensive quarantine measures were implemented in China with millions of individuals impacted in an attempt to interrupt transmission (the count now is well over 40 million individuals). That being said, it isn't know how effective such a measure will be, how to determine the efficacy, and if effective, can other countries implement a similar action successfully? A fact that was mentioned in discussing this was that over 5 million people had already traveled outside of Wuhan city before the quarantine was imposed. - Mod.MPP]

S. Korea to test all people with symptoms of novel coronavirus
--------------------
South Korea said Monday [3 Feb 2020] that it will start testing everyone that shows symptoms of novel coronavirus, regardless of whether they have visited China recently, as the country braces for further spread of the fatal virus.

According to the health ministry, the new rules will go into effect as of Tuesday [4 Feb 2020] with doctors at the country's 532 clinics authorized to conduct detailed tests on people complaining of illness that may be linked to the new virus.

So far, only those with pneumonia-like conditions who had visited the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei Province have been tested.

As of Sunday [2 Feb 2020], the state health agency said it was testing 87 people in quarantine.

Common signs of infection include fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome and even lead to death.

The ministry added that of the 2nd batch of 333 people airlifted from Wuhan on Saturday [1 Feb 2020], none have tested positive for the illness.
