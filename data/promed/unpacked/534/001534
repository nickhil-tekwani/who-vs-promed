Pests and diseases have attacked at least 1600 hectares of rice
fields in 4 regencies in southern Central Java [Jawa Tengah], causing
major losses to local farmers.

Tri Gunawan, head of the Banyumas regency's Agricultural Pest and
Disease Laboratory, said that farmers in Banyumas, Purbalingga,
Cilacap, and Banjarnegara have been suffering from the attacks. "The
biggest losses are caused by rats and bacterial blight disease. The
other attacking pests are stemborer moths, rice ear bugs and mealy
bugs," he said.

The laboratory also recorded a sharp increase in cases of bacterial
blight disease, caused by high humidity during the dry season, which
created perfect conditions for the bacteria to grow.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas
oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ and has been reported from Asia, northern
Australia, Africa, and the USA. In Asia, millions of hectares of rice
paddies are severely affected every year, with reported yield losses
of up to 60 percent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of
leaves and wilting of seedlings. Blight lesions caused by severe
strains elongate over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a
striped appearance. Severe strains may also affect panicles. Mild
strains cause only small leaf lesions and may not lead to any
detectable yield loss. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the
lesions, contributing to the damage. Field patches infested with
bacterial blight have a whitish, ragged appearance.

BLB is favored by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity,
standing pools of water, and warm temperatures. The bacterium is
short-lived in soil and suspected to be seedborne but also to be
short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as
rice stubble or ratoons, and contaminated irrigation systems are
thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by
windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting
seedlings), and the high insect activity reported above from Central
Java may assist in the spread of the bacteria. Disease management
includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice
reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural
measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers), and use of
resistant crop varieties.
