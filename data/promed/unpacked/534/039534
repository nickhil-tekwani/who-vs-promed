The correction refers to posting "Anthrax, human, laboratory diagnosis"
(20011218.3057), paragraph 4 of which stated, incorrectly, that "_Bacillus
anthracis_ is typically hemolytic on sheep blood agar".

Some short comments:
1. Contaminations nowadays mostly take place when the blood culture is
drawn and not in the laboratory.
2. In our lab (and maybe in others) the second most common contaminant is
_Corynebacterium_ sp.
3. In automatic blood culture systems usually a set of 2 bottles is used;
when done manually some include a third bottle (hypertonic medium).
4. Although Professor Shapiro gave instructions for identification of _B.
anthracis_, I think it´s worth pointing out that a comment in the posting
itself ("noting that _Bacillus anthracis_ is typically hemolytic on sheep
blood agar") is WRONG.
5. Since a patient with _B. anthrax_ septicemia is likely to show signs of
severe disease with typical symptoms, why not ring up the clinician when
_Bacicllus_ sp. is [apparently detected in a blood culture?

[Several readers have pointed out, correctly, that _B. anthracis_ is not
hemolytic on blood agar. It is doubtful if _B. anthracis_ is ever hemolytic
or even motile, though both have been claimed on occasion. I thank everyone
who pointed out this error. ­ Mod.MHJ
