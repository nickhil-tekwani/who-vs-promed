Leptospirosis patients are found in coastal areas like Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg and also in rice cultivating areas of Vidarbha and tribal areas in Pune district.

To combat cases of leptospirosis, which rise during the monsoons, the state government is adopting the control strategy of vaccinating milch [milk?] animals, which play a part in transmitting the infection. The disease, which is caused by the _Leptospira_ bacteria, spreads through animal urine and has claimed 19 lives in Maharashtra this year [2015].

"While the quantity of urine discharged by mice is just around 1-3 ml, cattle like cows, buffaloes and bullocks, which are reared by people in rural areas, pass around half to 3 litres of urine. In cattle sheds, the urine and dung is mixed, and the floor, if it is kuccha[?], tends to remain damp, helping the bacteria breed and infect people," said a senior health department official.

He added that they had come across cases where people who did not even go to farms, where hosts like rodents transmit the disease through contaminated water and mud, had been affected. This was because these patients had come in contact with cattle urine.

The official said that hence, these animals would be vaccinated by the state animal husbandry department to prevent spread of the infection through renal shedding. "The volume of cattle urine is more, and people come into contact with it more often," he explained.

In 2011, the number of leptospirosis patients was 476, and the deaths stood at 48. However, in the next year, this rose to 510 and 16, respectively. In 2013, the number of patients fell to 453, while deaths rose to 20. 2014 was a better year in terms of cases, with a lower number of patients (179) and deaths (7) being reported.

As of Monday [14 Sep 2015], a total number of around 130 patients and 19 deaths have been reported in Maharashtra. The highest number of deaths have been reported from Mumbai (18), followed by Thane (1).

The state health department has identified 45 villages as belonging to the high-risk category. Workers in primary health centres (PHCs) in districts with a high incidence of leptospirosis have been asked to make weekly visits to conduct surveys about patients; diagnostic kits and medicines have been made available in the PHCs, rural, sub-district, and district hospitals, and blood component separation units are available in all districts except Palghar.

Fever, body and muscle aches, especially in the area under the back and in the calves, red eyes, and headache, and even breathlessness, are among the symptoms.

[Leptospirosis is a fresh water-borne zoonotic disease, and cases of this spirochetal infection increase in India with the onset of the monsoon season and flooding.

A map of the Indian state of Maharashtra that shows the locations of Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg and Pune is available at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/maharashtra/. Vidarbha is the eastern region of the Indian state of Maharashtra (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidarbha).

The following was extracted from the Merck Veterinary Manual available at http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/generalized_conditions/leptospirosis/leptospirosis_in_ruminants.html:

"Bovine leptospirosis vaccines available in the USA and Canada are pentavalent and contain leptospiral serovars Pomona, Grippotyphosa, Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, and Hardjo. These vaccines provide good protection against disease caused by each of these serovars, with the possible exception of serovar Hardjo. Experimental and field evidence indicates that some traditional five-way leptospirosis vaccines do not provide good protection from serovar Hardjo infection. New vaccines have been introduced to address this issue. If a primary goal of a vaccination program is protection of cattle against Hardjo, care should be taken in selection of a vaccine product. In general, annual vaccination of all cattle in a closed herd or low incidence area, or twice-yearly vaccination in an open herd or high incidence area, is the most effective approach to control."
