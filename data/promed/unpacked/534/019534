Influenza update number 343 (based on data up to 26 May 2019)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza detections increased overall. The 2019 influenza season appeared to have started earlier than previous years in Australia, Chile, South Africa, and New Zealand.
-- Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated in Oceania and South Africa.
-- Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in South America.
- In Southern Asia and South East Asia, influenza activity was low overall, with exception of Bangladesh and Cambodia.
- In the Caribbean, Central American countries, and the tropical countries of South America, influenza and RSV activity were low in general.
- In Eastern, West and Middle Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity returned to interseasonal level in most countries.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 100 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 13 May 2019 to 26 May 2019 (data as of 7 Jun 2019 04:13:54 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 46 002 specimens during that time period. 5285 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 3157 (59.7%) were typed as influenza A and 2128 (40.3%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 620 (30.5%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 1414 (69.5%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 34 (3%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 1104 (97%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Seasonal [influenza A/H1N1] killed 3 people in Yangon, and the remaining [influenza A/H1N1] suspected patients were already analyzed at labs to confirm diagnosis, yesterday [Wed 19 Jun 2019], said Deputy Director General Dr. Tun Myint, who is also head of the Public Health Department in Yangon. In Yangon region, 20 [influenza A/H1N1] suspected patients were found as of [Wed 19 Jun 2019]. Among them, 7 had tested positive for [influenza A/H1N1] virus and 3 out of 7 H1N1-positive patients died.

"According to the seasonal flu report, in Yangon, there were 12 [influenza A/H1N1] suspected patients from January to the end of May (2019). Among 12 patients, 1 was confirmed as [influenza A/H1N1] positive patient. The laboratory test said that the remaining 11 patients didn't suffer from seasonal influenza. However, 7 out of 20 suspected patients are infected with [influenza A/H1N1] virus in June (2019). At present, 5 have been diagnosed with the disease and 3 already died. The 1st death was a [29-year-old] woman from Kawthmu Township, Yangon region. She died 17 days after giving birth. The 2nd death was a 75-year-old from Sanchaung township. He received medical treatment at the Yangon General Hospital on [Sun 16 Jun 2019] but he died on [Mon 17 Jun 2019]. The 3rd was 32-year-old man from Dagon Seikkan township and he died on the same day [Mon 17 Jun 2019]. 2 men were buried on [Wed 19 Jun 2019]," said Dr. Tun Myint.

Dr. Nay Wun Thein from Yangon General Hospital said that the blood of victims who had died from suspected [influenza A/H1N1] virus had been diagnosed at the National Health Laboratory in Yangon General Hospital. If they will get blood test, they can determine whether the virus is [influenza A/H1N1] or not. "The Yangon General Hospital requested us to bring a man's body who died from [influenza A/H1N1]. The dead man was about 60 years old, from Yangon. We buried him at the Yay Way Cemetery," said an official from Information Department of the Free Funeral Service.

The Health and Sports Minister had directed the officials concerned to keep enough medicines at the public hospitals and start monitoring as [influenza A/H1N1] may occur this season. The World Health Organization sent recommendations over the control of seasonal [influenza A(H1N1)pdm09] in 2017. So, the Health Ministry is carrying out preventive measures against the seasonal flu. Myanmar found that there were 514 [influenza A/H1N1] suspected patients in 2017. 97 had tested positive for [influenza A/H1N1] virus and 12 patients had died. But, there was no outbreak of seasonal influenza [influenza A/H1N1] last year [2018], according to Dr. Tun Myint.

[Influenza is a viral infection that affects mainly the nose, throat, bronchi and, occasionally, lungs. Infection usually lasts for about a week, and is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, aching muscles, headache and severe malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat and rhinitis. The virus is transmitted easily from person to person via droplets and small particles produced when infected people cough or sneeze. Influenza tends to spread rapidly in seasonal epidemics.

Most infected people recover within 1 to 2 weeks without requiring medical treatment. However, in the very young, the elderly, and those with other serious medical conditions, infection can lead to severe complications of the underlying condition, pneumonia, and death.

It is imperative to maintain epidemiological and laboratory-based surveillance, while ensuring that healthcare facilities are prepared to manage upsurge of cases requiring hospital admission in the coming weeks. In addition, efforts are required to promote immunization of high-risk groups using recommended vaccine. - Mod.UBA
