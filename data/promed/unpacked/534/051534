Q fever outbreak in the Chamonix Valley, France, summer 2002
-----------------------------------
At the end of July 2002, the Direction Departementale des Affaires
Sanitaires et Sociales (DDASS) was informed of several dozen patients who
had consulted their general practitioners (GPs) in Chamonix with fever,
myalgia, and severe headaches. Most of the patients had serum transaminases
2-3 times above normal level. Most patients recovered spontaneously after
5-10 days. Several patients were hospitalised.
In mid-August 2002 the diagnosis of Q fever was confirmed for 10 patients
by the presence of Q fever phase II IgM antibodies >25 in serum.
An epidemiological investigation was carried out by the Cellule
Interregionale d'Epidemiologie de Lyon (CIRE), the Centre National de
Reference des Rickettsies (CNR), the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS),
and the DDASS, to identify the mode of transmission and the source of the
outbreak, and to implement appropriate control measures.
Cases were identified through the GPs of the Chamonix valley, the local
hospital, the medical laboratory in the valley and the CNR.
Case definitions used in the investigation:
Possible Q fever: individual residing in, or visiting Chamonix valley since
June 2002 and having presented after 20 Jun 2002 with fever >39 degrees C,
accompanied by at least 2 of the following symptoms: myalgia, nausea, chills.
Probable Q fever: a possible case with an increase of transaminases AST and
ALT, above normal.
Confirmed Q fever: a possible or probable case with positive serology for Q
fever (phase II IgG >/= 100 and phase II IgM at >/=25).
Up to 30 Aug 2002, 79 cases were identified: 25 possible, 32 probable and
22 confirmed cases. All were adults between 17 and 92 years of age. The M:F
ratio was 1.8:1. Eleven individuals required hospital treatment.
Place of residence was known for 71 cases; 57 (80 percent) live in the
commune of Chamonix, 11 (15 percent) live in another town in the valley, or
close to the valley, and 3 are French tourists.
An exploratory study carried out on 19 confirmed cases suggested airborne
contamination from one or several excretory herds (sheep, goats, or
cattle), possibly moving to summer pastures, or from manure-spreading
areas. None of the cases has a high-risk profession for Q fever infection
(for example, stock breeder, abattoir technician, etc.). During the
exposure period, 4 individuals had close contact with ruminants, 4 had
eaten cheese made from unpasteurised milk, of which one only had eaten
locally produced cheese. None had drunk unpasteurised milk and 7 had
domestic animals. The cases questioned did not attend an event involving
animals. Neither is there an abattoir or knacker's yard [a knacker buys
worn-out domestic animals or their carcasses, usually for animal feed or
fertilizer] in the valley.
The epidemic curve, which is not complete for week 33 and after, due to the
delay in getting the onset dates, suggests a persistent source of
contamination. [see webpage at above URL for Figure: Cases (possible,
probable and confirmed) of Q fever by week of onset of symptoms, Q fever
outbreak, Chamonix Valley, 2002.]
A case control study is in progress to determine risk factors and
transmission methods (movement, consumption of unpasteurised milk, direct
or indirect contact with manure or animal herds, participation in an event
involving indirect or direct contact with animals, etc.). In parallel,
information is being gathered on the animal herds present in the valley
since June 2002. These enquiries should further clarify the hypothesis on
the source of contamination and allow us to put control measures in place.
Recommendations to the public
Since June 2002, residents and visitors of the Chamonix valley may have
been exposed to _Coxiella burnetii_, the agent causing Q fever.
Consequently, the Ministry of Health recommends that persons belonging to
high-risk groups (pregnant women, persons with valvular cardiac disease, or
immunosuppressed persons) who were resident or who stayed in the Chamonix
valley between June and the present time consult a doctor to get a
diagnostic test, and, if necessary, suitable medical treatment.
An alert was sent to the European national health authorities via the
European surveillance network for alert action on 27 Aug 2002.

[This is a nice summary of the investigation to date. In the absence of
identification of the source of the outbreak (airborne, ingestion of
contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products) implementation of control
measures is difficult (an understatement). We look forward to additional
information as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
