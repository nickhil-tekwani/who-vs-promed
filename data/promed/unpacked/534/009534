Fatal Rat Bite Fever - Florida and Washington, 2003
------------------------------------------------
Rat bite fever (RBF) is a rare, systemic illness caused by infection with
_Streptobacillus moniliformis_. RBF has a case-fatality rate of 7-10
percent among untreated patients (1). _S. moniliformis_ is commonly found
in the nasal and oropharyngeal flora of rats. Human infection can result
from a bite or scratch from an infected or colonized rat, handling of an
infected rat, or ingestion of food or water contaminated with infected rat
excreta (1). An abrupt onset of fever, myalgias, arthralgias, vomiting, and
headache typically occurs within 2-10 days of exposure and is usually
followed by a maculopapular rash on the extremities (1).
This report summarizes the clinical course and exposure history of 2
rapidly fatal cases of RBF identified by the CDC Unexplained Deaths and
Critical Illnesses (UNEX) Project in 2003. These cases underscore the
importance of 1) including RBF in the differential diagnoses of acutely ill
patients with reported rat exposures and 2) preventing zoonotic infections
among persons with occupational or recreational exposure to rats.
Case Reports
Florida
-------
In early Sep 2003, a previously healthy woman aged 52 years visited an
emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of headache, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, lethargy, right axillary lymphadenopathy, progressive myalgias,
and pain in her distal extremities. On physical examination, she was
afebrile and hypotensive (blood pressure: 82/40 mmHg) with left-sided
abdominal tenderness and scleral icterus; no rash was noted. Laboratory
tests indicated a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 13 800
cells/microL, thrombocytopenia (71 000 platelets/microL), elevated alanine
aminotransferase of 112 U/L, elevated aspartate aminotransferase of 154
U/L, elevated total bilirubin of 5.8 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen of
55 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, where she became
increasingly hypoxic with marked anemia (hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL) and
increasingly severe thrombocytopenia (32 000 platelets/microL). She was
treated with ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin for possible Gram
negative bacillary sepsis and received 2 blood transfusions; however, she
died approximately 12 hours after admission. A maculopapular rash was noted
postmortem. No autopsy was performed.
Peripheral blood smears obtained before death revealed abundant neutrophils
and intracellular collections of filamentous bacteria [for figure see
original URL above - Mod.LL]. Premortem blood from a tube containing no
additives or separators was inoculated onto a blood agar plate and
incubated in CO2 at 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). After 72 hours, the
culture demonstrated slight growth of Gram-negative filamentous bacteria.
UNEX was contacted for assistance, and diagnostic specimens were submitted
to CDC for further laboratory evaluation. At CDC, the isolate was
subcultured onto media enriched with 20 percent solution of sterile normal
rabbit serum and incubated in a candle jar for 48 hours. Biochemical
analyses identified the bacterial isolate as _S. moniliformis_. The 16S
rRNA gene sequences amplified from DNA extracted from the patient's blood
and the bacterial isolate were consistent with _S. moniliformis_.
The patient had been employed at a pet store. She was bitten on her right
index finger by a rat in the store 2 days before symptom onset and 4 days
before arriving at the ED. She self-treated the wound by using antiseptic
ointment immediately after being bitten. In addition, she had regular
contact with several pet rats, cats, a dog, and an iguana at her home;
however, no bites from these animals were reported. None of the animals was
tested for _S. moniliformis_.
Washington
----------
In late Nov 2003, a previously healthy woman aged 19 years was pronounced
dead on arrival at a hospital ED. No laboratory studies were performed in
the ED. An acquaintance reported that the patient had experienced a 3-day
history of fever, headache, myalgias, nausea, and profound weakness
without cough, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Before her transport to the ED,
she exhibited anxiety, confusion, and labored breathing. ED staff noted
that she appeared jaundiced. The body was transported to the coroner's
office, where an autopsy was performed.
Cultures of blood and tissue from autopsy were negative for pathogenic
organisms. A toxicology screen was negative. Serologic assays for
leptospirosis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and viral hepatitis
were negative for recent infection. Histopathology revealed findings
suggestive of a systemic infectious process that included disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the liver,
heart, and lungs. UNEX was contacted for assistance, and project staff
facilitated the submission of diagnostic specimens to CDC for further
laboratory evaluation. Immunohistochemical assays performed at CDC for
_Leptospira spp_., _Bartonella quintana_, spotted fever and typhus group
rickettsiae, flaviviruses, hantaviruses, and influenza viruses were
negative. Clusters of filamentous bacteria were identified in sections of
the liver and kidney by using a silver stain. The 16S rRNA gene sequence
amplified from DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed samples
of liver and kidney was consistent with _S. moniliformis_.
The patient worked as a dog groomer and lived in an apartment with 9 pet
rats. One pet rat with respiratory symptoms had recently been prescribed
oral doxycycline after having been evaluated at a veterinary clinic.
Doxycycline was subsequently used to treat a 2nd ill rat. None of the rats
was tested for _S. moniliformis_. The patient had no known animal bites
during the 2 weeks preceding her death.

MMWR Editorial Note:
---------------
Although rapidly fatal pediatric cases of RBF have been described
previously (2,3), similar mortality among adults has not been reported.
Mortality attributed to severe systemic complications (e.g., endocarditis,
myocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, or multiple organ failure) has been
documented in certain adult patients (1,4). Both patients described in this
report died within 12 hours of presentation, allowing little opportunity
for assessment and treatment. These case reports demonstrate that infection
with _S. moniliformis_ can cause fulminant sepsis and death in previously
healthy adults. As a result, prevention of severe disease might depend on
increasing the awareness of appropriate risk-reduction activities and
possible symptoms of RBF among persons who have exposure to rats.
Intravenous penicillin is the treatment of choice, and prompt therapy can
prevent severe complications (1). Because rapid laboratory confirmation of
infection with _S. moniliformis_ might not be possible, clinicians should
consider initiating empiric therapy for patients with a compatible clinical
presentation and exposure history.
Clinicians should consider RBF in the differential diagnosis for
unexplained febrile illness or sepsis in patients reporting rat exposure.
Initial symptoms might be nonspecific, but a maculopapular rash and septic
arthritis commonly develop (1,5). However, as demonstrated by the cases in
this report, patients can have severe disease before the onset of typical
symptoms. Despite its name, approximately 30 percent of patients with RBF
do not report having been bitten or scratched by a rat (1,5). Risk factors
for RBF include handling rats at home and in the workplace (e.g.,
laboratories or pet stores). RBF is rare in the USA, with only a few cases
documented each year (1,6,7). However, because RBF is not a nationally
notifiable disease, its actual incidence has not been well-described.
In the cases described here, diagnosis of RBF was delayed in part because
of the inability to rapidly isolate or identify _S. moniliformis_. If
infection with _S. moniliformis_ is suspected, specific media and
incubation conditions should be used (8) (See Box in original URL). In the
absence of a positive culture, identification of pleomorphic Gram-negative
bacilli in appropriate specimens might support a preliminary diagnosis (1).
In the event of an unexplained death in a person with rat exposure,
performing an autopsy might also be critical to identifying an etiology.
Because of the high prevalence of colonization and asymptomatic infection
with _S. moniliformis_ among rodents, testing and treatment of rats is not
practical. Disease prevention should center on risk reduction among persons
with frequent rat exposure. Adherence to simple precautions while handling
rats can reduce the risk for RBF and other potential rodent-borne zoonotic
infections, wound infections, and injuries. Persons should wear gloves,
practice regular hand washing, and avoid hand-to-mouth contact when
handling rats or cleaning rat cages (1,9). If bitten by a rat, persons
should promptly clean and disinfect the wound, seek medical attention, and
report their exposure history. A tetanus toxoid booster should be
administered if more than 10 years have lapsed since the last dose (9,10).
Clinicians should contact their state health departments for assistance
with diagnosis of unexplained deaths or critical illnesses and cases or
clusters of suspected RBF or other zoonotic infections. UNEX coordinates
surveillance for unexplained deaths possibly attributed to infection
throughout the United States. Cases are reported by a network of health
departments, medical examiners/coroners, pathologists, and clinicians.
Epidemiologic and clinical data are collected, and available clinical and
pathologic specimens are obtained for reference and diagnostic testing at
state, CDC, and other laboratories. State and local health departments may
contact UNEX for assistance with the evaluation of unexplained deaths that
occur in their jurisdictions.

[Bacillary rat bite fever due to _S. moniliformis_ is not commonly
diagnosed in the USA, and these cases are particularly noteworthy due to
rapid fulmination in an adult. As noted in the posting, infection may also
occur following ingestion of contaminated food or drink. One such outbreak
was reported in 1926 from Haverhill, Massachusetts and was apparently
linked to contaminated milk (Parker F Jr., Hudson NP: The etiology of
Haverhill fever (erythema arthriticum epidemicum) Am J Pathol 1926;2:357-79).
The spirochete _Spirillium minus_ can also cause RBF, the spirillary
form. _S. minus_ is associated with a significant proportion of cases in
Asia but is rare in the USA. In Japan, the disease is referred to as
sodoku (so = rat; doku = poison). - Mod.LL]
