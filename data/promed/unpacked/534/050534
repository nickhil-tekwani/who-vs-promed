[Cases continue to be reported from Saudi Arabia, with 5 cases reported since 1 Jan 2015 (1 from Taif on 3 Jan 2015, 1 from Dammam on 3 Jan 2015, 1 from Najran on 5 Jan 2015, and the 2 from Riyadh reported above on 6 and 7 Jan 2015). With these newly reported cases, the total number of cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now up to 830, including 358 deaths (case fatality rate holding at 43.1 percent). Of these 5 newly reported cases, 4 had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities (all but the 45-year-old Saudi male from Dammam reported on 3 Jan 2015). In terms of identified possible high risk exposures, one had a history of animal exposure (the 76-year-old Saudi male from Taif reported on 3 Jan 2015), one had a possible history of animal exposure that was under investigation (the 45-year-old Saudi male from Dammam reported on 3 Jan 2015), and one had a history of contact with a suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infected individual in the healthcare environment.

Conclusion: transmission within the healthcare environment continues, and possible transmission from animals (camels) continues to result in sporadic cases.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Jordan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On 25 Dec 2014, the National IHR Focal Point of Jordan notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:
A 70-year-old, non-national male from Quriat City, Saudi Arabia who developed symptoms on [20 Dec 2014]. He was admitted to hospital in Quriat City on [21 Dec 2014]. The patient discharged himself from the hospital against medical advice and travelled to Jordan where he was admitted to a private hospital on [22 Dec 2014]. The patient was transferred back on [26 Dec 2014] to Saudi Arabia where he is presently admitted to a hospital in Quriat City. He has co-morbidities. The patient has history of raw camel milk consumption. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is critically ill and on mechanical ventilation.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for this case.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 previously reported MERS-CoV cases.

Globally, the WHO has been notified of 945 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 348 related deaths.

[This case was reported by the media on 26 Dec 2014 (see MERS-CoV (68): Jordan, Saudi Arabia, RFI 20141229.3057913), at which time there were varying reports on the nationality of this case. There was a 70-year-old Saudi male reported from Quriat on 26 Dec 2014, but was listed in stable condition at the time of report. At that time there was mention that a history of animal exposure was under investigation. On 4 Jan 2015 there was a report of a recovery of a 70-year-old Saudi male in Quriat. One suspects these Saudi reported cases are the same as the case reported by Jordan, with the exception that the WHO reports that the patient was in critical condition on mechanical ventilation.

The WHO report of "the death of 3 previously reported MERS-CoV cases" may well refer to the 3 deaths reported on 14 Dec 2014 (see MERS-CoV (66): Saudi Arabia, new cases, deaths 20141216.3037408), as the more recent MERS-CoV associated deaths in Saudi Arabia were reported on 1, 5 and 7 Jan 2015. Those 3 deaths from 14 Dec 2014 occurred in a 22-year-old expat male from Taif, a 61-year-old Saudi male from Najran and a 60-year-old Saudi male from Taif.

With the addition of this case, this now brings the global total of cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO to 945, including at least 348 deaths (case fatality rate 36.8 percent).

Quriat City is located in the north of Saudi Arabia in Aljawf province, approximately 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Jordan (see map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qurayyat,_Saudi_Arabia).
