CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and
the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Enteritidis infections linked to alfalfa sprouts and spicy
sprouts. There is no connection between this outbreak and the European
_E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak. Investigators are using DNA analysis of
_Salmonella_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify
cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

As of 27 Jun 2011, a total of 21 persons with the outbreak strain of
_S._ Enteritidis have been reported from 5 states: Idaho (3), Montana
(7), North Dakota (1), New Jersey (1), and Washington (9). Among
persons for whom information is available, illnesses began between 12
Apr 2011 and 7 Jun 2011. Ill persons range in age from 12 years to 77
years old, with a median age of 35 years. 71 percent are female. Among
the 10 ill persons with available information, 3 (30 percent) persons
have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Collaborative investigative efforts of local, state, and federal
public health and regulatory agencies have linked this outbreak to
Evergreen Produce brand alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts. The sprouts
were distributed to various customers in Idaho, Montana, Washington
State, and possibly to retailers in neighboring states. CDC, FDA, and
state and local public health partners are continuing surveillance to
identify new cases and trace potentially contaminated products. CDC
will continue to update the public on the progress of this
investigation as information becomes available.
