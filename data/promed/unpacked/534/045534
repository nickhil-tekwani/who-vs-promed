[1] Africa: measles outbreaks, US travel alert

The US CDC issued a new travel regarding measles outbreaks in various African countries.

In Africa, health officials in the countries listed below have reported measles outbreaks, meaning the number of confirmed measles cases is higher than normal.

The CDC says 'keep in mind that destinations reporting measles outbreaks are not the only places where the infection is a risk. Locations, where measles is common, may have many cases, but not be considered to have an outbreak.'

The CDC's Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions notice published on 15 Sep 2020, stated 'All travelers to Africa, including infants and pre-school aged children, should be fully vaccinated against measles, according to CDC immunization schedules.'

Vaccination with a measles-containing vaccine is the best way to make sure that you are protected prior to traveling abroad, says the CDC.

There are 2 measles-containing vaccines available in the United States: measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) for those aged 6 months and older, and measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for children aged 1 through 12 years.

If you are 12 months of age or older you need 2-doses of measles vaccine to be fully protected. Infants 6 through 11 months of age should receive 1-dose of vaccine, though this dose does not count as the 1st dose in the routine childhood vaccination series.

The CDC added 'You are also protected if you have laboratory confirmation of a past measles infection or if you were born before 1957.'

If you are not sure if you or your travel companions are fully protected against measles, schedule an appointment to see your healthcare provider at least one month before traveling so that you have enough time to get vaccinated.

Some people should not get a measles-containing vaccine or should wait. If you don't think you can safely receive a measles-containing vaccine, talk to your doctor and consider making alternative travel plans, says the CDC.

The African countries list in this Level 1 Travel Alert are as follows: Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan.

An updated list of suggested travel vaccines is published by Vax-Before-Travel

[Note that DRC is included in the list of African countries with a measles alert, even though the outbreak is considered over and the number of cases in the country is decreasing [see next report]. This is because there continue to be high numbers of cases in the country, still presenting a risk to unvaccinated non-immune people. - Mod.LK

[2] Democratic Republic of Congo: measles decline

DRC measles in sustained decline, 'Dependent on continuing vaccine program efforts'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported today [21 Sep 2020] that the ongoing measles outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is showing a sustained decline in new cases and deaths-reporting 245 suspected cases and 1 death during the week ending 6 Sep 2020.

WHO reminds while the declining trend in this long-standing measles outbreak is to be welcomed, this is dependent on continuing vaccine program efforts, without which cases will rebound.

Major infant vaccine programs have been ongoing in 2019 and 2020, with a total of 18.4 million children aged 6-59 months reached between October and December 2019.

From the start of the outbreak on 31 Dec 2018 to 6 Sep 2020, there has been a total of 382 370 cases and 7071 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.8%).

In 2020 to date, 70 899 suspected cases have been reported, including 1026 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.4%). This is a decrease compared to the same period in 2019, when there were 184 289 suspected cases and 3650 deaths reported.

[This is wonderful news and a credit to the immunization program in the DRC. On 25 Aug 2020, the DRC declared the end of a 25-month outbreak of measles that claimed the lives of more than 7000 children under 5 years old. The outbreak was staunched by vaccination on a massive scale, in which millions of children and infants were immunized. This is especially noteworthy since COVID-19 makes it more difficult to maintain the program. - Mod.LK
