[The above information was also included in a media report published by the Chinese news agency Xinhua on Fri 27 Mar 2015, indicating a transport ban within 1 km around the infected farm for poultry, eggs, poultry manure and used bedding since Thu 26 Mar 2015. Within this area there is one other poultry farm, "which will be tested for avian influenza." Based on European rules, all 22 000 laying hens will be culled, by the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA), a necessity because the low pathogenic variant avian influenza can mutate into a highly contagious and highly pathogenic form, fatal for chickens.

Two weeks ago bird flu of the mild H7N7 was found at a poultry farm in Barneveld, in the province of Gelderland, after which around 30 000 laying hens were culled. See http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=274629.

Final, full serotyping of the current LPAI H7 strain is anticipated soon. - Mod.AS
