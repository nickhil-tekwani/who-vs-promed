Hemorrhagic fever deaths in Abbottabad
--------------------------------------
At total of 4 deaths have been reported as a result of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and [or?] dengue fever, while the National
Institute of Health has confirmed 4 more cases of CCHF virus at the
Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad (Khyber Pukhtoonkhwa province).

Deputy Medical Superintendent ATH Dr Junaid also confirmed that
laboratory reports conducted by the National Institute of Health
(NIH) on 4 more patients confirm that they have CCHF but no one at
ATH was able to tell if these patients were still admitted or have
been discharged from the hospital. Earlier 4 Congo-positive patients
were discharged from the hospital a few days ago and even their
whereabouts are not known to the hospital authorities.

So far, more than 150 cases of dengue fever have been confirmed in
Abbottabad. Executive District Officer (EDO) Health Dr Zafeer claimed
that the administration of Ayub Teaching Hospital (ATH) is hiding
facts and is not cooperating with the health department despite the
fact that the maximum number of such cases was admitted in ATH.

Hazara Commissioner Sahibzada Muhammad Anees has also confirmed the
presence of 37 cases of dengue fever other than those being treated
in the ATH. Blood samples of 167 suspected patients were sent to NIH
of which 37 have been confirmed as having dengue fever.

[It is unclear from the information provided in this press report
whether these CCHF cases in Abbottabad are new cases or cases already
included in the list of confirmed cases issued on 26 Oct 2010 by the
Pakistani Ministry of Health and the WHO. - Mod.CP]

CCHF virus: Health Ministry unaware of 12 deaths
------------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry turns out to be unaware of 12 deaths due to
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus infection. 12 people
among 9 health officials in Holy Family Hospital Rawalpindi (Punjab
province) have died due to this virus.

Responding to questions raised in the National Assembly in this
regard, the Parliamentary Secretary for Health Mehreen Razzaq Bhutto
said that the Ministry of Health is unaware of deaths in such large
numbers [as a consequence of] CCHF and she could [not] answer the
question [until further] information in this regard [becomes
available]. She said that the deaths might be due to dengue virus as
symptoms of CCHF and dengue are similar.

[The only conclusions possible are that CCHF and dengue fever are
prevalent throughout Pakistan and although case numbers are
increasing the the precise numbers of cases and fatalities are
uncertain. There are more cases of dengue fever than CCHF which is
not unexpected in view of the different modes of transmission of
these 2 hemorrhagic fevers (mosquito-borne versus tick-borne transmission).

Overall there is evidence of confusion in diagnosis, deficiencies in
record-keeping and deliberate deception. The statement of the
Parliamentary Secretary for Health Mehreen Razzaq Bhutto deserves
commendation for its clarity and honesty.
