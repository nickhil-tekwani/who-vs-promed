A new case of anthrax has been identified in the territory of
Sakartvelo [Georgia]. As reported by the GHN, a 27-year-old patient
from Lagodekhi was taken to the Tbilisi Infectious Disease Hospital
with an ulcer on the right hand. He told the doctors that he was going
to send his cattle meat for sale, but after checking, it was not
taken.

The new patient is a butcher. The doctors have assumed that he was
infected with anthrax when he was cutting the meat. According to [the
hospital] experts, at this stage, the patient's state is regarded as
stable.

In late August 2011, anthrax was diagnosed in a 45-year-old man in the
Kakheti region; he was also transferred to the Infectious Diseases
Hospital in Tbilisi [see 20110904.2698]. The health status of the
patients is estimated as moderate.

[It is proving to be an active year for anthrax in Georgia, with 3
recorded previous outbreaks in livestock (Samtskhe-Javakheti, Kakheti,
& Imereti). While the numbers of livestock outbreaks are not large,
their impact on humans is significant. For example: 2004 (6 bovine
outbreaks, 45 human cases), 2005 (3, 19), 2006 (3, 38), 2007 (4, 42),
2008 (7, 62), 2009 (10 bov and one sheep/goats, 38), 2010 (9, 28). The
skeptic in me would believe that there is probably an under-reporting
of livestock cases where no human cases result. Their vaccination
policy is modest, with under one percent cattle vaccinated.

Lagodekhi is a short distance from the Azerbaijani border (5.2 km) and
then only a further 12.2 km to Balakan. Lagodekhi and Balakhan are
neighbouring cities in the same valley system draining into the
Caspian Sea. So, we can assume that essentially the same livestock
management systems apply on either side of the border. Azerbaijan
claims total livestock vaccination coverage and reports infrequent
outbreaks, e.g., single outbreaks in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and more
limited human cases, e.g., 2005 (5), 2007 (17), 2008 (12), and 2010
(1). Hopefully, the Azerbaijan animal health programme is more
effective than their Georgian neighbour's, but they would be wise to
view Georgian beef with caution.
