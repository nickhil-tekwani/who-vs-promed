Incidence of measles 'worrying' as cases increase by 149%
-------------------------------------------------
The number of measles outbreaks in Ireland and Europe has been
described by health authorities as “worrying” after a 149 per cent
rise in cases was revealed. The Health Service Executive Health
Protection Surveillance Centre published its annual report yesterday,
with a breakdown of the incidence of notifiable diseases for last
year.

Measles cases increased by 149 per cent, with 403 cases notified
compared with 162 cases in 2009. The Centre said 108 of the cases last
year resulted in hospitalisation. Cases predominantly occurred in
children who had not been vaccinated against this vaccine-preventable
diseases, it added. Other European countries also saw measles
outbreaks last year.

In contrast the number of cases of mumps fell by 53 per cent, with 293
cases reported compared to 620 in 2009. The number of MRSA and HIV
infections, as well as certain gastroenteric diseases and
healthcare-associated infections, all fell. MRSA rates in Ireland are
now at their lowest rates since surveillance began in 1999, the centre
said. It found such bloodstream infections fell by 14 per cent in
2010, with 305 cases notified compared with 355 the previous year. HIV
cases fell by 21 per cent in 2010. There were 331 cases notified
compared with 395 cases in 2009. The highest number of new HIV
diagnoses in 2010 were among men who have sex with men, with 40.5 per
cent of new cases occurring in this category. During 2010 the
incidence of all types of invasive pneumococcal disease fell by 25 per
cent compared with 2008, when the vaccine was first introduced. One
young child who was not vaccinated died from pneumococcal meningitis
in 2010.

Health Protection Surveillance Centre director Dr Darina O’Flanagan
said the decline in many notifiable diseases was very welcome and was
due to strong public health surveillance and hard work in the battle
against infectious disease. She said a catch-up MMR vaccination
campaign was needed to control and eliminate the continued
transmission of measles, mumps and rubella in Ireland, as there had
been “a worrying number of measles outbreaks in Ireland and Europe
during 2010”.

SA [South Australia] Health has issued a public health alert about the
highly infectious measles virus following a confirmed case in South
Australia this week. SA Health's chief medical officer Professor Paddy
Phillips said the 22-year-old girl from metropolitan Adelaide most
likely acquired the virus while overseas.

"Measles is highly contagious among people who are not fully
immunised, and is spread through coughing and sneezing," he said. "The
illness begins with fever, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes, followed
by a rash which begins on the head and then spreads down the body.
Complications of measles can be severe."

During the infectious period, the teen visited the following sites:

- Oriental Hotel, 120 Magill Rd, Norwood, on 11 December from 4 to
8.30pm;

- Foodland, 177 Glen Osmond Rd, Frewville, on 12 December from 1 to
3.30pm;

- Fountain Corner Family Practice, 57-59 Unley Rd, Parkside, on 13
December from 8.45 to 11.30am; 16 December from 9.30 to noon and again
from 2 to 4.45pm;

- Blockbuster, 365 Shepherd's Hill Rd, Blackwood, on 14 December from
6.30 to 8.30pm;

- Hansen Yuncken Building, ground floor, 191 Fullarton Rd, Dulwich,
on 12 December from 8.45 to 7.15 pm and on 15 December from 9 to
11.30am;

- Sound Diagnostic Radiology, 257 Fullarton Rd, Parkside, on 16
December from 11.30am to 2.15pm;

- Ashford Hospital Emergency Department on 17 December from 5pm to
midnight.

"We are advising anyone who was in these locations during these times
to be alert for symptoms over the next two weeks and if they are ill
to see a doctor," Professor Phillips said. "It is very important that
people phone their GP ahead of any visit and mention why they are
attending, so that precautions can be taken to avoid spreading disease
to others. An alert has been issued to General Practitioners advising
them of this case.
