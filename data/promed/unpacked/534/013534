The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources says the whirling disease
parasite has been found in trout of the upper Green River below
Flaming Gorge dam.

However, Roger Wilson, chief of the DWR's Aquatic Section, said the
agency's fish pathologists and biologists don't think the parasite
will seriously impact trout in the river.

The parasite was found during recent testing of 4 rainbow trout taken
from the popular northeastern Utah recreational site.

Most of the trout in the 8-mile stretch below the dam are brown trout,
a species that has proven resistant to whirling disease.

Rainbow trout are thought particularly vulnerable to whirling disease
when they are small, but the fish of the DWR stocks in the upper Green
River average 8 inches long, too large for the parasite to
significantly affect them.

"We don't expect trout in the upper Green River to be greatly
affected," Wilson said Thursday [8 Sep 2011]. "The upper Green River
should remain one of the best trout fishing waters in the country."

Whirling disease afflicts fingerlings and fry with skeletal
deformations and neurological damage that make them "whirl" instead of
swimming normally. The disease makes it harder for them to feed and
makes them more vulnerable to predators.

[Whirling disease affects fish in the trout and salmon (salmonid)
family. By damaging cartilage, whirling disease can kill young fish
directly or cause infected fish to swim in an uncontrolled whirling
motion. This can make it impossible for them to escape predators or to
effectively seek food.

Whirling disease is caused by a microscopic parasite called _Myxobolus
cerebralis_. The parasite was introduced to the United States from
Europe in the 1950s and has spread to many streams across the country.
The whirling disease parasite has been found in wild fish and fish
hatcheries in 25 states.

Once established in a stream, the parasite cannot be eradicated, nor
can its worm host, without significantly damaging the ecosystem.
Whirling disease has no known human health effects. Currently, there
is no known treatment for affected fish. However, practice management
in hatcheries can reduce the risk.

The disease does not affect humans, only fish in the trout and salmon
family. The infective stage of the parasite can penetrate human skin
and tissues, but it does not survive at a human's natural body
temperature. Therefore, the disease is harmless to humans, and even if
an infected fish is consumed, it will not affect humans.

The disease can be quite devastating to fish and is a concern for all
when it is found in a body of water. Anglers can help by disinfecting
boats, boots, lines, live-wells, and other equipment prior to arrival
at a new/different body of water.
