European wheat could be potentially at risk from a new strain of
yellow rust [stripe rust] that has caused large-scale yield losses
across the major wheat belt in the USA. The strain survives at higher
temperatures than current races, produces many more spores and is
more aggressive in its attack, Mogens Hovmoller, from Denmark's
University of Aarhus, together with Eugene Milus from the University
of Arkansas have discovered. And with just one or 2 mutations it
could easily infect European varieties, Dr Hovmoller says.

Prior to 2001 yellow rust was confined mainly to a few parts of the
northwestern states of the USA. Then it spread and is now the most
severe wheat disease in the region, with annual losses of 10 million
tonnes/year. The disease extended into areas previously considered
too hot. The new strain grows much faster on universally
rust-susceptible wheat and is also able to produce enough spores at
high temperatures to keep the rust epidemic going. DNA analysis has
confirmed the new race has a completely different origin to European rust.

Worryingly for European farmers, isolates with a very similar make up
have been found in rust screens set up in Denmark. These atypical
races are able to grow on certain varieties used in the screen. At
the moment, European varieties are protected by varietal resistance,
but Dr Hovmoller suggests the new strain would only require maybe
one, 2, or 3 mutations before it would be able to infect many new
European varieties.

Research has found the rate of evolution for yellow rust to adapt to
new cultivars is very fast. "It has a high mutation rate. That could
be because the disease has no sexual stage, so it needs to mutate to
continue to evolve," he explains.

And the new strains ability to produce many more spores increases its
chance of succeeding, he warns. "We definitely need resistance to
this strain otherwise it will be a big problem."

[Wheat stripe rust (also called yellow rust) is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly
in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants, and reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield
losses may vary from 40 up to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some
barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of
grass species. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the
cropping season. Since the fungus interferes with seed development,
infection early in the crop cycle is more damaging than infection
after seed fill has concluded. Early discovery of infection at any
stage of the crop cycle is important so action can be taken to limit
the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum.

Spores are dispersed by wind and mechanical means. The fungus needs
living plants to survive between seasons, it cannot survive on seed,
stubble, or in soil. Volunteer plants may generate a "green bridge"
providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management includes
the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control
of volunteer cereals. New pathogen strains with increased virulence
have been reported from several wheat growing areas. For example in
Australia, strains apparently overcoming one of the major stripe rust
resistance genes used in wheat breeding have emerged in recent years
posing a serious problem to farmers.

The report above states that strains genetically 'very similar' to
the US heat tolerant strain have been found apparently spontaneously
infecting susceptible varieties in experimental screening plots. No
information is given, however, whether the Danish strains are thought
to be introduced variants of the US strain, or due to mutations
having occurred locally but resulting in similar properties of
enhanced virulence. In any case, this early alert may give European
wheat breeders and farmers a chance to be prepared.
