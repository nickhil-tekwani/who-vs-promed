Indonesia: 11 Human Cases of Avian Influenza Awaiting Confirmation
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia, which has already registered 16 avian influenza deaths, is
awaiting test results from the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11
more suspected infections. "The latest report we have shows that
there has been a total of 23 cases of confirmed infection, 16 of them
fatal, while we are still awaiting the result of WHO tests on 11
other probable cases, 4 of them fatal," said an official at the
health ministry's bird flu information center.
The official, who identified himself as Nurdin, said local tests on
the 11 probable cases had tested positive but that only tests
conducted by the WHO laboratory in Hong Kong would officially confirm
infection cases. "But from experience, the WHO tests have only
confirmed the results of our tests," Nurdin said.
The latest WHO test results obtained at the weekend [4-5 Feb 2006]
showed that a 22-year-old chicken vendor who died last month [January
2006] and a 15-year-old teenager who died on Wed 1 Jan 2006 were
Indonesia's latest deaths from the H5N1 virus, health ministry
official Hariyadi Wibisono has said. 2 more cases had also been
confirmed by the Hong Kong-based laboratory, but the patients
remained alive, bringing the total of confirmed bird flu cases in
Indonesia to 23, of which 16 have died," Wibisono told AFP.
Nurdin could not give details of the 2 new surviving bird flu cases.
A health official on the weekend [4-5 Feb 2006] said the 2 were a
5-year-old boy from Lampung province on Sumatra island and a
15-year-old boy from the West Java town of Padalarang.
Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous nation, was initially
accused of covering up the virus, which is transmitted by close
contact with infected poultry. Many Indonesians live with chickens
around their homes, even in urban areas, creating ideal conditions
for infections to pass from the birds to humans. A WHO team warned
last month [January 2006] that Indonesia needed to focus more on
measures aimed at preventing such virus transmission and also on
preparations for a possible human pandemic.

[If the 11 suspected cases of avian influenza are confirmed by the
WHO-accredited laboratory in Hong Kong, the number of human cases
reported in Indonesia will become 34 and the number of deaths 20.
That would make the overall total of human cases in Eurasia 176, at
least 92 of whom have died. - Mod.CP]
