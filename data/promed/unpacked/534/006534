If prion uptake and possible transmission to rodents through plants bears out in further study, it might point to a potential difficulty for reestablishment of black footed ferrets [BBFs] in parts of their past territory if:

1. Prairie dogs uptake the prions, and
2. If BBFs turn out to be susceptible to getting transmissible mink encephalopathy [TME]. Domestic ferrets can contract it, but the incubation time is much longer than it is for mink.

Here are a few studies in reference to TME (including its possible origin from diseased sheep or from fallen cattle, perhaps variants from either):
http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/72/3/589.long,
http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/75/11/2947.long,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822718,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4235697/.

Their continued presence in the wild is not the only threatened one at potential risk from prion disease pressures, according to this Big Horn paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23938169.

A good many years ago, I read a paper on chickens given feed created from ungulate offal that stated that either the crops or the gizzards retained prions for a while after death. Honestly, I cannot recall the length of time or location, and failed to locate the paper. However, I did find that more recent research finds chicken prions but that they apparently have interesting differences compared to mammalian prion disease:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19492390,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863561,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3226046/.

The links are potentially interesting articles, but I did not read them thoroughly. My vision, unfortunately, often limits my time spent reading recently.
