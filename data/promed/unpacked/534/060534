inhabitants was 2.15. The specific morbidity in individual age groups was
highest in age group 45  54 years (that means 3.3 per 100,000
inhabitants). Most cases were recorded in the Southern Moravia region
(41.4%). The most affected areas were West Bohemia, Southern Bohemia and
Southern Moravia regions. The most frequent forms of the disease were
glandular (38.7%) and ulcero-glandular (33.6%). The source of this disease
