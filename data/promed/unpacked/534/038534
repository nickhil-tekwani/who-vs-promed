[Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) serotype of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the subfamily _Paramyxovirinae_, family _Paramyxoviridae_.

According to the European Commission section on Animals under Health and Consumers; see http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/newcastle_en.htm: "In case of disease outbreaks specific control measures including killing of infected animals and those suspected to be infected or contaminated need to be implemented in the infected holdings and areas around the outbreaks. Council Directive 92/66/EEC requires setting up a 3km protection zone and 10km surveillance zone. The protection zone measures must be applied for at least 21 days, and the surveillance zone measures must be applied for at least 30 days after the cleansing and disinfection of the outbreak holding."

Council Directive 92/66/EEC of 14 Jul 1992, introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle disease, is available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31992L0066 (Note: to see the complete document, scroll down to the "Text" section). - Mod.CRD
