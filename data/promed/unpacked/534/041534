I would like to comment on the hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Kosovo.
When I worked with Doctors of the World in Kosovo in 1995 (on a tuberculosis
project) we became aware of a simultaneous outbreak of Crimean Congo
Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) and Hanta Fever Renal Syndrome (HFRS). It was about
the same time of the year.
The infectious disease specialists in Prishtina were very good at
distinguishing the two syndromes with which they were very familiar, based
on the clinical presentation and epidemiology. CCHF has a much lower
proportion of renal complications than HFRS, where this is obviously one of
the major presentations. The physicians also knew in which areas in Kosovo
and for which occupations (for example monks living in the woods, shepherds,
etc.) CCHF or HFRS is characteristic.
The only Albanian physician in the department whom I remember was a Dr.
Salih, who was very good. I am not sure if the Serbian physicians are still
there. Any of them would probably be happy to assist if there are questions.
