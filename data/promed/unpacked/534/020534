Influenza-A in Mongolia (Winter, 1998 - 1999)
---------------------------------------------------
Summary:
The influenza epidemic that struck Northern China in December and early
January was mirrored in Mongolia. The dates of the start, peak, and
abatement of cases tracked closely to what we know of the situation in
Beijing. The clinical description of the cases, the age distribution,
the high attack rates, and the low mortality were also similar.
As was the case in Northern China, many individuals who had received
the influenza immunization earlier in the season (expatriates living
in Mongolia) were not protected, although some newer data may
question that assumption in the Mongolian epidemic.
Studies are under way in the virology lab in Mongolia to more fully
define the virus, and there is strong evidence supporting the
supposition that the virus which struck Mongolia was the same as that
which struck Northern China.
The Mongolian Ministry of Public Health did an excellent job of
tracking the epidemic locally and reporting their findings to the
Mongolian population.
[The following would all greatly improve our surveillance
capabilities in this very important corner of the world:
- Facilitation of disease reporting from Mongolia to international forums,
- increased assistance in the form of technical assistance in virus
identification,
- guidelines for case definition and reporting,
- advice about clinical management,
- direct provision of laboratory supplies and testing equipment, and
- facilitating the process of passing virus samples to CDC.

[WHO has an office in Mongolia, which in the past was very assiduous
in passing on reports of plague cases to Geneva HQ. One supposes that it is
now forwarding information on the flu - Mod.JW
