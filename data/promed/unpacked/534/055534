[Thanks to Dr. Mosbach Gerhard of the University of Zurich for calling this
incident to our attention on 23 September 97. The following is a news
report of the Lassa fever case in Germany. --es
MAINZ, Germany, Sept 22. German health authorities issued a health warning
for possible contacts of a Ghanaian national Monday after the man died of
Lassa fever.
The 37-year-old man died here Saturday, nine days after he was admitted to
hospital with symptoms similar to a common cold.
The viral disease is fatal in up to 20 percent of known cases.
Health officials were alerted in the Frankfurt and Duesseldorf regions to
find possible contacts and medical staff who spoke to the man, a spokesman
for the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin said.
The regional Rhineland-Palatinate health ministry said 50 people had already
undergone medical tests.
The Lassa virus, first identified in Niger in 1969, is transmitted between
humans by body fluids and airborne infection. [Evidence for human to human
transmission suggests that direct contact is more important than airborne
trasmission. --es
Last year 200 people were infected with the disease in Sierra Leone. More
than 60 people died.

[The Lassa virus, first identified in Niger in 1969, is transmitted between
humans by body fluids and airborne infection. [Lassa virus was first
described in an outbreak in Nigeria NOT Niger, in a mission hospital on the
Jos Plateau. In another outbreak in Liberia, it was discovered the disease
was spread from rats _Mastomys natalensis_ to humans by urine. Lassa fever
was one of the earliest of deadly, hemorrhagic fevers to be dealt with in
terms of international travel and quarantine. An American was transported
home using an Apollo space capsule for isolation, and a German national was
stuck in Ibadan, Nigeria in 1974 until ostensibily safe transport and
quarantine measures were developed. Mod. pc
