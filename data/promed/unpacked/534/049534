Citrus canker found on 6 properties, disease continues to spread
--------------------
Citrus canker has been found on 6 properties in this coastal enclave, as
the disease continues to spread through South Florida. State Department of
Agriculture spokesman Mark Fagan stated that Wednesday during a meeting
with Highland Beach officials that a 2 year old quarantine in Boca Raton
and its suburbs, Boynton Beach and parts of West Palm Beach is likely to be
expanded, and that a decision on whether to expand the quarantine will be
made when a Palm Beach County survey is complete in about 6 weeks.
6 properties in Highland Beach's Bel Lido neighborhood, on Intracoastal
Drive and Tranquility Drive, have citrus trees with canker, a disease that
causes fruit to fall prematurely, weakening trees. It is not harmful to humans.
Hurricane winds worsened the spread of canker, which is ravaging the
state's USD 9.1 billion citrus industry.

[Citrus canker caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv _citri_
(Xac) continues to spread in southern Florida. Eradication of infected
citrus trees is the primary means of disease management. Local spread of
Xac is primarily by wind-driven rain, overhead irrigation and contaminated
equipment and long-distant movement is by infected plant material.
The extent of natural spread depends entirely on local environmental
conditions, including presence or absence of the Asian citrus leaf miner
_Phyllocnistis citrella_. Much success was achieved by implementing a
policy of destroying infected trees and pruning all green wood on trees
within 50 feet of the infected trees, but in the latest eradication program
with citrus leafminer involvement, the general policy of removing infected
trees plus exposed trees within a 1900 ft radius is now in place.
This epidemic of citrus canker (1995 - present) has impacted many areas of
Florida including 15 counties. - Mod.DH]
