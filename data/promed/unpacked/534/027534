WU virus - a new polyomavirus
-----------------------------
We report the identification of a novel polyomavirus present in respiratory
secretions from human patients with symptoms of acute respiratory tract
infection. The virus was initially detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate
from a 3 year old child from Australia diagnosed with pneumonia. A random
library was generated from nucleic acids extracted from the nasopharyngeal
aspirate and analyzed by high throughput DNA sequencing. Multiple DNA
fragments were cloned that possessed limited homology to known polyomaviruses.
We subsequently sequenced the entire virus genome of 5229 bp, henceforth
referred to as WU virus, and found it to have genomic features
characteristic of the family _Polyomaviridae_. The genome was predicted to
encode small T antigen, large T antigen, and three capsid proteins: VP1,
VP2, and VP3. Phylogenetic analysis clearly revealed that WU virus was
divergent from all known polyomaviruses. Screening of 2135 patients with
acute respiratory tract infections in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and
St Louis, Missouri, United States, using WU virus-specific PCR primers
resulted in the detection of 43 additional specimens that contained WU
virus. The presence of multiple instances of the virus in two continents
suggests that this virus is geographically widespread in the human
population and raises the possibility that WU virus may be a human pathogen.
The research article describing this novel virus is published in the 4 May
2007 edition of PLoS Pathogens as: Gaynor AM, Nissen MD, Whiley DM, Mackay
IM, Lambert SB, et al. Identification of a novel polyomavirus from patients
with acute respiratory tract infections. PLoS Pathogens 2007; 3(5);

[It remains to be elucidated whether WU virus is a pneumonia-related
pathogen or merely a passenger virus. According to the 8th Report of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses the family _Polyomaviridae_
comprises 13 distinct virus species, each with a specific host range in
nature and in cell culture. Different species infect primates, rodents,
bovines, and birds. Simian virus 40 is the type species and there are 2
human polyomaviruses -- JC polyomavirus and BK polyomavirus -- which have
worldwide distributions.
Involvement of these viruses in kidney disease is occasionally observed and
their presence can complicate tissue transplantation. Most polyomaviruses
have oncogenic potential in rodents and one of the human viruses, JC
polyomavirus, can induce brain tumours in monkeys. The pathogenic potential
of polyomaviruses is diverse and the disease-producing potential of WU
virus will be a subject of considerable interest. - Mod.CP]
