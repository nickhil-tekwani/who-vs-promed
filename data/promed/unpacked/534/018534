A comment on the mutation rate of hepatitis viruses
------------------------------------------------------------------
The statement that: "State Health Department spokeswoman Claudia
Hutton says that because the virus can mutate in people's bodies,
it's too late for genetic tests to establish whether the infections
stemmed from Finkelstein's needle technique." is misleading for
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and controversial at least for hepatitis C
virus (HCV).

HBV mutation rate has been estimated to be 4.2 x 10(-5) (Fares MA,
Holmes EC: J Mol Evol. 2002 Jun;54(6):807-14. A revised evolutionary
history of hepatitis B virus (HBV)). There are very few reports of
long-term longitudinal studies; the recently published study by our
lab (C. Osiowy et al.: Molecular evolution of Hepatitis B virus over
25 years. J. Virol. 2006, Nov: 80,(21) 10307-10309) indicated a
slightly higher rate of 7.9x10(-5). To put it in lay language, the
range of evolutionary rate in that study varied from 0.36 to
2.4 nucleotide changes per genome per year! Therefore if the
unfortunate incident/transmission started in 2004 it is definitely
not too late to establish virus relatedness based on phylogenetic analysis.

Although HCV mutation rate is higher than that of HBV,
"fingerprinting" of HCV isolates obtained as a result of vertical
transmission shows significant similarity at least within the 1st
several years after mother-to-infant transmission event.

Rather than underestimate the power of phylogenetic analysis as a
tool in molecular epidemiology the state department perhaps does not
want to get involved in this type of investigation judging from the
comment of the same spokesperson on the Newsday website (5 Dec 2007,
Twelve test positive for hepatitis B and C*); "Although she said the
health department cared intimately about each patient's disease
diagnosis, what would be the purpose to figure out a 2nd or 3rd
transmission except to sue Dr. Finkelstein? That's not the
health department's job. That's why people hire attorneys" she said.
