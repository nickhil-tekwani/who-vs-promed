Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, 2006 - USA (5 states)
-------------------------------------------------------
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rodent-borne viral disease
characterized by severe pulmonary illness and a case-fatality ratio
of 30-40 percent. Sin Nombre virus causes the majority of HPS cases
in the United States, and the deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_)
is its predominant reservoir. This report describes an increase in
human cases of HPS reported during January to March 2006 from
Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, and Washington State. The
findings emphasize the need for renewed attention to reducing the
risk for hantavirus exposure.
Human HPS
------
HPS is characterized by a febrile illness (i.e., temperature >101.0
degrees F) associated with bilateral diffuse interstitial edema of
the lungs developing within 72 hours of hospitalization in a
previously healthy person; radiographically, the edema can resemble
acute respiratory distress syndrome (1). Annually, the majority of
HPS cases occur in spring and summer; however, the seasonality of HPS
can vary by elevation, location, and biome, and cases have been
identified throughout the winter and early spring (2). Since
recognition of the disease in 1993, CDC has confirmed 438 cases of
HPS (as of May 2006) reported from 30 states among residents of 32
states (illustrated graphically in the original text); 35 percent
(154) of these cases were fatal.
During the period Jan to Mar 2006, a total of nine confirmed cases
(based on onset date) of HPS were reported from Arizona, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Texas, and Washington. Of the 9 cases, 6 were in
Arizona and New Mexico. During 1994 and 1999, a similar number of HPS
cases was confirmed nationally in the same 3-month period. Both years
were characterized by environmental conditions (e.g., increased
rainfall and vegetative biomass) during the preceding 1 to 2 years
that promoted increased rodent populations. This, in turn, increased
virus transmission in the rodent populations and increased exposure
risk for humans (2, 3, 4). During 1994, 1999, and 2000, more than 6
cases were confirmed in the first 3 months of each year, and all had
a high yearly total of HPS cases (illustrated graphically in the
original text)). Nine cases of HPS were identified in the first 3
months of 2006, suggesting that a greater risk for human hantavirus
infection might exist this year.

MMWR Editorial Note
------------
Hantavirus infection can occur after exposure to infectious virus in
rodent saliva or excreta. HPS typically begins as headache, fever,
and myalgia and is soon followed by pulmonary edema, which often
leads to severe respiratory compromise; thrombocytopenia, presence of
immunoblasts, and hemoconcentration are characteristic laboratory
findings (1). Other than supportive care, no treatment exists for
hantavirus infection. The probability of surviving HPS increases with
early recognition, hospitalization, and aggressive pulmonary and
hemodynamic support (5,6). All health-care providers are strongly
encouraged to become familiar with the signs and symptoms of HPS (7)
and to report suspected cases immediately to their state health departments.
Since 1994, CDC has sponsored continuous monitoring of rodent
populations at study sites in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and
Montana (8). Larger rodent populations and subsequent higher
prevalence of hantavirus infection in rodent populations have been
associated with higher risk for hantavirus exposure in human
populations (2,9,10). Environmental conditions, including increased
rainfall during 2005, likely contributed to increased rodent
populations in certain areas of the Southwest. Some rodent monitoring
sites have continued to have high rodent population densities or high
levels of hantavirus infection during spring 2006, suggesting an
increased risk for hantavirus infection among human populations in
certain rural areas (J Mills, PhD, personal communication, May 2006).
Public health education (especially among residents of rural areas of
the western United States) regarding the importance of risk-reduction
measures should be emphasized, especially in spring and summer, when
the majority of previous HPS cases have been identified. Most persons
with HPS are thought to have been infected in and around their homes;
therefore, limiting opportunities for peridomestic exposure to
rodents and their excreta is particularly important.
CDC's Seal Up! Trap Up! Clean Up! campaign offers detailed
information on preventing transmission of diseases from rodents and a
comprehensive rodent-control website <http://www.cdc.gov/rodents>.
Measures to prevent HPS include: 1) sealing up holes inside and
outside the home to prevent entry by rodents, 2) trapping rodents
around the home to help reduce the rodent population, 3) cleaning up
potential rodent food sources and nesting sites, and 4) taking
precautions when cleaning. CDC also provides detailed recommendations
for HPS risk reduction (10).
Additional information regarding HPS is available from local or state
health departments; through the hantavirus hotline, 404-639-1510; on
