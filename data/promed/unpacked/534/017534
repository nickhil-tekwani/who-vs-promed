Buffalo in park struck by BTB
-----------------------------
Bovine Tuberculosis (BTB) is believed to have infected the majority of Cape
Buffalo herds in the Kruger National Park (KNP). The disease infects the
lungs and lymph glands and is not immediately fatal, but reduces the
animal's life span by about 2 to 3 years.
According to Raymond Travers, spokesman for the KNP, BTB is present in 60
percent of buffalo herds in the southern section of the park. There are
currently about 32 000 buffalo in the park, with only an isolated
population in the remote northern section believed to be free of BTB.
The disease is believed to have entered the park in the late 1950s, when
buffalo came into contact with domestic cattle.
Although the disease has been confined to the south of the park, studies
show it is spreading north, and concerns have been raised about its impact
on the park's lion population.
"Lions that prey on buffalo are particularly vulnerable to BTB, and we have
found a high incidence of the disease in lions in the southern section,"
Travers said.
He said the fact that BTB was spreading, combined with the tendency of
nomadic male lions from the north to move into the southern areas, raised
concerns of its impact on Kruger's lions. Kruger is home to about 2000
lions and according to Travers, males are more vulnerable to BTB than females.
"Males in a pride get priority at a kill, preferring to eat the soft tissue
areas such as the lungs first, which are most affected by the disease," he
said.
Gus Mills, a carnivore specialist and scientist with South African National
Parks (SANParks), said the first 5 years of a study on the impact of BTB in
lion populations had just been completed. 2 lion prides in different areas
of the park, one of which is infected with BTB, were used as a sample study
to determine the impact of the disease.
"Although we found a high incidence of BTB in certain lions, we have
determined that the disease has not had a negative impact on the whole of
Kruger's lion population," he said. Rather, Mills said, the disease was
restricted to individual lions or prides.
"Infected lions do not necessarily die from BTB. However, it may reduce
their life span by a few years," he said.
BTB is not a curable disease, but according to Mills, can be prevented and
successfully managed.
"It (BTB) is virtually impossible to eradicate, as it is carried by
herbivores other than buffalo as well, but it can be prevented to a certain
extent," he said.
David Mbunda, chief executive officer of SANParks, said the situation was
under control and there was no threat of Kruger's losing its lion population.
