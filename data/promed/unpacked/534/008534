In a follow-up on the Lassa fever outbreak recently declared in Guinea, the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene of Guinea reported a 2nd confirmed case on 29 Apr 2022. The individual, a 24-year-old male from Koumassan village, Wokouama sector, has no known epidemiological linkage to the 1st case.

Lassa fever is endemic in parts of West Africa, including Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, where the natural reservoir of the Lassa virus, the _Mastomys_ rodents, has been found. Sociocultural practices, including hunting for the rodents, have been known risk factors for Lassa fever infection in the region.

The World Health Organization says the newly declared Lassa fever outbreak in Guinea is of grave concern in the context of a country with a fragile health system that has faced multiple disease outbreaks, such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, yellow fever, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities are currently conducting in-depth epidemiological investigations to determine the source of infection.

[This is the 2nd report of a Lassa fever virus infection in Guinea this year (2022). Lassa fever cases have occurred before in Guinea, one earlier this year (2022), last year (2021), and in previous years, although sporadically. West Africa, including Guinea, is endemic for the Lassa fever virus.

The follow-up epidemiological studies for this case by the Ministry of Health are prudent indeed. Orientation of the population where these cases occurred is an important preventive measure. Assuming that these cases acquired the virus from a rodent host, keeping the household environment free of rodents is a good preventive practice.
