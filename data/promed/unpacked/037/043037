Wilson County [North Carolina (NC), USA] health officials confirmed an 8th case of legionnaires' disease Monday [30 Jun 2014] linked to Wilson Pines, a nursing and rehabilitation facility. Joyce Wetherington, Wilson County Health Department spokeswoman, could not comment on whether that person was a visitor or facility patient.

In addition, health officials here said there are other suspected cases of the disease that are not related to any facility. Last year [2013], 12 percent of legionnaires' cases reported in the state were in Wilson County, according to state statistics. The county makes up less than 1 percent of the state's population. Wilson County reported 11 cases last year and is up to 8 cases this year. There were 90 cases reported in North Carolina last year.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] has been consulted for what state officials termed an outbreak in Wilson.

_Legionella_ is a bacterium commonly found in the environment, usually in hot water and in systems producing aerosols or mist. People can get infected when they breathe in a mist or vapor that has been contaminated with _Legionella_ bacteria. But most people who are exposed to that bacteria do not get sick, state officials said. Legionnaires' disease is a bacterial pneumonia and can't be spread from person to person.

The 1st confirmed case was announced [13 Jun 2014]. There are now 6 total confirmed cases linked to Wilson Pines and 2 cases linked to Longleaf Neuro-Medical Treatment Center, a state-operated facility. Wetherington said she couldn't comment as to whether Monday's [30 Jun 2014] confirmed Wilson Pines' case was a visitor. But she did say that person was being treated at the hospital for pneumonia.

One person did contract the disease while visiting Wilson Pines several weeks ago.

NC Department of Health and Human Services officials announced Saturday [28 Jun 2014] that 2 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease were linked to Longleaf [Neuro-Medical Treatment Center]. The state's public health division learned of the 1st case at Longleaf on [19 Jun 2014], state officials said Monday [?30 Jun 2014]. They publicly disclosed the case on Saturday [?28 Jun 2014].

The 2nd Longleaf case, which was "retrospective," was confirmed Friday [?27 Jun 2014]. That case is no longer symptomatic and [was] discovered during routine testing after the initial discovery and diagnosis, state officials said. That case was also publicly disclosed Saturday [?28 Jun 2014].

"2 cases associated with a health care facility are considered an outbreak, regardless of the fact that one of the cases is a retrospective case," said Kirsti Clifford, NC Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS] spokeswoman. "DHHS issued the health advisory upon learning that the facility met the definition of an outbreak." Clifford said they would not release the conditions of any patients due to privacy reasons.

Agencies involved in the Longleaf investigation include the state's division of public health, state operated health facilities, Longleaf, and the Wilson County Health Department. Clifford said it is common practice to consult with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for legionnaires' disease cases and that they have consulted with the CDC.

Clifford said state officials worked with Longleaf and their on-site contractor Saturday [?28 Jun 2014] to conduct an environmental assessment. "Samples were taken from various environmental sources within the facility," she said, adding they have not determined the source yet.

Internal control measures have since been put in place at Longleaf for protection of residents, visitors, and staff. Longleaf is not taking any new clients and some visitor restrictions are still in place. The facility is using bottled water for drinking, mouth rinsing, and shaving, the state said. Wilson Pines is also under water restrictions as well.

Wetherington said Monday [30 Jun 2014] that 2 other suspected cases related to Wilson Pines tested negative. Several samples were also collected from various locations within Wilson Pines. Last week county health officials announced results from Wilson Pines did test positive for _Legionella_ bacteria. Water restrictions will remain in place until follow-up shows negative test results of _Legionella_ in the facility, officials said. "The facility was treated," Wetherington said. "But in the meantime, a person affiliated with Wilson Pines tested positive for legionnaires' [disease]." State public health officials are working with the health department on the investigation into Wilson Pines, officials said.

Public health officials are taking measures to investigate the outbreaks in the 2 facilities as well as working with the facilities to make sure residents, staff and visitors are protected, state officials said Monday [30 Jun 2014]. "We are looking into all potential exposures, but no links between these outbreaks or other cases in the community have been identified," Clifford said. When the Wilson Times asked if any other facilities were being investigated in Wilson, the state referred that question to the Wilson County Health Department. State officials said Wilson County would take the lead in investigating any additional facilities.

Wetherington said as of Monday [30 Jun 2014] there aren't other facilities being investigated. Matt Shaw, City of Wilson's communications coordinator, said tests were conducted of the city's water supply since the confirmed cases. "There is no link between our public water and these breakouts," Shaw said Monday. "These problems seem to have occurred within their [Wilson Pines' and Longleaf's] own plumbing systems. There is no evidence that this is being transmitted by our water system." Shaw said the public should not be concerned about their water. "We are very vigilant about testing our water to make sure it is safe," he said.

Wetherington said they are encouraging those who have symptoms to contact their doctor. She said their doctor will assess those symptoms and make a decision as to whether that patient needs to be tested for legionnaires' disease. "We are continuing surveillance," Wetherington said.

She also said most doctors are testing those who present respiratory problems. Symptoms include high fever, chills, cough, body aches, headache, and fatigue. The disease typically begins 2 to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria and can be treated effectively with antibiotics, according to the state.

Most healthy individuals do not become infected with _Legionella_ bacteria after exposure. People at higher risk of getting sick include ages 50 [years] and older, current or former smokers, those with chronic lung disease, those with weak immune systems from disease like cancer, diabetes, or kidney failure, and those who take drugs like chemotherapy that weaken their immune systems.

The news report above tells of 2 different outbreaks of legionnaires' disease in June 2014 at healthcare facilities in the city of Wilson, North Carolina -- one outbreak at the Wilson Pines Nursing and Rehabilitation Center that involves 6 cases, and another at the Longleaf Neuro-Medical Treatment Center that involves 2 cases. The city's public water supply tested negative for _Legionella_, but both healthcare facilities' plumbing systems tested positive for _Legionella_ (species not given) and their plumbing systems "treated" (dates not given). Nevertheless, a case at Wilson Pines subsequently presented with legionnaires' disease, which can happen because this new case could have been exposed before remediation of the plumbing system contamination and only became ill at some later date, as a consequence of the 2-14 day incubation period of the disease.
