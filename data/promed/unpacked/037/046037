PPR outbreak in Somali region
-----------------------------
FAO has received reports of an outbreak of peste de petits ruminants
(PPR) in major sheep-rearing areas of Warder and Geladin woredas
[equivalent to a district] in Warder zone (Somali Region). The
regional agricultural bureau and National Animal Health Diagnostic
Investigation Centre have deployed a surveillance team. FAO and
partners, meanwhile, will start a major PPR vaccination campaign in
Shinile zone in the coming weeks, which will contribute to
strengthening resilience across the region. The effort will be
adapted to other zones should the reports be confirmed. During the
last drought, PPR reportedly contributed to the death of higher
number of sheep and goats than the drought.

[PPR is endemic in Ethiopia. Its control has become more feasible
following the development, during the 90's, of the homologous, live
attenuated PPR vaccine. The vaccine, available commercially, has been
found efficacious when adequately and systematically applied. For details, see
