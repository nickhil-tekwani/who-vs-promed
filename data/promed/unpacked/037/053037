According to the Yemeni Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPHP), during the past 5 months of this year [2022], the number of measles-infected people in areas controlled by the Yemeni government reached 2924 cases, including 34 deaths, excluding the governorates under the control of the Houthis faction.

Last week, the health authorities in the Yemeni government began implementing a campaign to immunize children in 10 Yemeni governorates. The vaccination campaign will include children from the age of 6 months to 10 years, even for those who have been vaccinated and have completed the routine immunization dose.

[Weak monitoring, testing and reporting for measles jeopardize countries' ability to prevent outbreaks of this highly contagious disease. Major measles outbreaks occurred in 26 countries and accounted for 84% of all reported cases in 2020.

"'Large numbers of unvaccinated children, outbreaks of measles, and disease detection and diagnostics diverted to support COVID-19 responses are factors that increase the likelihood of measles-related deaths and serious complications in children,' said Kevin Cain, MD, CDC's Global Immunization Director. 'We must act now to strengthen disease surveillance systems and close immunity gaps, before travel and trade return to pre-pandemic levels, to prevent­­ deadly measles outbreaks and mitigate the risk of other vaccine-preventable diseases'" (From Outbreak News Today 10 Nov 2021 http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-evidence-suggests-we-are-likely-seeing-the-calm-before-the-storm-as-the-risk-of-outbreaks-continues-to-grow-around-the-world-82569/. - Mod.LK

In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in Afghanistan, UNICEF reports between January and the end of May 2022, there were 50 433 reported cases of measles and 309 deaths. While the incidence of new cases decreased following measles vaccination campaigns in 49 districts in March 2022, UNICEF and partners continued to advocate for a countrywide campaign.

[That is a frightening number of measles cases and deaths. According to a UNICEF statement released 4 May 2022 (https://www.unicef.org/stories/measles-cases-spiking-globally):

"The number of reported worldwide measles cases has increased by 79% in the first 2 months of 2022 compared to the same time last year [2021]. It's a worrying sign of an increased risk for the spread of the highly contagious virus and other vaccine-preventable diseases. And there are fears this reported increase is the beginning of large measles outbreaks globally. Here's what you need to know about the current situation.

"The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF describe the current condition for measles outbreaks as a perfect storm. Why?

"A number of factors are contributing to what's being called a perfect storm. Pandemic-related disruptions, increasing inequalities in access to vaccines and the diversion of resources from routine immunization all play a role. Too many children right now are being left without protection against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. As a result, the risk of large outbreaks has increased.

"In 2020, 23 million children missed out on all basic childhood vaccines. That's the highest number seen since 2009 and 3.7 million more than in 2019.

"The risk is also heightened, as many communities have relaxed social distancing practices that were implemented during the height of the pandemic. That gives the measles virus a chance to spread faster among unprotected communities.

"Children across the world continue to be caught up in conflicts. Does that put them at greater risk of measles outbreaks?

"Absolutely. Millions of children right now are being displaced by crises in countries, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Ukraine. In these countries there have been disruptions in immunization and other essential child health services. Many children are living in overcrowded conditions. These factors increase the risk of an outbreak occurring and the severity of the outbreak when it happens.

"Children caught up in these situations are also more likely to face a lack of clean water and sanitation. That all increases the risk of outbreaks of other diseases too.

"Where specifically are these outbreaks being seen?

"As we mentioned, conflict and instability contribute to these outbreaks. Countries with the largest measles outbreaks in the past year include Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. As of April 2022, 21 large and disruptive measles outbreaks have been reported in the past year alone. And the reality is that the actual number of cases is likely much higher. That's because the pandemic has disrupted surveillance systems and that can result in substantial underreporting of cases.

"What impact can measles have on a child?

"Measles is potentially a deadly disease. The virus has a direct effect on the body, which can be lethal. The virus causes fever and a distinctive rash that starts on the face and spreads over the whole body. In some cases, severe complications can include pneumonia, severe diarrhea, blindness, encephalitis (brain swelling) and death. It can also weaken the immune system of a child and make them more vulnerable to other infections long after recovering from measles. This phenomenon is known as immunity amnesia.

"What needs to happen to prevent more measles outbreaks?

"The coronavirus pandemic has interrupted vaccination campaigns around the world, including for measles. As we rebuild from the pandemic, it's imperative that there's a commitment to building stronger health systems, making sure that every child has access to the routine immunizations they need to be healthy.

"When we talk about stronger health systems, that means an increased number of trained healthcare workers, additional vaccination sites in underserved communities, more robust health records and effective messaging around vaccines." - Mod.LK

[3] USA (Minnesota): Hennepin County, ex unknown foreign country
Date: Tue 14 Jun 2022

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) announced today [14 Jun 2022] it is investigating 2 measles cases in unvaccinated, pre-school children who are siblings. The children developed measles symptoms shortly after returning to Hennepin County after visiting an unidentified country where measles is endemic.

One child was hospitalized due to measles complications. The children were isolated when symptoms started, so exposures were limited to healthcare and family settings.

It generally takes 8-12 days from exposure to someone with measles to develop the 1st symptom, usually fever. The MDH, Hennepin County Public Health, and local staff are working to notify people who may have been exposed to the vaccine-preventable measles virus in Minnesota or while flying.

The MDH stated on 14 Jun 2022 that the measles risk to the general public is low. However, the measles virus spreads quickly by coughing, talking, or being in the same room with someone who has measles.

If additional measles cases develop due to these cases, they will likely occur before 1 Jul 2022, health officials said.

Some communities in Minnesota continue to have low vaccination rates for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). According to recent data, the percentage of 2-year-olds who had received at least one dose of MMR vaccine by 24 months declined from 81.4% in 2019 to 79.3% in 2021.

State epidemiologist Dr. Ruth Lynfield commented in a related press release, "Vaccines are extremely effective for preventing measles. It's important that we work on getting our immunization rates back up where they need to be so that all children in Minnesota are protected."

Minnesota has had 4 cases of measles since a significant outbreak in 2017. In a typical year, Minnesota sees one to 4 cases of measles, generally in people who traveled to countries where measles is more common.

The World Health Organization recently reported measles cases increased by 79% in the first 2 months of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. "We need to maintain our high vaccination rates in the United States to make sure measles does not make a comeback in Minnesota," added Margaret Roddy, section manager for vaccine-preventable diseases at MDH.

"As long as there is measles somewhere in the world and people travel, the risk to Minnesota remains. The measles vaccine is safe and effective. Without it, the risk of disease is real."

The US CDC says "measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but it is still common in other parts of the world." As of 3 Jun 2022, only 3 measles cases were reported by 2 jurisdictions this year. This improved from 2021, when 5 US jurisdictions reported 49 measles cases.

The best way to prevent measles is through vaccination. The CDC says children should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine: the 1st at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd at 4-6 years of age. Children 6-12 months should get an early dose of the MMR vaccine if they are traveling to a country where measles is common.

And on 6 Jun 2022, the US FDA approved GSK's Priorix MMR vaccine. This is the 3rd approved MMR vaccine. These vaccines are generally available at local pharmacies and health clinics.
