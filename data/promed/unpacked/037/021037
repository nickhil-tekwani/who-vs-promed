It would appear that this report refers to the case previously identified in ProMED (Hantavirus - Americas (02): Argentina (CH) 20220117.8700918), when no details were available. - Mod.SH

A case of a hantavirus [infection] has been confirmed in Chubut. [The patient is] a man in intensive care. The young man presented with "a clinical picture of serious respiratory insufficiency and is on mechanical respiration."

The patient is a 29 year old young man who worked in the Esquel Fishermen's Club in the Los Alerces National Park. Currently, the man is in intensive care in the local Zonal Hospital with a reserved prognosis. Local authorities ordered the isolation of his close contacts and set in motion investigations to find out where he may have acquired his infection.

On12 Jan [2022], a worker from Los Alerces National Park had to be admitted to the Trevelin Rural Hospital due to respiratory distress compatible with a hantavirus [infection]. However, he had to be referred to the Esquel Zonal Hospital to be treated in the intensive care unit.

As explained in the Esquel Program Area, the young man was "with a picture of severe respiratory insufficiency was on mechanical respiratory assistance," since his pathology was "clinically and, by preliminary complementary studies, compatible with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome."

"The prognosis for him is guarded," they added.

What is known about the confirmed case of hantavirus in Chubut
-------------------------------------------------
This Saturday [15 Jan 2022], the Anlis-Malbran Institute confirmed that a hantavirus was the responsible pathogen, and the director of the Esquel Zonal Hospital, Sergio Cardozo, informed local media.

Given this situation, the Northwest Program Area, the Municipality of Esquel, Los Alerces National Park, and the Esquel Fishermen's Club met to consider further action. Close contacts of the 29 year old worker were isolated, and an inspection in the environment and survey were carried out to identify possible places of infection.

In addition, the local media assured the public that the Environmental Health and Zoonosis area of the province would initiate rodent capture operations to evaluate the epidemiological situation. It was stated that Los Alerces National Park would keep its doors open. In the provincial health agency, we recommend the following, among other points:

- Use designated sites for camping or day stay.
- Do not sleep in contact with the grass.
- Travel on designated trails.
- Maintain hand and food hygiene.
- Consume safe water and do not collect wild fruits in areas where the presence of rodents is evident.

What is hantavirus?
According to the national Ministry of Health, the hantavirus [fever] is a severe acute viral disease caused by hantavirus. The main reservoirs of this pathogen are wild mice (especially long-tailed mice) that transmit the virus to people when the mice eliminate it through saliva, feces, and urine.

This virus produces 2 severe clinical forms in humans: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Asia and Europe, and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas. In Argentina there are 2 species of hantavirus (Andes and Laguna Negra) and at least 10 different viral genotypes.

How is hantavirus transmitted?
- By inhalation: [of virus-containing particles] either in sheds, orchards, or pastures, where the feces or urine of rodents shed the virus, contaminating the environment;
- by direct contact: by touching live or dead infected rodents, or the feces or urine of these rodents;
- from bites;
- between humans: close contact with an infected person during the 1st days of symptoms, through respiration.

What are the symptoms of hantavirus?
- shaking chills
- fever
- muscle pains

After 24-48 hours, symptoms progress to
- dry cough;
- feeling unwell (general malaise);
- headache;
- nausea and vomiting;
- respiratory distress.

[The patient worked in a fisherman's club in a national park, likely in a rural or natural environment where rodent virus reservoirs live. This environment is not described in the above report. The locality where the young man acquired his hantavirus infection is Chubut province, in the foothills of the Andes Mountains.

Although the virus involved in this case is not mentioned, the most likely virus is Andes virus, found in western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. There is also the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, which is widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). This virus can also be transmitted directly between people in close physical contact.

The above reveals that the patient is suffering serious respiratory insufficiency and is on mechanical respiration, indicating that this is a case of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, which can have a case fatality rate of 40%. This syndrome can rapidly become very serious and fatal. - Mod.TY
