The Denmark news source, Politiken Denmark (computer translated) reports between 6000-12000 Danes who have never been near a pig farm could be infected with porcine MRSA [methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_] without knowing it.

Two MRSA experts say the multidrug-resistant swine bacterium MRSA [clonal complex] CC398 will be the result of more fatalities among the Danish population. "It is naive to imagine otherwise," Henrik Westh, the head the Region Hovedstaden [Capital Region of Denmark] MRSA research centre, said in the report. "It is simple mathematics."

The message on thousands of cases of infection comes after the State Serum Institute last week [week of 18 Aug 2014] published figures showing that 105 Danes in July [2014] alone were found to be infected with swine MRSA. This is the highest number ever in a month. Pig MRSA has so far cost 4 lives at home.

Many people carry the infection without knowing it, and the bacteria are able to live for weeks on infected surfaces like tabletops and doorknobs.

According to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI; State Serum Institute), in 2007, pig MRSA of the CC398 type comprised only 2 percent of all notified MRSA cases in Denmark. This year [2014], the type presently accounts for more than 35 percent of cases.

Part of the increase is owed to the fact that more of the infected persons are now being detected. Today, all patients who are admitted to hospital are asked if they work with pigs or live at a pig-producing farm. Those who do are tested for MRSA even if they show no signs of being infected with the bacterium.

SSI also notes that considerable regional differences are observed, and the incidence is particularly low on Zealand and Bornholm, whereas the MRSA CC398 type is predominant in areas with intensive farming, particularly in West Jutland, North Jutland, and South Jutland.

[The news report above says that the frequency of MRSA ST398 has increased from only 2 percent of all notified MRSA cases in Denmark in 2007, to more than 35 percent of cases so far this year (2014). They attribute this increase in part to routine screening culture of all patients who are admitted to hospital if they respond positively that they work with pigs or live at a pig-producing farm, even if they show no signs of being infected with the bacterium. However, colonization and infections with ST398 in humans with no known contact with animals have been reported in the United States and Europe (http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/1164.long).

Livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA is largely a single clonal complex on the basis of multilocus sequence typing (ST398) and non-typeable (NT) because of the inability to type it by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using Sma-1. LA-MRSA initially was detected in the Netherlands in pigs and pig farmers in 2003. This strain of presumably animal origin (nearly 40 percent of pigs in the Netherlands have been found to be colonized by this strain) has been reported to be responsible for more than 20 percent of all MRSA infections in the Netherlands (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/568512) and has been found in community-associated human infections in several European countries, North America, and Asia. Nosocomial transmission of this strain has also been reported among patients and health care workers in the Netherlands
(http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/eccmid18/abstract.asp?id=69352).

According to an investigative story in the Washington Post, of the 35 million pounds of antibiotic used in the US in 2008, 70 percent went to pigs, chickens, and cows to help prevent disease and make them grow large quickly (http://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/12/29/pressure-rises-to-stop-antibiotics-in-agriculture). Confinement of these farm animals at high stocking density requires use of antibiotics to mitigate the spread of disease exacerbated by these crowded living conditions. Similarly, intensive fish farming provides conditions that require large quantities of antibiotics to be added to feed (http://www.bellona.org/aquaculture/artikler/Antibiotics). Exposure to antibiotics allows survival of antibiotic resistant mutants and organisms that have acquired from other bacteria genes that encode antibiotic resistance.

Antibiotics, as well as bacteria that carry antibiotic resistance genes, from agricultural sources can enter the environment via wastewater treatment plant effluents, processing plant effluents, application of agricultural waste and biosolids to fields, and leakage from waste-storage containers and landfills and can facilitate the development and spread of antibiotic resistance (Tello A, Austin B, Telfer TC: Selective Pressure of Antibiotic Pollution on Bacteria of Importance to Public Health. Environ Health Perspect. 2012 August; 120(8): 1100-6. Published online 2012; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3440082/). Consequently, antibiotic resistant pathogens have been found on non-farm workers and wildlife, as well as farm workers, in farm country (see ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance - USA: (IA) MRSA, wildlife 20121023.1360127). - Mod.ML
