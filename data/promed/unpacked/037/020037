Circulation of Vaccine-derived Poliovirus Type 2 in Egypt, 1982-1993
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The finding that vaccine-derived polioviruses may circulate under suitable
conditions presents an additional challenge to efforts to eradicate polio
worldwide. During the year 2000, circulation of type 1 vaccine-derived
poliovirus in the Dominican Republic and Haiti was associated with 19
suspected polio cases. Nucleotide sequence relationships among Sabin
2-derived polioviruses isolated in China during the mid-1990s also were
consistent with establishment of genetic lineages by person-to-person
transmission.
This MMWR report summarizes the results of a study indicating that oral
poliovirus vaccine (OPV)-derived poliovirus type 2 circulated in Egypt
during the 1980s and early 1990s and caused widespread infection and
paralytic disease. The findings underscore the need for countries using OPV
to target communities with low vaccine coverage for intense vaccination
activities to prevent circulation of both wild and vaccine-derived
polioviruses.
During 1988-1993, 32 polio cases associated with vaccine-derived poliovirus
type 2 were found in 8 of 27 Governorates in Egypt. Although initial
antigenic characterization of the isolates indicated that they had
non-vaccine-like properties, nucleotide sequence analysis (i.e., comparing
the 903 nucleotides encoding the major capsid protein, VP1) performed during
1999 revealed that all of the isolates were related (93%--96% nucleotide
sequence identity) to the Sabin type 2 OPV strain (Sabin 2). The isolates
were not related (less than 81% nucleotide sequence identity) to the wild
type 2 poliovirus that had been indigenous to Egypt (last isolated in 1979)
or to any other wild type 2 polioviruses. The isolates also differed from
type 2 vaccine-derived polioviruses normally isolated from patients with
acute flaccid paralysis that typically are related closely (>99.5%
nucleotide sequence identity) to Sabin 2.
Both epidemiologic and genetic data among the 32 case isolates indicate
extensive circulation of type 2 vaccine-derived polioviruses in Egypt during
1988--1993. Several type 2 isolates were associated with clusters of cases
within the same Governorate, and sustained circulation of Sabin 2-derived
poliovirus probably occurred in some communities. The isolates grouped into
approximately 10 genetic lineages (corresponding to chains of transmission),
and isolates from the same Governorate usually were closely related. The
extent of VP1 sequence divergence from Sabin 2 was similar for isolates for
any given year, and divergence increased at a nearly constant rate from 1988
to 1993. However, the sequence diversity (4%--5%) of the early isolates
suggested that circulation had started several years before 1988.
Although the precise duration and extent of vaccine-derived poliovirus
circulation in Egypt is uncertain because of gaps in surveillance before
1990, regression analysis of the VP1 evolution rate suggested that all
lineages derived from one OPV infection that occurred approximately during
1982, and that progeny from that initiating infection circulated in Egypt
during 1982--1993. The time estimate of the initiating OPV infection is
based on the assumption that the rate of VP1 evolution was nearly constant
throughout the period of virus circulation.
Circulation of the Sabin 2-derived poliovirus occurred when OPV coverage
probably was low in the affected communities. OPV coverage rates increased
steadily in the mid-1990s, and no highly divergent vaccine-derived
poliovirus isolates have been found in Egypt since 1993. Low OPV coverage
following the elimination of at least one indigenous wild poliovirus
serotype probably is critical for circulation of vaccine-derived
polioviruses. Such conditions permit expansion of the cohort of children who
are not immune to one or more poliovirus serotypes. The threshold rates of
vaccine coverage needed to suppress circulation of vaccine-derived
polioviruses are unknown but probably vary by poliovirus serotype and
environmental factors (e.g., population density, levels of sanitation, and
climate). However, when OPV coverage rates are sufficient to prevent
circulation of wild polioviruses, they probably are sufficient to prevent
circulation of vaccine-derived polioviruses
Because the outbreak described in this report involved extensive
person-to-person transmission of poliovirus, it differs from
vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP). Cases of VAPP are not linked
epidemiologically or virologically to each other, but are associated with
separate recent exposures to OPV. However, the early events associated with
the circulation of vaccine-derived polioviruses may be similar to events
associated with contact cases of VAPP: an unimmunized person is exposed to
vaccine-derived poliovirus excreted by a recent OPV recipient. Excreted
vaccine-derived viruses often are more virulent than the original OPV
strains. Low levels of population immunity may favor the selection and
transmission of vaccine-derived variants with biologic properties
indistinguishable from those of wild polioviruses.
The outbreak in the [the island of Hispaniola involved circulating
poliovirus type 1; the cases in China and Egypt (and possibly infections
detected by environmental surveillance in Israel [9) involved circulating
type 2 vaccine-derived viruses. The type 2 OPV strain is the most
transmissible of the 3 poliovirus serotypes. Because circulation of wild
type 2 polioviruses probably has ceased worldwide, the only type 2
polioviruses infecting humans and conferring type-specific immunity are
likely to be those derived from OPV.
The potential of vaccine-derived polioviruses to establish and maintain
circulation has important implications for developing an appropriate
strategy for the cessation of vaccination with OPV after wild poliovirus
eradication has been achieved. Potential vaccine-derived poliovirus
circulation also underscores the importance of maintaining high rates of
poliovirus vaccine coverage worldwide. Countries using OPV should target
communities with low vaccine coverage for intensified vaccination activities
to prevent circulation of vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses. Countries
using inactivated poliovirus vaccine [IPV should take steps to ensure high
coverage rates in all communities to prevent the transmission of imported
polioviruses.

Dr. Pedro Mas Lago has pointed out an error in his comment in the
ProMED-mail post entitled "Poliomyelitis - Dominican Republic & Haiti." At
the end of the first paragraph the phrase "poliovirus type 1 related in
Israel", should read "poliovirus type 2 related in Israel". - Mod.CP
