[It's nice to see that Kazakhstan is now routinely genomically typing
their cultures. If any member would like to see a genomic map of _B.
anthracis_ in Kazakhstan, go to: "Historical distribution & molecular
diversity of _B. anthracis_ in Kazakhstan" at
http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/5/789.htm.

Movement Controls? The standard post-outbreak control procedure is to
not allow any animals off the farm until 21 days following
vaccination.

In the past, we have seen livestock anthrax reports from Kazakhstan
only in reference to sentinel human cases. This outbreak does not have
an associated human case. If this continues, we can then take
confidence from the reported livestock outbreaks probably reflecting
reality and begin to assume just a minimum of background unreported
outbreaks. Put another way, we could consider changing their ranking
from "enzootic" to "sporadic." In the past 10 years, human cases have
varied from 0 to 17 cases per year, with a median of 6-8 cases. -
