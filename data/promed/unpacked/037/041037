UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, CUSTARD APPLE - MEXICO (02)

I was intrigued by this one, as _Phytophthora kernoviae_ was found on custard apple orchards in New Zealand causing fruit rot and dieback [see also ProMED-mail post 20090408.1356]:

http://journals.oregondigital.org/ForestPhytophthora/article/view/kernoviae/2736,
http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/IUFRO_abstractNZ.pdf/$file/IUFRO_abstractNZ.pdf.

It is not clear from this report what the symptoms of this "plague" in Mexico are. It seems as though it may be worthwhile for the Mexican authorities to check whether _Phytophthora kernoviae_ is involved.

It is a logical connection, especially if it follows a period of wet weather. But there is a lack of information on whether this is likely in that region in Mexico. The related _Phytophthora infestans_ does well in regions of Mexico; indeed that is its centre of origin.

[Our sincere thanks go to Dr Cooke for these valuable comments and the additional information.

The oomycete genus _Phytophthora_ (previously classed as a fungus) includes some of the most devastating pathogens of crops and forest species, for example, _P. infestans_ (late blight of potato and tomato), _P. palmivora_ (bud rot of palms, black pod of cocoa), _P. cinnamomi_ (eucalypt dieback), and _P. ramorum_ (sudden oak death).
