[Sheep pox and goat pox [SGP] are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalized papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, which can infect sheep, goats, or both.

According to Chapter 2.7.14, "Sheep pox and goat pox" of the OIE Terrestrial Manual (updated 2010), capripox is endemic in Africa north of the Equator, the Middle East, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, parts of the People's Republic of China, and Bangladesh. The most recent outbreaks occurred in Mongolia in 2008 and 2009, an isolated outbreak in Greece in 2008 [the disease was recently reported in Greece and Bulgaria in 2013. - Mod.CRD] and in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in 2009. Goat pox has been established in Viet Nam since 2005. The 1st goat pox outbreak in Chinese Taipei occurred in 2008 and in 2010 the disease reoccurred and was declared endemic.

For more detailed information regarding laboratory diagnostic methodologies, vaccines, and references, please refer to Chapter 2.7.14 "Sheep pox and goat pox" in the latest edition of the OIE Terrestrial Manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.14_S_POX_G_POX.pdf.

In the 2 previous 6-monthly reports sent to OIE (July-December 2012 and January-June 2013), 28 countries reported sheep and goat pox as present. Of these, 15 are located in Asia: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Pakistan, Palestinian Auton. Territories, Turkmenistan, Yemen, China (People's Rep. of), India, Jordan, and Tajikistan (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).

The origin of infection is, reportedly, "illegal movement of animals." The focus is adjacent to Kazakhstan's border with Kyrgyzstan, which reported 2 outbreaks of SGP in February 2012, in Jalal Abad; in both outbreaks, "sheep/goats" were reportedly affected. The outbreak is designated as "continuing".

Since 1997, Kazakhstan has submitted 5 immediate notifications to the OIE reporting sheep pox and goat pox, 3 of them through WAHID (operational since 2005) and 2 through HandistatusII (operational 1996-2004; less detailed), as follows:

According to the last 6-monthly report sent by Kazakhstan to the OIE, the disease is present in the country, but limited to one or more zones (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation; select "Year 2012"). For this reason the latest event in Jambyl was reported as "1st occurrence" in a zone.

It would be useful to know the number of animals affected by species because if both goats and sheep were affected, it may (just may) indicate a 1st occurrence of a new (for Kazakhstan) poxvirus, common to sheep and goats. Such viruses have been seen in the past elsewhere, such as the Kenyan "sheep and goat pox virus" 0240 strain (KS-1).

"Sheep pox virus (SPV) and goat pox virus (GPV) were once believed to be strains of the same virus, but genetic sequencing has now demonstrated them to be separate viruses. Most strains are host specific and cause severe clinical disease in either sheep or goats, while some strains have equal virulence in both species. Further complicating this is that recombination can occur between sheep and goat strains, which produces a spectrum with intermediate host preference and range of virulence. SPV and GPV cannot be distinguished from each other with serological techniques, including viral neutralisation (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/SHEEP_GOAT_POX_FINAL.pdf)."

There is no information on the type of vaccine used to control this last event.

Finally, it is important for OIE Member countries to remember that an "immediate notification" must be sent to the OIE within 24 hours of confirmation. - Mods.CRD/AS
