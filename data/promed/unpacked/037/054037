Food poisoning detected in 46 residents of two elderly facilities in Kudamatsu
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yamaguchi Prefecture announced on 26 Sep 2022 that 46 residents of 2 elderly facilities run by the social welfare corporation Midoriyamakai in Furukawa-cho, Kudamatsu City developed foodborne illness caused by _Clostridium perfringens_. They complained of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but all but one with a chronic illness have recovered.

According to the prefecture, the 2 facilities are Gran Terrace Kudamatsu Chuo, a care house, and Hoshi Terrace, a special nursing home for the elderly. On 17 Sep 2022, a total of 109 residents and staff of the 2 facilities were served breakfast prepared by the Midoriyamakai-run school lunch facility. It is said that 46 people developed symptoms from the evening of the same day [17 Sep 2022] to 18 Sep 2022.

The prefectural government determined that the simmered food was the source of the illness, as _Clostridium perfringens_ was detected in the simmered komatsuna (Japanese mustard spinach) and deep-fried fish cakes served for breakfast.

[Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness, in which the preformed toxin is ingested, in _C. perfringens_ disease the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract. The following discussion was obtained from a previous version of the FDA Bad Bug Book (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf):

"1. Name of the organism
_Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic, Gram positive, spore-forming rod. It is widely distributed in the environment and frequently occurs in the intestines of humans and many domestic and feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

"2. Nature of acute disease
Perfringens food poisoning is the term used to describe the common foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_. A more serious but rare illness is also caused by ingesting food contaminated with type C strains. The latter illness is known as enteritis necroticans or pig-bel disease.

"3. Nature of disease
The common form of _C. perfringens_ poisoning is characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea, which begin 8-22 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers of those _C. perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours, but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for 1-2 weeks. A few deaths have been reported as a result of dehydration and other complications.

Necrotic enteritis (pig-bel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic enteritis are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA.

Infective dose: The symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers (greater than 1 000 000) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the digestive tract (or in test tubes) is associated with sporulation. This disease is a food infection; only one episode has ever implied the possibility of intoxication (that is, disease from preformed toxin).

"4. Diagnosis of human illness
Perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation can also be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.

"5. Associated foods
In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by _C. perfringens_ is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small numbers of the organisms are often present after cooking and multiply to food poisoning levels during cool down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, meat products, and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.

"6. Relative frequency of disease
Perfringens poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the USA. There were 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreaks have been reported annually in the USA for the past 2 decades. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of persons are affected. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported because the implicated foods or patient feces are not tested routinely for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. CDC estimates that about 10 000 actual cases occur annually in the USA.

"7. Course of disease and complications
The disease generally lasts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm, symptoms may last 1-2 weeks. Complications and/or death only very rarely occur.

"8. Target populations
Institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.) where large quantities of food are prepared several hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most frequent victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of pig-bel syndrome, complications are few in persons under 30 years of age. Elderly persons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe symptoms.

"9. Food analysis
Standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The procedures take 1-3 days." - Mod.LL
