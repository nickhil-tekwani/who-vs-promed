Highlights
- Using independent SARS-CoV-2 antigens improves specificity of serological assays
- Neutralizing and spike-specific antibody production persists for at least 5-7 months
- Nucleocapsid antibodies frequently become undetectable by 5-7 months
- Antibody production is higher in severe disease relative to mild cases

Summary
We conducted a serological study to define correlates of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Relative to mild COVID-19 cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated virus-neutralizing titers and antibodies against nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein. Age and sex played lesser roles. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. Spike RBD and S2 and neutralizing antibodies remained detectable through 5-7 months post-onset, whereas alpha-N titers diminished. Testing of 5882 members of the local community revealed only one sample with seroreactivity to both RBD and S2 that lacked neutralizing antibodies. This fidelity could not be achieved with either RBD or S2 alone. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen. We conclude that neutralizing antibodies are stably produced for at least 5-7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[An orthogonal test uses 2 independent tests in sequence when the 1st test yields a positive result. This confirms the initial result when the positive predictive value of a single test is low, as in a low seroprevalence community.

In this study, the investigators used a strategy using RBD and S2 as antigenically distinct tests to accurately identify seropositive individuals. In doing so, this assay greatly reduced the existing limitations to testing accuracy in low seroprevalence communities and identified individuals for subsequent analysis of the immune response. The positive results correlated well with virus neutralization assay results. The neutralization assays measure the true ability of the virus to inhibit replication of the virus, thereby neutralizing it, and although more biologically relevant, they are tedious to do, expensive, and require biosafety level 3 facilities. Therefore, the demonstration by the investigators that the assays against RBD and S2 together are basically equivalent to the neutralization assay is significant.

The persistence of antibody has been hotly debated. These investigators found "that disease severity, but not age or sex, were correlates of the magnitude of the response. Further, use of these 2 antigens, nucleocapsid protein, and neutralizing antibody titers revealed discordance in the durability of antibody responses depending on the viral protein [thereby explaining differences in published results]. In contrast to earlier reports, [they] demonstrate durable production of functionally important antibodies lasting at least 2-3 months post-disease onset." - Mod.LK

Similar findings were reported with respect to the MERS-CoV. Following the outbreak involving 186 cases in South Korea, studies demonstrated that individuals with a history of severe disease had persistent high titer antibody responses 1 year following infection, whereas 4 out of 6 with mild disease (including pneumonia) had no detectable antibodies (1). In a follow-up study, 3 years post-infection a similar pattern was seen -- those with severe disease had persistent antibodies 3 years later, but those with mild disease or asymptomatic infection did have declines in antibody titers (2). Harvey et al. (3) and Okba et al. (4) discuss the sensitivities of the various tests available for MERS-CoV antibody identification, highlighting low sensitivity in those with mild symptoms and a recommendation to use a testing algorithm that includes more than 2 different tests to ensure correct diagnosis of MERS-CoV. While there have been fewer than 3000 cases of confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV, the similarities with its cousin the SARS-CoV-2 are definitely there.

[2] Switzerland: yodeling superspreading event

The coronavirus pandemic has not deterred the Swiss from sending yodels echoing across their mountain valleys, but a concert attended by 600 people is believed to have made one canton a European virus hotspot.

At the late September [2020] yodelling event in the rural Schwyz canton, Switzerland, people in the audience were asked to maintain social distancing, but mask-wearing was not required.

"We can't do anything about what happened with this yodelling group. We found out 9 days after the performances that several people from the group were infected," event organiser Beat Hegner told RTS public television.

An Australian study last month [September 2020] suggested that singing can spread coronavirus via airborne droplets and poses greater risks than talking. A choir singing indoors can saturate the air with infected particles which float. The researchers, from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, added that if singers wear a face mask and venues practice social distancing and allow smaller audiences, then the risk from singing can be reduced.

Now the pandemic has spread through the Swiss region, with 1238 cases compared with just 500 in mid-September 2020. On Wednesday [14 Oct 2020] alone, 94 people tested positive, twice as many as the day before. The overloaded cantonal hospital in Schwyz has asked people to begin wearing masks and avoiding gatherings. "There's an extremely high rate of positive tests. We've gone from 30% to 50%," hospital chief Franziska Foellmi said.

"It's time we reacted. The explosion in the number of cases in Schwyz is one of the worst in all of Europe," chief doctor Reto Nueesch posted online. Cantonal authorities have stepped up infection control measures, making mask-wearing compulsory at all public and private events with more than 50 people and in situations where distancing can't be maintained. But people can still go to the shops without covering their nose and mouth.

Switzerland isn't the only country to practice yodelling, an age-old style of singing where the performer rapidly switches between registers. It's also practised in Austria's Tyrol region and in variant forms across the mountains of central Europe, from Poland to Romania. Like archery, wrestling and the Alpine games, yodelling has been one of the building-blocks of common identity between Switzerland's culturally disparate regions since the 19th century.

[Other superspreading events linked to singing have been reported. In March 2020, of 61 persons attending a choir practice there were 32 confirmed and 20 probable secondary cases, 3 were hospitalized and 2 died (1).

The Australian study referred to in the above media report is by Bahl et al. (2). From the article abstract: "Choral singing has become a major risk during the COVID-19 pandemic due to high infection rates. Our visualisation and velocimetry results reveal that the majority of droplets expelled during singing follow the ambient airflow pattern. These results point toward the possibility of COVID-19 spread by small airborne droplets during singing."

The authors concluded: "These findings could inform safety guidelines for restarting choirs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar respiratory infection outbreaks. For example, rehearsals could be done with fewer people, greater physical distancing between singers, or face coverings and masks to reduce droplet and aerosol expulsion. In addition, either well-ventilated large spaces or outdoor performances should be utilised to minimize the risk of infection."

Miller and Srebric in a study published on 13 Jul 2020 (available at https://www.nfhs.org/media/4029952/preliminary-testing-report-7-13-20.pdf) found that singers, as well as certain wind and brass instrumentalists, generate respiratory aerosols at high rates. Recommendations can be found at https://www.nfhs.org/media/4029971/preliminary-recommendations-from-international-performing-arts-aerosol-study.pdf, most of which rely upon performers using face masks when possible.

One suspects that if studied, yodeling might well be demonstrated to increase aerosolization of viral particles as well as propel droplets farther than the recommended 2 meters (approximately 6 feet).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 216.

Data by country, area, or territory for 16 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct16_1602892646.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 32.9% of daily case numbers and 47.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 18.3 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Honduras, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Chile.

- The European region reported 40.0% of daily case numbers and 22.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 7.5 million. Countries not reporting cases today (16 Oct 2020) include Israel, Kazakhstan and Sweden. France is dominant, followed by the UK, Russia, Spain, Czech Republic, Italy, Poland, Netherlands, Germany, Ukraine, Romania, Switzerland, and Portugal. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Slovakia, Turkey, Armenia, Austria, Hungary, and Ireland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.6% of daily case numbers and 8.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.7 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon and UAE. Libya, Pakistan, Kuwait, and Oman each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 3.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.24 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.96% of daily case numbers and 0.98% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.67 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Japan, Malaysia, Guam, South Korea and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 19.4% of the daily newly reported cases and 17.9% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.2 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe and the Americas region is still very active. While India had reduced daily confirmations by over 30% in the past few weeks, the region is still having active transmission.

[India and the USA are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, the USA (71 963) followed by India (65 126) have maintained their dominance. A global total of 6256 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (15-16 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (17 countries) include India, USA, Brazil (30 574), France (25 086), Argentina (16 546), UK (15 635), Russia (15 150), Czech Republic (11 102), Belgium (10 448), Italy (10 009), Spain (9765), Colombia (8372), Netherlands (7984), Germany (7976), Poland (7705), Mexico (6751), and Ukraine (5992). A total of 46 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 46 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 were from the Americas region, 7 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region and 5 were from the Southeast Asian region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 8.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 7.5%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts followed by the Eastern Mediterranean region and South East Asia region. The USA has increased in 7-day average daily reported cases in the past week compared with the preceding week by 14.1%, reflecting the increased transmission ongoing since the end of the summer. - Mod.MPP]
