Outbreak of rabies hit 9 towns, cities in Negros Occidental
-----------------------------------------------------------
A rabies outbreak has hit 7 cities and 2 towns in Negros Occidental,
provincial veterinarian Renante Decena said yesterday [12 Aug 2010]. As
required by the World Health Organisation guidelines an outbreak of rabies
disease declaration is required in the event of any canine or human
confirmed cases of rabies in a locality, even if it is only a single case.

Decena said one human death from rabies has occurred in San Carlos City. A
total of 9 dogs have been confirmed positive for rabies in Bacolod City, 4
in Victorias City, 3 in Silay City, 2 in Bago City, one in Isabela, 2 in
Binalbagan, one in Himamaylan City, and 2 in Sipalay City.

An outbreak [has been] declared immediately to contain the situation and
prevent a spread, Decena said. Upon receiving a report of a rabies case,
the local rabies control committee conducts a quick response vaccination
sweep of dogs within a one kilometre radius.

The provincial government has been conducting a comprehensive province-wide
rabies vaccination program, Decena said. A synchronized vaccination
campaign in June and July [2010] led to the vaccination of 71 percent of
the total dog population in Negros Occidental, he said. They would target a
100-percent vaccination of dogs using the 300 000 doses of rabies vaccines
already distributed to the local governments and para-vet vaccinators,
Decena added.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided free vaccines for 1300
vaccinators for their pre-exposure vaccination against rabies as well as
for high-risk health personnel, he added. The foundation also provided the
vaccines for the total dog population in Negros Occidental. Decena said
Bacolod City has about 50 000 dogs and the 31 towns and cities of Negros
occidental have 214 041.
