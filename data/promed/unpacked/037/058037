The need to be extra vigilant while trying to obtain crucial and relevant documents in Nigeria came to the fore recently when a man who ignorantly obtained a [fake] vaccination certificate popularly referred to as yellow card was nabbed at the Idiroko border, Ogun State, by Federal Ministry of Health officials. His arrest however led to the apprehension of 2 members of a syndicate which specialised in issuing such fake yellow cards by the Ogun State Police Command.

Yellow cards are issued to intending travellers to indicate that they had been vaccinated against yellow fever and other communicable diseases as listed and requested by some countries. Vaccination is recommended for persons over 9 months of age travelling to or living in endemic areas. The vaccine affords long-term protection.

Such countries require a valid Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate. The vaccination is expected to be administered at least 10 days before travelling and no longer than 10 years before, under International Health Regulations.

Parading the suspects to Crime Reports, the state police public relations officer [PPRO], Olumuyiwa Adejobi, a deputy superintendent of police revealed that a victim (name withheld) who wanted to travel needed an international passport and a yellow card from a "Mr A" which would indicate that he had been vaccinated against some illnesses.

Though the man succeeded in obtaining the yellow card, he was reportedly arrested by health officials from Ministry of Health at Idi-Iroko border on 8 Jan [2014], when it was noticed that the yellow card he had was a fake one. He was immediately arrested and transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Iyaganku, Ibadan.

When interrogated, he revealed that he obtained it from a young man around the immigration office at Festac town, Lagos State. This led detectives to the place and 2 suspects were arrested "Mr A and Mr O", while other fake copies of the yellow card were recovered from "Mr O".

In an interview with "Mr O", a 53 year old man from Lagos State, he said the cards were brought to him by a "Mr T" who sold them to him at N300 [USD 1.81] each, while he made a profit of N200 [USD 1.21] on each by selling at N500 [USD 3.03] to middle men who in turn sell to intending clients. According to "Mr O", "I have a business centre where I do photocopy and downloading of information from the internet to clients. The centre is at Festac Town in Lagos State beside the office of the Nigeria Immigration Services.

"The yellow cards were given to me by "Mr T". He told he had them for those who might want to obtain them. He brought them in 5s and 10s. In all, he had given me 25. I collected N500 for each, out of which I got N200 and I gave "Mr T". N300. I thought "Mr T" was a local government official. I never knew it was wrong to sell them. I didn't know they were fake, if not, I would not have collected them from him."

The 2nd suspect, "Mr A, 32, an indigene of Iwo, Osun State who lives at Ojo in Lagos State also said he was one of the touts who used to help people do online payment and downloading for international passport around immigration office at Festac Town. He further revealed that the arrested victim was directed to him by an immigration officer. The immigration officer called me that someone needed a yellow card and asked whether I could assist him. I took the man's data and went to "Mr O" to get the yellow card for him.

"I got to know from other people working around the immigration office that "Mr A" had the cards. That was how I got involved. I had obtained 4 from him. I used to collect N1000 [USD 6.05] from the clients but I paid "Mr A" N500 and made N500 profit for myself. I never knew what I was doing was contrary to the law," he said.

In his own defence, the immigration official told Crime Reports that he only asked the supplier to take the victim to the Ministry of Health secretariat at Ikeja since the man told him that he was not familiar with Lagos. "I never knew he had the intention of writing fake yellow card for the man," the official said.

The PPRO however said that investigations were still on as the police commissioner, Ikemefuna Okoye was determined to wage war against producers of fake documents.

[The sale of fake yellow fever (YF) vaccination cards has been a recurring problem in Nigeria. In 2013, the Nigeria Ministry of Health replaced old cards with a new type in an attempt to prevent the sale of fake cards (see ProMED-mail archive no 20130827.1906967). Apparently, this effort has not been successful, since the report above indicates that there has been a recent, organized attempt to sell fake cards.

The sale of fake yellow fever vaccination cards to individuals who did not receive the vaccine presents a serious public health problem inside Nigeria and outside it. Susceptible, unvaccinated individuals can contribute to a YF outbreak within the country. YF virus is endemic in Nigeria, and an unvaccinated, viremic individual with a fake card who becomes infected in Nigeria could carry YF virus to localities where vector mosquitoes are present and initiate an outbreak of this serious disease.

Re the statement "The vaccination is expected to be administered at least 10 days before travelling and no longer than 10 years before, under International Health Regulations." This needs clarification. The vaccine does not take its full effect until 10 days later, so a person arriving in a country less than 10 days after being vaccinated may have problems with immigration.

***WHO has recently declared:
"A single dose of YF vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained life-long protective immunity against YF disease; a booster dose is not necessary." Ref: WHO/WER (Weekly Epidemiological Report) 2013. 27(88): 269-84 (p. 281). Vaccines and vaccination against yellow fever. WHO Position Paper -- June 2013; http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8827.pdf?ua=1.

On p. 283 WHO says a risk assessment should be done for people aged 60 years or more, taking into account underlying medical conditions and medications. CDC says, "If you cannot get the vaccine for medical reasons but require proof of yellow fever vaccination for travel, your doctor can give you a waiver letter if he considers the risk acceptably low. If you plan to use a waiver, you should also contact the embassy of the countries you plan to visit for more information." Ref: CDC 2011. Who Should NOT Get Vaccinated with these Vaccines? http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/should-not-vacc.htm#yf. Accessed 3 Feb 2014.

***Using a fake card puts not only your own life at risk but also the lives of others in your own country (if it has a vector mosquito), and in other such countries to which you travel. - Mod.JW]
