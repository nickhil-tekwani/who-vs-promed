Filariasis cases reported in Capiz
----------------------------------
The 1st-ever documented filariasis cases in Capiz
were found last month [September 2008]. This was
revealed by the Provincial Health Office (PHO) in
a press conference to discuss the result of a
survey by a team of health workers in some
barangays in Tapaz town last September. The team
was composed of health workers from the
Department of Health and Capiz Provincial as well as Municipal Health Offices.

Filariasis is a disease caused by worms
transmitted to humans through bites of infected female mosquitoes.

"Of 656 persons coming from 16 barangays in Tapaz
examined, 41 were found positive for having
filariasis," said PHO Medical Specialist IV
Evelyn T. Bolido during the press conference. The
disease may have no specific initial symptoms and
the worms can be detected through blood examination, Dra. Bolido added.

Filariasis may manifest as recurrent fever,
enlarged lymph nodes, and urine with color
similar to rice washing. If not treated, the
disease can lead to enlargement of the thigh, leg, breast or scrotum.

During the press conference, the Capiz health
authorities advised everyone to wear long sleeves
and pants when working in the fields, sleep under
mosquito nets, use mosquito repellant, and
install screens on windows and doors of the
house. The public are also urged to get rid of
possible mosquito breeding grounds in their homes
and consult the nearest health center as soon as
any of the symptoms is observed.

The PHO also assured the Capice F1os [?] that the
situation is under control and it is working
closely with all concerned agencies to address
the filariasis incidence. (PHO/PIA).
