For once the footballing cliche was entirely
justified. Tottenham Hotspur players were feeling
as sick as the proverbial parrot last night and
not just because they had been denied a place in
next season's Champions League -- a prize worth
30 million pounds [about USD 55.8 million]. Hours
before the kick-off in their crucial game with
West Ham, 10 of the team succumbed to an illness
as mysterious as the reasons why disappointed
footballers always seem to compare their
misfortunes to the well-being of
gorgeously-plumed birds from the tropics.
The cause of the debilitating bug among
Tottenham's finest was thought to be food
poisoning and fears that the team had been
nobbled [originally meaning to incapacitate a
racehorse, especially by drugging - CopyEd.PG]
were taken seriously enough for police forensic
experts to be called in as the club attempted to
have the game postponed. Its pleas were rejected
by the authorities, a setback mirrored soon
afterwards by a 2-1 defeat.
To make a bitter pill even harder to swallow --
for those few Spurs players able to contemplate
such an action -- the beneficiaries of their
defeat were arch-rivals Arsenal, whose victory
over Wigan clinched 4th spot in the Premiership
and that very lucrative place in Europe. It left
Tottenham fans raging against fate as the team
manager, Martin Jol, confirmed that he had had 10
players confined to their hotel beds in the
morning because they were unable to keep down
food and drink.
The evening before, the team had checked into the
400 pound-a-night [about USD 743] Marriott hotel
in Canary Wharf, east London, before the away
match at Upton Park, and had enjoyed a steak and
chicken buffet. "The police and health and
safety people were called but I don't suspect
foul play," said Jol.
Hotel staff was at pains to point out that the
players' illnesses were nothing more than an
unfortunate accident. But the police were
interested enough to send scientific evidence
experts to the hotel at the behest of the club.
Officers armed with forensic bags and plastic
gloves took away food samples to be tested.
The hotel said the players had been treated to a
buffet, prepared by its staff but under the
supervision of a club nutritionist. They ate in
a private room away from the main dining room and
no other guests are thought to have fallen ill.
Paul Downing, the hotel's general manager, said:
"We are used to having professional sports teams
staying with us. We prepared their meals, as
usual, liaising with a dietary expert from the
club. As far as I know there were no unusual
requests and no one ordered room service. We are
investigating how this happened. I have never
seen anything like it."
The drama began at 7am yesterday, 7 May 2006,
when Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy received a
phone call to say that 10 of his players, thought
to include the star striker and captain and other
starters, were being sick. The club tried to
have the match postponed, but the Premier League
ruled that it still had enough healthy players to
compete. Jol chose to play most of the ailing
players. However, they performed badly, with one
report claiming that a midfielder looked "barely
able to stand". Jol said: "I do not want to
blame the illnesses for our defeat but we were
not strong out there."
The legendary rivalry between the 2 north London
clubs runs deep, and this season the potential
for rancour has been greater than most. After
years in which Arsenal have been consistently far
more successful, the tables had appeared about to
turn. If Tottenham could have beaten West Ham
-- as they were widely expected to do -- they
would have finished higher in the league than
them for the first time in 13 years.

The players struck down by illness before
Sunday's clash at West Ham are improving, but
feeling the effects of the game. Martin Jol
described the lads as "heroes� after their
efforts but it was a sad end to the season as we
lost 2-1 and therefore missed out on 4th place."
Club doctor Kalpesh Parmar said this afternoon:
"Given the nature of such infection, it is
incredibly difficult to determine the origin. It
could be passed by food contamination or human
contact. In respect of the tests that have been
conducted it will be at least 48 hours before we
have those results. Early indications are that
it is going to be extremely difficult to pinpoint
accurately the origin."
He continued, "Another player called today to say
he had diarrhea and vomiting, the same symptoms
as the other players. He was told to stay at
home. I had a look at the players today and they
are all still feeling a bit rough and very tired
after the game. They have a lot of muscle
soreness, which is to be expected. We've
basically told them that they need to rehydrate
themselves, they are feeling better in terms of
their symptoms with the medication we gave them
to clear up the sickness and it's a question of
letting whatever they had work out of their
system."
"They are feeling better symptom-wise but they
are also feeling the effects of the game more
than they normally would," Parmar added. "I
don�t know how they got through it to be honest
-- one playing 90 minutes after the state he was
in, it was unbelievable."

[While the likelihood of intentional poisoning is
low, given the known fanaticism of football fans
on the eastern side of the Atlantic Pond,
stranger things have been known to occur. More
information on the outcome of the investigations
as to the etiology of this food poisoning event
would be gratefully appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
[The nature of the illness is unclear but likely
is either a viral gastroenteritis (probably
norovirus-related) or a toxin-induced process
such as from staphylococcal enterotoxin. - Mod.LL]
