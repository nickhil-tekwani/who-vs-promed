About 40 people have been confirmed dead following an outbreak of
meningitis in Kano state. The worst-hit area is Kano city where many houses
have poor ventilation. A similar outbreak killed 6 people in Kebbi state
last week while 86 people have been treated in hospital in Zamfara state.
However, the Kano state commissioner for health, Dr Muhammad Sanda, told
Daily Trust yesterday that only 25 deaths have been officially recorded,
and that many of the deaths were recorded at the beginning of the outbreak
in early Mar 2006, but assured that the number has dropped following
immediate intervention by health officials. Dr Sanda stated that as at
yesterday, 23 Apr 2006, the number of patients at the Infectious Diseases
Hospital (IDH), Kano, was 30.
At Hasiya Bayero, about 8 children infected with the disease were still
being treated, 6 children were seen at both the adult and children's wards
of the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital while at IDH, 30 people were
hospitalized. The outbreak of meningitis in Kano has become an annual event
because of poor sanitation and ventilation in many homes in the city.
In Gusau, Zamfara state, 6 people are currently receiving treatment at
various locations following the outbreak of meningitis. The most affected
areas included Tudun Wada, Sabo Gari and Filin Gunza where an undisclosed
number of people were hit by the disease.
At the Federal Medical Center, Gusau, Daily Trust gathered that victims,
mostly children were admitted and are receiving treatment. There are also
reported outbreaks of the disease in surrounding villages.
4 people were reported dead and over 1000 others affected by an outbreak of
meningitis that hit some parts of Katsina state last week. Checks conducted
by Daily Trust over the weekend revealed that children aged 10 and 12
years, mostly beggars, are the worst affected.
A report obtained exclusively by Daily Trust from Katsina General Hospital,
shows that in the pediatric ward alone, a total of 78 children were
affected from 1 to 19 Apr 2006, of whom 46 were discharged. The record
further indicated that most of the cases came from Tudun Yanlifidda, Kofar
Marusa and Kofar Kaura areas of Katsina metropolis and are mostly beggars
sleeping in a congested environment with about 50 to 60 children.

A meningitis epidemic in Eastern Guinea has hit at least 168 people and
killed 17 since the beginning of Apr 2006, the Swiss branch of Medecins
sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Sun, 23 Apr 2006.
According to Gerard Bedock, head of MSF-Switzerland's mission in Guinea,
the disease first appeared in the far eastern provincial capital, Mandiana,
between 4 and 6 Apr 2006, before spreading to other areas, including
Faralako, Koundian, Morodou, and Kinieran near the Malian border.
"At least 168 cases have been recorded, 17 of these being fatal", Bedock
said, "that means the mortality rate is 10 per cent."
Bedock also announced that a crisis committee was set up this weekend to
start a campaign of vaccination in the region, for which the health
ministry, WHO and UNICEF had brought 200 000 doses of the vaccine to the
area, along with other medicines.
Guinea is in the so-called "meningitis belt" that runs from the Southern
Sahara in Senegal to Ethiopia, and whose total population is estimated at
300 million people. The disease usually breaks out during the dry season,
which starts in Dec-Jan when the warm, dry Harmattan wind begins to blow,
spreading meningitis germs.

[Mandiana's location in eastern Guinea can be seen at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/guinea.pdf> in the Kankan
district. The Harmattan is a dry and dusty wind blowing south west and west
off the Sahara into the Gulf of Guinea between Nov and Mar. It is
considered a natural hazard.
On its passage over the desert it picks up fine dust particles (between 0.5
and 10 micrometers). When the Harmattan blows hard, it can push dust and
sand all the way to South America. In some countries in West Africa, the
heavy amount of dust in the air can severely limit visibility and block the
sun for several days, comparable to a heavy fog. The effect caused by the
dust and sand stirred by these winds is known as the Harmattan Haze, and
costs airlines millions in cancelled and diverted flights each year. In
Niger, people say that men and animals become increasingly irritable when
this wind has been blowing for a while, giving it a bad reputation. But the
cool wind brings relief from the oppressive heat, which is why the
Harmattan has earned the nickname "The Doctor" (source:

An outbreak of meningitis in Niger has killed 109 people since the start of
2006 and infected 1550 others, more than double the number of deaths
recorded by the UN a month ago, say officials.
The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said
last week that 802 people had been infected by the disease in Niger between
1 Jan and 10 Mar 2006, of whom 52 had died.
The Niger government's national health information system (SNIS) said the
outbreak this year was significantly worse than 2005, when 550 people were
infected and 76 of them died.
The OCHA said that in neighboring Burkina Faso, meningitis had infected
6110 people and killed 616 of them by 18 Mar 2006, a death rate per
infection of 10.8 per cent.
Niger and Burkina Faso, 2 of the world's poorest countries, are situated in
the Africa's meningitis belt, which stretched from Senegal in the west to
Ethiopia in the east and had a population of about 300 million.
