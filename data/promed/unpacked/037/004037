[1] WHO update on omicron
Date: Sun 28 Nov 2021
Source: WHO [edited]
https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron


On 26 Nov 2021, WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named omicron, on the advice of WHO's Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE). This decision was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes. Here is a summary of what is currently known:

Current knowledge about omicron

Researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available.

Transmissibility: It is not yet clear whether omicron is more transmissible (e.g., more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of omicron or other factors.

Severity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including delta. Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with omicron. There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with omicron are different from those from other variants. Initial reported infections were among university students -- younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease -- but understanding the level of severity of the omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of COVID-19, including the delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key.

Effectiveness of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

Preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with omicron (i.e., people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with omicron), as compared to other variants of concern, but information is limited. More information on this will become available in the coming days and weeks.

Effectiveness of vaccines: WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines. Vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against the dominant circulating variant, delta. Current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death.

Effectiveness of current tests: The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with omicron, as we have seen with other variants as well. Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests.

Effectiveness of current treatments: Corticosteroids and IL6 receptor blockers will still be effective for managing patients with severe COVID-19. Other treatments will be assessed to see if they are still as effective given the changes to parts of the virus in the omicron variant.

Studies underway

At the present time, WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand omicron. Studies currently underway or underway shortly include assessments of transmissibility, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatments.

WHO encourages countries to contribute the collection and sharing of hospitalized patient data through the WHO COVID-19 Clinical Data Platform to rapidly describe clinical characteristics and patient outcomes.

More information will emerge in the coming days and weeks. WHO's TAG-VE will continue to monitor and evaluate the data as it becomes available and assess how mutations in omicron alter the behaviour of the virus.

Recommended actions for countries

As omicron has been designated a variant of concern, there are several actions WHO recommends countries to undertake, including enhancing surveillance and sequencing of cases; sharing genome sequences on publicly available databases, such as GISAID; reporting initial cases or clusters to WHO; performing field investigations and laboratory assessments to better understand if omicron has different transmission or disease characteristics, or impacts effectiveness of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, or public health and social measures. More detail in the announcement from 26 Nov [2021] [https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern].

Countries should continue to implement the effective public health measures to reduce COVID-19 circulation overall, using a risk analysis and science-based approach. They should increase some public health and medical capacities to manage an increase in cases. WHO is providing countries with support and guidance for both readiness and response.

In addition, it is vitally important that inequities in access to COVID-19 vaccines are urgently addressed to ensure that vulnerable groups everywhere, including health workers and older persons, receive their 1st and 2nd doses, alongside equitable access to treatment and diagnostics.

Recommended actions for people

The most effective steps individuals can take to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus is to keep a physical distance of at least 1 metre [3.3 ft] from others; wear a well-fitting mask; open windows to improve ventilation; avoid poorly ventilated or crowded spaces; keep hands clean; cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue; and get vaccinated when it's their turn.

WHO will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available, including following meetings of the TAG-VE. In addition, information will be available on WHO's digital and social media platforms.

[2] Omicron: impact
Date: Sun 28 Nov 2021
Source: STAT News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2021/11/28/scientists-rapidly-identified-the-omicron-variant-but-firm-answers-about-its-impact-could-take-weeks/


The emergence of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, with a suite of mutations that suggests it might be extra transmissible and be able to evade at least some immune protection, has the world eager for answers about what it means for the COVID-19 pandemic. But so much remains unknown largely because the variant appears to have been detected and publicized so quickly.

With other variants, a matter of months passed between the time they were first documented until they were designated "variants of concern," in some cases giving scientists more opportunity to understand them before they attracted widespread attention. With omicron, initially identified as B.1.1.529, it all happened within about 2 weeks.

As they race to launch more rigorous studies, scientists for now are trying to glean insights from limited epidemiological evidence in South Africa and from the list of mutations the variant has acquired, some of which are associated with an increased ability to spread or to get around immune protection. The variant is also notable for its sheer number of mutations: 32 alone in its spike protein, which is what the vaccines teach our immune systems to target. Other variants just had a handful of mutations in spike.

"Right now, there are many studies that are underway," Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead on COVID-19, said Friday [26 Nov 2021]. "There is a lot of work that is ongoing in South Africa and in other countries to better characterize the variant itself, in terms of transmissibility, in terms of severity, and any impact on our countermeasures, like the use of diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines. So far, there is little information, but those studies are underway, so we need researchers to have the time to carry them out." She added: "It will take days to weeks for some of these studies to be undertaken."

The scientists who have conducted the early research on omicron stress they don't know if the variant will have a major impact globally. But they have reasons for concern, which is why they're urging nations to prepare and act early.

For now, perhaps the most pressing questions about omicron are: Is it more transmissible than even the delta variant, and if so, how much? And to what extent can it evade immune protection generated by earlier infections or vaccines?

On the transmissibility question, experts will watch closely to see how omicron continues to play out in South Africa and elsewhere.

Early epidemiological data suggested that omicron was racing ahead of delta in South Africa, and even replacing it faster than delta did other variants. (A potential spreading advantage could mean the variant is inherently more transmissible, that it is able to cause infections at higher rates than other versions of the virus in people who are protected, or some combination of the 2.)

Levels of COVID-19 in South Africa were subdued when the variant was first detected; since that time, numbers have jumped. It's possible that means omicron has a growth advantage over delta, but it's also possible that it's riding the new surge of cases, not driving it. Some scientists hypothesized that the rise in cases has been propelled by some superspreading events, explaining why a surge was first detected primarily in Gauteng province. Now, however, cases from the variant are increasing around the country, the WHO said, but some of the increase could be tied to which infections are being sequenced.

If omicron establishes toeholds in other countries and pulls ahead of delta there as well, it will help solidify the idea that it's more transmissible.

To determine whether the variant might undermine immunity generated by vaccines or infection, scientists can draw antibodies from people's blood and test them against omicron. But it takes time to grow the variant in labs or to build an engineered version of it that can serve as a model for the virus.

The WHO said Saturday [27 Nov 2021] that early evidence indicated the variant was causing reinfections at higher rates than other variants in South Africa, suggesting some ability to get around the immune response.

"Studies are being rapidly conducted in South Africa to look at antibody neutralization of this variant, as well as interactions with T cells, but these studies are going to take several weeks to complete," said Sharon Peacock, the director of the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium. She described the variant as having "several aspects of concern" but with "lots of unknowns."

With new variants, vaccines can lose a step at blocking infections -- particularly if the antibodies they elicit aren't able to recognize the virus as well -- but still largely maintain their ability to guard against severe disease and death because of the broader immune response, including T cells. This has happened already to varying degrees with other variants, to the greatest extent with the beta variant and even to some extent with delta. It's also possible that if there's a greater degree of immune escape, a higher percentage of breakthrough cases will lead to serious outcomes. That wouldn't point to complete vaccine failure, but it would point to reduction in vaccine effectiveness.

Joe Phaahla, South Africa's health minister, said Friday [26 Nov 2021] that breakthrough infections were occurring in the country, but the majority of hospital admissions remained among people who were not vaccinated, suggesting that vaccines were still maintaining some level of protection against omicron. But, he acknowledged, "it's still early days in terms of this particular variant."

There is also a question about whether omicron causes the same disease severity on average as other variants. Studies will look at the rates of people who have omicron and go on to be hospitalized or die, compared to delta and other variants.

Omicron was first identified primarily in Botswana and South Africa, but it didn't necessarily emerge there. Those countries have strong sequencing networks so were in a better place to detect a new variant. Still, many countries, including the United States, have announced restrictions on travel from those countries, as well as their neighbors in southern Africa.

Studies have shown that travel restrictions can slow, but not necessarily hold off, the arrival of variants of a virus like SARS-CoV-2. Case in point: The variant was detected in a handful of European countries even after travel restrictions were announced.

Pathogens generally follow travel patterns as they spread, but there's also a lot of randomness about whether and when variants will take off in a given place. Some imported infections won't go anywhere, but others will set off chains of transmissions; the more cases that are introduced, the higher the likelihood that some ignite spread.

Omicron will also underscore the sometimes-competing priorities of vaccine campaigns. In wealthy countries that stockpiled vast amounts of vaccines, it will increase calls for eligible people to get booster shots; if the variant is able to get around the immunity from the primary series to an extent, a booster could help pep up the immune system enough to fend off a highly mutated form of the virus.

An even more transmissible virus will worsen the plight of countries with limited vaccine supplies. Already, advocates were arguing the emergence of omicron is a demonstration of what happens when the world has such inequitable distribution of vaccines, and transmission is allowed to persist at such high levels in certain parts of the world.

[3] Omicron: patience
Date: Sat 27 Nov 2021
Source: Science [edited]
https://www.science.org/content/article/patience-crucial-why-we-won-t-know-weeks-how-dangerous-omicron


At 7:30 a.m. on [Wed 24 Nov 2021]], Kristian Andersen, an infectious disease researcher at Scripps Research in San Diego, received a message on Slack: "This variant is completely insane." Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh was reacting to a new SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence found in 3 samples collected in Botswana on 11 Nov [2021] and one picked up a week later in a traveler from South Africa to Hong Kong.

Andersen looked at the data and then replied: "... that is quite something. The length of that branch..." A few minutes later he added: "Just had a look at the list of mutations. So nuts."

They were talking about what is now called omicron, a new variant of concern, and the long branch Andersen noticed refers to its distance to every other known virus on SARS-CoV-2's evolutionary tree. The variant seemed to have picked up dozens of mutations, many of them known to be important in evading immunity or increasing transmissibility, with no intermediate sequences in the database of millions of viral genomes. On [Tue 23 Nov 2021], after spotting the odd sequences in a global database, Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, had already posted his own verdict on GitHub: "This could be of real concern."

Now, once again, the world is watching as researchers work nights and weekends to learn what a new variant has in store for humanity. Is omicron more infectious? More deadly? Is it better at re-infecting recovered people? How well does it evade vaccine-induced immunity? And where did it come from? Finding out will take time, warns Jeremy Farrar, the head of the Wellcome Trust: "I'm afraid patience is crucial."

Researchers in South Africa were already on the trail of this new variant. Several teams were independently trying to figure out why cases were spiking in Gauteng, a northern province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria. And a private lab called Lancet had noticed that routine PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were failing to detect a key target, the S gene, in many samples, a phenomenon previously seen with alpha, another variant of concern. When Lancet sequenced 8 of these viruses, they found out why: The genome was so heavily mutated that the test missed the gene.

Lancet shared the genomes with the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA), which called an urgent meeting on [Tue 23 Nov 2021]. "We were shocked by the number of mutations," says Tulio de Oliveira, a virologist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and NGS-SA's principal investigator. After the meeting, de Oliveira says, he called South Africa's director general of health and "asked him to inform the minister and president that a potential new variant was emerging." The team sequenced another 100 randomly selected sequences from Gauteng in the next 24 hours. All showed the same pattern. After informing the government, de Oliveira and his colleagues presented their evidence at a press conference on [Thu 25 Nov 2021] morning. On [Fri 26 Nov 2021], the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the virus a "variant of concern" and christened it omicron. (Variant names follow the Greek alphabet, but WHO skipped the letters nu and xi, it said, "because nu is too easily confounded with 'new,' and xi was not used because it is a common surname.")

One reason for concern about omicron is that sequenced samples indicate it has rapidly replaced other variants in South Africa. But that picture might be skewed. For one, sequencing might have been focused on possible cases of the new variant in recent days, which could make it appear more frequent than it is. PCR data provide broader coverage and a less biased view, but there, too, samples with the S gene failure indicate a rapid rise of omicron.

But the rising frequency could still be due in part to chance. In San Diego, a series of superspreading events at a university resulted in an explosion of one particular strain of SARS-CoV-2 earlier this year [2021], Andersen says: "It was thousands of cases and they were all the same virus." But the virus wasn't notably more infectious. South Africa has seen relatively few cases recently, so a series of superspreading events could have led to the rapid increase of omicron. "I suspect that a lot of that signal is explained by that, and I desperately hope so," Andersen says. Based on a comparison of different omicron genomes, Andersen estimates that the virus emerged sometime around late September or early October [2021], which suggests it might be spreading more slowly than it appears to have.

The other reason to be concerned is omicron's confusing genome. Its spike protein, which latches on to cells on human receptors, has 30 amino acid differences from that of the original Wuhan virus. In addition, amino acids have disappeared in 3 places and new ones appeared in one place. (Other proteins, too, have undergone changes.) Many of the changes in spike are around the receptor binding domain, the part of the protein that makes contact with the human cell. "That is very troubling," Farrar says. Structural biology mapping last year [2020] showed that some of these changes made the virus bind to the receptor much better.

It's hard to tell how infectious a virus is based on mutations alone, says Aris Katzourakis, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford. "But if we were looking out for mutations that do affect transmissibility, it's got all of them," he says.

The sequence also suggests the virus could excel at evading human antibodies, says Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The human immune system produces a host of different antibodies that can neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but many of the most important ones fall into 3 categories that each target a slightly different site on the spike protein of the virus, simply called 1, 2, and 3. A mutation called E484K has long been worrying because it changes the shape of the site that class 2 antibodies recognize, making them less potent. Omicron carries a mutation called E484A in this site and similar changes in the sites for the other 2 classes of antibodies.

Bloom thinks people who recovered from COVID or were vaccinated are unlikely to completely lose their ability to neutralize the virus. "But I would expect, based on this particular combination of mutations, that the drop in neutralization is larger than for all the other major variants."

Experiments in the laboratory will have to show whether he is right. Alex Sigal, an infectious disease researcher at the Africa Health Research Institute, says he received swabs with omicron on [Wed 24 Nov 2021] and has started to grow the virus. Producing enough of it to test against sera from vaccinated and recovered individuals will take a week or two, he says. Other researchers will test viruses genetically engineered to carry just the spike protein of omicron, a process that is faster than growing the variant itself, but a bit further removed from what happens in real life.

As such studies take place, it's crucial to closely monitor any shifts in the pandemic, Farrar says. "Do you see cases increasing not just in South Africa but the broader South African region?" The virus has already been picked up in Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Israel, Farrar points out, and will probably be found elsewhere as well. "Do you see transmission increasing in other parts of the world around presumed index cases?" Epidemiologists will also watch for changes in disease severity: how many people are hospitalized and die. All that will take time.

In the meantime, the European Union, the United States, and many other countries have restricted travel to and from southern Africa in a bid to protect themselves. Travel restrictions are unlikely to stop the variant, Farrar says, but they can buy some time. "The question is what you then do with the time."

Travel restrictions come with an economic and social cost, which could be a disincentive to report new variants. "I've heard through the grapevine that countries didn't push sequences out very quickly [in the past] because they were worried about travel bans," says Emma Hodcroft, a virologist at the University of Bern. "This is the opposite of what we want."

Such considerations did not stop South African researchers, de Oliveira says. "We do risk a massive backlash in case [omicron] does not cause a massive wave of infection and can be controlled," he wrote in a message. "But this is a risk that I am comfortable to live with as the pandemic has caused so many deaths and suffering. [Our] hope is that our early identification will help the world."
