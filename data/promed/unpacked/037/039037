Strange disease affects coffee crops
------------------------------------
Mario Baquiata, president of the Association of Coffee Producers in Apolo (APCA in Spanish) [Department of La Paz], announced that this year [2014] a strange disease has appeared that is destroying coffee crops in the region.

"APCA producers are concerned after the appearance this year [2014] of an unknown disease that is severely affecting plantations. For the local producers, coffee is the only source of income," he said.

He also requested government support to fight the problem. Apca comprises 18 coffee producing communities.

[New and more aggressive strains of coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, are currently emerging in the southern Americas, including Colombia. A number of other coffee diseases are also known to occur in the region. Reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems reported above is needed before any management strategies can be designed.
