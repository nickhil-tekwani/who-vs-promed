Abstract
----------------
Background
Bacterial co-pathogens are commonly identified in viral respiratory infections and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of bacterial infection in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood.

Objective
To determine the prevalence of bacterial co-infection (at presentation) and secondary infection (after presentation) in patients with COVID-19.

Data Sources
We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE databases for English language literature from 2019 to 16 Apr 2020.

Study Eligibility Criteria
Studies were included if they 1) evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 2) reported the prevalence of acute bacterial infection.

Methods
Data were extracted by a single reviewer and cross-checked by a 2nd reviewer. The main outcome was the proportion of COVID-19 patients with an acute bacterial infection. Any bacteria detected from non-respiratory tract or non-bloodstream source were excluded.

Results
Of 1308 studies screened, 28 were eligible and included in the rapid review representing 3448 patients with COVID-19 evaluated for acute bacterial infection. In the meta-analysis, bacterial co-infection (estimated on presentation) was identified in 3.5% of patients (95%CI 0.6 to 6.5%) and secondary bacterial infection in 15.5% of patients (95% CI 10.9 to 20.1%). The overall proportion of COVID-19 patients with bacterial infection was 7.1% (95% CI 4.6 to 9.6%). Bacterial infection was more common in critically ill patients 8.1% (95% CI 2.3 to 13.8). The majority of patients with COVID-19 received antibiotics (71.3%, 95% CI 57.1 to 85.5%).

Conclusions
Bacterial co-infection is relatively infrequent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The majority of these patients may not require empiric antibacterial treatment.

[2] Children as Covid-19 Spreaders

Children younger than 5 years with mild or moderate COVID-19 have much higher levels of coronavirus genetic material in their nose and throat than do older children and adults, according to a research letter published yesterday [30 Jul 2020] in JAMA Pediatrics.

Researchers at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Northwestern University analyzed data from 145 kids within the 1st week of symptoms of mild or moderate coronavirus infection, comparing loads of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in 46 children younger than 5 years, 51 children 5 to 17 years, and 48 adults 18 to 65 years old.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification cycle threshold values revealed that very young children had 10 to 100 times more coronavirus RNA in their upper respiratory tract than older kids and adults.

The authors noted that their study could detect only viral RNA, not live virus, although some previous studies have shown a correlation between higher viral RNA levels and the ability to culture live virus.

They said their findings could mean that young children, who often have mild or asymptomatic illness, spread the virus as much as other age-groups. This mode of transmission may have been under recognized due to the rapid closure of schools and daycare facilities earlier in the pandemic, which prevented large studies of schools as a conduit of community spread.

"Behavioral habits of young children and close quarters in school and day care settings raise concern for SARS-CoV-2 amplification in this population as public health restrictions are eased," they wrote. "In addition to public health implications, this population will be important for targeting immunization efforts as SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available."

[Children are known to shed other viral respiratory pathogens (influenza, human rhinoviruses etc.) for much longer periods than older children and adults (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4829445/), a feature that is also replicated with SARS-CoV-2. The incubation period in children is approximately 2 days, with a range of 2-10 days (similar to adults). The mean incubation period between household exposure and pediatric symptom onset is approximately one day longer than observed in adult cases. Children typically have negative swabs within 6-22 days of symptom onset, but often not until 2 weeks' time. Children have been found to have high viral loads despite mild symptoms, with prolonged shedding in nasal secretions. As a result of the lower symptom burden, the rates of asymptomatic transmission or transmission with mild symptoms are unknown. There is little documented evidence of child-to-adult transmission of SARS-CoV2. This is different than outbreaks of other viruses such as influenza where children have been found to have a high rate of infection outside of the household and significant inter-generational transmission. Data in the above study is on viral RNA and not live viral shedding, which does not conclusively indicate potential for higher transmission or spread.

The molecular test/PCR remains imperfect in that it may continue to detect viral genetic materials in absence of live virus, which does not mean that the individual is infectious. - Mod.UBA]

- 04:58 GMT -- Japan - Okinawa declares state of emergency
Japan's Okinawa region has declared a state of emergency and asked people to stay home for 2 weeks amid an "explosive spread" of coronavirus cases. Governor Denny Tamaki said hospitals were being overwhelmed by the surge and told residents to avoid non-essential outings through the emergency, which is set to end on 15 Aug 2020. Okinawa reported 71 new coronavirus cases Fri 31 Jul 2020, bringing its total to 395. US forces based on the island account for 248 of those cases.

- 03:47 GMT -- 20 US states, territories exploring contact tracing apps [Google]
Alphabet Inc's Google says 20 US states and territories, representing about 45 percent of the country's population, are "exploring" contact tracing apps using a tool it developed with Apple Inc. In addition, the company said public health authorities in 16 countries and regions outside the US had launched apps using the Apple-Google tool, up from 12 previously. They include Austria, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Gibraltar, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Uruguay. The technology enables app users to track encounters with other people through Bluetooth signals and anonymously notify contacts if they later become infected with the virus. Google said the 1st of the US apps would be released in the "coming weeks" but declined to name the states. It added that its system with Apple now enables apps launched by different countries to talk to each other, allowing contact-logging to continue even when users cross borders.

- 02:48 GMT -- USA - California, Florida reports record rise in deaths
California and Florida, 2 of the most populous US states, have reported record increases in COVID-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Florida reported 257 deaths and California, 208 on Fri 31 Jul 2020. For Florida, this is the 4th day in a row with a record rise in deaths and for California the 2nd this week. Mississippi, Montana and Nevada also had a one-day record increase in deaths on Fri 31 Jul 2020. Overall in the US, deaths have increased by more than 25 000 in July 2020 to 153 000 total lives lost since the pandemic started.

- 03:26 GMT -- China - Sharp drop in new cases
China has reported a sharp drop in newly confirmed infections in the mainland, logging 45 additional cases in a possible sign that its latest outbreak in Xinjiang may have run its course. 31 of the cases were in far western Xinjiang; 8 were in northeastern Liaoning, and the remaining 6 were imported cases. The figures are down from 127 cases reported nationally on Fri 31 Jul 2020.

- 03:15 GMT -- Viet Nam - new cases, increased testing
Viet Nam's health ministry has reported 12 new local coronavirus cases linked to the recent outbreak in the tourist hotspot of Danang, taking total infections to 116 since the virus resurfaced last week. The new patients, with ages ranging from 2 to 78, are linked to Danang hospital, the ministry said in a statement. Viet Nam has registered a total of 558 coronavirus cases since the pandemic began. After months of successful curbs, it reported its 1st 2 deaths on Fri 31 Jul 2020. In Hanoi, where 2 people have tested positive after returning from Danang, more than 100 clinics have been set up with test kits to detect the virus. Hanoi has tested 1/3rd of the 54 000 people returning from Danang. "I want to be tested so I can stop worrying if I have the virus or not. It is for me and for the community," said Pham Thuy Hoa, a banking official who recently went to Danang for a family vacation. "Since coming back, my family and I have quarantined ourselves at home. I did not go to work or see others. We must be responsible for the entire community." In Ho Chi Minh City, the country's southern hub, 5 people who returned from Danang have tested positive for the virus. The city is testing some 20 000 other returnees. As the number of cases continues to increase, Danang has tightened security and set up more checkpoints to prevent people from leaving or entering the city, which has been in lockdown since Tue 28 Jul 2020.

- 01:41 GMT -- Puerto Rico extends restrictions
Wanda Vazquez, the governor of Puerto Rico, has extended measures aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus for 2 more weeks. That means bars, gyms, marinas and movie theatres across the US territory will stay shuttered until at least 15 Aug 2020. Beaches remain closed on Sundays and are open the rest of the week only to people doing exercise, including surfers, swimmers and runners. Face masks continue to be mandatory, and those who refuse to wear one will be arrested, Vazquez said. A curfew from 10pm to 5am will remain in place, and no parties or gatherings will be allowed in short-term rental facilities.

- 00:56 GMT -- Mexico overtakes UK to post 3rd-highest death toll
The number of coronavirus deaths in Mexico rose to 46 688 on Fri 31 Jul 2020, with the Latin American country overtaking the United Kingdom for the world's 3rd-highest COVID-19 death toll. The health ministry registered 8458 new cases, a record for a single day, as well as 688 additional deaths, bringing the total to 424 637 cases and 46 688 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases.

- 00:36 GMT -- Free tests for migrants stuck at Costa Rica-Nicaragua border
Costa Rican doctors have started giving free coronavirus tests to about 200 Nicaraguan migrants who have been stranded at the 2 countries' border for more than a week because the Nicaraguan government has demanded negative test results.

- 00:18 GMT -- Argentina halts plans to ease lockdown
Argentina President Alberto Fernandez has announced a halt on the easing of lockdown measures due to an increase in new cases and fears the health system could become overwhelmed. "We will keep things as they are until 16 Aug 2020," said Fernandez. "In the last few days the virus has been spreading more, and we've seen a larger increase in infections. All this generates hospital admissions and unfortunately, deaths." In Argentina, more than 185 000 infections and nearly 3500 deaths have been registered so far, figures well below those of other countries in the region.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.UBA]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 1 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The 4th meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding COVID-19 was convened by the WHO Director-General on 31 Jul 2020. The Director-General declared that the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Recommendations from the Emergency Committee highlight the need for response efforts to continue over the long term.
- WHO has updated the interim guidance on Water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH), and waste management for SARS-CoV-2. The document provides additional details on risks associated with excreta and untreated sewage, on hand hygiene, on protecting WASH workers, and on supporting the continuation and strengthening of WASH services, especially in underserved areas.
- WHO has published a draft for Target Product Profiles (TPP) for COVID-19 therapeutics. The 3 sets of TPPs describe the preferred and minimally acceptable profiles for therapeutic agents for the treatment of those with COVID-19, ranging from mild through critically ill patients. Comments on this document are welcomed by submitting a comment form. All forms should be completed with the details of the individual or organization providing the comment.
- For World Breastfeeding Week, WHO and UNICEF are calling on governments to protect and promote women's access to skilled breastfeeding counselling. This is a critical component of breastfeeding support and, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important to find innovative solutions to ensure that access to these essential services is not disrupted.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 58.1% of the global newly reported cases and 66.6% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 9.1 million cases. USA reported 40.0% of cases (67 823), followed by Brazil 34.4% (57 837), Colombia 5.9% (9965), Mexico 4.5% (7730), Peru 4.0% (6809), Argentina 3.7% (6377), and Chile 0.1% (213).

- The European region reported 7.8% of the global newly reported cases and 7.3% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 24.2% (5462) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 13.7% (3092), Romania 5.7% (1295), Kazakhstan 5.6% (1289), France 5.7% (1272), Ukraine 5.2% (1172), Turkey 4.4% (982), Germany 4.2% (955), the UK 3.9% (880), Uzbekistan 3.4% (746), Poland 2.9% (657), and Kyrgyzstan 2.2% (494). While the proportion of cases represented by Russia is continuing to drop, the absolute numbers of cases are relatively stable in keeping with the increase in activity in Eastern European countries. Spain and France are having renewed increased transmission, and Eastern Europe remains active.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.0% of the global newly reported cases and 5.8% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 28.7% (3346), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 22.9% (2674), Saudi Arabia 14.5% (1686), Morocco 9.1% (1063), Kuwait 5.4% (626), Bahrain 3.8% (444), Egypt 3.4% (401), and Palestinian Authority 3.3% (380). Pakistan and Oman did not report their case numbers in the last 24 hours, although the Worldometer data available on the link in the next section shows 841 cases for Pakistan, while the number of cases from Oman is not available. Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020 (on 1 Jul 2020, Pakistan reported 4133 newly confirmed cases), while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq, Oman and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 6.2% of the global newly reported cases and 5.1% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 61.1% (11 014) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Equatorial Guinea 13.7% (2471), Ethiopia 5.1% (915) Kenya 4.0% (723), Algeria 3.1% (563), Nigeria 2.6% (462), Zambia 2.3% (408), Ghana 2.0% (362), and Madagascar 0.7% (120). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000, 21 of the 31 days. Zambia is showing/reporting higher case numbers and made the list today [1 Aug 2020] ahead of Ghana and Madagascar.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.3% of the global newly reported cases and 0.94% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 59.2% (3980) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 21.8% (1464), Australia 8.9% (602), Singapore 5.9% (396), China 2.5% (166), Viet Nam 0.72% (49), and South Korea 0.46% (31). Japan is definitely experiencing an increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 21.5% of the global newly reported cases and 14.1% of global deaths. India reported 91.7% (57 118) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.5% (2772) and Indonesia 3.3% (2040). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (31 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with a daily case count today [1 Aug 2020] approaching 55 000. The world tally crossed the 18 million mark in the last 24 hours.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported (58 429) cases followed by India (54 865) and Brazil (42 578). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (60.9%). There were 5798 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Russia, and the Philippines, all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 4963 to 58 429. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iran, Iraq, Bangladesh, Chile, Indonesia, Dominican Republic, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Bolivia, and their range of reported new cases is 1555 to 2548.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 3.7%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 7.0%. The key question arises as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or is this a reporting artifact? Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances.

Impression: Essentially unchanged. The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.UBA]
