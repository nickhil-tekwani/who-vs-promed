Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Australia
-------------------------------------
Information received on 28 Mar 2017 from Dr Mark Schipp, chief veterinary officer, Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Australian Government, Canberra, Australia

Summary:
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 14 Mar 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 14 Mar 2017
Report date: 27 Mar 2017
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 1, strain K5 [RHDV1 K5]
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Canberra, Australian Capital Territory
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Mar 2017
Outbreak status: resolved 27 Mar 2017
Epidemiological unit: natural park
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
European rabbit: _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ (Leporide) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: single dead rabbit found near RHDV1 K5 release site on the outskirts of Canberra.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Released as biological control agent
Epidemiological comment: Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus 1, strain K5 was released in all jurisdictions throughout Australia, as a biological control agent, in the first week of March 2017. This case is the 1st reported case following the release of this strain of RHDV1, which is now considered endemic throughout the country.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exist); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
CSIRO, Black Mountain, Canberra (National laboratory) / European rabbit / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 14 Mar 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. RHD is characterized by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

For these characteristics of RHDV, it was deliberately released in Australia and New Zealand. There, RHD has reduced rabbit abundance, particularly in dry regions, but rabbits in cooler, high-rainfall areas have been able to maintain their populations. In Australia and New Zealand, RHD has raised the prospects for managing rabbits in low rainfall areas and brought substantial economic and environmental benefits. It is expected that after many generations the defense strategies of rabbits evolve to resist and/or tolerate RHDV, so introduction of a novel strain might enable boosting the efficiency of RHD as a biological control. - Mod.PMB
