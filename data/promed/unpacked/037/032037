Chagas disease and blood donations in Canada
-------------------------
According to a report on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's
Radio one program the Current, (aired 19 Nov 2003) it's 5 cases in US
and 2 cases in Canada, both in Manitoba. The cases were both
immunocompromised by chemotherapy for cancer. One case, a child, died
shortly after acquiring Chagas through transfusion of blood products,
but may have died of complications of his underlying illness -- this
was 17 years ago. The other case received the Chagas treatment
protocol recommended by CDC-Atlanta, survived Chagas, but eventually
succumbed to the cancer. The donors were both non-Hispanic with
history of travel or residence in Latin America, no history of
symptoms, and no symptoms at time of blood donation. More info will
likely be posted later on the CBC website.

Parasite may pose a risk to blood supply
-----------------------
A parasitic infection that is common is Latin America is threatening
the U.S. blood system, and Canadian officials say they are evaluating
the risk it poses here. The infection, Chagas disease, is still rare
in North America. There have been 2 cases in Canada transmitted by
blood transfusion since 1986, including one person infected in
Manitoba in 2000, said Lorna Tessier, a spokeswoman for Canadian
Blood Services. Chagas, a microscopic parasite, is common in Mexico,
Central America, and South America. Insects called Reduviids, also
known as kissing or assassin bugs, live in thatched houses and drop
down on humans while they sleep. They find their way into people's
mouths, suck their blood, and leave behind a tiny drop of excrement
that is laden with the parasite. Infected people initially suffer
from fever and swollen glands, but the disease can lie dormant for up
to 30 years. It eventually weakens organs -- including the heart --
causing them to rupture. There is no effectiv!
e treatment or vaccine.
Chagas is widespread in much of Latin America, where 18 million
people are infected and 50 000 people die of the disease each year.
The 2 Canadian cases were both the result of blood that was donated
by Canadians who had travelled to rural Latin America. In 1997,
Canadian Blood Services conducted a survey in Toronto. The
organization assessed all blood donors who had travelled to affected
parts of Latin America over a 14-month period. Of the 1300 people
tested, no one showed any signs of the disease, Ms. Tessier said. The
blood agency is now considering whether to undertake a second survey
to help assess the risk. There is currently no way to screen blood
for the parasite that causes Chagas, although 2 U.S. drug companies
are working on a test. In the United States, experts say it is one of
the top threats to the blood supply, but has been overshadowed by
more high-profile diseases such as West Nile and bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (mad-cow disease). Studies have shown the!
re is a significant risk of getting Chagas from donated blood in some
parts of the United States, particularly in regions that are home to
people who immigrated from an area that covers southern Mexico to
northern Chile.
In 1998, a study found that in Los Angeles, there was a one-in-5400
chance of getting the disease from donated blood. In Miami, the risk
was one in 9000. In the United States, blood donors are asked whether
they have visited a country were Chagas is prevalent, or whether they
have slept in a thatched hut. In Canada, blood donors are asked only
about their travel. At least 2 blood donors brought the disease home
with them. By 2000, when the second patient was infected with Chagas,
Canadian Blood Services had a system in place to trace everyone who
may have been given blood or blood products made from the infected
donation, Ms. Tessier said. But in 1986, the Red Cross was in charge,
and it is unclear whether everyone who may have been infected was
located or notified. "We may not even have records from then," Ms.
Tessier said.

[ProMED thanks Dominique Charron for her comments on the 2 patients
infected with _Trypanosoma cruzi_ via transfusion in Canada. Lona
Tessier from the Canadian Blood Services, quoted in the article from
The Globe and Mail, further discusses the Canadian situation. The
study mentioned by Dr. Tessier of returning Canadians travelling in
_T.cruzi_-infected areas probably is the wrong population to study.
Travellers are rarely exposed to infection, and _T.cruzi_ infection
in travellers is exceedingly rare. The triatomid bug, which transmits
_T.cruzi_, lives in cracks and crevices in mud walls, and it is
therefore immigrants living under poor conditions for a prolonged
time who may carry the infection and pass it on through blood
transfusion. It is noteworthy that the 2 Canadian
transfusion-infected patients were both immunosuppressed, suggesting
that transfusion-related infections may be asymptomatic -- at least
for some time -- in people with normal immune function. - Mod.EP]
