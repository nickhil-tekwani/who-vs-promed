About 190 000 ducks have been culled in the Netherlands as the authorities try to prevent the spread of bird flu across northern European countries. The slaughter involved 6 farms, following the discovery of a virus in the village of Biddinghuizen, some 70 km (43 miles) east of Amsterdam.

Officials said they were checking for bird flu at farms within 3 km [2 mi] of the original site and imposed a ban on transporting poultry products within a 10 km (6 mi) radius.

[According to information published on 26 Nov 2016 on the website of Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, at Lelystad in The Netherlands, designated as national reference laboratory for viruses and contagious animal diseases, the pathogen involved has been identified as HPAI H5N8. The affected farm kept meat ducks. The same company keeps meat ducks in 4 other holdings, 3 of them in Hierden and one in Ermelo. These were said to be preventively culled at the same time, totalling about 180 000 ducks. An additional 10 000 ducks were to be preventively culled on another holding which is situated within 1 km (0.6 mi) from the infected holding in Biddinghuizen.
