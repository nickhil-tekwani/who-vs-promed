Norovirus outbreak affects 380 passengers on cruise ship
-----------------------------------------------
More than 380 passengers and crew aboard a cruise ship were affected
by a virus [infection] during a 7-day Caribbean cruise, cruise
officials said on Sun 3 Dec 2006. The outbreak struck Royal Caribbean
Cruises Ltd.'s "Freedom of the Seas," which returned as scheduled to
the Port of Miami on Sun 3 Dec 2006, according to a statement from
the Miami-based company.
The ill passengers received over-the-counter medication, and crew
members sanitized frequently touched surfaces such as railings, door
handles and elevator buttons after the short-lived outbreak began,
officials said.
A guest previously exposed to norovirus likely brought it on board 26
Nov 2006, according to the cruise line. Noroviruses, characterized by
[gastric] flu-like symptoms, affect about 23 million Americans
annually, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. An
outbreak struck more than 700 passengers and crew members aboard a
trans-Atlantic cruise last month [November 2006] on the Carnival
Cruise Lines' Liberty [see: Norovirus, cruise ship - trans-Atlantic
20061117.3289].
The Freedom of the Seas, which was [commissioned] in May 2006, can
carry more than 4000 people aboard its 15 passenger decks. Standing
upright on its bow, it would be taller than the Eiffel Tower.

Hundreds sick on world's largest cruise ship
-----------------------------------------------
Nearly 400 passengers and crew were sickened by a common stomach
virus on a Caribbean cruise aboard Royal Caribbean's "Freedom of the
Seas," the world's largest cruise ship, the company said on Sun 3 Dec
2006. It said 338 of the ship's 3823 passengers and 46 of its 1402
crew came down with what was believed to be a norovirus [infection],
a gastrointestinal ailment brought on board by a passenger. The ship
returned to Miami on Sunday [3 Dec 2006] after completing a 7-day
cruise to Mexico, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica and Haiti. Royal
Caribbean said those affected were treated with an over-the-counter
medication and responded well.
"Freedom of the Seas" made its debut in May 2006. It is the largest
cruise ship at about 160 000 tons and has among its amenities a wave
pool for surfers and an ice rink.
Last month [November 2006], more than 700 people on Carnival Corp.'s
cruise liner "Liberty" fell ill on a trans-Atlantic cruise from Italy
to Florida.

[Outbreaks of norovirus-associated viral gastroenteritis among
passengers and crew of even the most modern cruise ships continue to
occur regularly, despite awareness of the problem and development of
techniques for thorough and efficient decontamination of vessels
between cruises.
Cruise ships operating in the Caribbean, which carry passengers
anxious to escape the rigors of the northern hemisphere winter, are
particularly vulnerable. Unfortunately, such passengers tend to bring
with them viruses prevalent during winter months, such as
noroviruses, which cause "winter vomiting disease" in the northern
hemisphere. Noroviruses may exhibit significant antigenic
heterogeneity, and mini-epidemics can result from circumstances in
which groups of individuals from different backgrounds congregate
together (as, for instance, as passengers in a cruise ship).
Fortunately, viral gastroenteritis caused by norovirus infection is
short-lived and has no serious outcome.

[In fairness to the cruise companies, this moderator had a recent
(uneventful) voyage on a cruise ship that provided some fascinating
anecdotal observations worth sharing. The cruise line had ample
notices in every stateroom warning of the risks for possible
gastroenteritis, urging passengers who might become ill to present
themselves to the infirmary sooner rather than later in the course of
their illness (to allow for early identification of a possible
problem on board the ship). Hand sanitizer dispensers were abundant
and at all entry points to the ship for passengers to clean their
hands before re-boarding the ship; they were also present at the
entry to all restaurants/eating areas and present at the entry to all
buffet lines, with signs throughout alerting passengers to use them
and to report any illnesses immediately upon onset.
Now, for the anecdotal observations: it appeared as though the
majority of men completely ignored the hand sanitizers, walking right
by them. Approximately 50 percent of the women used them, and very
few of the children used them unless their parents urged them to do
so. The ship had approximately 2600 passengers and an additional 1000
plus staff. One wonders how we managed to escape having a significant
outbreak on board other than just good luck. Any time one gets a
large group of individuals in an enclosed area, the introduction of
person-to-person easily transmitted infectious agents creates an
ideal situation for large outbreaks, especially when one is somewhat
dependent upon human behavior to help mitigate such occurrences. - Mod.MPP]
