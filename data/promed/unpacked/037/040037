The governor of Zabaykalski krai [Trans-Baikal territory], Konstantin Ilkovsky, submitted a letter to the Head of Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance], Sergey Dankvert, which includes a report on the measures undertaken by the Trans-Baikal Territory Government to address the epizootic situation in the province following the penetration of foot-and-mouth disease from neighbouring China and Mongolia, territories suffering deficiencies of their respective animal disease control systems. The efforts to fully eliminate pockets of the infection in Trans-Baikal do not always bring the expected positive results.

The activities required the active involvement of Rosselkhoznadzor Federal Centre for Animal Health (State Organization "ARRIAH") under the direction of Vasily Alexandrovich Grubyy. Staff members from ARRIAH Center have repeatedly traveled to the Trans-Baikal territory to offer technical assistance, have visited foci of disease and produced recommendations for actions which have been undertaken by the State Veterinary Service of the Trans-Baikal territory. Mass preventive vaccinations have been carried out using the universal monovalent type A vaccine, in the Priargunsky and Kalgan areas.

In addition, for the Amur oblast [region], a batch of 310 000 doses of an FMD vaccine specifically designed against FMD virus strain A2155/Zabaykalskiy/2013 are being applied, particularly in the border areas of the territory.

[Since the beginning of 2013, 2 separate FMD serotype A epizootics are evolving in Russia, caused by 2 different lineages of the virus; one in the south-west, namely in the Republics of Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, and Krasnodar krai, where the circulating strain has been recognised as FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, lineage Iran-05 (SIS-10). The other epizootic is located in the far east, namely in the Trans-Baikal krai and the Amur oblast, where the circulating virus strain is FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, lineage Sea-97, originating in China. A common summary of both epizootics, with a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014277_20131022_155158.pdf.

From the Rosselkhoznadzor information above, it may be assumed that the serotype A vaccine strains included in the regular vaccines in Russia have conferred only partial protection of vaccinated cattle against the ("Chinese") virus strain currently circulating in Amur oblast (bordering China) and Zabaykalski krai (bordering Mongolia and China). This seems to have led ARRIAH to launch the development and production of a batch of a homologous (emergency) vaccine based on a recent isolate from Zabaykalski krai. This batch is currently being applied in strategic areas along the border with China. Data on the protection level conferred by this vaccine against the (Chinese) strain will be helpful. It will also be interesting to note which vaccine is currently being applied in China against the circulating serotype A virus.

Sequence data of 7 serotype A isolates, 4 from the Amur and 3 from the Zabaykalski regions, isolated by ARRIAH during 2013, have been submitted to the world reference laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD Pirbright, UK) for comparative genotyping. All were identified as topotype ASIA, lineage Sea-97. The reference strain found closest to them (up to 93 percent identical) was A/TAI/7/2003 (HQ116312).
