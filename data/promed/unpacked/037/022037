Outbreak of _Salmonella manhattan_ infection in Denmark with international
implications
_Salmonella manhattan_ is a rare _Salmonella_ serotype in Denmark, usually
isolated between 0 and 3 times each year. From the first week of 1998 the
incidence increased, with cases occurring throughout Denmark, predominantly
in adults.
Molecular epidemiology:
By January 23, 15 human isolates of _S. manhattan_ from the outbreak had
been DNA-typed using pulse field gel electrophoresis. Twelve of these
strains were of the 'outbreak type' and three were closely related. Three
human _S. manhattan_ isolates from the summer of 1997 were clearly
different from the outbreak type, which suggested that the current outbreak
had a common source. Six isolates of _S. manhattan_ obtained from an
international pig production company were indistinguishable from the
outbreak type, but 13 _S. manhattan_ strains from Danish broilers, pork,
and imported poultry were clearly different from the outbreak type. The
veterinary isolates were from the top of the breeding pyramid, which is
part of the international trade with pigs intended to improve of their
genetic material. These results suggested that the outbreak could be linked
to pork products.
European perspective:
In the Enter-net database of _Salmonella_ isolates from 13 participating
countries _S. manhattan_ has been a rare serotype. In 1993 and 1994, 98 and
97 isolates were reported, respectively, but only 64 in 1995. In 1996,
there were 105 reports (64% higher than in the previous year) and in 1997,
126 cases (a further 20% rise). Although the numbers were small, _S.
manhattan_ has been reported at greater than expected levels for particular
quarters and countries in 1996 and 1997. The 38 cases in the first seven
weeks of 1998 in Denmark represent a substantial further increase in the
incidence of _S. manhattan_ in Europe. On 22 January, an enquiry about the
recent incidence of human isolates of _S. manhattan_ was sent to all
Enter-net participants. At that time no other countries had noted a marked
change in recent weeks.
Case control study:
A case control study was conducted in Denmark from 6 to 10 February 1998.
Ten out of 16 cases had eaten salted and smoked ready-to-eat fillet of pork
in the three days before becoming ill, compared with 4 out of 45 matched
controls (odds ratio 17, p less than 0.0001). The fillet was traced back to
a particular slicing plant that receives smoked fillet from Denmark as well
as elsewhere in Europe.
Action taken:
The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration was informed about the
results of the investigations. The product was withdrawn from shops and its
production ceased on February 17. An investigation to find the origin of
the contaminated smoked pork fillet is in progress. Food authorities in
European countries have been informed about the outbreak and the results of
the investigations conducted so far.
Comment:
To ascertain the full extent of this outbreak, histories of the foods eaten
by recent _S. manhattan_ cases in other European countries before they
became ill should be reviewed to see whether they may have eaten processed
smoked pork products.
