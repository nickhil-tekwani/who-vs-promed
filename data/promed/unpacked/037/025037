The full texts of the Bruce et al and Collinge et al papers in Nature of 2
October, have already been posted early on the Nature Web site at
<http://www.nature.com/> whence they may be downloaded and printed
[Specific web addresses for individual articles given below. BTW, thanks
much to Hans Andersson for sending us press releases on this subject but as
Ralph mentions, I think it is critical to read the papers on this one. -
Mod. pc].
Bruce's conclusion is
"In conclusion, strain typing based on transmission to mice has shown: that
vCJD is caused by the same strain of agent that has caused BSE, FSE and
TSEs in exotic ruminants: that vCJD is distinguishable from spCJD: and that
CJD in two dairy farmers is of the spCJD type and is not linked to the
causative agent of BSE. Epidemiological surveillance continues to indicate
that vCJD is a new condition occurring almost exclusively in the UK. Our
transmission studies, in combination with the surveillance data, provide
compelling evidence of a link between BSE and vCJD."
Collinge's conclusion is
"The prion titres in these primary inocula are unknown but may be higher in
the human cases, because cattle with BSE will have been culled before the
terminal stages of disease. However, on clinical, pathological and
molecular criteria, vCJD shows remarkable similarity in its transmission
characteristics to BSE, and is quite distinct from all other forms of
sporadic and acquired CJD. These data provide compelling evidence that BSE
and vCJD are caused by the same prion strain. Taken together with the
temporal and spatial association of vCJD with BSE but not with scrapie or
other animal prion diseases, and BSE transmission studies in macaques, this
strongly suggests that vCJD is caused by BSE exposure. The theoretical
possibility that both BSE and vCJD arise from exposure to a common
unidentified source appears remote. "
SEAC's comment was
"This new research provides convincing evidence that the agent which causes
BSE is the same as that which causes new variant CJD. SEAC's advice to the
Government has always been based on this assumption. The most likely
explanation of the new variant cases to date remains exposure to BSE before
the introduction of the specified bovine offal ban in 1989."
May I suggest that if there is to be a worthwhile discussion of the science
involved and of the scientific implications of the findings, those of us
who participate should first study these two Nature papers and the
experimental results which led to these conclusions.
Neither of these papers (nor, for that matter, the Collinge et al paper of
October 1996), actually _proves_ that BSE causes nvCJD. But as the
successive updates of the IFST Position Statement (and I) have been
pointing out for several months in anticipation of the possible second
(Bruce's)finding of a BSE "fingerprint" for nvCJD by a different
methodology, this would strongly reinforce Collinge's October 1996 finding
[Nature, 383, 685-690, 24 October 1996, 685-690. ]. We now have three
distinct findings to that effect as well as the in vitro findings of
Raymond et al [Nature 388, 285, 17 July 1997]. Both Bruce et al and
Collinge et al point out that their respective findings do not stand alone
but need to be evaluated in conjunction with other circumstantial evidence
. Having regard to that, I think that we are as close to proof of a causal
connection as science is ever likely to get (short of
ethically-impermissible inoculation of human subjects with BSE
infectivity).
[As Ralph points out, I have read the papers and the evidence seems clear
that these two agents are indistinguishable in these mice studies.
Important questions remain concerning the incubation time for this agent in
humans. Fortunately, the number of nvCJD cases in humans has remained
steady and low (n=21) but the number of cases is subject to as yet unknown
incubation period. Vexingly, we can not be assured that the human epidemic
curve will remain static. Only time will tell if an epidemic curve spike
will result in larger numbers of human cases. Next, the mode of
transmission must be further clarified particularly in regard to the case
of the vegetarian. Of interest to those studying the emergence of new
diseases, are the circumstances surrounding this bovine/human epidemic. If
the genesis of this disease - which we now conclude has jumped to humans -
was a change in the operational technology of the animal rendering
industry, how could have we predicted the emergence of this agent or
prevented it? - Mod. pc]
