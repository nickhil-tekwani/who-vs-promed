Spanish flu of 1918 contained special, deadly mechanism
The Spanish flu virus that killed millions in 1918 had a special trait that
sharply increased its deadliness, according to a study due out Tuesday in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. A typical flu
virus has two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).
To contaminate human cells, the HA molecule must first divide in two, which
it does using a protease present in the trachea and lungs. But the HA
present in the 1918 virus used a special enzyme, plasmin, to divide,
according to Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Hideo Goto, scientists at the University
of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine in Madison. The plasmin was held
in the virus in the form of plasminogen by two special substances on the NA
molecule. Scientists had never before seen a virus with proteins able to
trap plasminogen.
The special trait "should be considered when evaluating the health hazard
posed by human influenza viruses," said the study's authors, adding that
any virus possessing it "should be regarded as potentially dangerous."
Norway last week authorized researchers to exhume and study the bodies of
seven young Norwegians who died of the 1918 pandemic. The U.S. National
Institutes of Health is funding the research.
