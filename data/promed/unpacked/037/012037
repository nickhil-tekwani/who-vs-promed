Ethnic Mongolian herders in China's northern region of Inner Mongolia have accused local officials of injecting more than 2000 head of livestock with an overdose of anthrax vaccine, causing hundreds of animal deaths from the disease and an unknown number of anthrax cases in local people.

Herding communities in Bayanhangai Som in Urad Middle Banner (county) say the authorities began injecting sheep, cattle, and horses with an overdose of anthrax vaccine on [23 Oct 2015] after claiming to identify symptoms of the highly infectious disease in horses.

Local people said the horses had been poisoned by eating wild onions, but that officials refused to listen, injecting at least 2448 head of sheep, cattle, and horses. Hundreds of animals have since died, and an unknown number of people have been infected, they told RFA.

"Several hundred people have caught this disease," one local herder told RFA. "It's not too bad if it's caught early, but if it's caught too late, it can be fatal. They can't eradicate it ... and a lot of sheep have died after receiving these vaccinations," said the man, who asked to remain anonymous. "But the herders don't dare come out and talk about this." He said he had been unable to transmit photos of the anthrax vaccination station by message to RFA on [Tue 3 Nov 2015]. "I couldn't get it to send," he said.

A 2nd local resident said the local authorities appeared keen to cover up the extent of the problem. "There were so many people who got this disease, and it was only then that they started to say it was the vaccine," a local herder whose son became infected with anthrax told RFA.

"It started to get serious, although it was never made public, and it got out of control," he said, adding that his son was infected through a cut while sheep-shearing back in May [2015]. He said the authorities had initially offered medical treatment to those infected free of charge. "Then, when we went to the doctor, they wanted money from us," he said. "He had aches all over his body of all kinds, in every joint, and he couldn't walk," the man said. "He is only 30 years old. This is a disease that is very serious if people catch it from sheep."

News of the anthrax infections began to surface after a local herdswoman sent out a tweet calling on journalists to report the story, amid ongoing attempts from local officials to impose an information blackout. She later told the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC) that the authorities' claim that an anthrax epidemic had affected local herds was wrong.

"The deputy director of the Urad Middle Banner bureau of animal husbandry came to our community and ordered ... an overdose of anthrax vaccine to be injected [into our] livestock immediately upon seeing a couple of horses that had minor food poisoning with wild onion," SMHRIC quoted the woman as saying in a statement on its website.

[The woman] was detained by local police on [3 Nov 2015] on suspicion of "spreading rumors and carrying infected animal blood," it said. "They confiscated my cell phone, and asked me how many pictures, video clips, and other pieces of relevant information I have transmitted over the Internet about this incident," she told SMHRIC. "They accused me of having violated certain safety policies by carrying infected animal blood samples." She said that local authorities "hate" the herders, and had likely infected their livestock deliberately amid ongoing tensions over land in the region between traditional herding communities, government officials, and Chinese mining and forestry companies.

Repeated calls to the Urad Middle Banner center for disease control and prevention rang unanswered during office hours on [Tue 3 Nov 2015].

An official who answered the phone at the Urad Middle Banner general government office denied the herders' account. "Not likely," the official said. "Since when do we have vaccination programs in winter? That's a lie. The time for vaccination is springtime."

Outbreak confirmed
------------------
An official who answered the phone at the Urad Middle Banner bureau of agriculture and animal husbandry confirmed the "outbreak" but not the reported cause. "No, that didn't happen," the official said. "How would they die from a vaccination? They probably died of something else ... [or] they probably already had it." He said the anthrax had come from the north western region of Xinjiang. "When it got serious, they dug a pit and buried them, so the blood didn't escape." He said cross-species infection from infected livestock to humans is entirely possible. "Yes, it can [infect humans]," the official said. "You can get infected if you don't wear gloves."

A herder from Bayanhangai Som, or village, said the death rate appeared to be slowing among livestock on [Tue 3 Nov 2015]. "I haven't discovered any more today," the herder said, adding, "[I lost] 200-300 head of sheep."

Disputes over land
-----------------
Herders blame the ongoing exploitation of natural resources by Chinese companies for the spread of grasslands-related protests in the region, as local governments sell off land to investors, often in the mining or forestry sectors, and sometimes in the face of existing "responsibility contracts" held by herding communities for the land.

SMHRIC estimates that at least 160 000 ethnic Mongolians have been forcibly evicted from traditional grazing lands in recent decades, while local activists also blame Chinese companies for damaging the fragile ecosystem in the region, leading local authorities to impose grazing bans to prevent further desertification.

In China, all land is ultimately owned by the state, so herders have little redress when it comes to safeguarding their own grazing rights, they say.

Local authorities in Southern Mongolia have injected animals with an overdose of anthrax vaccine, consequently killing over 100 sheep, cattle, and horses. Herders, whose livelihoods are dependent on livestock, have been adversely affected by the actions described as acts of hatred by one Mongolian herder.

A [4 Nov 2015] article published by Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC) can be accessed at http://www.smhric.org/news_584.htm.

Since [23 Oct 2015], at least 2448 heads of livestock have been injected with an overdose of anthrax vaccine by the local authorities in Bayanhangai Som, Urad Middle Banner of Southern (Inner) Mongolia, in fear of a possible anthrax epidemic. According to local Mongolian herders, over 100 sheep, cattle, and horses have died because of the overdose vaccine and many have been sickened.

Information about the incident is tightly concealed by the Chinese authorities. At least one Mongolian herder was arrested and detained for protesting the authorities' intentional killing of their livestock.

"It is very common that livestock occasionally got poisoned with excessive amount of certain plants such as wild onion (_Allium mongolicum_)," [a woman, a] herder from Urad Middle Banner, told the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC), "but this has nothing to do with anthrax epidemic. The deputy director of the Urad Middle Banner Bureau of Animal Husbandry came to our community and ordered to inject overdose of anthrax vaccine to our livestock immediately upon seeing a couple of horses that had minor food poisoning with wild onion," said [the herder] in a phone interview with the SMHRIC.

[... ...]

As China speeds up its process of opening up rural areas and resettling pastoralists in Southern Mongolia, Mongolian herders from Urad Middle Banner have tirelessly been protesting the Chinese authorities' illegal appropriation of their grazing lands and violation of their legal rights. 2 weeks ago, at least 9 Mongolian herders were arrested and detained for staging protests during the regional party secretary Wang Jun's visit to Urad Middle Banner.

Obviously you really need to have a good postmortem exam with histopathology (once you confirm it isn't anthrax disease through a blood sample) to know what exactly is going on, and that doesn't sound like it is happening or being allowed to happen.

I will also say that there are rare occasions where adverse reactions from vaccination can cause death, even with a normal dosage. The most susceptible species to these reactions, in my experience, has been goats and miniature horses. I have also seen it in younger horses and rarely in sheep. I have not seen it in cattle, but who knows what would happen with a big overdose?

What is seen on gross necropsy is progressive edema (what Max Sterne called "edema disease") and acute renal tubular necrosis, or both. These types of reactions usually do not begin to cause clinical signs until 4-7 days after they have been vaccinated. The Sterne strain will not cause anthrax disease, as you know. An overdose may increase the likelihood of edema disease and/or renal failure but this is most likely due to the saponin (assuming they are vaccinating with Sterne strain with saponin).

The vaccine used obviously needs to be evaluated as well. Is the vaccine used a licensed and tested vaccine?

There are a lot of variables to look at here. Is it possible that the animals contracted anthrax right before or after vaccination? What were the ambient temperatures during this time? Are they in a drought? Were these animals grazing or were they being fed hay? Did they have uncoagulated blood coming from their orifices after death?

I was also made aware by someone today of a controversial disease outbreak this summer [2015] in wild antelope in Mongolia that they are blaming on _Pasteurella_ sp. and _Clostridium_ sp. and global warming. This story just came out in some publication or news outlet. Apparently thousands of antelope have died. Of course, both of these genus of bacteria can be secondary opportunistic infections. I wonder if there is any relation to this anthrax/vaccination story? Some strange goings on in Mongolia!

Inner Mongolia province of China lies along the southern border of Mongolia; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/china_pol01.jpg. For Urad Middle Banner, see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/20/Hailutu.html.

Clearly there is a confusion of events, not made any easier by an apparent refusal to have blood samples checked for the cause of death. Sterne vaccine does cause problems in goats and small horses, and for this reason is given at half the normal dose.

The 2nd half of October is a very unusual time to vaccinate for anthrax; the normal time is in the spring. And at this time Inner Mongolia would be deep into the colder autumn weather/early winter. If the authorities are "vaccinating" the deaths may be due to "edema disease" from the reaction to the saponin adjuvant. A puzzle needing scientific clarification. Very grateful for Randy Berrier's informed and experienced comments.

And all against a background of an enzootic ongoing problem of normal anthrax outbreaks in the province, and experience which adds to the confusion, reference to the son infected while shearing sheep in May [2015] in item [1] above. Bovine & ovine anthrax outbreaks were reported in this province in 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2011. - Mod.MHJ]
