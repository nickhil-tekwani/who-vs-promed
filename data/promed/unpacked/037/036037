Malaysia: 54 Deaths Due To Dengue Fever; WHO Declares Alert
--------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever has claimed 54 lives this year, with 10 753 confirmed cases
reported nationwide, a senior health official said on Mon 30 Dec 2002.
"Malaysia is currently experiencing an increase in the number of cases
compared to last year, but it has not reached the epidemic stage," S.
Sothinathan, the Health Ministry parliament secretary, told Agence France
Presse (AFP). Last year, Malaysia posted 50 deaths and reported 8669 dengue
cases. Sothinathan attributed the rise in deaths to the current situation,
in which Malaysia is facing intermittent rainfalls and hot weather, both of
which encourage mosquito breeding.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) had issued an alert about 5 months ago,
warning all countries in the tropical region including Malaysia to be
prepared for an increase in the number of dengue cases in view of present
weather conditions, [Sothinathan] said. Lim Kit Siang, chairman of the
Chinese-dominated Democratic Action Party, had urged the government to
declare a nationwide alert. Lim urged the government to launch a media
campaign immediately to boost national awareness and curb the loss of any
more lives. Children have suffered more fatalities than in previous years.
Malaysia, a tropical country, experiences frequent rainfall, ideal for the
_Aedes_ mosquito (which carries the dengue disease) to breed. Sothinathan
said that firm action would be taken against offenders who fail to clean
their surroundings, especially construction sites, which are favourite
breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In September 2002, Malaysia placed its
capital city, Kuala Lumpur, and 4 states on dengue alert following an
alarming surge in cases.

Malaysia: Most Dengue Cases in Kelantan Reported from Kota Baharu District
--------------------------------------------------
The Kelantan government today set up a special committee to curb the spread
of dengue fever in the state. Public Administration, Local Government, and
Regional Development committee chairman Takiyuddin Hassan said its members
include state, federal, and non-governmental agencies. The committee would
draw up action plans that included Saturday gotong-royong activities to
clean up areas infested with _Aedes_ mosquitoes, Takiyuddin said after
chairing the committee's first meeting here today.
Meanwhile, Kota Baharu District health officer Dr Hamzah Awang Mat said the
area recorded the highest number of dengue fever cases -- almost 70 percent
of the cases in Kelantan came from Kota Baharu District. "The increase in
dengue cases was due the public's failure to ensure cleanliness," Dr Hamzah
said. Kota Baharu District alone recorded 1139 cases compared to 1657 cases
throughout Kelantan thus far, he said. Indiscriminate throwing of rubbish
and dirty home surroundings contributed to the breeding of _Aedes_
mosquito, especially in the monsoon months. Dr Hamzah warned that the local
authorities would take firm action against those who failed to maintain
cleanliness.

Sarawak: 4 Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever Deaths Reported
--------------------------------------------------
In 2002, 4 people have died of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Sarawak,
State director of Health Dr Yao Sik Chi said today. The 4 were a 3-year-old
girl from Tabuan Jaya in Kuching, a 36-year-old man from Pujut in Miri, a
54-year-old woman from Sungai Pantu in Sarikei, and a 37-year-old woman
from Kampung Engkelumi in Serian.
Dr Yao said 31 cases of DHF were reported in the State up to 30 Dec 2002.
"As of 30 Dec 2002, Sarawak registered 948 dengue fever cases," he said,
adding that 431 dengue fever and 24 DHF cases were reported in the State
[during 2001]. He said the increases in dengue fever and DHF cases this
year were due to a major dengue outbreak in Sibu between June and August,
when 50 cases were reported.
Dr Yao said the Health Department had intensified the control and
preventive measures against the spread of dengue fever and DHF. The
measures included fogging and intensive search-and-destroy operations on
_Aedes_ breeding grounds. The department also intensified its community
awareness campaign and secured the involvement of community leaders to
prevent dengue fever and DHF outbreaks.

Johor: Dengue Cases Rise by 68 Percent
---------------------------------------
The number of dengue cases in Johor rose 68 percent to 3952 cases last year
with 20 deaths. State Exco for Family Development, Women Affairs and Health
Datin Halimah Sadique said of the total cases, 253 were haemorrhagic dengue
fever.
In the previous year, there were 137 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever out
of the total of 2346 dengue cases in the state with 12 deaths, she said.
"The latest cases were mostly reported in urban areas, namely within the
Johor Baharu City Council (MBJB), Johor Baharu Tengah Municipal Council
(MPJBT), Kluang Municipal Council and Pasir Gudang," she told reporters
after the State Exco meeting, here today. She said the Johor Baharu
district recorded 2212 cases compared with 1463 cases last year, followed
by Kota Tinggi district with 534 cases and Kluang with 396 cases.
Elsewhere, Batu Pahat had 145 cases, Pontian 71 cases, and Mersing 26
cases, she said.
"In the rural areas, dengue cases mainly occurred in Felda schemes in the
Kota Tinggi district due to the attitude of the settlers, who did not pay
much attention to the breeding grounds of the _Aedes_ mosquito near their
homes," she said.
According to Halimah, the dengue-sensitive areas in the Johor Baharu
district included the Bandar Baru Uda, Taman Kenanga, Kampung Bakar Batu,
Taman Perling, Taman Universiti, Taman Ungku Tun Aminah, Taman Mawar flats,
Kampung Desa Rahmat, Taman Cempaka, Taman Melor, Kampung Sri Jaya, Kampung
Serdang, Kampung Telok Serdang, Taman Johor Jaya, Kampung Pasir, Taman
Kobena, Taman Sri Pulai and Taman Kota Masai. On the measures taken to
check the problem, she said the State Health Department had conducted
house-to-house inspections with 341 955 homes checked throughout the state.

Bolivia: A Case of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Confirmed in Santa Cruz
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Roman Callata, responsible for the Malaria Department of the Departmental
Health Service (Sedes), confirmed the death from dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) at the end of December 2002 of a child in Plan Tres Mil. The test was
done in the Centro de Enfermedades Tropicales (Cenetrop).
5 suspected cases of classic dengue fever have been reported from
Cochabamba: 2 in the city and 3 in the zone of Chapare. Callata pointed out
that not all cases of dengue virus type 3 infection result in DHF. He said
that in December 2002, Santa Cruz registered 12 cases: 3 in the city, 3 in
San Ignacio de Velasco, one in Portachuelo and one in Caranda [the math
doesn't work out - CE.PG]. In 2002, there were 182 cases of dengue virus
types 1 and 2.
[It is not clear from this report whether this fatal case was due to dengue
virus type 3 and marks the beginning of a new threat to that region of
Bolivia in the lowlands east of the Andes. - Mod.JW]
