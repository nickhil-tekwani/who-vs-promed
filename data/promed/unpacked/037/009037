Rabies, a fatal disease that affects animals and humans, which is caused by a neurotropic virus, was recently detected in the remains of wild Formosan ferret-badgers, a veterinary research team confirmed yesterday [16 Jul 2013].

This means rabies has reappeared in Taiwan for the 1st time in 50 years, said Victor Fei Pang, a professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine of National Taiwan University during a meeting convened by the Council of Agriculture.

The meeting was held after Shih Wen-yi, former deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), said in a Facebook post on Monday [15 Jul 2013] that the COA might have been concealing information from the public about the return of rabies for more than a year.

Rabies is a zoonotic disease, which means it is transmittable from animals to humans, Shih told reporters on Tuesday [16 Jul 2013]. Rabies has the highest case fatality rate of any conventional infectious disease, approaching 100 percent, he said.

The COA convened the meeting of experts one year after the disease reappeared in Taiwan and has not yet informed the CDC of the matter, Shih said, adding that 3 of the samples taken from 6 Formosan ferret-badgers at the NTU's School of Veterinary Medicine have tested positive for rabies.

Meanwhile, the 3 cases of rabies were confirmed during the meeting, 2 in dead Formosan ferret-badgers in Gukeng, Yunlin County, in November 2012 and one in Yuchi, Nantou County, in December 2012. Another Formosan ferret-badger that was sent by an amusement center in Nantou to NTU's School of Veterinary Medicine in May 2012 also tested positive for rabies, according to Pang.

Also on Tuesday [16 Jul 2013], Susan Chang, director general of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that the bureau has prepared 12 000 doses of anti-rabies vaccine to be given free of cost to domestic animals in the mountainous areas of Yunlin and Nantou.

Chang said the bureau has stockpiled 100 000 doses of the vaccine and plans to import 80 000 more in late August 2013, while veterinary medicine manufacturers have stockpiled 230 000 doses and plan to import 200 000 more.

The bureau said it will report the cases to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE]. Currently, Japan is the only rabies-free country in Asia, it added.

Meanwhile, only 10 countries and regions around the world are free from rabies: United Kingdom, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Guam.

[Details of the laboratory tests and their results, allegedly leading to confirmation of rabies in Taiwan, are anticipated. If ferret-badgers have been indeed confirmed rabid, there should be a source of infection to be clarified and the involvement of other susceptible animal species to be excluded.

According to a 2009 paper (Ref. 1), ferret badger-associated human rabies cases emerged in China in 1994. The authors used a retrospective epidemiologic survey, virus isolation, laboratory diagnosis, and nucleotide sequencing to document its reemergence in 2002-2008. They argued that whether the cause was spillover from infected dogs or recent host shift and new reservoir establishment required further investigation.

The genome of ferret badger rabies virus isolated in Jiangxi Province, China in 2009 has been recently completely sequenced. The genomic length is 11 923 nucleotides (nt) with an overall organization similar to that of other rabies virus isolates. The virus [JX09-17(fb)] was claimed to be closely related to Chinese epidemic canine isolates in clade I. The complete genomic sequence of that virus has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number KC762941. (Ref 2). It will be of importance to check the genetic relationship between the Taiwanese virus and the mentioned Jiangxi 2009 isolate.

It lives in grassland, open forest, and tropical rainforest from northeastern India to southern China, Taiwan, and northern Indochina.

[Ferret badgers are species of the mustelid family, included in the _Melogale_ genus. The Formosan Ferret Badger (_Melogale moschata subaurantiaca_) is a subspecies of the Chinese ferret badger (_M. moschata_) that only occurs in Taiwan. It is reported to be an agile climber and often sleeps curled up on tree branches. Ferret badgers are omnivorous, and live in burrows or crevices and are active at dusk and at night.
