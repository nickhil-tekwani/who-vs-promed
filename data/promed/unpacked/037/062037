A steep decline in Puget Sound-area herring, a critical food source for
larger fish, marine mammals and sea birds, has scientists mystified. Not
only are adult herring dying earlier than normal, but some fear a stock
that used to be one of the largest in Washington state's inland marine
waters could go extinct.
The 30-year decline in the small, silvery fish has far-reaching
implications, said Jim West, a state Fish and Wildlife Department research
scientist who found high concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and
other toxic substances in herring in south Puget Sound. "Virtually any
predator worth its salt in Puget Sound is going to be eating herring," West
said.
Herring are a dietary stable for chinook salmon, cod and halibut, and also
are eaten by porpoises, seals, sea lions and orcas. Freshly spawned herring
eggs once drew swarms of marine birds, especially diving ducks called surf
scoters, that fly north to nest in the Canadian interior. "It's thought to
be important for them to feed on herring spawn while they're here, because
there's not a lot of food up there for them," said Joseph Evenson, a state
Fish and Wildlife Department biologist.
"They're basically working off their fat reserves." The herring decline may
explain the disappearance of thousands of scoters from parts of the inland
waters, said Evenson and his boss, Dave Nysewander, the state's marine bird
and mammal project leader.
One of the most severe herring declines is between Bellingham and the
Canadian border, an area which once accounted for about 1/3 of the state's
total stocks.
The Cherry Point stocks plummeted from 10 000 tons in 1994 to 808 tons in
2000, then rebounded to 1611 tons in 2003, but remain in danger of going
extinct, said Duane Fagergren, a fish biologist with the state's Puget
Sound Action Team.
In January 2004, the Center for Biological Diversity and other activists
sought protection for Cherry Point herring under the Endangered Species
Act. A decision from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is
expected in mid-May 2005.
Much of the mystery to scientists is in the high percentage of herring that
die before reaching the age of peak fertility. Herring in the inland waters
typically used to live as long as 5 to 8 years, but now "it's rare to see
one over 4," said Paul Hershberger, a U.S. Geological Survey fish
pathologist who has been studying disease in herring since the mid-1990s.
In the 1970s, about 20 percent of the Sound's herring population died of
natural causes annually, but now it's 67 percent to 84 percent, Hershberger
said.
Environmental activists blame pollution and other habitat degradation, but
state marine fish manager Greg Bargmann says disease, lack of food and
predators also may be involved.
Hershberger cited the presence of a ichthyophonus -- a parasite that wasn't
noticed in the inland waters 30 years ago but is now common and infects the
heart and other organs -- and a virus that causes viral hemorrhagic
septicemia, which infects mostly young herring.

[Anytime a population has a natural attrition rate of 20 percent, and,
approximately 30 years later, the attrition rate is almost 3 times that
rate, there is a serious problem. Herring are a major food source for many
organisms. As such, they are essentially at the bottom of the feeding
chain, and, as this food source is seriously depleted, there will be a
ripple effect.
There are both Atlantic herring (_Clupea harengus_) and Pacific herring
(_Clupea pallasii_). They are similar, in that they are members of the same
family, and a wide variety of fish and animals feed on them. Their silvery
bodies "flash" in the sun when they turn quickly. The habit is called
"flashing." - Mod.TG]
