A quarantine was declared in the village of Toguz-Bulak, Kara-Suu district of Osh region over anthrax, rural municipality governor Kurbanbek Miyashev said. The village is locked down from 4-18 Aug 2020, he said.

Turmush reported suspected anthrax cases in the village. Eight people were taken to the hospital. The villagers slaughtered a cow infected with anthrax and divided meat between 288 people. Testing of the soil where the cow was slaughtered gave a positive result for anthrax. The population of Toguz-Bulak village is 406 people.

The Ministry of Health said that 8 people were taken to the Osh Interregional United Hospital with suspected cutaneous anthrax. The test results of one patient were positive for anthrax. The condition of the patients is satisfactory.

[Osh is at the head of the Fergana valley that it shares with Uzbekistan. To see the location of Osh Region, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osh.

The villagers were lucky that there were only 8 cases among the 285 people sharing this meat. It was wise to put them all under observation and antibiotics. On the Uzbek side of the border, the disease is poorly controlled and spills over into the nearby Kyrgyrz farms. There is a long history of livestock anthrax in Osh and nearby Jalal-Abad. Without a coordinated vaccination-control program between the 2 countries in this region, we will continue to see outbreaks there. - Mod.MHJ
