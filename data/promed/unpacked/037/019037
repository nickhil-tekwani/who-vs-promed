[3] Nigeria: case increase

Nigeria [NCDC] has so far recorded 1180 suspected cases of monkeypox.

The country also recorded 482 cases and 7 deaths resulting from monkeypox in 2022.

These were made known in Abuja by the Director-General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, Dr Ifedayo Adetifa at a bi-weekly ministerial media conference anchored by the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire.

Mr Adetifa said the NCDC had developed a treatment regime which could entail the option of having antiviral treatment for those at the highest risk of having severe complications, hospitalisation, and death. "People with immunosuppression fall in that category. People who have a dual infection with chickenpox or monkeypox at the same time fall into that category.

"We want to be able to reduce the sufferings in patients and the death rate while working on an integrated, one health approach to bring monkeypox under control,'' he said.

[4] India (Jammu & Kashmir): 2 suspected cases
Date: Mon 10 Oct 2022
Source: Kashmir Age, Gujarati News Service (GNS) report [edited]
https://kashmirage.net/2022/10/10/2-suspected-monkeypox-cases-detected-in-kashmir/


Officials said on Monday [10 Oct 2022], 2 suspected cases of monkeypox have been detected in the Uri area of north Kashmir's Baramulla district [Jammu & Kashmir]

They said both suspected patients are from Dazna Lachipora area of Uri and as a precautionary measure, they have been isolated. The duo has developed a fever and lesions resembling monkeypox or chickenpox on their skin, they said. "Their samples have been sent to the SKIMS [Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences] microbiology department," Block Medical Officer Boniyar Dr Pervaiz Masoodi, confirmed to GNS.

He said the duo has a "maculopapular rash" over the body, mostly on the face and abdomen.

"So far we cannot say whether these suspected people have monkeypox or chickenpox but at the same time cannot rule out either," he said. "We have taken the samples and in the coming days and the reports are expected soon to find out what kind of disease is this," he said.

Dr Masoodi said that an awareness drive had been launched to raise awareness among the people regarding the disease. "Awareness among the population was immediately imparted by the medical team. School teachers, PRIs, and locals Imams were sensitized and made fully aware of the disease," he said.

He said on getting information on 6 Oct 2022 regarding the suspected case of chickenpox or monkeypox in the area, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Baramulla and the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) team district Baramulla were informed.

Immediately, he said, the IDSP [Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme] Team of Medical Block Boniyar visited Dazna Lachipora and examined all villagers and isolated infected people.

On 8 Oct 2022, he said, the state epidemiology team along with (IDSP) team Baramulla visited the spot and took samples of infected people. Actually, sources said, samples of 8 people have been taken but due to the severity of symptoms, samples of 2 persons have been sent to the SKIMS microbiology department for testing to confirm or rule out the possibility of monkeypox.

Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease with symptoms similar to smallpox, although with less clinical severity. With cases being reported from a large number of countries, the World Health Organisation has termed the outbreak a global health emergency.
