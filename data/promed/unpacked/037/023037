An unknown disease has claimed the lives of 2 children in one week at
Barakpur union under Digholia upazila in Khulna district while 44
children are now under treatment at Upazila Health Complex.

and are the lowest level of administrative government. - Mod.TY]

The 2 deceased were identified as 6-year-old boy, and an 8-year-old
girl of Nikaripara village under the same upazila. The boy died on
the night of 29 Jun [2008] and the girl died on the evening of 02 Jul
[2008] while undergoing treatment at Khulna Medical College Hospital.

Digholia Upazila Health Officer Ataur Rahman said the disease is
suspected as 'viral encephalitis' and it has created panic among the
people of the upazila. A 6-member medical team was formed on Sunday
[06 Jul 2008] with Digholia upazila Medical Officer Dr. Jotirmoy Saha
as its head to monitor the situation.

The upazila administration has arranged announcement through
microphones, advising people to consult physicians immediately after
a child is attacked with high fever.

Most of the victims of this disease are children between 4 and 10
years of age, Dr. Jasmin Sultana, a member of the medical team, said.
People in the affected area had been advised not to eat any kind of
meat, especially fowl, she said.

UNO Mohammad Daud Mian said adequate measures have been taken to
prevent spread of this disease and victims are being provided with
proper medicare services.

[The information provided is not sufficient to suggest which
etiological agent is involved with these cases. It is possible that
Japanese encephalitis virus might be involved, but any diagnosis will
require laboratory confirmation. It is not indicated if specimens
have been sent for laboratory testing. Absent a specific diagnosis,
it is not clear how effective specific preventive measures have been
decided upon and implemented. Also, it is not clear why the
population of the area has been advised not to eat meat of any kind,
especially fowl. ProMED would appreciate receiving further
information as this outbreak is investigated by health authorities.

[While the above given description of encephalitis in Kulna
Bangladesh is more reminiscent of Japanese encephalitis, with a
relatively low case fatality rate (2 deaths out of 46 cases
mentioned) once cannot omit the possibility of nipahvirus infection.

Since 2001 there have been multiple outbreaks of nipahvirus
encephalitis with mortalities reported in Bangladesh. The 1st
outbreak occurred in Chandpur of Sadar thana, Meherpur District, in
late April to late May 2001. That outbreak involved 28 cases with 9
fatalities. In January 2003 there was a 2nd outbreak with 17 cases
and 8 deaths in Chalksita and Biljoania villages (located 45 km
northeast of Rajshahi) in Naogaon district. In January/February 2004
there were 42 cases and 14 deaths attributible to nipahvirus
infection in Rajbari District, in the southwest of Dhaka Division,
bordering with both Kulna and Barisal Divisions and in Manikganj
district. In April 2004 there were 36 cases and 27 deaths in
Faridpur district. In January 2005 there were approximately 20 cases
and 12 deaths attributable to nipahvirus infection in Tangail
district. In January 2008 there were 18 cases with 8 deaths
attributable to nipahvirus in Manikganj and Rajbari districts. - Mod.MPP]
