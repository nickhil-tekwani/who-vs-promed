A Green Country family was hospitalized after _E. coli_ exposure at a campground.

"I never ever expected 2 weeks at the lake to turn into who knows how long at the hospital," said the mother of the family. But the family's summer lake vacation turned into extended medical care. Two girls, their mother, and grandmother, fell ill with a dangerous _E. coli_ bacterial infection.

The family is still trying to comprehend what happened here at Ft. Gibson Lake. "It was just a bunch of kids and moms and dads playing in the water, feeding geese, fishing, boats, you know the whole thing," said the mother. "We had a good time until the end."

The family was having a blast at Flat Rock Campground. Those last days at the campsite, the family started to get sick. "It's taken a real toll," said the father of the family, "going back and forth to work from here trying to stay here making sure that upstairs she's good to go, seeing her go through everything she's been through, seeing my mother-in-law go through everything she's been through." Their little girls, their mother, and their grandmother all came down with _E. coli_.

The mother thinks their kids may have taken a small sip of the lake water. "My 3-year-old is actually in the PICU right now with some acute kidney failure and a little bit of anemia," said the mother.

The Army Corps of Engineers, when they 1st learned about this incident, sent rangers to the campground site. At this point, they believe it is an isolated incident. The Corps says it does regular testing for _E. coli_ and other bacteria at swim beaches but says none of the shoreline at Flat Rock is a designated swim beach. They recommend people always take steps to limit exposure no matter where you are on the lake. "You should come out; you should wash your hands before eating; don't put your hands in your mouth; try to keep the water out of your mouth in general," said Brannen Parrish of the Corps.

Now, the family is just waiting for their daughter to come home. "I want to make sure that the word's out about the _E. coli_," said the father. "Make sure no child has to go through what I've seen mine go through."

[Although it is not specifically stated, a cluster of illnesses blamed on an _E. coli_ with the development of kidney disease certainly suggests that enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is at work here, either the prototypic serotype O157:H7 or one of the other Shiga toxin-producing strains.

EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food; the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock or wild animals or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.
