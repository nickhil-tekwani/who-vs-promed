The county public health department declared a meningococcal disease outbreak at San Diego State University [SDSU] on [Fri 28 Sep 2018], citing 3 cases among undergraduates since June [2018].

Announcing the decision in Montezuma Hall just before lunch, officials said that all 3 students have been infected by the "B" type of the meningococcal bacteria that can cause deadly meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. So far, none of the infections have been fatal, and officials stressed that declaring an outbreak was done out of an abundance of caution, not panic.

"We truly understand how scary it is for our students and their parents to hear the word 'outbreak' ... It's not a time to be alarmed. It's a time to understand what you can do to protect yourself," said Dr Cynthia Cornelius, medical director of student health services for the university.

The most recent case at SDSU came when a man who lived on campus started experiencing symptoms on [25 Sep 2018]. In early September, the county and the university announced that a female student who lived on campus had been hospitalized after becoming infected. And on [Fri 28 Sep 2018], the county also provided information on a 3rd previously unmentioned student who lived off campus and got sick in June [2018]. Unlike the 2 cases in September [2018], the 3rd student lived off campus. She did not attend classes while she was sick, officials said, because her illness occurred during summer break.

Dr Sayone Thihalolipavan, the county's deputy public health officer, did not say much about the health conditions of the 3 students but did indicated that they are not currently in critical danger. "I will just say that they are OK," Thihalolipavan said.

The county and university are recommending that all undergraduates younger than 24 [years old] be vaccinated against type B meningococcal disease. Why only that specific group and not all campus students, faculty, and staff? The physician said that other type B outbreaks on other campuses across the United States have never generated a case older than age 22. "In general, it has been teens and young adults," Thihalolipavan said.

Though people in that age bracket routinely receive a vaccine that immunizes them against 4 different types of meningococcal infection, type B is not in the mix. A specific vaccine that just covers B type bacteria is necessary for immunity. San Diego State officials announced [Fri 28 Sep 2018] that they will hold an additional vaccination event on campus early next week [week of 1 Oct 2018] to offer shots to anyone who has not already been immunized.

Vaccination does not ward off infections that are already present, and a person whose nasal passages have been colonized by the bacteria may not get sick right away. About 10 percent of people carry meningococcal bacteria in their nasal passages but never get sick. But when the bacteria move from a person's respiratory tract to their bloodstream, infection can turn deadly very quickly.

Officials urged the entire campus population to keep their eyes open for symptoms of meningococcal disease including fever, intense headache, lethargy, stiff neck, and a rash that does not blanch under pressure.

The health department routinely traces all known contacts of anyone who comes down with a serious communicable disease. That work, Thihalolipavan said, has already been done for the 3 SDSU cases, and the county has already proactively dosed about 1800 people who could potentially have been exposed with antibiotics. Proactive antibiotics, if delivered quickly enough after exposure, can prevent meningococcal disease infection.

He said the county's investigation has not yet discovered any significant epidemiological link between the 3 [SDSU cases]. "None of the cases are known to each other that we know of. We're not aware of any of the 3 individuals hanging out or sharing anything or eating together," Thihalolipavan said.

The San Diego County public health officials declared an outbreak of meningococcal disease at San Diego State University [SDSU] on [Fri 28 Sep 2018] after a 3rd student in recent months contracted the bacterial disease.

"There's been 3 cases within 3 1/2 months; this meets the CDC's outbreak criteria and now we have to take further action," county public health officer Dr Sayone Thihalolipavan said. "We want the population of students under the age of 24 to get vaccinations so they're protected even though they haven't been exposed yet."

By declaring an "outbreak" the university and county health department receive access to additional resources from the state of California, including vaccines.

None of the students had prior contact with each other, SDSU officials said, though one in 10 people have the bacteria living inside their nasal passages without getting sick. "We know there must be enough of a carriage rate, that's what we call it, that it's around this environment at SDSU currently," Thihalolipavan said.

The university is planning to hold a mass vaccination event on campus with thousands of vaccines for students. Since the disease primarily affects young people, only undergraduate students under the age of 24 are being urged to get the vaccine.

In 2014, this rare form of meningitis killed one SDSU freshman and infected students at multiple colleges throughout the country.

National Foundation For Infectious Diseases estimates one in 10 people who get the meningococcal B [disease] will die, with 2 in 10 suffering serious complications including brain damage, kidney damage, and amputation of limbs. Bacterial meningitis is spread by sharing items such as cigarettes or drinking glasses or through intimate contact such as kissing. Meningococcal group B vaccines are recommended for people older than 10 years old who are considered high risk including those with certain medical conditions or those exposed during an outbreak.

[Household and other close contacts of persons with invasive meningococcal disease have a higher risk for carriage and invasive disease, for which they should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _Neisseria meningitidis_ as soon as possible. Ciprofloxacin has been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal disease began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the US CDC recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (selected US counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Ceftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).

As pointed out by Kathleen Harriman, PhD, MPH, RN (Chief, Vaccine Preventable Diseases Epidemiology Section California Department of Public Health Richmond, California, <kathleen.harriman@cdph.ca.gov>), the CDC recently updated their meningococcal disease outbreak guidance and no longer recommends the use of an absolute outbreak threshold. The new guidance can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf. The relevant portion of the guidance is extracted below:

8.3 Outbreak thresholds
-----------------------
"The purpose of declaring an outbreak is to determine when appropriate public health interventions should be considered. In contrast to previous guidance in which a threshold of 3 cases of the same serogroup with an attack rate of more than 10 cases per 100 000 population during a 3- month period was used to define both organization- and community-based outbreaks, the current guidance does not recommend the use of an absolute threshold. However, the following thresholds can be considered as guidance, with considerable flexibility to account for the unique nature of each meningococcal disease outbreak.

"For organizations, 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within a 3-month period is considered to be an outbreak (Box 4 -- see below). In most situations, 2 cases within an organization constitute an outbreak. However, in some situations, such as an outbreak within a large university (for example one with more than 20 000 undergraduate students) where no identifiable subgroup at risk within the population can be identified, it may be reasonable to declare an outbreak after 3 cases.

"For communities, an outbreak is defined as multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period (Box 4). Several strategies may be considered to determine whether incidence is above expected in a community. For instance, incidence during the current 3-month period can be compared with the incidence during a similar time period in previous years, or in the setting of very low or unstable monthly incidence, annual incidence in the 3-5 years prior. If community incidence has historically been very low or zero, comparisons against state or national incidence can be made. Additional supportive evidence of an outbreak should be solicited, such as similarity of the strains by molecular typing and common epidemiologic or social characteristics of cases. Consultation with CDC is encouraged if an outbreak is suspected.

"Box 4. Outbreak thresholds
Thresholds by outbreak type
Organization-based: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period.
Community-based: multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period.

"Although an absolute outbreak threshold is no longer used, calculating an outbreak attack rate may still be useful in determining the magnitude of an outbreak and comparing against a historical baseline. An outbreak attack rate per 100 000 population is calculated as follows: [(number of outbreak-associated meningococcal disease cases during a 3-month period)/(population at risk)] x 100 000. The epidemiology of the cases should be used to determine the appropriate denominator for attack rate calculations and should include the population of the smallest geographic area that contains the cases and be limited to the sub-populations in which cases were reported (such as among certain age-groups or social networks). For some populations, such as MSM [men who have sex with men], determining the denominator can be very challenging. Results of local or statewide surveys (such as proportion of adult male population that is MSM, proportion of population with HIV) along with census data can be helpful in estimating population sizes.

"Previous versions of the outbreak guidance do not define the term 'cluster' of meningococcal disease, though this term is used informally by public health officials. In this updated guidance, the term cluster can be used to describe a grouping of cases thought to be epidemiologically related that are still under investigation or that do not meet the definition of an outbreak.

9. Vaccination
--------------
9.1 Decision to vaccinate
"Vaccination is the preferred control measure for meningococcal disease outbreaks of all serogroups commonly seen in the United States (B, C, W, and Y). However, many factors should be taken into consideration when determining the need for vaccination. While the number of cases is important, other factors to consider include the population size, ability to define a target group for vaccination, whether ongoing transmission is likely, feasibility of a vaccination campaign, and timing of potential vaccination in relation to cases. In situations where ongoing transmission is unlikely (such as cases limited to household members, roommates, or boyfriend/girlfriend), a vaccination campaign is not necessarily indicated as long as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is implemented to prevent further transmission.

"The guidance above suggests thresholds for considering vaccination, but decisions to vaccinate should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the local/state health department and CDC taking into account all circumstances and epidemiology specific to the outbreak."

The CDC recommends vaccination with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine for all preteens and teens at 11 to 12 years old, with a booster dose at 16 years old. Teens and young adults (16 through 23 year olds) also may be vaccinated with a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine. In addition to a meningococcal conjugate vaccine, certain preteens and teens should get a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine if they: have a rare type of disorder (complement component deficiency); are taking the medicine called Soliris [eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized myasthenia gravis in adults)]; have a damaged spleen or their spleen has been removed; or are part of a population identified to be at increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/public/index.html).
