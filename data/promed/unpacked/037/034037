http://outbreaknewstoday.com/argentina-reports-two-more-monkeypox-cases-in-buenos-aires-country-total-now-9-49736/


The Ministry of Health of the Nation, based on the results received last night [9 Jul 2022] from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INEI), confirms the diagnosis of monkeypox in 2 patients residing in the city of Buenos Aires (CABA).

The people referred to have no relationship between them, but it is coincidental, as background, that both recently arrived in the country from Europe.

In relation to the above, one of the people is a 47-year-old man who, after a trip through France and Spain, began with non-specific symptoms last Saturday, 2 Jul 2022, to which the appearance of a rash was added 2 days later, the reason for which he approached a private health provider in the city of Buenos Aires.

Another man also has a history of traveling to Spain, who returned to Argentina on 30 Jun [2022] and presented symptoms on 1 Jul 2022. As a result, the day before yesterday the person went to make a consultation at a public hospital in the same jurisdiction.

Both patients are under medical follow-up and in good general condition, complying with the isolation indicated by the health protocol.

With these 2 new cases of monkeypox, there are a total of 9 diagnoses of this disease [in Argentina] made by the scientific teams of the INEI, dependent on the National Administration of Laboratories and Health Institutes (ANLIS) "Dr Carlos Malbran".

[4] United Kingdom: downgrade

UK officials have downgraded their classification of the monkeypox outbreak as the rare virus continues to spread around the country.

Previously classed as a 'high consequence infectious disease' [HCID], the country's health agencies decided cases in the current outbreak haven't been severe enough to warrant this status.

HCID classification implies a disease has a high rate of mortality and a dearth of available medical interventions. But the country's monkeypox cases have typically resulted in relatively mild disease, with no deaths reported. In addition, a vaccine is available that can help protect against severe symptoms.

Practically, the classification change won't make much difference to the way the outbreak is handled. But it means most close contacts of confirmed cases will no longer be contacted daily for updates. Instead, they will be given details of who to contact should they develop symptoms.

Officials met to consider the classification back in June [2022], but news of their decision was only announced last week [week of 4 Jul 2022].

Although the outbreak has been downgraded, cases of monkeypox continue to grow, with more than 1500 confirmed across the UK on Thursday [7 Jul 2022]. The vast majority have been found in London.

This was an increase of roughly 50% in just over a week, with 1076 cases reported as of 28 Jun [2022].

UK officials say cases newly imported from West Africa should still be considered HCIDs because they may have more serious clinical outcomes.

Dr Meera Chand, Director of clinical and emerging infections at the UK Health Security Agency, advised members of the public to remain alert to symptoms -- particularly men who have sex with men.

"While anyone can catch monkeypox, the majority of monkeypox cases in the UK continue to be in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), with the infection being passed on mainly through close contact between people in interconnected sexual networks."

She advised people to check themselves for rashes and blisters before attending events, and abstain from sex if they find symptoms.

"It can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to appear after being in contact with someone with monkeypox, so stay alert for symptoms after you have skin to skin or sexual contact with someone new," she added.

New Zealand's 1st case of monkeypox has been detected in Auckland, the Ministry of Health has announced.

The person in their 30s is in isolation at home and has recently returned from overseas travel in a country with reported cases of monkeypox. A "very small" number of contacts are being advised to watch for symptoms, and there is no evidence of community transmission.

Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease, meaning it is able to pass from animals to humans.

ref: Atkinson B, Burton C, Pottage T, et al. Infection-competent monkeypox virus contamination identified in domestic settings following an imported case of monkeypox into the UK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
An imported case of monkeypox was diagnosed in December 2019 in a traveller returning from Nigeria to the UK. Subsequently, environmental sampling was performed at 2 adjoining single room residences occupied by the patient and their sibling. Monkeypox virus DNA was identified in multiple locations throughout both properties, and monkeypox virus was isolated from several samples 3 days after the patient was last in these locations. Positive samples were identified following use of both vacuum and surface sampling techniques; these methodologies allowed for environmental analysis of potentially contaminated porous and non-porous surfaces via real-time quantitative PCR analysis in addition to viral isolation to confirm the presence of infection-competent virus.

This report confirms the potential for infection-competent monkeypox virus to be recovered in environmental settings associated with known positive cases and the necessity for rapid environmental assessment to reduce potential exposure to close contacts and the general public. The methods adopted in this investigation may be used for future confirmed cases of monkeypox in order to establish levels of contamination, confirm the presence of infection-competent material, and to identify locations requiring additional cleaning.

Originality-significance statement
----------------------------------
Several imported cases of human monkeypox infection, an emerging infectious disease with a case fatality rate of up to 10%, have been identified in recent years including importations into the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, and Singapore. It is likely that this phenomenon relates to decreased immunity against monkeypox infection in endemic regions that was previously provided via the smallpox vaccination programme. It is therefore likely that further imported cases of monkeypox will be reported in future; such occurrences will require significant clinical oversight, including suitable infection control measures. Environmental sampling to identify contaminated sites that may pose a risk can inform infection control guidance. This report documents an environmental sampling response following an imported case detected in late 2019 in the UK. Monkeypox virus DNA was readily identified in numerous locations throughout 2 domestic residences associated with the infected patient and infectious virus was isolated from several environmental samples confirming that contaminated environmental settings may pose a risk for onward transmission. The methods utilised in this report may advise future environmental responses following cases of this high consequence emerging viral disease in order to prevent secondary cases in close contacts or members of the public.

[7] Vaccine: 1 or 2 doses
Date: Fri 1 Jul 2022 2:30 PM

https://www.science.org/content/article/there-s-shortage-monkeypox-vaccine-could-one-dose-instead-two-suffice


As the monkeypox outbreak grows, the preferred vaccine to combat it is in short supply -- a problem that's only getting worse now that countries are expanding access to the vaccine. But there is a strategy that could double overnight the number of people who can be vaccinated: use a single shot instead of the recommended 2.

Compelling data from monkey and human studies suggest a single dose of the vaccine -- produced by Bavarian Nordic and sold under 3 different brand names -- solidly protects against monkeypox, and that the 2nd dose mainly serves to extend the durability of protection.

The United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada are offering the vaccine to anyone deemed at high risk of infection -- for now that's primarily men who have sex with men (MSM) who have multiple partners. The United States at first limited the vaccine to contacts of confirmed cases, including healthcare workers, but on 28 Jun 2022 also began to offer it to people at high risk of infection who had presumed exposures, which includes MSM who have had multiple partners "in an area where monkeypox is spreading."

There's no way to put a hard number on it, but millions of people worldwide are now eligible for the vaccine. Yet there are nowhere near enough doses of vaccine, which contains a virus called modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), to quickly get all of them the recommended 2 doses, which are normally spaced 4 weeks apart.

The United Kingdom is already giving people just one shot for now, advising them that they might want the 2nd dose if they have an ongoing risk. And some public health officials and scientists say time is of the essence for a broader vaccination campaign among high-risk people if countries hope to prevent the epidemic from getting out of hand and the virus establishing itself outside areas where it is already endemic.

Bavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin, an immunologist, also embraces the single dose plan. Studies have shown that immune responses triggered by a single shot of the MVA vaccine declines after 2 years, which is why the approved vaccine schedule calls for a 2nd shot. But Chaplin says immune memory is so robust after a single dose that a booster given 2 years later leads to the same immune response as the standard schedule. If countries decide to use single shots now, they have a long time to add the booster and still achieve the durability benefit, he believes. "There are a lot of data to support the single shot," Chaplin says.

Bernard Moss, a virologist at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studied the efficacy of a single-dose MVA vaccine in monkeys, says he's reluctant to make public health recommendations -- but also volunteers: "I think a single dose in an emergency setting is reasonable." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, says the United States will stick with the 2-dose regimen because that's what is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Bavarian Nordic's product is one of 2 FDA-approved vaccines for monkeypox. Both were developed to target its cousin, smallpox, but animal studies suggest both protect against monkeypox as well.

One, named ACAM2000, is a modern version of the age-old smallpox vaccine, made from unmodified vaccinia virus, that helped eradicate that disease from humans, a feat WHO celebrated as complete in 1980. FDA approved ACAM2000 in 2007, and the United States has enough of it in its Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to vaccinate the country's entire population if there is a bioterror attack with smallpox. Some of the vaccine has been used "off label" for monkeypox in the current outbreak. But vaccinia copies itself after vaccination, which can lead to serious disease, especially in people who have compromised immune systems from HIV -- which has a high prevalence among MSM -- or other factors.

MVA, the virus in Bavarian Nordic's vaccine, does not replicate in the body and is much safer, which makes it the preferred vaccine for the monkeypox outbreak. Known as Jynneos in the United States, Imvanex in Europe, and Imvamune in Canada, MVA is the only vaccine FDA has explicitly approved for monkeypox. Because monkeypox is so rare, the company had no human efficacy data when it applied for approval from FDA; the agency granted its license in 2019 in part based on studies showing the vaccine protected animals from monkeypox.

In the United States, SNS will make 56 000 Jynneos doses available to states immediately, officials said during a 28 Jun 2022 White House press conference. Because that's not nearly enough to meet potential demand, the government has devised a 4-tiered allocation system that prioritizes locales with the highest monkeypox rates and the largest population at high risk. Officials said they expect to receive an additional 296 000 doses from Bavarian Nordic "in the coming days."

The European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority has purchased 109 090 doses of the vaccine -- only some of which are immediately available -- and is also prioritizing locations with high case numbers. (The 1st 5300 doses were shipped to Spain; Portugal, Germany, and Belgium are next.)

Individual countries in Europe have purchased supplies of the vaccine as well, but numbers are hard to confirm. All told, the world has about 1 million doses of the vaccine in hand, Chaplin says. Supply will steadily increase later this year. Bavarian Nordic already has an additional 1 million doses available for the United States, which still require FDA's blessing because they were produced at a new plant in Denmark, Chaplin says, and the US government today [1 Jul 2022] announced the purchase of another 2.5 million doses to be delivered by early 2023.

But the supply of vaccine to prevent monkeypox today "remains very constrained," said a 15 Jun 2022 WHO monkeypox guidance, which encourages countries that have doses to share them with those that have limited or no supply.

The constraints are intensifying given the expanded eligibility for the vaccine. Initially, many countries followed WHO guidance and offered vaccination to only 2 groups. One was people who were at high risk of infection because of their occupation: health care workers, outbreak response teams, and lab workers who might handle viral samples. The other was people who had been in close contact with a known case; the vaccine can work post-exposure, ideally if given within 4 days but up to 2 weeks after contact occurs. Now, several countries are effectively offering the vaccine both as pre- and postexposure prophylaxis to anyone at high risk.

At a press conference this week announcing U.S. plans to expand vaccination, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky stated that 2 MVA doses are needed as "it takes about 2 weeks after your 2nd dose for maximum protection."

Faster protection
-----------------
In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1817307] in 2019, Chaplin and colleagues compared immune responses in people given either MVA or ACAM2000. With smallpox virus, levels of neutralizing antibodies are seen as a key indicator of protection, so the same idea extends to monkeypox virus. The researchers found that 14 days after a single dose, the levels of antibodies that neutralize the monkeypox peaked with MVA, at a level nearly identical to that triggered by ACAM2000. Given that the vaccines are presumed to work postexposure if given within 2 weeks of contact, this suggests that a single dose of MVA could prevent many cases of disease and slow spread.

In a 2008 monkey study led by Moss, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0804985105], researchers compared preexposure vaccination against monkeypox from a single dose of MVA and one dose of a cruder version of ACAM2000 called Dryvax. Because MVA does not make copies of itself, the team gave it at a higher dose--similar to what's used in the Bavarian Nordic shot today--than the Dryvax vaccine.

Both vaccines worked well, but MVA appeared to work faster. Levels of neutralizing antibodies and CD8 cells -- critical immune actors that destroy infected cells -- both rose more rapidly with MVA, which Moss and coworkers concluded was because it took time for Dryvax to replicate to levels that matched the initial shot of MVA. What's more, when they injected the animals with the monkeypox virus just 4 days after vaccination, it grew less well in monkeys vaccinated with MVA.

In a statement to Science, CDC stressed that a single dose of the vaccine hasn't been studied in any outbreak and cautioned that it is "challenging" to extrapolate from immune responses in earlier studies and protection in animal studies.

At this week's press conference, there was no discussion of temporarily giving only one dose in the US vaccination campaign. But when asked about the option by Science, Peter Marks, the head of FDA's vaccine division, said "we're looking into this."

[This report underscores the dilemma of having to make decisions in the face of an ongoing outbreak when relevant data are unavailable. There is not time available to carry out the relevant experiments when transmission is occurring currently. Clearly, one dose of the vaccine is better than none. Duration of immunity will become clearer as recipients of a single dose are naturally challenged over time. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Recent enhanced monkeypox (MPX) surveillance in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where MPX is endemic, has uncovered multiple cases of MPX and varicella zoster virus (VZV) coinfections. The purpose of this study was to verify if coinfections occur and to characterize the clinical nature of these cases. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory results were used to investigate MPX/VZV coinfections. A coinfection was defined as a patient with at least one Orthopoxvirus/MPX-positive sample and at least one VZV-positive sample within the same disease event. Between September 2009 and April 2014, 134 of the 1107 (12.1%) suspected MPX cases were confirmed as MPX/VZV coinfections. Coinfections were more likely to report symptoms than VZV-alone cases and less likely than MPX-alone cases. Significantly higher lesion counts were observed for coinfection cases than for VZV-alone but less than MPX-alone cases. Discernible differences in symptom and rash severity were detected for coinfection cases compared with those with MPX or VZV alone. Findings indicate infection with both MPX and VZV could modulate infection severity. Collection of multiple lesion samples allows for the opportunity to detect coinfections. As this program continues, it will be important to continue these procedures to assess variations in the proportion of coinfected cases over time.

[The findings of the study above indicate infection with both MPX and VZV could modulate infection severity. Although this study was conducted with samples taken between 2009 and 2014 in DR Congo and the monkeypox virus involved was doubtless the Central African clade, a similar study done during the current ex-Africa MPX outbreak would be of interest. - Mod.TY]
