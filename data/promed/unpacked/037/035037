[In ProMED-mail posting "Bluetongue - Europe (49): BTV-8, Switzerland
20071028.3504," Basel was erroneously replaced by Bern. We regret the
error. - Mod.AS

Basel, which is located very close to the French and Germany borders with
Switzerland (see interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=46.8,8.2,5>) lies well within the bluetongue
restriction zone, so it is not surprising to receive notice of an outbreak.

For a map of the restriction zones across Europe, see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/BlueTongue_RestrictedZones.jpg>.

The report mentions that vaccine use is presently prohibited. It is to be
hoped that a good hard freeze will occur, eliminate the midge vector, and
provide some respite at least until next year (2008). A thorough risk
assessment process can then be undertaken to decide on whether vaccine can
be part of an ongoing control strategy. With the spread of BTV-8 to
Scandinavia and now Switzerland, an optimal control plan is imperative. -
