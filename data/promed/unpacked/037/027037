[The fact that we are already getting follow-up reports indicates how much
attention animal health officials are paying to this outbreak. However,
none of these reports contains information on the virus type, and the IAH
laboratory at Pirbright is identifying the virus type from the Dutch
samples. However, there is no indication here that the other countries
involved are also having their Bluetongue Viruses typed. I suspect that is
the case, because there are 5 types (1, 2, 4, 9, and 16) which have been
circulating in Southern Europe since 1998. It would be very important --
although quite difficult -- to identify risk factors which have encouraged
the movement of these viruses northward, if they turn out to match the
southern European virus types. For additional information, see the comment
of Mod.AS in Bluetongue - Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, OIE 20060821.2353.
