China's agriculture ministry confirms a new African swine fever [ASF] outbreak in the city of Zhaotong in Yunnan province in the country's southwest, official CCTV reported on Sunday [21 Oct 2018].

The ministry confirms ASF in 2 farms in Zhaotong with a total of 545 pigs dead, CCTV reports.

[The above outbreak, adding the province Yunnan to China's 9 provinces and an autonomous region reported as infected earlier, is yet to be reported to the OIE. The updated list will then include the following 11 main administrative territories (in alphabetical order): the provinces Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, Shanxi, Tianjin, Yunnan and Zhejiang, plus the Inner Mongolia Autonomous region.

For the location of the city of Zhaotong in Yunnan province, see https://tinyurl.com/yb9n2x3b.

The most current OIE ASF outbreaks map (global) presents, in relation to the Chinese event, the situation as of 18 Oct 2018, when Shanxi became the 10th affected territory; available at https://tinyurl.com/y899xbvf (Click on the Chinese cluster, zoom in).

The outbreak in Yunnan is a considerable, worrying leap of ASF south-westwards.

The Chinese ASF epizootic remained limited to domestic pigs, most of them in small holdings. The epizootic situation could become more complicated in case wild boars (_Sus scrofa ferus_) get involved, becoming a difficult-to-control reservoir of the virus.

In China, wild boar density is estimated at between 2 and 5 head/sq.km, with densities put at 2.24 head/sq.km [5.8 head/sq.mi] in some forests in northeastern China, and even higher in the southeastern coastal areas. In Guangdong Province Nature Reserve, wild boar density was estimated at between 4.87 and 5.15 head/sq.km. [12.6-13.4 head/sq.mi] (Ref 1, page 8). This is a rather high density; for comparison's sake, see data from Europe in ref. 2 (page 13, Fig. 13 "Wild boar population abundance (head per sq.km) based on available population estimates."

The species is widely distributed throughout China, except for some dry and unsuitable regions in the west (Xinjiang province) and north of the country, including the Tibetan plateau, and the region bordering Mongolia. However, little precise information is available about the ecology, population structure and dynamics, as well as the actual distribution and density, of wild boar in China. Complementary information is required.
