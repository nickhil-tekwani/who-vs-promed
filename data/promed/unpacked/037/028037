In the recent past we experienced a moderate die-off of catfish in a
sport fishing pond. Other species of fish appeared unaffected.

Catfish are delivered to such ponds routinely (that is, they are
stocked with fish trucked in). Necropsies and bacterial cultures on 3
catfish revealed _Edwardsiella tarda_.

[_Edwardsiella tarda_ is a gram-negative bacterium that causes a
systemic infection, edwardsiellosis, in fish. The virulence factors
of this pathogen and its genetic determinants have not been
systematically examined. However, the incidence of _Edwardsiella_ spp
increased during the summer months, as water temperatures increased.
Again, the significance of this bacterium in fish and a relationship
to human health have not been determined.

Also, in the original piece, the water from the lake was being used
to cool a plant. If the plant were pulling deeper cooler water from
the lake, then they would be raising the water temperature of the
deeper waters. This is significant as catfish tend to be bottom
dwellers, and warmer water would support the bacterium mentioned above.
