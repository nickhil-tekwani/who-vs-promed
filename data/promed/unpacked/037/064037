The Democratic Republic of Congo has almost run out of yellow fever vaccine in Kinshasa in the same week that the government declared an epidemic of the disease in the packed capital and 2 other provinces.

Some local people have complained they were denied immunisation due to the shortage, despite queueing for a shot. More supplies have been promised, but health officials in the impoverished country say they have to choose between the high cost of flying them in, or a long wait for shipment by sea.

The mosquito-borne haemorrhagic virus is a major concern in Kinshasa, a city of about 12 million people which has poor health services, a humid climate beloved of the insects, and much stagnant water where they can breed owing to poor drainage.

Health minister Felix Kabange said on Monday [20 Jun 2016] that 67 cases had been confirmed in Kinshasa, Kongo Central and Kwango provinces and that over 1000 more suspected cases are being monitored. Five people have died from the disease.

The government and international health organisations vaccinated more than 2 million people, about half of them in Kinshasa, between 26 May and 4 Jun 2016. But there is no more vaccine left aside from a small number of doses left in reserve in Kongo Central and some being administered by a government agency at Kinshasa's central hospital, airport and river crossing with neighbouring Congo Republic, health officials said.

The agency is charging USD 35 for the doses it administers, a hefty sum in a country whose gross national income per person is estimated by the World Bank at USD 380 a year.

Eugene Kabambi, the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, said that the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision has promised Congo more than a million more doses.

"That requires either a cargo flight, in which case it would come very quickly but cost a lot, or if it's by boat, it could take a few weeks," he told Reuters.

The Coordinating Group brings together the WHO and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies plus the medical charity Médecins sans Frontières.

The global stockpile of yellow fever vaccine has already been depleted twice this year [2016] to immunise people in Angola, Uganda and Congo. It stands at 6 million doses, but this may not be enough if there are simultaneous outbreaks in a number of highly-populated areas, experts warn.

Almost 18 million doses have been distributed for emergency vaccination campaigns so far in the 3 African countries.

Congo has extensive experience of dealing with outbreaks of tropical diseases, and the Ebola virus was 1st identified in the central African country. It earned plaudits in 2014 for quickly containing a local Ebola outbreak that killed 49 people in the country. By contrast, an Ebola epidemic killed more than 11 300 as it swept through West Africa from 2013.

Of the cases confirmed in the latest yellow fever outbreak, 7 were locally transmitted in Congo. Another 58 were imported from Angola, where it began, and 2 came from remote forested areas not linked to the current outbreak.

Symptoms of the disease include fever, body aches and nausea, although most people recover.

In Kinshasa's Ndjili commune, a maze of narrow alleys and one of the health zones in the city targeted for vaccination in late May 2016, many residents were unable to receive an injection before stocks ran out.

"Everyone started coming, even from other districts. Near the end, we realised that the vaccine was insufficient," said Murphy Nzuzi, a doctor at a dimly-lit health centre in Ndjili with only a few small treatment rooms. He added that fights had broken out among people waiting in line.

In a nearby market, where trash collected in a small stream, residents said that some people had received vaccination papers while waiting in line but never got a shot.

"When you present yourself, they give you the card that gives you access to the vaccine, but then there wasn't enough vaccine for everyone," said a local resident.

The current method for making vaccines using chicken eggs takes a year. Health authorities are considering using 1/5th of the standard dose of vaccine -- enough to immunise temporarily but not to give lifelong immunity -- to maximise its availability, but no final decision has been made.

[Although this report is a week old, we decided to post it because it has some details not included in previous posts. This report adds a human dimension illustrating the social and logistical elements that are part of a vaccination campaign. The good news is that dose spitting (1/5th the normal dose) is being used in Kinshasa, which will extend coverage. The bad news is that if USD 35 is being charged, many individuals and families will be unable to afford it. The question is that, if the vaccine comes by sea, will the limited vaccine supplies run out before the new shipment arrives? - Mod.TY]
