Summary:
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 14 Oct 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 26 Nov 2013
Report date: 28 Nov 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 28 Nov 2013
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 3/21.4 percent
Mortality: 0 percent
Zoonotic impact: asymptomatic exposure of camel to MERS-CoV (laboratory advanced) and one outbreak in a specific zone (Shahanya)
Causal agent: MERS-CoV

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Shahanya, Shahanya, Rayyan, Ar Rayyan
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Oct 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected population: small farm with 14 camels, one sheep, one pigeon cage, and some chickens.
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Camelidae / 14 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0 /
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Camelidae / 21.4 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and / or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the health authority in Qatar notified the presence of a confirmed human MERS-CoV (Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) case. A joint team from both health and veterinary authorities was sent to the patient farm to investigate the health status of animals and the contact person. A farm worker proved to be positive for MERS-CoV and samples were collected from the 14 existing camels in addition to one sheep, some pigeons and chickens, and some environmental samples (water, soil, animal food, and grass) and all were sent to the Netherlands for testing. All animals were kept under observation and quarantine and all were apparently healthy.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam) and National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Bilthoven), the Netherlands (OIE's Reference Laboratory) / Camelidae / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 26 Nov 2013 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This outbreak in Qatar confirms the recently published ProMED-mail request for information on a suspect case in this country (archive no 20131128.2080449). Also see ProMED-mail 20131119.2064239.

According to the OIE's "Questions and Answers MERS coronavirus (CoV)," updated on 28 Nov 2013 and available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/update-28th-november-2013-questions-and-answers-mers-coronavirus-cov/, these follow-up questions are of particular interest:

"Can animals become infected with MERS-CoV?
Recent information from analyses carried out by a laboratory in the Netherlands provide compelling evidence that MERS-CoV has been isolated from 3 camels on a farm in Qatar, also linked to 2 human cases of MERS CoV. In this event, the exposure source of the humans and the camels (and possibly other animals) is not known, that is, the direction of transmission between the 2 species is not known and it is also not known whether the animals and humans were exposed to some other source of infection. Further investigations are needed to assess the implications of these findings.

What about the suspicion that camels and other animals play a role in MERS?
Although recent results from a laboratory in the Netherlands provide evidence that 3 camels were infected with MERS-CoV, further investigations are needed to understand the significance of these findings and to assess the potential role of camels and possibly other animals in MERS.
It is important to remain open minded about all potential sources of exposure for human and animal cases until more information is available.

What would happen if MERS-CoV is identified in animals?
If information from public health investigations identifies a possible animal source, OIE will support further joint investigations.
OIE Member Countries would be obliged to report to the OIE a confirmed case of MERS-CoV in animals, as an "emerging disease" in accordance with article 1.1.3 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. If MERS-CoV was identified in an animal this would not necessarily mean that the animal is a source of human infection. Detailed investigations would then be needed to understand the relationship between any animal cases and human cases, and whether a finding in animals would be significant for human infection." - Mod.CRD
