Suspected bird flu patients moved to AI center
----------------------------------------------
After 3 days of medical treatment at the Serang General Hospital, 5
suspected bird flu patients were moved to the special avian influenza (AI)
center at the Jakarta-based Persahabatan Hospital by ambulance on Fri 21
Dec 2007. The 5 were rushed to the general hospital on Wed 19 Dec 2007
after being treated at a local health service post.
The father of the first 3 patients said his children were suffering from
fever with respiratory difficulty and cough before being taken to the
health service post. He said that, a day before they fell ill, about 60
ducks and chickens owned by him and his neighbors had died suddenly. "Local
agriculture officers who checked the dead fowls said they tested positive
for bird flu," he said.
Bird flu has so far claimed the lives of 93 people in Indonesia. The last
fatality was a 47 year old man who died at Persahabatan Hospital, after
falling ill from the H5N1 virus on 2 Dec 2007.
At least 208 people have died in 12 countries in Asia and Africa of the
disease, according to World Health Organization statistics.
