The county government plans to vaccinate at least 70 000 cattle against Rift Valley fever [RVF] in Baringo South Constituency. The disease has so far killed over 500 livestock, mostly goats and sheep, at Kiserian in the past 2 months. This has left many families that rely on livestock without a source of livelihood.

Baringo South veterinary officer Julius Cheruiyot yesterday [Sat 4 Aug 2018] said vaccination was started after samples taken to government laboratories were positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF). "We have started a vector control programme [...] to prevent its further spread," said Dr Cheruiyot.

Before RVF was diagnosed livestock were being treated for blue [tongue] disease. However, the high number of abortions, especially in goats and sheep, raised the alarm, prompting testing for RVF.

Cheruiyot said veterinary officers were working with local administrators to educate residents about the disease. He warned against consuming meat from uninspected carcasses. "Dead animals should be buried," he said. Livestock get infected by RVF through mosquitoes that breed higher during heavy rains.

[The above media report is somewhat confusing. While Baringo South Constituency is one of 6 constituencies in Baringo County, one of Kenya's 47 counties, Kiserian is a settlement in another county, Kajiado county. Both counties, Baringo and Kajiado, are located in the former Rift Valley Province.

The information may be interpreted as follows: while heavy losses are said to have been caused by RVF in the Kajiado county, mass preventive vaccinations are planned to be applied in the Baringo South Constituency, probably not (yet) affected by the disease. Confirmation or otherwise would be welcomed.

The total number of reported RVF outbreaks in Kenya's animals since the start of the event (3 Jun 2018) is 10, according to the 6 official reports submitted so far to the OIE. The most recent follow-up report was submitted on 6 Aug 2018, informing absence of new outbreaks (since 2 Jul 2018). The outbreaks were reported from the following counties (number of outbreaks in brackets): Mandera (1), Wajir (2), Marsabit (1), Isiolo (2), Meru (1), Baringo (1), Tara River (1), and Siaya (1). Links to all reports and a map presenting their locations is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26827.

The above list might be subject to updates/modifications. In contrast with the media report above, Kajiado county is not included among the counties officially reported as infected. For Kenya's counties map, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Kenya.

The media report also highlights a diagnostic challenge. The simultaneous circulation of other animal diseases, such as bluetongue in sheep, deserves to be considered. Bluetongue, endemic throughout Africa, is a seasonal vectorborne disease, clinically seriously affecting mainly sheep of exotic breeds (most cases in goats and cattle are subclinical). Bluetongue is not zoonotic. Other abortifacient infectious agents, including zoonotic ones such as brucellosis, chlamydiasis, toxoplasmosis, Q fever and salmonellosis, deserve to be excluded as well. The striking difference between them and RVF is the higher mortality rates in the latter, particularly in offspring, and the acute, influenza-like disease in man. - Mod.AS
