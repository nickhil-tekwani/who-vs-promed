The Humanitarian Bulletin, a news release from the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Ethiopia reported on 10 Mar 2014 [http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Humanitarian%20Bulletin_10%20March%202014.pdf] that:
"The same regions [Amhara, Gambella, and SNNPR (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Regions)] are reporting suspected cases of meningitis, with 66 cases reported during the past week. The meningitis outbreak was confined to Amaro woreda [district] of Segen Peoples zone, SNNPR. A 2nd outbreak is now suspected in Gedo zone, with 35 cases reported in Dilla town, Dilla Zuria, and Wenago woredas during the past week. The SNNP Regional Health Bureau is planning a mass vaccination campaign in the affected woredas using the limited meningitis vaccine available in the country. WHO reports inadequate meningitis vaccine stock in Ethiopia to reach the more than 2 million people at risk."

[Maps of Ethiopia can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1Ahu and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Ethiopia (regions).

Ethiopia is one of the countries in the WHO African meningitis belt, a region in sub-Saharan Africa stretching from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa where the incidence rate of meningitis is very high (see map at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/images/map3-13-frequent-epidemics-meningococcal-meningitis-large.png). Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the African meningitis belt each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx).

_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A is said to be the most commonly isolated pathogen in the African meningitis belt. However, outbreaks have also been caused by other _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, such as serogroup C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751), and in March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html). No reports on meningitis were available for Ethiopia for 2013 (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/) and we are not told the microbial etiology of the meningitis outbreak in the various regions of Ethiopia in the report above. ProMED-mail would appreciate information on the microbial causes of the meningitis outbreaks in Ethiopia from knowledgeable sources.

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains. Meningococcal disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. Rarely, outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been related to other serogroups, such as type X, which has occurred in Niger in 2006 and Burkina Faso in 2010.

Serogroup A, B, C, Y, and W135 polysaccharides are immunogenic in humans; serogroup B is poorly immunogenic, presumably because serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule. While effective capsular polysaccharides-based vaccines exist against serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B strains. However, a new protein-based, broad-spectrum meningococcal serogroup B vaccine has been developed. - Mod.ML]
