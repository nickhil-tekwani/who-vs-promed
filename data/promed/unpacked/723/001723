Sharply rising cases of some sexually transmitted diseases -- including a 26% rise in new syphilis infections reported last year [2021] -- are prompting US health officials to call for new prevention and treatment efforts.

"It is imperative that we ... work to rebuild, innovate, and expand (STD) prevention in the US," said Dr. Leandro Mena of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a speech Monday [19 Sep 2022] at a medical conference on sexually transmitted diseases.

Infections rates for some STDs, including gonorrhea and syphilis, have been rising for years. Last year [2021] the rate of syphilis cases reached its highest since 1991, and the total number of cases hit its highest since 1948. HIV cases are also on the rise, up 16% last year [2021]. And an international outbreak of monkeypox, which is being spread mainly between men who have sex with other men, has further highlighted the nation's worsening problem with diseases spread mostly through sex.

David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, called the situation "out of control."

Officials are working on new approaches to the problem, such as home-test kits for some STDs that will make it easier for people to learn they are infected and to take steps to prevent spreading it to others, Mena said.

Another expert said a core part of any effort must work to increase the use of condoms. "It's pretty simple. More sexually transmitted infections occur when people are having more unprotected sex," said Dr. Mike Saag, an infectious disease expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Syphilis is a bacterial disease that surfaces as genital sores but can ultimately lead to severe symptoms and death if left untreated. New syphilis infections plummeted in the US starting in the 1940s when antibiotics became widely available. They fell to their lowest ever by 1998, when fewer than 7000 new cases were reported nationwide. The CDC was so encouraged by the progress it launched a plan to eliminate syphilis in the US. But by 2002, cases began rising again, largely among gay and bisexual men, and they kept going. In late 2013, CDC ended its elimination campaign in the face of limited funding and escalating cases, which that year [2013] surpassed 17 000. By 2020, cases had reached nearly 41 700, and they spiked even further last year [2021], to more than 52 000. The rate of cases has been rising, too, hitting about 16 per 100 000 people last year [2021]. That's the highest in 3 decades.

Rates are highest in men who have sex with men and among Black and Hispanic Americans and Native Americans. While the rate for women is lower than it is for men, officials noted that it's has been rising more dramatically -- up about 50% last year [2021].

That ties to another problem -- the rise in congenital syphilis, in which infected moms pass the virus on to their babies, potentially leading to death of the child or health problems like deafness and blindness. Annual congenital syphilis cases numbered only about 300 a decade ago; they surged to nearly 2700 last year [2021]. Of last year's tally, 211 were stillbirths or infant deaths, Mena said.

The increases in syphilis and other STDs may have several causes, experts say. Testing and prevention efforts have been hobbled by years of inadequate funding, and spread may have gotten worse -- especially during the pandemic -- as a result of delayed diagnosis and treatment. Drug and alcohol use may have contributed to risky sexual behavior. Condom use has been declining. And there may have been a surge in sexual activity as people emerged from COVID-19 lockdowns. "People are feeling liberated," Saag said.

The arrival of monkeypox added a large additional burden. CDC recently sent a letter to state and local health departments saying that their HIV and STD resources could be used to fight the monkeypox outbreak. But some experts say the government needs to provide more funding for STD work, not divert it. Harvey's group and some other public health organizations are pushing a proposal for more federal funding, including at least USD 500 million for STD clinics.

Mena, who last year [2021] became director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention, called for reducing stigma, broadening screening and treatment services, and supporting the development and accessibility of at-home testing. "I envision one day where getting tested (for STDs) can be as simple and as affordable as doing a home pregnancy test," he said.

[The US CDC report, entitled "Preliminary 2021 STD Surveillance Data," including table and figures, referenced by the news article above can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2021/default.htm and is excerpted below:

"Preliminary data show 2.5 million reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in 2021.

"STDs continued to increase during the 2nd year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no signs of slowing. This page presents preliminary STD surveillance data for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and congenital syphilis. These data include cases reported to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (as of 7 Jul 2022), STD Surveillance Network (as of 15 Jun 2022), and Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (as of 23 Jun 2022) and are considered preliminary as 2021 STD surveillance data will continue to be reported to CDC through the fall of 2022. Final 2021 data, including STD case counts and rates for states and territories, will be provided in the forthcoming 2021 STD Surveillance Report. Until then, the most current complete data for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are available in Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance, 2020 [https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/default.htm]." - Mod.ML
