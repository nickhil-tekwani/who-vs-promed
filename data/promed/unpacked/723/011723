A 27-year-old female and her male companion returned to Perth (more than
3,000 km from Cairns) after staying for 2 nights at the hostel in Cairns
where an outbreak of dengue 3 virus had occurred.
In late November (5 days after her Cairns stay) she developed nausea,
vomiting, fever, rash, etc. which resolved after two weeks. She was
admitted to a local Perth hospital overnight during the acute stage, and
her illness had perplexed the staff. Her boyfriend became unwell two days
after she did. She heard about the dengue outbreak two weeks ago on the
news and returned to her physician, who contacted me. Thanks to ProMED I
was able to provide some information. I had not heard about the outbreak
from any other source. The patient subsequently has had serology performed
at the Pathcenter (the West Australian arbovirus reference group) and her
illness has been confirmed as dengue 3 (HI and IgM).
Seems to me there are a few obvious lessons including that presumably there
are more cases that have gone undetected. I am not sure if the
Queenslanders know about these two cases yet.

[The good folks at the University of Western Australia know that all such
cases should be reported to Communicable Disease Intelligence, Australia,
so I assume these cases are already known to Queensland Health officials. -
