A woman who miscarried after taking Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is being
monitored by health officials, but her doctor said there was no evidence
the anti-bird flu drug was to blame. The World Health Organization and the
Swiss-based drug manufacturer Roche Holding AG say they have inadequate
data on the use of Tamiflu in pregnant women, so the significance of the
miscarriage is not immediately clear.
The woman was 2 months pregnant when she was admitted to Adam Malik
Hospital in North Sumatra's capital Medan on 22 Aug 2006, said Dr Nur
Rasyid Lubis, adding that although she had symptoms of bird flu she later
tested negative.
The 35 year old woman came from an area hard hit by the disease, so was
given Tamiflu as a precaution, he said, adding that he did not believe her
miscarriage had anything to do with the drug. The woman was "bleeding from
her womb" when she arrived at the hospital and the fetus "was very weak,"
he noted.
WHO says that until more data on pregnant women are available, Tamiflu
should only be prescribed when the potential benefit to the mother
justifies the possible risk to the unborn child.

[The manufacturer is right to say that conclusions should not be drawn from
this isolated incident. Drugs are usually prescribed with great caution in
pregnancy, and rightly so, but this does mean that the evidence for their
safety or danger in pregnancy is often inadequate. - Mod.SH]
