A total of 48 persons died due to hydrophobia [rabies] in the country
[Sri Lanka] during the past year, the Epidemiology Unit statistics
have revealed. [Compared with 55 in 2007, 59 in 2008, and 56 in 2009.
See: Rabies, canine, human - Sri Lanka (02) 20100910.3264. - Mod.CP].
The highest number of deaths, which was 6, was reported from the
Gampaha District. Five deaths each were reported from the Galle and
Batticaloa Districts.

Galle district epidemiologist Dr. Mrs. Sriyani Jayasuriya confirmed
that during the year 2010, 5 deaths had been confirmed in the Galle
district. From the Southern Province, she says that deaths due to
hydrophobia have been reported only from the Galle district. [A map

With World Bank assistance last year [2010], the inoculation of dogs
had taken place in the Galle district. The inoculation of dogs had
been carried out by 13 persons recruited on a contract basis and by
the Anti-Hydrophobia Unit of the Ministry of Health in the Galle
district. Accordingly, last year [2010] alone, 81 690 dogs had been
inoculated, Dr. Mrs. Jayasuriya said.

She further said [that despite] the [ongoing] inoculation against
hydrophobia, the [number] of deaths is relatively high, and we must
contain this dangerous situation. A problem is that in future, as
there will be no World Bank assistance, the contract-based projects
[have] had to be stopped, she [added].

In the Galle district, one local government institution had to spend
nearly Rs. 30 000 [approx. USD 271.00] a month, and Gale Municipal
Council has already earmarked this amount.

[Rabies transmitted by domestic dogs remains a major problem in Sri
Lanka, where decades of warfare and natural disasters have afflicted
the country. In the Southern Province of Sri Lanka, human rabies
cases have been restricted to the Galle district, which may indicate
that the canine vaccination programme has had some effect. Continued
financing of the programme is becoming a major problem.
