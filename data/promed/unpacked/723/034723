With many children missing out on measles vaccines because of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, fears are growing that there could be an outbreak of the disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

"In the last 2 to 3 months we've not been able to carry out routine measles vaccinations, which is worrying," says Eugenie Ngabo Nzigire, a nurse based in the eastern city of Bukavu.

"It takes just one sick child and the whole community is in danger," adds the 57-year-old head of the maternity unit at Skyborne Hospital.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that with an estimated 140 million measles vaccinations around the world having been missed due to COVID-19 disruption, countries with fragile healthcare systems, such as DR Congo, could be sitting on a "time bomb" of potential outbreaks.

Nearly 8000 people - mainly children - died from measles between 2018 and 2020 in the country, according to monitoring data from the WHO.

Measles is the most infectious preventable disease in the world, much more contagious than COVID-19. It is spread through contact and droplets that can remain in the air for hours.

Still a common killer, there are outbreaks currently in Pakistan and Yemen as well as concerns that there could be one in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.

"A child can get measles and die wherever they are in the world, but the likelihood of death is much higher for children younger than one and if there are other stresses like malnutrition or vitamin A deficiency, these really increase the risk of death," says Dr. Natasha Crowcroft, senior technical advisor for measles and rubella at the WHO.

Bukavu is a bustling commercial centre and home to around a million people. It is also where Ms. Ngabo Nzigire has dedicated more than 3 decades of her life to treating children. "I knew I wanted to be a nurse at a very young age, so it's not just a job that I fell into but a vocation to care for people," says the mother of 11.

Ms Ngabo Nzigire found her calling unexpectedly when she became very ill and had to be hospitalised at the age of 12. "I remember the nurse treating me was using an old mercury thermometer that you had to shake before taking the temperature," she says. "I was fascinated by it and thought: 'This is what I want to do with my life'."

The city is also a distribution hub for vaccines, which arrive from the capital Kinshasa, before being sent out to nearby smaller towns such as Bunyakiri.

"It's been 4 months since we have had measles vaccines available, and we've had other vaccine shortages at the same time," says Marocain Chumac Buroko, a supervising nurse in Bunyakiri.

Bunyakiri is located within the "red zone", an area in the east of the country plagued by decades of insecurity and violence.

Trust, says Mr. Buroko is critical to his work, "because people are living with trauma".

But recently fake news and rumors about COVID vaccines have resulted in some families refusing to vaccinate their children completely. "Many in the community were worried when the news of COVID-19 first emerged. People were told that the vaccine [for COVID-19] would be included along with other routine vaccines, so parents didn't want to vaccinate their children from all other diseases out of fear," says Mr. Buroko.

Regarding regional shortages, the authorities declined to comment.

However, aid agencies say it is due to a lack of investment.

"In the last few months, there was a shortage of some vaccines paid for by the government. Measles vaccinations weren't stopped, but there was a slowdown in immunisation programmes," says Thomas Noel Gaha from the UN children's agency Unicef in DR Congo.

It's not only DR Congo that's been affected by the pandemic. Many countries have fallen behind with critical vaccination programmes, threatening the health of an estimated 228 million people - mostly children - at risk of diseases such as polio, yellow fever and measles.

Of the more than 20 countries which temporarily halted their measles vaccination campaigns entirely last year, 15 were in Africa.

"Despite the falling routine vaccine coverage in the first 2 quarters of last year [2020], many countries managed to make up ground. But we don't know whether all children in the first half were ever reached,'' says Dr. Crowcroft.

"Many of us in the measles field are really concerned that we're sitting on a time bomb with some countries," she says.

Prior to the pandemic, in 2019 measles infections surged worldwide reaching the highest number of reported cases in 23 years - resulting in nearly 208 000 deaths.

Experts say the high number of cases and death toll were mainly fueled by a failure to vaccinate children on time with the recommended 2 doses of the vaccine.

However in countries like DR Congo, where there is conflict, weak healthcare systems and limited resources, even providing a single dose to every child in the country under the age of 5 is a struggle.

"Children are normally vaccinated against measles at 9 months here [DR Congo] with a single 0.5ml injection," says Ms Ngabo Nzigire.

Critically, says Dr Crowcroft, measles prevention relies on herd immunity, whereby the large majority of the population is immune, reducing the chance the virus can spread to those who are the most vulnerable.

But in DR Congo, with one of the highest birth rates in the world, this is very difficult to achieve. Just one unvaccinated child risks passing the virus on to the next generation of newborns.

DR Congo is one of nearly 50 countries at risk of a severe measles outbreak in the next few years, according to the WHO.
"Every measles death is a preventable death," says Dr. Crowcroft.

"Outbreaks are a sign that something has gone wrong, so we are pushing for countries to be prepared ahead of what we think is coming," she adds.

[A total of 440 000 cases with 7800 deaths in the DR Congo from 2018 to 2020 is a tragedy that could have been totally preventable in the face of an effective and safe vaccine. The cause, failure to vaccinate children with the full 2-dose regimen, is largely a consequence of conflict, weak healthcare systems, limited resources, and distrust. Children are not only at risk of contracting measles, but also along with adults, vaccine-preventable yellow fever and polio. The next few years could be even more disastrous unless vaccines can get to the people. This will take a community effort with global support. - Mod.LK]

Measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with around 2.6 million annual deaths worldwide. The basic reproduction number of 12 to 18 for the measles virus is the highest of any respiratory virus and is much higher than that of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19 (1). Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine against measles, many countries have experienced measles outbreaks in recent years. In 2019, there was a precipitous increase in measles outbreaks worldwide, with 413 308 confirmed cases and 207 500 measles-related deaths, compared with 140 000 deaths in 2018, 110 000 deaths in 2017, and 89 780 deaths in 2016 (1,2).

Pakistan stands among the top 5 countries with the largest number of children not vaccinated against measles in 2021, and therefore has the highest toll of measles cases, along with Yemen, Tanzania, India, and Nigeria (3). Measles has been endemic in Pakistan for decades and accounts for 65% of the total measles burden among 22 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region (4).

Since its emergence in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a worldwide public-health disaster, with more than 172 million confirmed cases and 3.7 million deaths (as of 4 Jun 2021) reported globally (5). Likewise, in Pakistan, the toll of confirmed COVID-19 cases reached more than 928 000, including more than 21 000 deaths, since [26 Feb 2020] (5). The 3rd wave of COVID-19 is intensifying in Pakistan and coincides with an unprecedented rise in measles outbreaks across the country, with 79 notified outbreaks, 8054 confirmed cases, and 47 deaths since January [2021] (Fig. 1). As many as 65% of the total case count comprises children below 5 years of age, 78% of whom were found to be unvaccinated.

This is, sadly, no surprise, as globally, more than 120 million children were unable to receive the vaccine against measles in 2020; 40 million of these children are in Pakistan (6). Suspension of childhood immunization programs might seem helpful for containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has triggered other public-health disasters, including measles. The risk of a measles epidemic is heightened in Pakistan, as the country has had a low level of routine immunization coverage for many years, with less than 66% coverage for the first dose of measles-containing vaccine in 2018, and 45% for the 2nd dose, far below the 90% coverage required for herd immunity.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a historic 65% decrease in immunization activity among Pakistan and India and an estimated 21.3% increase in child mortality that resulted in 228 000 deaths in children under 5 years of age in South Asian countries, including Pakistan (7). Although children infected with SARS-CoV-2 rarely have a severe infection, co-infection with measles virus may lead to serious complications, in part due to measles-induced immunological amnesia (8). Reports indicated that before the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 54% of Pakistani children were malnourished and vitamin A deficient, which led to immunodeficiency and accounted for 35% of the total childhood deaths in the country (9). The COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the proportion of nutritionally deficient children in Pakistan due to disruptions in nutrition and essential services, which coincides with a 30% increase in measles incidence among children under 5 years of age, relative to its incidence in the pre-pandemic period (Fig. 2).

Pakistan spends less than 1% of its gross domestic product on the health sector, which is wholly inadequate in the 5th-most-populous country in the world, with regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, rotavirus, poliomyelitis - and now COVID-19. The control and prevention of measles requires sustained and robust routine immunization programs coupled with supplementary measles-vaccination campaigns.

Multiple local challenges, such as low investment in the public-health sector, lack of medical services, malnutrition, vaccine hesitancy and complacency, high population density, public negligence, and now the COVID-19 pandemic, are likely to further increase the incidence and case-fatality rate of measles in Pakistan this year [2021]. Maintaining good immunization coverage is of the utmost importance to control and prevent further measles outbreaks. If the circulation of measles in Pakistan is not quickly stopped through vaccination, this outbreak could spell disaster for the stretched healthcare system of the country, and could also pose a grave risk to Pakistan's neighbors - for as with SARS-CoV-2, the measles virus knows no borders.

[Globally with more than 120 million children unable to receive the vaccine against measles in 2020 due to COVID and other factors, also discussed above, the health system must be prepared for the worst in 2021. Pakistan, Yemen, Tanzania, India and Nigeria are the 5 countries with the highest number of children not vaccinated against measles in 2021, and therefore have the highest toll of measles cases. It must be a priority that vaccine is administered to these children as soon as possible. The impediments to immunization in the delivery system must be corrected. - Mod.LK]
