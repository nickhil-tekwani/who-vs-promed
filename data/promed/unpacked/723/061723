Canada: Outbreak of HTLV-1 Infection in Nunavut
-----------------------------------------------
Nunavut health officials have begun a territory-wide search for people
infected with a rare cancer-causing blood virus, after discovering an
outbreak of HTLV-1 [human T-lymphotropic virus 1] infection.
"Nobody knows" how widespread the infection is, said Dr. Isaac Sobol,
Nunavut's Chief Medical Officer of Health. "So far, we've identified
several people -- less than 20 -- who test positive." HTLV-1 is a
retrovirus in the same family as HIV, the virus believed to cause AIDS.
The vast majority of people infected with HTLV-1 show no symptoms, said Dr.
Sobol. But for about 5 percent of those infected, the virus can cause
degenerative nerve disease leading to loss of control of the legs and
bladder. It can also cause blood cancers, including leukemia and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Like HIV, it is most commonly spread through
unprotected sex and blood-to-blood contact, such as sharing needles. An
infected woman can also pass it on to her fetus, as well as to her child
during breast-feeding.
There is no cure for HTLV-1 infection. Symptoms take between 10 to 20 years
to appear. Nunavut's 1st case of HTLV-1 was discovered in June 2005 in a
person with leukemia, Sobol said. Despite the more than 3 months between
the diagnosis and Friday's [30 Sep 2005] public announcement, Sobol said he
doubts there have been any new infections. "We began our intervention as
soon as we learned of the presence of this virus," he said. "Our 1st
priority was to assist those persons infected with the virus and contact
tracing. We've been doing intensive work with the individuals involved, and
we've been doing our contact tracing. I believe we've taken all reasonable
steps to protect the public at this time."
Since the virus was found, all blood samples taken in Nunavut have been
tested for HTLV-1. That testing will continue until officials can properly
assess its prevalence in the territory, although because those tests are
anonymous, they won't identify individual carriers. Confidential, free
tests will be available to anyone in Nunavut who asks for one, Sobol said.
Getting a fix on the virus's spread is likely to take about 6 months. Sobol
released few other details about the outbreak, refusing to say whether it
was confined to one community or describe the health of the other carriers.
HTLV-1 is so rare in Canada that it's not a reportable disease in many
jurisdictions, said Health Canada spokesman Julian Beltrame. The last
outbreak in memory was in 1993, when 3 people were found with HTLV-1 in
British Columbia.
The Canadian Blood Service, which has screened for HLTV-1 since 1990,
reports that, out of roughly 900 000 blood donations received every year,
only 10 or 12 are found contaminated with HLTV-1. The virus, however, is
endemic in other parts of the world, including Southern Japan, the
Caribbean, Papua New Guinea and some parts of Africa. In Nunavut,
health-care providers have been briefed to give blood tests and advice. The
federal Public Health Agency and National Virology Lab in Winnipeg will
also be providing testing resources and advice, Sobol said. HTLV-1 testing
will also be added to prenatal screening tests.

[The viruses originally known as human T-lymphotropic viruses have been
re-designated primate T-lymphotropic viruses in recognition of their
prevalence in non-human primates as well as humans. Human T-lymphotropic
virus 1 and simian T-lymphotropic virus 1 are closely related and now
ranked as members of the same virus species: _Primate T-lymphotropic virus
1_. Likewise, Human T-lymphotropic virus 2 and simian T-lymphotropic 2
virus are ranked now as members of the same species: _Primate
T-lymphotropic virus 2. Recently, 2 more species have been identified in
the Cameroons (see: Primate T-lymphotropic viruses 3 & 4, human - Cameroon
20050226.0610). All 4 primate T-lymphotropic viruses, together with the
species bovine leukemia virus, make up the genus _Deltaretrovirus_, one of
the 7 genera that comprise the family of reverse-transcribing viruses know
as the _Retroviridae_.
The deltaretroviruses are transmitted horizontally, and no endogenous
counterparts are known. So far, they have been found only in bovines and
primates. They are associated with B- or T-cell leukemias or lymphomas, and
neurological disease (tropical spastic paraparesis or HTLV-associated
myopathy).
HTLV-1 was isolated 1st from a cell line derived from splenic cells taken
from a patient suffering from a hairy cell leukemia, now considered to be a
fortuitous association. No oncogene-containing members of the genus are
known. HTLV-2 is endemic among several Amerindian populations in North,
Central and South America. In industrialized countries, HTLV-2 is prevalent
among drug abusers and is spread by contaminated needles and by
heterosexual transmission. In the developing world, breast-feeding may be
the predominant route of transmission. Biologically, the HTLVs differ from
HIV in their greater genetic stability and their characteristic patterns of
geographic distribution.
Previously, it was thought that the present distribution of HTLV-2 in the
world reflected its possible introduction into the New world at the time of
the initial settlement of the American continent by the ancestors of the
present day native Americans some 20 000 to 40 000 years ago, followed by
more recent dissemination from one or a few centers. It seems more likely
now that all 4 primate T-lymphotropic viruses were transmitted to humans
from African primates. It is likely that HTLV-1 was introduced into Nunavut
Territory by a blood-borne or sexual route. - Mod.CP]
