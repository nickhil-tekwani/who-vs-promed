Two brothers in Hanoi's Soc Son District died of melioidosis, or Whitmore's disease, 2 weeks apart. On [28 Oct 2019], a 5-year-old boy, was admitted to the National Children's Hospital in the capital city [Hanoi] with high fever and stomachache. 3 days later he died of septic shock from a bloodstream infection. Doctors found out later that his death was caused by melioidosis, an infectious disease spread to humans through direct contact with contaminated water or [s]oil. Its symptoms include fever, pneumonia, abscesses, and inflammation of the brain and joints. The disease is frequently misdiagnosed as tuberculosis.

Half a month later, on [10 Nov 2019], the boy's little brother was brought to the hospital with similar symptoms when he was just 19 months old. He was conscious when he was admitted and was treated with antibiotics which slightly improved his condition. However, after 4 days, he also experienced a septic shock and died on [16 Nov 2019]. Doctors found that his death was also caused by melioidosis.

"All the results of medical examination of [the younger brother's] immune system and white blood cell functions showed no pathological abnormality", said Associate Professor Tran Minh Dien, deputy director of the hospital. "We will need to do a genetic analysis for a deeper diagnosis."

"In 30 years that I have been practicing, it is the 1st time I have seen 2 consecutive cases of melioidosis in the same family", said doctor Ta Anh Tuan, head of the hospital's Intensive Care Unit.

Previously, in April [2019], the family's eldest child, [a 7-year-old] was the 1st to die at the Saint Paul Hospital in the capital city, diagnosed with intestinal necrosis caused by bloodstream infection. Since she was not tested for melioidosis, it cannot be definitively stated that the disease caused her death as well.

Whitmore's disease is known to cause various types of infection, including pulmonary, localised, bloodstream, and disseminated infections, all of which [can be] fatal to patients. The disease's mortality rate is 40 percent.

"For this disease, treatments include up to 6 months of taking multiple antibiotics. There is currently no vaccine for it," said Trinh Thanh Trung, head of the Science and Technology Department of the Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology with the Viet Nam National University-Hanoi. "It peaks during the rainy season, from July to November."

Every year, Viet Nam diagnoses about 10 000 cases of melioidosis, around half of which prove fatal. Recently, many cases have been recorded in the provinces of Nghe An, Yen Bai, Thai Nguyen, and Ha Tinh.

[The finding of 2 fatal cases in one family suggests a genetic issue in the response to this infection, especially since neither child was known to have a clear risk factor. These, sometimes called inborn errors of immunity, are being more frequently described and likely explain why certain infections are more manifest in certain individuals over others. JL Casanova's work in this regard has been prolific. Examples include:

Lim HK, Huang SXL, Chen J, et al: Severe influenza pneumonitis in children with inherited TLR3 deficiency. J Exp Med. 2019; 216(9): 2038-56; http://jem.rupress.org/content/216/9/2038.long

This infection is found primarily in southeast Asia and the Northern Territory of Australia. Despite this, cases of melioidosis have been acquired in other parts of the world including the Americas. Flooding from the increasing number of severe tropical storms related to climate change is increasing.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials, and in fact, bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
