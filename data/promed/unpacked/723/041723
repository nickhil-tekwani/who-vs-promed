The Jakarta government will on Sunday launch a city-wide program to
exterminate _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, which are responsible for this
year's epidemic of dengue fever. The mosquito-borne disease has already
killed more than 30 people in the capital since January.
Deputy Governor of Public Welfare, Djailani, yesterday said he has met with
related institutions and are planing a program for mosquito control. He
said the program is urgently needed because of thousands of Jakarta
residents are suffering from dengue fever, while the number of those killed
by the disease is tipped to rise. The year's dengue fever epidemic is so
widespread the Jakarta government has had to ask the military to loan beds
to hospitals and public health clinics.
Head of South Jakarta Health Department, Sri Sudarmilah, blames this year's
epidemic of dengue fever on the public's lack of awareness. He said the
most important thing now is to stop the spread of dengue fever by
destroying all possible breeding places of mosquitoes.
Sudarmilah call on the city's residents to: (1) clean water tanks once
every week, (2) close water containers tightly, (3) replace water in flower
pots with new water daily, (4) fill up holes in their yards with sand or
cement, (5) throw away all cans [which] could collect rain water, and (6)
keep all laundry indoors as soon as it is dry.
The epidemic of dengue fever in the West Java capital of Bandung has this
year afflicted 85 people, of whom 4 have died, and experts predict the
death toll will increase.
Head of Epidemic Disease Eradication in Bandung, Nina Rehana, yesterday
said 17 people suffered from the disease in January, while the number rose
to 23 in February, and 45 in March. Data from the Bandung Health
Department shows that 208 people suffered from dengue fever last year,
while 973 cases were reported in 1996.
Rehana said the figure of 85 people suffering from the disease in the first
three months of this year is misleading, as many of the hospitals and
public health centers will not issue reports on dengue fever until later
this year. She predicts the dengue epidemic will peak over June and July.
Professor Suganda from Bandung's Hasan Sadikin Hospital says dozens of
children in the city are now suffering from dengue fever, although accurate
figures are yet to be released.
Research conducted in 1993 indicates that 60% of dengue fever cases are
transmitted at schools, 30% at residential areas, and 10% in offices.

[As this report was from a newspaper, Dr. Markon and ProMED-mail asks
whether anyone has information about the final statement above regarding
the rate of transmission in schools being 60%? Which dengue virus (or
viruses) is (are) circulating? Have the diagnoses been on clinical grounds
only? Are molecular epidemiologic methods being applied? - Mod.CHC]
