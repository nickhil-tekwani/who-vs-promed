[Reviewing reports for cases and positive environmental samples since 1 Jan 2021, there have been cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) confirmed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Liberia, Madagascar (cVDPV1), Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Yemen (cVDPV1). (cases associated with cVDPV2 in all but Madagascar and Yemen). Counties with no AFP confirmed cases but positive environmental samples (ES) for cVDPV2 include Egypt, Kenya, Somalia.

Interpretation: cVDPV transmission/circulation continues in 14 African countries, 4 Eastern Mediterranean region countries, and 1 European region country. While there were no positive AFP cases or positive environmental samples for WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1), it has only been 1 week since the last positive environmental sample in Pakistan was reported. (Poliomyelitis update (14): Global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2, cVDPV1) 20210708.8505008).

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at: https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One sees cases of cVDPV are in a band across Africa and in Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Nigeria (Kano), positive environmental samples
Date: Sat 10 Jul 2021

Kano State has recorded a fresh outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived polio type 2 (cVDPV2).

The State Commissioner for Health, Dr Aminu Ibrahim Tsayanwa who confirmed the development, added that 6 cases of the same circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus were discovered in Yobe State, while 5 were recorded in Jigawa State.

The commissioner, who spoke through the State Director of Public Health, Dr. Bashir Lawal stated that the cVDPV2 cases were discovered through experimentation of environmental sampling, not within human bodies as being experimented in the case of wild poliovirus.

He expressed concern that if adequate measures were not in place, the development may give birth to another round of wild polio virus infections and eventual retrieval of the country's polio free certificate.

[Nigeria continues to have circulation/transmission of the cVDPV2 viruses both in 2020 as well as continuing into 2021. The presence of positive environmental samples confirms the circulation of these viruses, and confirms the presence of pockets of population that are susceptible to polioviruses. Should a wild poliovirus be introduced into these areas, transmission would be likely as well.
