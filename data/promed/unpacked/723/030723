Cat deaths at temple indicates cat flu outbreak
-------------------------------------------
The initial probe into the deaths of several cats abandoned at a temple in Angthong province has revealed that they died of cat flu disease, a provincial livestock official said on Monday [3 Dec 2012].

Krissana Komonchan said the remaining cats at Wat Khao Kaew in Pho Thong district, which appeared to have symptoms, were given antibiotic injections. No cure is available for the disease and all that can be done is to treat the symptoms.

The official was speaking after visiting the temple Monday [3 Dec 2012] to check reports that felines abandoned at the temple had died of mysterious disease, possibly cat flu.

"The virus can spread quickly in the temple because there is no quarantine or separation of the sick animals."

Krissana said he would confirm the diagnoses by sending saliva and laboratory testing. The results of the tests are expected within 8 to 10 days.

A nun, who took care of the cats, had said there were previously about 200 cats at the temple but since last week, many had died at a rate of about 2 a day.

"Before they died, they would have sores on their bodies, coughs, runny noses, no appetite, and convulsions. If the disease hit a mother cat, it would claim the lives of the mother and the kittens," the nun said. She added the symptoms seemed to fit those of cat flu disease.

[The (rather confusing) term "cat flu" refers, in most cases, to feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR; a herpesvirus) and feline calicivirus (FCV) infections. Dual infections with these viruses are common; both are host-specific and pose no known human risk. They are known to occur worldwide.

The involvement of other pathogens, particularly FIV (Feline immunodeficiency virus), and also _Chlamydia psittaci_, _Mycoplasma spp_, and reoviruses deserve to be considered. Results of the epidemiological and laboratory investigations will be appreciated.
