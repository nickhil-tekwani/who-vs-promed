Raw fish causes fish tapeworm outbreak in Sao Paulo
--------------------
The city of Sao Paulo is experiencing an outbreak of an infection acquired
from the consumption of raw (sushi and sashimi), cured [smoked], or
incompletely cooked fish. From Mar 2004 through March 2005, there were 28
cases of Diphyllobothriasis [fish tapeworm infestation - Mod.MPP], a
disease transmitted by the parasite _Diphyllobothrium spp._ -- 18 of which
have occurred this year [2005].
In the period 1998 through 2004, the State had reported only 2 cases of the
disease, both in foreigners who had eaten raw fish outside of the
country. This is the 1st time that autochthonous cases have been reported
in Brazil.
In South America, cases have been confirmed in Chile, Peru, and Argentina.
The principal symptoms of the disease are pain and abdominal discomfort,
flatulence, and diarrhea. There can also be associated vomiting, weight
loss, and megaloblastic anemia, since the parasite absorbs vitamin B-12
from the host. Only 20 percent of those infected are symptomatic.
This week, the Center for Epidemiologic Surveillance (CVE) of the State
Secretariat of Health (Sao Paulo) will publish a notice which recommends
the freezing of fish that will be consumed raw for a minimum of 24 hours at
negative18 degrees Centigrade, in order to contain the outbreak. This
recommendation is similar to that made by the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) of
the United States.
But the epidemiologic surveillance unit itself admitted that freezing alone
may not prevent the outbreak of the disease, because it hasn't been
scientifically proven that the low temperature kills or inactivates the
parasite. "We still do not know if the application of this recommendation
will bring results. This is an attempt to block the evolution of this
important outbreak", said the Director of CVE, Carolos Magno Fortaleza.
Japanese restaurants affirmed that the freezing [of the fish] is routinely
practiced and that it doesn't influence the flavor of the dishes. Fortaleza
said that restaurants should not be held responsible for the outbreak,
because it is impossible to identify the parasite visually. The Folha
learned that ANVISA (The National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance) also
prepared a resolution to develop norms for the importation and consumption
of raw fish.
The principal suspect remains salmon, because it has been related [to this
disease] in the literature and it is found, along with robalo [_Centropomus
undecimalis_, a large serranoid food fish found on both coasts of America,
also variously known as sea pike, garfish, cobia, and Spanish bass] as the
principal host of the parasite. Today, salmon is the only imported fish --
principally from Chile -- used in the production of sushi and sashimi.
However it still hasn't been demonstrated that [salmon] is responsible for
the outbreak in Sao Paulo. Technicians from epidemiologic surveillance are
collecting specimens of salmon in order to localize the parasite, but they
have not discarded the possibility that a species of fish from Sao Paulo or
from [elsewhere] on the Brazilian coast is contaminated.
The worm lives in the musculature of the fish (in the case of salmon, in
the nerves). After having been consumed raw, it affixes itself in the
intestines, where it can live up to 10 years and achieve a length of 10
meters. The alert on the outbreak was made by the Fleury laboratory,
responsible for 24 of the 28 reports. According to the clinical
pathologist Jorge Luiz Mello Sampaio, the infected persons mentioned they
had eaten sushi and sashimi in different regions of the city, suggesting
that there isn't a single focus of transmission.
Some asymptomatic patients, including children, become aware of the
infection when they observe pieces of the parasite in their feces. Scared,
they go for an exam, which then proves they have the disease. The names of
the restaurants frequented by the patients have already been given to the
surveillance authorities, who have been conducting a survey of the species,
the suppliers, and the origins [of the fish involved]. Treatment is a
single dose of praziquantel. The physician recommendation is also that
blood tests be conducted to see whether there is anemia, and if so, to
treat the anemia.

[_Diphyllobothrium latum_, the fish or broad tapeworm, is a parasite of
freshwater fish and needs a freshwater crustacean as its intermediate host.
It is therefore not found in strictly saltwater fish. The proglottids
(segments) of the tapeworm may be mistaken for segments from other human
tapeworms, including _Taenia saginata_ (beef tapeworm) or _Taenia solium_
(pork tapeworm) unless examined by experts. The present report does not
unequivocally identify the parasite as _Diphyllobothrium latum_. - Mod.EP]
