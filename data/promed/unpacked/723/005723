The rotting bodies of about 6000 pigs in a river that supplies tap water to Shanghai has drawn attention to an ugly truth -- China's pig farms are often riddled with disease and one way or another, sick animals often end up in the food chain.

Authorities have found traces of a common pig virus in some of the animals floating in the Huangpu River this week, and industry insiders say farmers likely dumped them, common in an industry which has no system of compensation for losses from disease.

"There is no mechanism by which, whenever diseases are found among pigs, the government compensates pig breeders so as to control the spread of diseases or compensate pig breeders for losses," said Feng Yonghui, general manager at pig-industry research organisation Soozhu.com. To make matters worse, Feng said insurance companies were unwilling to insure pig breeders because the risks were so high.

On Wednesday [13 Mar 2013], workers on barges and on the riverbank used pitchforks to drag bloated dead pigs out of the river.

Pork is China's staple meat and the swine population is the world's largest at 475 million head at the end of last year [2012].

At market, margins on pork are thin and for hog farmers unwilling to spend money to incinerate or bury dead animals, the Huangpu River may have offered a tempting alternative.

While there was no proof any sick animals had been butchered and sold for meat in this case, media have reported several scandals involving sick or dead livestock being butchered and sold for meat.

Early this year [203], state media accused a supplier of chicken to KFC and McDonald's of selling them sick poultry. The supplier denied it.

While authorities have not confirmed a disease, or the death of unusually large numbers of pigs, talk of pigs dying would seem to suggest an outbreak of some sort.

One farmer in the Jiaxing [Zhejiang province] area near Shanghai, said about 30 per cent of his pigs had died of disease since January [2013].

Reuters witnesses visited 3 reeking swine disposal pits in Jiaxing which appeared to have been just filled up and had signs saying they were at capacity.

Dumping pigs in a river is not unheard of. "We don't think it is individual case. Many similar cases were just not reported," said Wang Xiaoyue, an analyst with Beijing Orient Agri-business Consultant Co Ltd.

An unidentified Jiaxing farmer had admitted to dumping dead pigs, the Xinhua state news agency said in a report on xinhuanet.com. The news agency also cited a pollution control official as saying some 7000 to 8000 pigs had died every month over the past few months in a pig-raising village.

[Another] villager said there were always pigs in the Huangpu, and aside from the number, the only difference this week was that authorities were clearing them out along with the trash. "Before, they just cleared out the garbage," she said.

Rather than blaming the farmers, Lin Rongquan, a veterinary health expert in Shanghai, pointed the finger of blame at the local government, a major link in the chain of agencies overseeing farms.

"It's definitely the problem of the local government, which should bear the main responsibility. They do not regulate the pig business well," he said.

On Sunday [10 Mar 2013], the central government unveiled restructuring plans aimed at improving efficiency and cutting out graft. The changes came as parliament sat in Beijing for a session at which complaints of corruption and red tape were common.

The restructuring included bundling the responsibilities of several agencies into a ministerial-level General Administration of Food and Drug in response to the scandals.

Analyst Wang said that should help but it would not change things overnight given the problems from feed additives, the use of antibiotics and pollution. "It's a tough job to improve things," he said.

Many people took to the internet to complain. Others sought solace in grim humour. In one joke posted online, a Beijing resident boasts about the air pollution in the capital, saying if he wanted a smoke, he just had to open the window. A Shanghai resident retorts: "That's nothing, when we turn on the tap, we get free rib soup."

The rotting bodies of nearly 6000 pigs in a river that provides 22 per cent of Shanghai's tap water has sparked panic as well as satire among Chinese people.

A total of 5916 dead pigs had been fished out from Huangpu River as of Wednesday afternoon [13 Mar 2012], the Shanghai Municipal Government's press office said.

Despite authorities' claims that the river water was not contaminated and Shanghai's tap water was safe, laboratory tests found porcine circovirus in one water sample. The virus can spread among pigs though not to human beings.

Public reaction toward the scandal has turned from panic and anger to satire during the past week. While studious Shanghai residents carried out their own water quality tests and posted results online to show tap water was dirty and unsafe, many others joked about the scandal.

"Life is happy in Shanghai: we simply turn on the faucet and oops, here comes fresh pork soup," read a posting on the web. It has been forwarded so many times that it is impossible to locate the author.

Web users described the dead pig scandal as "Life of Pig". An anonymous netizen even photoshopped the poster of Ang Lee's Oscar-winning "Life of Pi" by adding dozens of pig carcasses in and around Pi's lifeboat.

The source of the dead pigs remained a mystery until a hog farm in Jiaxing City in neighboring Zhejiang Province, confessed Wednesday [13 Mar 2013] to dumping carcasses into the Huangpu River.

Though Jiaxing was widely suspected to be the source of the dead animals and local media reports said at least 20 000 pigs died of a sudden illness earlier this year [2013], the city government was steadfast until Tuesday [12 Mar 2013] that the dead pigs could not be traced to Jiaxing and no swine epidemic had been reported there.

Jiaxing authorities said 70 000 pigs died this year from abrupt changes of farming techniques and climate conditions, but insisted there had been no swine epidemic breakout.

Coincidentally, on Wednesday [13 Mar 2013], a court in Wenling city, also in Zhejiang, sentenced 46 people to jail terms ranging from 6 months to 6.5 years for processing and selling pork from diseased pigs from 2010 to 2012.

In Wenling's pork safety campaign, beginning in April 2012, authorities seized more than 6000 kg [about 13 300 lb] of pork products that tested positive for various viruses.

Some meat processing companies are notorious for producing ham, bacon, and sausages with pork from diseased pigs. "We should be happy they dumped the dead pigs into the river instead of putting the meat on our table," a Shanghai resident said in a posting on weibo.com. "Dead pig" was among the top 3 most searched words or phrases at the Twitter-like microblogging service this week.

Farm animals that die of illness are often collected for free incineration or burial. Local governments in Jiaxing offer pig farmers an allowance of 80 yuan [about USD 13] for every dead pig.

A decades-old practice for hog farmers, however, has been to dump carcasses into rivers or on rural roads.

In Jiaxing's Nanhu district, Xinhua reporters saw dead pigs being dumped near an incineration site that had been closed at the end of the day. "The hog farmer was in a hurry to rid the dead animals and just didn't care what nuisance it would be for others," said an unnamed villager.

When pigs die of diseases, their keepers often dump the carcasses into the river, fearing others might find out about the disease and refuse to buy the animals from the farm, said a pig farmer in Xinfeng township of Nanhu district.

In the past when there were few pig farms, the carcasses were quickly eaten by fish and shrimps. "Nowadays, there are so many farms and dead pigs in the river becomes a serious environmental issue," he said.

Jiaxing has more than 100 000 pig farms that raise 7 million pigs. Annual pig sales total 4.5 million, half of which are sold to Shanghai.

The city has to dispose of 210 000 dead pigs each year, if calculated at the average death rate of 3 per cent, said Yu Hongwei, deputy chief of the city's environmental protection bureau.

"More pigs have died so far this year [2013], as a result of cold weather, pollution, and negligence -- as pork has not sold as well as before," said one of the biggest pig farmers in the town, with 1000 on her family farm in Caoqiao township of Pinghu district.

"The death rate is particularly high among piglets, as many farmers think they are underpriced and use fodder and disinfectants very sparingly," she said.

Pigs in Caoqiao township are mostly sold to Shanghai. "There are so many pig farms that it stinks. Pig soil paves rural roads and dead animals are everywhere."

Jiaxing city authorities had planned to reduce the number of farm pigs to 2 million by 2015, but the move was widely criticized as it may affect pork supplies and cause price hikes in the Shanghai-centered Yangtze River Delta.

Despite the satire surrounding the incident pig farmers are facing problems.

Around 50 pig carcasses were today [13 Mar 2013] discovered in a tributary of the Yangtze River in Yichang City, Hubei Province, China Central Television reported.

Some of the bodies were highly decomposed, said the report. The carcasses were spotted floating near Wulong Village.

The local government has launched an investigation and dispatched officials to the scene.

The news has attracted much public attention as it follows the discovery of thousands of dead pigs in Shanghai's Huangpu River, a branch of the Yangtze. By late yesterday [12 Mar 2013], almost 6000 pig carcasses had been fished out of the river and an investigation into where they came from is ongoing.

[It is not clear if the Hubei event is regarded as related to the one(s) reported earlier from Zhejlang and Jiangsu. Clarification would be helpful.

The huge improvements still needed in addressing China's environmental pollution, animal health, and food safety issues are long known. It remains to hope that the mega-state's leaders will manage to utilise the new unfolding crisis as another leverage for advancing that goal. - Mod.AS
