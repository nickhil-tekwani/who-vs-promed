A 29-year-old woman from Sweet Grass County was hospitalized in Billings
with [a hantavirus [infection, state health officials reported Monday.
She is the 13th Montanan stricken with the disease since it was identified
in 1993. Three of the first 12 victims died.
The patient was diagnosed [as having hantavirus pulmonary syndrome = HPS
over the weekend, said Jim Murphy, health specialist for the state
Department of Public Health and Human Services. She was in intensive care
at St. Vincent Hospital in Billings on Monday in very serious condition,
Murphy said. Investigators have not yet determined how she was infected.
The most recent previous case of [HPS in Montana was a 33-year-old Custer
County man who was hospitalized late in March in Miles City. HPS is a
severe respiratory infection spread by urine, feces or saliva [from
infected rodents. People typically become sick about two weeks after
breathing virus particles stirred up in a rodent-infested space, such as
when sweeping a mouse nest out of a barn or cabin.
More than four of every 10 people who contract the virus die, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
