The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is warning Americans about the risks of "medical tourism" after nearly 24 US residents contracted serious infections related to cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic.

The 21 people affected were all women who underwent surgeries including liposuction, tummy tucks, butt implants, and breast reduction at one of 5 clinics in the Dominican Republic in 2013. In the process, they were infected with rapidly growing _Mycobacteria_, organisms that thrive in dirty water and may enter the body during a procedure in an unsterile environment.

The bacteria caused an oozing skin condition that in some cases did not completely heal even 9 months after their surgeries, according to a CDC study released [Wed 13 Jul 2016] [1].

Each year, between 75 000 and 750 000 US residents travel abroad to receive medical services. Although little is known about medical tourism, it's on the rise, primarily because health care is much cheaper in parts of the developing world like Latin America and South Asia. But regulation of health care facilities abroad is a patchwork at best. "People traveling for medical care need to be informed of its risks," said Dr Douglas Esposito, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC's Travelers' Health Branch and a lead author of the study. "There are many unknowns overseas ... in how they deal with infection."

_Mycobacteria_ are also notoriously resistant to most antibacterial drugs, making them "complex and complicated" to treat, said Esposito. Once painful swellings surfaced on their skin, the women were treated with a prolonged course of antibacterial drugs (in some cases, more than 5 different drugs) and surgical procedures to drain fluid from infected tissue or remove implants.

13 patients had been to the same clinic in the Dominican Republic, which was referred to as "clinic A" in the study. Only one reported full recovery 9 months after the surgery. For more than half the patients, getting treatment was also a financial burden -- either in direct medical costs or in the inability to work.

Part of the problem is that standards of care are not global. Some international organizations inspect and certify health care facilities outside the US, but none of the cosmetic surgery clinics in the Dominican Republic were accredited by those organizations.

An abdominoplasty -- a surgery to remove belly flesh that more than half the women underwent -- costs around USD 1500 to USD 2000 in the Dominican Republic, about 1/3 what it costs in the US, according to one study.

For the 21 women, however, saving money was not their sole motivation. Most of them were either born in the Dominican Republic, or had family or friends there who told them about the clinic where they had surgeries.

The infections were first detected when 2 women in Maryland went to their physician in 2013 with infected abscesses. They revealed that an acquaintance in Massachusetts had "similar problems" after getting cosmetic surgery at the same clinic.

Rapidly growing mycobacterial infection is not a "nationally notifiable" disease, which means that it is not usually reported to a federal body like the CDC. But the concerned physician notified the Maryland Department of Health, triggering a nationwide investigation to find patients who may have contracted similar infections in the Dominican Republic. The country's Ministry of Health reported that clinic A, where the majority of the women had surgeries, has since closed.

[Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are acid-fast bacilli that are part of a grouping separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html). NTM differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation and rapid molecular diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. Pigmented, intermediately growing NTM include _M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_. Slowly growing NTM include _M. kansasii_ and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex.

NTM are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, that can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of drinking water distribution systems, constituting a risk for certain patients both by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. Water from these systems can also contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. In immunocompromised patients, RGM also cause disseminated infection.

ProMED-mail previously reported on outbreaks of RGM disease occurring after cosmetic surgery performed in the Dominican Republic: in 2003-2004, an outbreak of soft tissue infection caused by _M. abscessus_ following cosmetic surgery performed at various clinics in the Dominican Republic involved 12 Americans (ProMED-mail post Mycobacterium abscessus - USA ex Dominican Republic (03) 20040621.1650; Mycobacterium abscessus - USA ex Dominican Republic (02) 20040504.1225; and Mycobacterium abscessus - USA ex Dominican Republic 20040501.1200).

The report above is likely that of an outbreak of post-operative wound infections that was posted by ProMED-mail in 2014: the outbreak at the time of the post involved 19 Americans who had traveled to the Dominican Republic for cosmetic surgery. 14 of these infections were caused by _M. abscessus_ and _M. fortuitum (ProMED-mail post Mycobacterium abscessus - USA (02): nosocomial non-TB mycobact, history 20140724.2631091). - Mod.ML
