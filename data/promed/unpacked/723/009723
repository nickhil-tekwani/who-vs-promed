Re: Rabies, animal - Israel (03): dog mediated, vaccinated animals
------------------------------------------------------------------
I refer to the following statement in the above posting, concerning
the applicability of oral rabies vaccine baits (I assume designed for
foxes and/or jackals) in dogs:

"The bait, however, is considered too small to be effective among
dogs. Canines swallow rather than chew the [bait], depriving the
vaccine of [making] the required contact with the mouth and throat
tissues."

Hasn't an effective oral bait been designed for use in dogs? Seems to
me that if the above is a significant issue, it should be very
feasible to develop an attractive, 'elongated' or rope-like,
dog-adapted bait that needs to be vigorously chewed before swallowing.

There are an awful lot of wild, feral and/or free-roaming dogs in many
areas of the world where canine-adapted strains of rabies circulate
that should benefit from a dog-adapted oral vaccine bait -- Africa,
the Indian sub-continent and parts of Indonesia (Bali, Flores) spring
immediately to mind in that regard. There are also quite a few
canine-adapted rabies-free places where there are sizable populations
of wild, feral and free-roaming canines, that should benefit greatly
from ready access to an important rapid response, or a vaccination
buffer to protect their status (e.g., North America, Western Europe,
UK, Australia, the main islands of Papua New Guinea including the West
Papua Province of Indonesia, etc.).

[Dr Thomson raises an interesting and debatable issue. Though trials
in vaccinating stray dogs have been performed throughout the years in
several countries (e.g., Tunisia, Guatemala, India; see references),
so far no effective bait for dogs, compatible with the baits developed
and widely, effectively applied for wildlife, has been developed or is
commercially available.

The following abstract, from a paper by researchers in the Kimron
Veterinary Institute, Israel (Ref 5) may help clarifying the issue:

"Since 1956, red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) and golden jackals (_Canis
aureus_) have been the primary vectors maintaining wildlife rabies in
Israel. Oral rabies vaccination of wild canids, initiated in 1998,
resulted in near-elimination of the disease in wildlife by 2005. In
2005 and 2006, an outbreak of rabies was observed in stray dogs in the
vaccinated area of the Golan Heights, with no cases in foxes or
jackals. Epidemiological investigations showed that the infected dogs
were from territories across the border. This was confirmed by
molecular analysis, which showed that the virus was different from
rabies isolates endemic to this area. The objective of this study was
to determine bait acceptance and the feasibility of oral rabies
vaccination in packs of livestock guardian dogs.

"Coated sachets and fishmeal polymer baits of Raboral V-RG (Merial,
USA) were tested in 5 different test zones. Both formats were hand-fed
to individual dogs and to dogs belonging to dog packs. Bait uptake and
consumption were observed in each dog. The estimated efficacy of oral
rabies vaccination was very low (a maximum of 28 percent). Vaccine
delivery problems were observed in dogs belonging to packs, whereby
dominant animals consumed multiple baits and in competitive situations
baits were swallowed whole. The uncertainty of oral vaccination
necessitated turning to other methods to control this outbreak: stray
dogs were removed and herd dogs were vaccinated parenterally. This
study showed that oral rabies vaccination of dogs in packs using baits
designed for wildlife would not be effective. Possibly, different
baits or steps to circumvent competition within the pack will make
this approach feasible."

On top of the technical failure of the available (wildlife-targeted)
baits in effectively vaccinating dogs, it remains to be questioned if
vaccinating stray dogs is the optimal solution to the issue,
universally. Where stray dogs are the main rabies vector, forming the
major or sole canid population within the territory to be protected,
their mass vaccination is desirable, even essential. However, in
industrialised, developed countries, where the majority of dogs are
owned, and most likely registered and vaccinated if so prescribed by
the prevailing rabies situation, the very establishment and existence
of a stray dog population, including free-roaming packs of susceptible
dogs, should be prevented. The territory will be effectively defended
from new intruders by domestic dogs, including properly vaccinated
working dogs.
