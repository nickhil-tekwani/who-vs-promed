The department of veterinary services yesterday said it has managed to
contain the anthrax outbreak that killed several cattle 3 weeks ago in some
parts of the country.
The department's principal director, Dr Stuart Hargreaves, said the
situation was now under control in the affected districts that included
Buhera and Chivhu. "We embarked on a massive programme of vaccinating
livestock in the affected areas and now this programme has been completed,"
he said.
The department, Dr Hargreaves said, had enough stocks of anthrax vaccine to
deal with any future outbreaks.
The veterinary chief said the department was fully alert as anthrax
outbreaks were more likely during the rainy season. He urged farmers to
report any suspected cases of anthrax in livestock to their nearest
veterinary offices and in the same vein warned the public to desist from
eating uninspected meat or slaughtering sick animals. Such animals could
have been suffering from anthrax.
Any major climatic change such as severe drought or heavy rainfall leads to
an outbreak of the disease, as the anthrax spores would be exposed to
livestock.

[This appears to be a different set of outbreaks from the ongoing problems
in Masvingo of previous years (see below). Though Dr Hargreaves sounds
optimistic it is clear from his comments that any vaccinations will be
reactive and not proactive in areas of known high risk. - Mod.MHJ]
