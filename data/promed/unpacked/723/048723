Comments
--------
Three facts are important to mention:
1) I donÂ´t trust seroconversion [data in a mobile population as an
indicator of regional distribution of a vectorborne disease [VBD, taking
into account that Austria, which in some parts is (hyper)endemic for
tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), is one of the main destinations for German
people spending their holidays.
2) The increase of TBE virus in ticks may also be due to the fact that
there is the possibility of vertical transmission (the mother infects the
eggs) resulting in a multiplication of infected vectors after some time.
3)There are 2 very good vaccines (in 4 formulations, an adult and a
children's vaccine in each case) now on the market; one from Baxter Immuno
(FSME immun; FSME is the abbreviation for the German word for
spring-summer-meningoencephalitis, which in fact is not true, since we see
increasing figures in fall as well), the other from Chiron Behring
(Encepur). Both vaccines show high protection rates/efficacy and (very) low
rates of side affects in the actual formulation (standard vaccination: 0, 1
month, 1 year). The Chiron Behring vaccine was also the first to be
registered for an accelerated vaccination schedule (good immunity after 2
shots within 7 days, a third shot scheduled after 3-4 weeks, and the last
dose after one year).
