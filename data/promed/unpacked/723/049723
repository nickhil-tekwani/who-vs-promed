In a recent paper published in Virology Journal, we have reported that
the infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) responsible for the
ongoing ISA outbreaks in Chile was introduced from Norway several
years before the 1st reported outbreak in June 2007 and probably
circulated undetected for more than 10 years in the huge Chilean
Atlantic salmon industry.

An extensive comparative analysis -- including phylogenetic analyses
of ISAV fusion and haemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein sequence data
of a large number of ISAV isolates from Chile and of reference
isolates from Canada, Faroe Islands, Norway, Scotland, and USA --
suggests that the original virus was introduced from Norway around
1996, probably on a very small scale into one specific location,
following which a few years later the virus was disseminated into the
Chilean Atlantic salmon industry.

Most likely, the introduction involved ISAV isolates of Chile Strain
1, and the wide dissemination in the industry occurred around 2005
coincident with a recombination event (insertion event) in the ISAV
fusion protein gene, 2 years before the index case in June 2007. The
paper, which is published in the current issue of the Virology Journal
and is available at <http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/88>, is the
1st comprehensive report tracing ISAV from Europe to South America.
