NewsWatch 12 has learned that Jackson County is dealing with an _E. coli_ outbreak. 15 people across Jackson County have been infected with _E.coli_ including 10 people who have been hospitalized.

Jackson County Public Health has told NewsWatch 12 that some of the hospitalizations include several children. "A couple of children are at OHSU [Oregon Health & Science University] are receiving emergency treatment," said Dr Jim Shames. "We need citizens to be aware that serious diarrhea or bloody diarrhea should be reported to their health care provider."

Jackson County Public Health says they are still trying to figure out where the _E. coli_ outbreak is coming from, but right now they do believe the outbreak to be localized in the county.

[Although it is not specifically stated, a cluster of illnesses blamed on _E. coli_ certainly suggests that enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is at work here, either the prototypic serotype O157:H7 or one of the other Shiga-toxin-producing serotypes. ProMED awaits more information about this outbreak.

EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food; the disease can also be transmitted when people drink or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock, wild animals, or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.

Jackson County is in southwest Oregon. Medford is the county seat. - Mod.LL
