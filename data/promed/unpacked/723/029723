[2] Canada: 1st H7N9 flu case in North America

B.C. woman diagnosed with 1st H7N9 flu case in North America
----------------------------------------------------
A British Columbia resident has been diagnosed with the 1st case of H7N9 avian flu in North America, according to health authorities.

The individual, a Metro Vancouver woman who has not been identified, recently returned from China, where nearly 500 human infections with this strain of bird flu have occurred since 2013.

Health officials said the woman was not travelling in a high-risk area in China and did not show symptoms until 14 Jan 2015, 2 days after she returned to Canada. She has been placed in self-isolation in hospital since returning. How she contracted the virus is not known. Her husband, who was traveling with her, was also suspected of contracting the virus. He has since recovered. Others who have had contact with the patient are being monitored for signs of avian flu, but none have fallen ill.

Officials said the couple was on a guided tour for part of their trip to China, but traveled on their own the rest of the time.

The H7N9 strain of avian flu can lead to symptoms of "severe respiratory illness, with about 1/3rd resulting in death," according to the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Public Health Canada said there is no evidence to show that the disease can be transmitted person-to-person and that so far in the investigation, "it seems that people are getting sick from close contact with infected birds."

The news comes about a month after an outbreak of H5N2 avian influenza at several Fraser Valley farms that led to tens of thousands of birds being euthanized.

[Although this is the 1st importation of H7N9 into North America, avian flu H5N1 was imported into Canada in 2014. To date, the H7N9 strain has not been detected in birds [or poultry] in Canada. The mild nature of the Canadian case(s) suggests milder cases may go unreported in China.

As of 26 Jan 2015, the Hong Kong government has reported 495 cases (not including the new case from Canada).
