The deputy minister of health of Uzbekistan denied any cases of
poliomyelitis in the country that were reported previously. He said that
since the beginning of this year [2010] there had been 23 AFP [acute
flaccid paralysis] cases in the country but none of them were linked to
polio after laboratory testing. He underlined that the local WHO office did
not disseminate information about polio cases in Uzbekistan. Concerning the
AFP cases, he said, all were etiologically different entities. He added
that WHO experts, who came to Uzbekistan recently, appreciated the
infectious diseases prevention activities in the country.

An outbreak of AFP caused by wild type polio was registered in the
Tajikistan territory neighboring with Uzbekistan. 12 out of 170 cases died.
There were several tens of confirmed polio cases [according to the most
recent WHO report, there were 32 cases confirmed (see Poliomyelitis -
worldwide (06): Tajikistan, WHO 20100502.1423]. Previously WHO reported
that there were several AFP cases in the territory of Uzbekistan, but it
added that the laboratory confirmation was not achieved.

[The newswire above theoretically provides the laboratory results on the
previously mentioned 3 cases of AFP identified in Uzbekistan that the media
had reported at the same time as reporting the outbreak of wild poliovirus
type 1 in Tajikistan (see Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (04): Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan susp 20100424.1319). AFP surveillance has been crucial in
identification of polio cases. There are many causes of AFP, one of which
is infection with a poliovirus. An indicator of good AFP surveillance in a
country is a non-polio annual AFP rate for children less than 15 years of
age greater than or equal to one per 100 000 population. In 2008, the
non-polio AFP rate for Uzbekistan was reported as 1.2 per 100 000
population (see
<http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/globalsummary/IndicatorTS_Result.cfm>:
from this page you may have to go back to the selection form, find the
country and year, and select the right indicator from a rather long list).

Uzbekistan had an estimated population of 27.6 million in July 2009, 28.1
per cent of which are under 14 years of age: to achieve a non-polio AFP
rate of 1 or greater, one would expect at least 276 AFP cases reported
during the course of the year.
