Another kindergarten was closed yesterday to stem the spread of hand,
foot and mouth disease (HFMD). On Sun 23 Jul 2006, a seriously ill
7-month-old baby boy was transferred from Bintulu hospital to the
better-equipped Sibu hospital for treatment. Yesterday 40 cases were
reported yesterday, bringing the total in the last 2 days to 104.
A total of 18 of the victims -- 9 on Sunday and another 9 yesterday
-- were admitted to hospital. The number of admissions had also risen
sharply since the so-called "2nd Wave" of the outbreak began in May 2006.
The kindergarten ordered closed for the mandatory 2 weeks yesterday
was the Ming Eng Methodist Kindergarten in Bintulu. On 12 Jul 2006, 2
Miri kindergartens, Prasekolah SK Senadin and Tadika T&W, were the
first to be ordered shut. Sedidik Muara Tebas was ordered closed on
19 Jul while the Methodist kindergarten in Marudi and SK Gayu in
Padawan here were closed 20 Jul 2006.

[Previous reports indicated that the agent responsible for this
escalating outbreak of HFMD in Sarawak is enterovirus 71, which
historically has been responsible for causing a higher frequency of
serious complications than other agents (see ProMED-mail references
below). The medical authorities in Sarawak believe that a "2nd wave"
of infection has been initiated and the outbreak is unlikely to
resolve in the immediate future. ProMED-mail would appreciate
receiving a comment from those in the area on the basis for the "2nd
wave" phenomenon.
