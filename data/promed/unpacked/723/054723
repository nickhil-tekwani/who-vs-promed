[1] Vaccines: Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause
[A] CDC panel
Date: Wed 14 Apr 2021

https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/cdc-panel-adjourns-without-vote-on-extending-j-26j-covid-vaccine-pause/ar-BB1fEPuB?ocid=uxbndlbing


A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee did not vote Wednesday [14 Apr 2021] on whether to extend the nation's pause on Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, after experts on the panel argued there was still insufficient data to make final recommendations in light of the serious, rare blood-clotting events potentially linked to the shots.

While the CDC's current pause on Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is not binding, the warning issued by federal health officials on Tuesday [13 Apr 2021] urged that vaccinations be suspended only until the panel voted on "updated recommendations" for using the vaccine. In response to the FDA and CDC advisory on the pause, all states and D.C. and Puerto Rico have opted to temporarily stop administering this vaccine. The CDC has yet to decide on a date to resume the panel's discussion on the topic.

"Your input today was incredibly helpful in terms of helping inform our work over the next week," said Dr. Amanda Cohn, the agency's designated federal officer for the advisory committee. "To be very frank, I do not want to vote on this issue today [Wed 14 Apr 2021]," Dr. Beth Bell, a member of the panel and a former top CDC infectious diseases official, told the committee.
"I just don't feel that was enough information to make an evidence-based decision. We won't have all the information, but I think there are some things that we can gather relatively quickly, which all have to do with the benefit risk balance," added Dr. Bell.

A work group within the panel said it had discussed a range of options this week, including recommending using the vaccine only for specific groups of people or abandoning the shot altogether, but concluded that they needed more data on these and other possible cases that could be reported.

White House officials have said the pause in Johnson & Johnson vaccinations was likely to impact the nationwide vaccination campaign in "the very short term," but have insisted supply from Pfizer and Moderna is sufficient to meet their goals.

Ongoing trials of the single-shot vaccine have been stopped in the wake of the original pause. Rollouts abroad of the vaccine were also disrupted following the recommendation, as well as key programs launched by state and local authorities in the U.S. to use the shots to vaccinate harder-to-reach communities.

"We are in a situation where not making a decision is tantamount to making a decision. Any extension of the pause will invariably result in the fact that the most vulnerable individuals in the United States, who were prime candidates for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, will remain vulnerable," Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told the committee.

Representatives of both Johnson & Johnson, Food and Drug Administration, and CDC officials made presentations to the committee, outlining a handful of new details on the cases known so far.

[B] Risk of increasing vaccine hesitancy
Date: Tue 13 Apr 2021, updated 9:16 a.m. ET 15 Apr 2021

States began halting use of Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine Tuesday [13 Apr 2021] after federal health officials recommended a pause "out of an abundance of caution" because of rare but dangerous blood clots. California, New York, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Florida were among more than a dozen states to almost immediately follow the guidance from the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Jeff Zients, White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said the pause would have little impact on vaccine availability. The U.S will have enough Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for 300 million Americans by end of July [2021], he said.

"We're prepared for a wide range of scenarios," Zients said at a White House briefing. "We have plenty of supply to continue our vaccination program and hit our goals."

More than 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been administered in the U.S. CDC and FDA are reviewing data involving 6 reported U.S. cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot -- cerebral venous sinus thrombosis -- in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine, the statement said. All 6 cases were among women 18-48, and symptoms occurred 6-13 days after vaccination.

One of the 6 patients died, and another was in critical condition, officials said. FDA chief Janet Woodcock said no definitive cause had been determined, but that it appears to be an extremely rare immune response. Officials said such clots are treated differently from other clots, and that incorrect treatment could cause death.

The pause is an example of a "double-edged sword in public health interventions," said Ogbonnaya Omenka, an associate professor and public health specialist at Butler University in Indianapolis. "The decision is indicative of vigilance and swiftness of action, which are both necessary for effectively dealing with public health threats," he told USA Today. "At the same time, there is a risk of the decision feeding into the already existing vaccine hesitancy. ... Nevertheless, this step is in the interest of the public, because it is the duty of the authorities involved to be safe instead of sorry."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported after vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca), a recombinant chimpanzee adenoviral vector encoding the spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1,2]. To date, such reactions have not been associated with other vaccines against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). We describe a case of extensive thrombosis associated with severe thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation that resembled autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [3] in a patient who had received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen), a recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.

A 48-year-old White woman with an unremarkable medical history presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of malaise and abdominal pain. The initial evaluation at another hospital showed mild anemia and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 13 000 per cubic millimeter [reference range, 150 000 to 400 000]). A peripheral-blood smear confirmed a marked reduction in the platelet count with occasional schistocytes. Additional studies showed a low fibrinogen level (89 mg per deciliter [reference range, 220 to 397]), a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (41 seconds [reference range, 25 to 37]), and a marked elevation in the d-dimer level (117.5 mg per liter [reference value, less than 0.5]), indicating a disseminated intravascular coagulation-like state. (A complete listing of the patient's laboratory values is provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMc2105869/suppl_file/nejmc2105869_appendix.pdf.) Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed extensive splanchnic-vein thrombosis.

The patient was transferred to our institution. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay of a sample obtained with a nasopharyngeal swab. Head CT that was performed after a report of new-onset headache showed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis involving the right transverse and straight sinuses. The administration of unfractionated heparin was initiated, but despite this treatment, the patient had progressive thrombosis with hemorrhagic stroke evident on magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography of the brain. Repeat CT angiography showed new thrombus involving the right hepatic and splenic veins.

On further inquiry, it was noted that the patient had received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 14 days before symptom onset. The screening test for antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin by latex-enhanced immunoassay was negative. However, the result of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies against PF4-polyanion was strongly positive (2.550 optical-density units [upper limit of normal range, less than or equal to 0.399). Heparin was switched to argatroban. She also received intravenous immune globulin at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of ideal body weight (as calculated according to the actual weight [112 kg] and height [168 cm] of the patient) for 2 days. This treatment was followed by an increase in the platelet count from 30 000 to 145 000 during a 5-day period. The patient remained critically ill at the time of this report.

In a recent study, Greinacher and colleagues [1] (one of whom, Theodore Warkentin, provided valuable advice regarding this patient) found that vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia was associated with IgG antibodies that recognize PF4 and activate platelets through their Fc-gamma receptors. Inhibition of platelet activation by intravenous immune globulin paralleled its efficacy in the treatment of autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [4].

We note with interest that during the clinical evaluation of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, a 25-year-old man was found to have symptomatic transverse sinus thrombosis beginning 19 days after vaccination. Although the case investigation and expert opinion deemed this event to be unrelated to the vaccine [5], this finding may require reevaluation in light of our patient's clinical course. Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are messenger RNA-based, the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines are nonreplicating adenovirus vector-based DNA vaccines. Our case suggests that the rare occurrence of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia could be related to adenoviral vector vaccines.

[According to the information available on the CDC webpage on J&J vaccines, "Reports of embolic and thrombotic events had a slight numerical imbalance with 0.06% of vaccine recipients and 0.05% of placebo recipients reporting such events. Risk factors for these events were present in the participants, however vaccine cannot be excluded as a contributing factor" (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/reactogenicity.html).

The J&J vaccine uses broadly similar vaccine technology as the AstraZeneca vaccine, known as adenoviral vectors, which has led some experts to speculate there might be a link between this vaccine platform and the very rare blood-clotting condition known as "vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia" (VITT). There are important questions to look into: Can adenoviral vectors in general cause VITT? Is VITT specific to the AstraZeneca/J&J adenoviral vaccines? Are certain individuals pre-disposed to develop VITT?

Currently, 4 COVID-19 vaccines use adenoviral vectors: AstraZeneca, Janssen/Johnson&Johnson, CanSino Biologicals, and Sputnik V.

There are many adenoviruses out there to use as a starting point to make different adenoviral vectors. While these vectors can share some characteristics, they can also be biologically pretty different.

Different adenoviruses use different access points, known as receptors, to get into our cells. This can result in a very different size and type of immune response. Also, the adenovirus used in the Sputnik V and CanSino vaccines, called "rAd5," isn't very good at setting off the alarms in our immune system, while other adenoviral vectors are better.

The different vaccines also deliver slightly different sets of instructions for the spike protein. The J&J vaccine, called "rAd26," instructs our cells to make a spike protein that's locked into a specific shape, to help our immune system recognise it, and it's delivered to the surface of the cell. The AstraZeneca vaccine, called "chAdOx01," instructs the cell to make a spike protein that isn't locked in place, and it can be secreted from the cell.

Given these differences, if one adenoviral vaccine is linked with a particular effect in our bodies, for example, blood clots, it doesn't mean all vaccines in this family will have that same effect. (https://theconversation.com/is-it-the-adenovirus-vaccine-technology-used-by-astrazeneca-and-johnson-and-johnson-causing-blood-clots-theres-no-evidence-yet-158944).

The risk of this adverse reaction is very low, around one in 200 000 people that receive the vaccine could develop the condition. But for the rare person that develops VITT, the consequences can be serious, with a fatal outcome in 25 % of cases.

VITT isn't like other clotting conditions and is likely caused by an unusual immune response. We don't know exactly what triggers this immune response. There have been reports of clotting conditions with adenovirus infections or very high doses of adenoviral vectors. However, this occurred very quickly, while VITT is a delayed response, observed 4-20 days after vaccination. It seems more likely at this stage that, in certain very rare patients, some kind of unusual immune response may be triggered.

It's important to investigate and categorize this risk to ensure continuing public confidence in vaccination. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Post-acute sequelae
Date: Tue 13 Apr 2021

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-experts-discuss-post-acute-covid-19


Many people who have COVID-19 make a full recovery and return to their baseline state of health; however, some people have symptoms or other sequelae weeks or months after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. These heterogeneous symptoms were the subject of the virtual "Workshop on Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19" hosted on 2 Dec and 4 Dec 2020 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in collaboration with other institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health. A paper published recently in Annals of Internal Medicine describes the workshop. Over 1200 registered participants including researchers, clinicians, and affected community members discussed what is known about sequelae after COVID-19 and the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in future research.

The constellation of symptoms and other effects experienced by those who do not return to their baseline state of health after COVID-19 has been referred to by many names, including post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), and long or long-haul COVID. Symptoms can be wide-ranging in severity and duration and may affect numerous organ systems. Reported symptoms include severe fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and shortness of breath, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Longer-term effects of COVID-19 have been reported in all age groups and demographics and in persons with asymptomatic, mild, or severe initial COVID-19 illness. If only a small fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to longer-term effects, the global burden of disease will be significant.

In addition to reviewing existing data, the workshop presenters identified important knowledge gaps. Notably, the epidemiology is not fully characterized, and it will need to be expanded in order to identify and help vulnerable groups of people. The full clinical spectrum of post-acute COVID-19 is not yet known, nor the reasons why the symptoms manifest so differently in individuals. Underlying pathophysiology is not determined and may be due to SARS-CoV-2 itself, or the immune response to infection.

Since COVID-19 is a new disease, researchers are still documenting the spectrum of recovery and trying to understand the different outcomes patients may experience. People who do not return to their baseline state of health have diverse clinical conditions that will require individualized and multidisciplinary approaches to treatment.

Workshop discussions highlighted that longitudinal studies, ideally including systematic assessments of different organ systems, and including diverse populations, will be needed in order to properly characterize post-acute COVID-19. Careful study of the virus and the immune response to infection may help researchers understand how manifestations of post-acute COVID-19 arise. These research efforts will need to involve a collaboration among clinicians, researchers, advocacy groups, and patient communities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
----------
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health-care systems and potentially on pregnancy outcomes, but no systematic synthesis of evidence of this effect has been undertaken. We aimed to assess the collective evidence on the effects on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of the pandemic.

Methods
We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effects of the pandemic on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We searched Medline and Embase in accordance with Prisma guidelines, from 1 Jan 2020 to 8 Jan 2021, for case-control studies, cohort studies, and brief reports comparing maternal and perinatal mortality, maternal morbidity, pregnancy complications, and intrapartum and neonatal outcomes before and during the pandemic. We also planned to record any additional maternal and offspring outcomes identified. Studies of solely SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant individuals, as well as case reports, studies without comparison groups, narrative or systematic literature reviews, preprints, and studies reporting on overlapping populations were excluded. Quantitative meta-analysis was done for an outcome when more than one study presented relevant data. Random-effects estimate of the pooled odds ratio (OR) of each outcome were generated with use of the Mantel-Haenszel method. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020211753).

Findings
The search identified 3592 citations, of which 40 studies were included. We identified significant increases in stillbirth (pooled OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.07-1.54]; I²=63%; 12 studies, 168 295 pregnancies during and 198 993 before the pandemic) and maternal death (1.37 [1.22-1.53; I-square=0%, 2 studies [both from low-income and middle-income countries], 1 237 018 and 2 224 859 pregnancies) during versus before the pandemic. Preterm births before 37 weeks' gestation were not significantly changed overall (0.94 [0.87-1.02]; I-square=75%; 15 studies, 170 640 and 656 423 pregnancies) but were decreased in high-income countries (0.91 [0.84-0.99]; I-square=63%; 12 studies, 159 987 and 635 118 pregnancies), where spontaneous preterm birth was also decreased (0.81 [0.67-0.97]; 2 studies, 4204 and 6818 pregnancies). Mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were higher, indicating poorer mental health, during versus before the pandemic (pooled mean difference 0.42 [95% CI 0.02-0.81; 3 studies, 2330 and 6517 pregnancies). Surgically managed ectopic pregnancies were increased during the pandemic (OR 5.81 [2.16-15.6]; I-square=26%; 3 studies, 37 and 272 pregnancies). No overall significant effects were identified for other outcomes included in the quantitative analysis: maternal gestational diabetes; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; preterm birth before 34 weeks', 32 weeks', or 28 weeks' gestation; iatrogenic preterm birth; labour induction; modes of delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery, caesarean section, or instrumental delivery); postpartum haemorrhage; neonatal death; low birthweight (less than 2500 g); neonatal intensive care unit admission; or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min.

Interpretation
Global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression. Some outcomes show considerable disparity between high-resource and low-resource settings. There is an urgent need to prioritise safe, accessible, and equitable maternity care within the strategic response to this pandemic and in future health crises.

[B] Menstruation
Date: Tue 13 Apr 2021

https://tarahaelle.medium.com/lack-of-data-on-covid-19-vaccines-and-periods-inspired-two-feminist-scientists-to-learn-more-b4c29395fb5


Pfizer and Moderna vaccines cause alterations in menstruation of women immediately after vaccination.

Vaccine trials include tens of thousands of people in phase 3 to ensure that even rare side effects are more likely to be detected. But once the vaccine is authorized and millions of people have begun receiving it, sometimes researchers learn about other, even rarer side effects not captured in the trials. But scientists could also miss a side effect if they simply don't ask about it, or don't record it when participants report it.

That may be why it's taken months after the vaccines were authorized by the FDA to explore whether changes in menstruation might be a temporary side effect of the COVID-19 vaccines. It took 2 feminist scientists and a large social media platform to even get the possibility on people's radar.

"Nobody thought to ask about it as a part of routine part of [trial] questionnaires," said Katharine Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in the Washington University School of Medicine Division of Public Health Sciences. "It's frustrating as somebody who thinks a lot about these biological processes. Why wouldn't you think to specifically to ask about these [menstruation irregularities] as symptoms?"

It's important to emphasize right at the start that investigating a possible link between COVID-19 vaccines and temporary changes in periods after vaccination does not mean the vaccine could affect fertility. The vaccine does not interfere with fertility or future pregnancy, and there is no evidence to support the misinformation that it does, despite the fact that it persists. But there are biological reasons that could explain why temporary changes in menstruation could occur after a vaccine without harming fertility, if it turns out that is happening.

It was after Lee got her 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine and compared notes on side effects with a friend that the topic came to her attention. She started her period shortly after getting the vaccine -- a surprise since her IUD usually prevents monthly periods -- and her friend similarly experienced an irregular period. So Lee reached out to her dissertation advisor, Kate Clancy, PhD, an associate professor of Anthropology at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign who has long studied menstruation in a variety of contexts. Clancy was intrigued, but she hadn't heard anything about irregularities in menstruation as a side effect of the vaccine.

Then a few weeks later, Clancy received her 1st Moderna shot. 9 days later she had a much heavier period than usual.

"It went from I'm not menstruating to I'm just gushing," said Clancy, who had otherwise been experiencing slower lead-ups to her period as she's gotten older. "By day 2, I was still changing out pads every hour and very grateful to be working from home." She finally asked on Twitter whether anyone else was having the same experience. The response was -- and still is -- overwhelming. "That thread is still just going bananas," she said.

None of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials have listed changes in menstruation as a possible side effect of the vaccine. However, no questions directly asked about it either, and it may be that participants didn't report it or that clinicians did not record it when it was reported.

Given the tremendous response to the survey and the unending replies to Clancy's original tweet, it might seem strange to people unfamiliar with clinical trials that such a widespread experience has not even been mentioned in reports about COVID-19 vaccine side effects, even if just to say it's not a common experience. But the absence of any discussion about menstruation irregularities in the trials speaks to a larger systemic problem in medicine that dates back to the earliest days of research: a dismissal of women's lived experiences.

The refusal to investigate women's experiences in the U.S. was actually codified in 1977 when a US Food and Drug Administration policy recommended excluding all women of childbearing age from phase 1 and 2 drug trials, regardless of whether they were using contraception, in a relationship, heterosexual or had a husband who was vasectomized. The reasons for the exclusion were understandable, arising in part from pharmaceutical disasters like that of thalidomide, which causes limb deformations in children exposed to it in the womb. But the over-cautious approach went too far and created an even bigger problem: a complete lack of data on how different drugs affect women. Although the National Institutes of Medicine began encouraging researchers to include women in trials starting in 1989, it wasn't until 1993 that it became federal law for NIH-funded studies to include women and minorities in clinical trials.

But requiring women to be included didn't change the culture of exclusion immediately.

Clancy is clear that she and Lee are investigating the topic without assuming there is a causal connection to vaccination and with the expectation that any effect is temporary and not a reason for concern.

"We are looking at something that's fairly transient," she said. "You don't have to be terrified if you get one really wonky period or 2. That's why it's important to study it."

Lee and Clancy both said that finding out whether irregularities in menstruation could be a potential side effect of a vaccine could help people be prepared for it and not worry when it happens.

Many people did apparently report it, or tried to, and were not taken seriously, Clancy said. She said she receives 5-10 emails a day from people who saw her tweet and reached out to say they were having a similar experience.

"Most of those emails are by people who said, 'I tried to tell somebody about my experience, and they told me that I was wrong,'" Clancy said. "Part of the reason that we are finally only now, months later, noticing that this might be something that menstruators are experiencing is that people hadn't been listening until now."

That reality has informed the purpose of the pair's research.

Clancy mentioned 2 potential biological mechanisms that she's aware of. One came from her discussions with Anirban Sen Gupta, PhD, a platelet researcher at Case Western Reserve University who will be collaborating with Lee and Clancy.

Sen Gupta told Clancy that some research has a possible link between the nanoparticles used in the mRNA vaccines and a temporary reduction in platelets count. Platelets are the blood cells that help blood clot, so it's possible that fewer platelets could lead to heavier bleeding -- less clotting -- in someone having a period, Clancy said.

"If you're a menstruator and your period is due soon anyway, then you might kind of have some kind of bleeding event that is much more powerful than what you would normally have just because your body is not quite as effective as at coagulating your blood," she said.

The phenomenon of lower platelet counts is called thrombocytopenia, and it is already a known rare side effect of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The condition is not life-threatening and resolves on its own without any long-term side effects. Clancy emphasized that it's important that people don't worry that heavier bleeding after a vaccine suggests any concerns about fertility or other systemic issues.

Another possible mechanism is the normal immune activation that occurs as a result of a vaccine," Clancy said. Her lab has previously studied how systematic inflammation can be associated with changes in hormone concentrations and other temporary effects on the reproductive system. Inflammation essentially refers to the immune system taking notice of a perceived threat and responding to it. Clancy's lab has found that people with higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker for inflammation, tend to have lower levels of estradiol and progesterone concentrations.

"What we could be seeing here is, again, another transient response to your immune system getting a pretty good kick," Clancy said. "A vaccine is activating your immune system. It's going to create some inflammation."

The uterus might be particularly sensitive to temporary inflammation because it's such a dynamic environment.

Surveys by local governments in Japan show the coronavirus variant first detected in Britain is surging in the country. The variant, dubbed N501Y, is said to be more transmissible than the original coronavirus.

In Osaka Prefecture, a survey of 304 people who tested positive in the week through 3 Apr [2021] showed 73.7%, or 224, with the variant.

The proportion of people with the variant was 41.7% in the week through 13 Mar [2021], 48.6% through 20 Mar [2021], and 65% through 27 Mar [2021].

In Tokyo, 130 people, or 25.5%, of the 510 who tested positive in the week through Sunday [11 Apr 2021] were confirmed to have the variant.

The proportion was 3.1% in the week through 28 Mar [2021] but rose to 16% in the week through 4 Apr [2021]. It's now up by almost another 10 points.

The surveys did not cover all who were infected, and they include areas with large numbers of people who've had close contact with the variant-positive.

But officials are stepping up alerts as the percentage is rising.

[B] Top Japan virus expert acknowledges 4th wave as variants take hold

Shigeru Omi, who heads a government panel of experts on the coronavirus pandemic, said at a [committee meeting of the House of Representatives] on Wednesday [14 Apr 2021] that Japan is seeing a 4th wave of infections.

"Due in part to the impact of variant strains, now is the time to flexibly take quasi-emergency measures," Omi said.

At the same committee meeting, economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is playing a pivotal role in the government's fight against the virus, said the government will consider adopting the measures in Aichi and Saitama prefectures for preventing a further spread of novel coronavirus infections there.

"Flexible responses," such as the possible adoption of stronger measures under the revised coronavirus special law, are needed for Aichi and Saitama prefectures, Nishimura said. "I'm concerned over the rising proportion of novel coronavirus variant cases in the 2 prefectures."

The government is in talks with the prefectural governments of Aichi and Saitama and will decide whether to add the 2 prefectures to the list of areas under the pre-emergency stage while hearing experts' views, he said.

The government is also set to discuss whether to put Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures, both bordering Tokyo, under the stage as well.
