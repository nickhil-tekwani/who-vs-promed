As many as 7 people, including children, from various parts of Murshidabad have been affected by scrub typhus in the past 48 hours. Around 9 people from the districts have so far been admitted to the Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital, out of which 5 are children. This has become a concern for the Health department.

Taking a note of reports of scrub typhus from some parts of Murshidabad, the state Health department has directed the district health officials to be alert and vigilant. "Scrub typhus is a disease that can be treated with antibiotics, if it is detected early. So, early detection is of the utmost importance. We have directed the hospital to keep a tab if fever continues for a period of 5 days in a patient," a senior official from the district said. All the patients are running high temperatures, and many of them have various other symptoms which include vomiting.

The disease is spread among people through the bites of infected chiggers (larval mites). Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is a disease caused by bacteria called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, and it commonly occurs in rural areas. The most common symptoms of scrub typhus include fever, headache, body aches and sometimes rash. Most cases of scrub typhus have so far been reported in rural areas of Southeast Asia, Indonesia, China, Japan, India and Northern Australia.

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

Illness in humans develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and a characteristic black eschar at the site of the chigger bite that is useful for making the diagnosis when present. Pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness. Because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1% to 30%, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf).

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions. The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was confirmed in these patients is not stated.

ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546.

Murshidabad district, with a population of 7.1 million residents in 2011, is located on the left bank of the river Ganges, in the Indian state of West Bengal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murshidabad_district). The government-run Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital, established in 2012, is located in the city of Berhampore, the administrative headquarters of the Murshidabad district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murshidabad_Medical_College_and_Hospital).
