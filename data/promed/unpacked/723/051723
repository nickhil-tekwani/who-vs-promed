Outbreak of undiagnosed febrile illness in Jaffna under control
---------------------------------------------------------------
The "mystery flu" that has claimed over 30 lives in Jaffna, causing concern
that it could spread to neighboring districts as well, has now been brought
under control. Latest reports received from the Jaffna hospital have shown
that the number of new patients being admitted to the Teaching Hospital is
on the decline, sources said. "But we still need to know the cause of this
mysterious illness. We are certain it is a viral fever, but we haven't been
able to identify the virus yet", Dr T A Kulatilleke, director, Epidemiology
Unit, Ministry of Health, told the Sunday Observer. He added that although
the Health Department had sent out several teams of top level officials
following the outbreak of the disease, all the samples they had brought
with them to Colombo had so far tested negative. "We are, however, keeping
the disease from spreading by treating the symptoms", he added.
The Health Department spokesman said that the reason why the tests so far
had been negative and they had not yet been able to isolate the virus
causing it was probably because of the delay in bringing down the samples
from Jaffna to Colombo. "The life of a virus is very short. So we need to
have the samples in our testing lab as quickly as possible. We are now
making arrangements to try and bring down the samples on the same day they
were taken by the return flight from Jaffna".
Health sources said that two other diseases, dengue fever and typhoid
fever, which had also begun to spread throughout the Jaffna district were
also being brought under control. "These two diseases are common at this
time of the year due to rains. We are now conducting fogging campaigns to
eradicate the mosquito population. All residents in Jaffna have also been
warned against drinking unboiled water and undercooked or contaminated
food. In addition, we are in the process of immunising the hospital staff
who handle patients with typhoid, with a vaccine, Dr Kulatilleke said.
Typical symptoms of the yet-to-be identified viral flu are high fever for
several days, a confused state of mind, pneumonia, and respiratory and
renal failure. Patients who have developed any of these symptoms are
advised to get themselves admitted to the nearest hospital immediately.

[Further information about this outbreak is awaited; the severity of the
symptoms are a cause for concern. The presumption of viral infection has
yet to be substantiated, but may indicate a failure of the patients to
respond to antibiotic therapy. The statement that all the samples examined
so far have tested negative is very much dependent on the nature of the
diagnostic reagents employed. Additional information is required to
interpret this incident. - Mod.CP]
