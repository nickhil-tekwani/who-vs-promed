Swine flu case linked to Minnesota State Fair
---------------------------------------------
A 4th case of swine flu [H1N2] has been linked to the Minnesota State Fair -- this one in a teenage boy who exhibited hogs at the Swine Barn. The boy was at the fair on 23 to 26 Aug 2012 and became ill 4 days after he went home, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. He did not require hospitalisation.

All 4 cases linked to the fair so far involved patients who spent long hours in the Swine Barn, and all 4 recovered quickly. The 4 cases involved a strain of flu different from the one [H3N2v] that prompted national warnings in August.

Minnesota health officials went on high alert last month as the new strain [H3N2v] swept across the central Midwest, sickening more than 300 people, with most cases linked to agricultural fairs. The new strain, H3N2v, has resembled ordinary seasonal flu, with symptoms that include a fever and runny nose. But public health officials watched it carefully because the flu virus can mutate quickly once it jumps from one species to another; 2 cases of that flu, and a suspected 3rd case, were reported last month in Dakota County among people who attended a live-animal market.

All 4 cases linked to the State Fair involved a different strain, known as H1N2.

[According to a CIDRAP News report of 6 Sep 2012 by Robert Roos (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/sep0712h1n2.html) the swine-origin H1N2 virus found in 3 [now 4] Minnesotans last week carries the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, marking the 1st time such a virus has been found in humans, according to state and federal health officials. The variant H1N2, or H1N2v, virus is different from the swine-origin H3N2v strain that has cropped up in nearly 300 people within the past year. But the 2 are alike in that both picked up the pandemic virus's matrix gene.

The number of H3N2v cases has risen to 297, an increase of 7 since a week ago, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) new count, posted today. Nearly all the cases have been in people who were exposed to pigs, most of them at agricultural fairs this summer. Only one death, that of an Ohio woman who had other medical conditions, has been linked to the virus, but there have been 16 hospitalizations.

No ongoing human-to-human transmission of either H3N2v or H1N2v viruses has been reported, but the CDC has said that the H1N1 matrix gene might increase the transmissibility of H3N2v and that a few instances of likely human-to-human spread of that virus have been found.

In reporting the H1N2v cases in a statement today [10 Sep 2012], the CDC said the population probably has some immunity to it because of past exposure to seasonal H1N1 flu viruses. "Genetic analysis shows that the hemagglutinin (H) of this virus is similar to human seasonal influenza viruses that circulated in people as recently as 2009, so there would likely be protective immunity against this particular virus in the human population," the agency said.

Although H1N2v is new in humans, the US Department of Agriculture's swine flu surveillance program has detected very similar H1N2 viruses with the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene in pigs in Minnesota and some other states since early 2010, the CDC reported. In reporting the cases last week, the MDH said 2 sick pigs at the State Fair tested positive for H1N2. Ferguson reported that the virus in the pigs was also found to contain the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene. The H1N2v cases demonstrate once again that swine flu viruses can spread to people, and they point up the importance of the CDC recommendation that people at risk for serious flu complications should avoid close contact with pigs and pig barns at fairs this season, the agency said.

Although the recent H1N2v cases are the 1st known to contain the 2009 H1N1 matrix gene, a few other H1N2v cases have been reported in recent years. One case was reported in a Minnesota child in December 2011. Another case was reported in 2007 in an 18-month-old Michigan child who had been in a swine barn. Both of those patients recovered. In 2002 the CDC reported that a total of 11 human H1N2 cases had been detected in Wisconsin, Texas, and Nevada the previous year.
