2003/172 Details on the situation of Tomato yellow leaf curl
begomovirus in Reunion
In Reunion, Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 list) was
first reported in September 1997 near St. Pierre. The virus was found
both in protected and field-grown tomatoes, causing serious
epidemics. In 1998, it was considered that eradication was not
feasible, but control programmes were initiated. Molecular studies of
isolates from Reunion suggested that they correspond to a single
recent introduction from a single origin.
Studies on the insect vector, _Bemisia tabaci_ [Bt] (_Homoptera_:
_Aleyrodidae_ - EPPO A2 list), showed that the Bt predominates on the
island, but some specimens belonged to another biotype (also present
in Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and designated biotype
Mascareignes). In 1998/1999, surveys showed that TYLCV was present
from La Possession (north) to St. Joseph (south), and to Makes
towards the centre of the island (900 m altitude). The eastern part
of the island was not affected by TYLCV, but it is not a
tomato-producing area.
No specific studies were done on crop losses, but losses up to 85
percent were observed on the most susceptible tomato cultivars (e.g.
Farmer, Boa). Control measures are being taken to contain both TYLCV
and its vector. In nurseries, insect-proof screenhouses and yellow
sticky traps are used, and planting material is tested. Growers are
recommended not to establish new tomato crops in the vicinity of old
plots, to apply weed control, chemical or biological control against
Bt, and to use more tolerant tomato cultivars. Import checks have
been also strengthened to avoid further introductions of infested
tomato fruits or plants, and of Bt.

[Tomato yellow leaf curl disease is well-established in the country
after 7 years of cropping. Genetic resistance to TYLCV in tomato
cultivars appears to controlled by at least 5 genes, and crossing
experiments yielded only tolerant hybrids. Production of genetically
engineered tomato is a possible management strategy.
