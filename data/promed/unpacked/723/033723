Old World screwworm (OWS) is a disease caused by _Chrysomya bezziana_, a fly which is an obligate parasite of mammals during its larval stages. OWS is one of the internationally reportable diseases included in OIE's list of Multiple Species Diseases. The internationally agreed requirements pertaining to OWS are specified in chapter 8.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The current version of this chapter deals also with New World screwworm, caused by _Cochliomyia hominivorax_.

Larvae feeding on the skin and underlying tissues of the host cause a condition known as wound or traumatic myiasis, which can be fatal. Infestations are generally acquired at sites of previous wounding, due to natural causes or to animal husbandry practices, but they may also occur in the mucous membranes of body orifices.

Female flies are attracted to wounds at the edges of which each female lays an average of 175 eggs. The larvae emerge within 12-24 hours and immediately begin to feed, burrowing head-downwards into the wound. After growth involving 2 moults, the larvae leave the wound and drop to the ground into which they burrow to pupate. The duration of the life-cycle off the host is temperature dependent, being shorter at higher temperatures, and the whole cycle may be completed in less than 3 weeks in the tropics.

Treatment is generally effected by application of organophosphorus insecticides into infested wounds, both to kill larvae and to provide a residual protection against re-infestation. Preventive measures include the spraying or dipping of susceptible livestock with organophosphorus compounds and, more recently, use of avermectins as subcutaneous injections to animals "at risk." Strict control of the movement of animals out of affected areas also acts as a preventive measure.

For further information, subscribers are referred to chapter 2.1.10, "New world screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_) and old world screwworm (_Chrysomya bezziana_)", in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, available online at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.10_SCREWW.pdf.

A map, presenting the distribution of predicted OWS risk for livestock in the Near East, based on eco-climatic suitability, was issued in 2008 by the FAO and is available at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/foto/2008/OWS_map.gif. - Mod.AS]
