Summary Of West Nile Virus Activity In New York City for 2001
-------------------------------------------------------------
The New York City Department of Health (DOH) today released an
overview of West Nile virus (WNV) findings in New York City for
2001. In total, there were 7 confirmed human cases of WNV in New
York City that required hospitalization for West Nile viral encephalitis
or meningitis.
Additionally, positive West Nile virus findings were identified in 166
dead birds, 71 live birds, and 208 mosquito pools citywide. Nationally
in 2001, 49 humans, 6 101 birds, and 756 mosquito pools tested
positive for WNV.
The Rapid Response program and the City's aggressive mosquito
prevention efforts, which included application of larvicide throughout
the City, reduced reliance upon the application of adulticides to control
the mosquito population. DOH conducted targeted, ground-based
adulticiding in 2001 to reduce the number of infected mosquitoes
mainly in non-residential areas (e.g., parks, marshes, cemeteries, golf
courses) in Staten Island, Queens, and Manhattan, as well as a small
number of residential areas in Staten Island and Queens. There was no
aerial application of larvicide or adulticides in New York City in 2001.
Human cases
---------------
As in prior years, DOH conducted active surveillance within the
medical community for West Nile viral encephalitis and viral
meningitis throughout Summer and Fall of 2001. In all, DOH received
reports of 666 individuals suspected of having a possible West Nile
virus infection. Of those, 351 were hospitalized patients with illnesses
suggestive of viral encephalitis or meningitis; 7 of these individuals
were confirmed to have West Nile virus: 2 from Staten Island, 2 from
Queens, 2 from Brooklyn, and one from Manhattan. Ages ranged from
44 to 75 years, with 4 cases occurring in males and 3 cases occurring in
females. There were no fatalities from WNV in New York City in 2001.
Mosquito pools
------------------
Mosquito pools were collected weekly from mosquito traps placed at
approximately 100 locations citywide. Of those mosquito pools
submitted for testing, 208 tested positive for WNV. The common
house mosquito (_Culex pipiens_) continued to be the primary WNV
carrier this year. In 2001, West Nile virus was identified from a total of
4 species of mosquitoes in New York City: _Culex pipiens_, _Culex
salinarius_, _Culex restuans_, and _Aedes vexans_. As in past years,
DOH will continue its mosquito surveillance over the winter months to
monitor and detect any arboviral disease activity.
Birds and Land Animals
----------------------------
Of the 587 dead birds from New York City tested for WNV in 2001,
166 tested positive (120 were crows). Of 1483 live birds collected for
testing, 71 tested positive for WNV. In 2001, 2 horses, one squirrel,
and 4 raccoons were submitted from New York City for testing for
West Nile virus; none of these animals tested positive for WNV.
Larviciding
-------------
The larvicide used in 2001 was VectoLex CG, a granular, bacterial
agent (_Bacillus sphaericus_). Between May and August 2001,
approximately 150 000 street and park catch basins were treated with
larvicide -- almost twice as often as in the previous year (May-
September 2000). Additionally, application of larvicide was conducted
in non-residential areas (e.g., parks, marshes, cemeteries, golf courses)
in all 5 boroughs. There was no aerial application of larvicide in 2001.
Adulticiding
--------------
During August and September 2001, DOH conducted ground-based
spraying of adulticides to reduce the adult mosquito population where
increased evidence of West Nile virus activity was found to pose a risk
to human health. In 2001, ground-based application of adulticides
occurred in areas of Staten Island, Queens, and Central Park in
Manhattan (a complete spray schedule for 2001 is available at
. While the majority of adult mosquito control
activities were conducted in non-residential areas (e.g., parks, marshes,
cemeteries, golf courses), a small number of residential areas were
treated. There was no aerial application of adulticide in 2001.
Public Relations
-------------------
DOH notified the public about all spraying operations in advance;
schedules were disseminated through radio, television, print media, the
DOH website () and information line, as well as
through elected officials and community boards citywide. DOH also
informed: hospital emergency departments throughout New York City;
day camps; the Board of Education; nursing homes; associations of
green grocers; and community organizations of spraying activities. In
addition, DOH made information on mosquito prevention and control
products widely available to interested parties. For more information
