Deaths of children in Perth blamed on flu
-----------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 children under 5 years of age have died in Perth,
Australia, in the past few days from what is believed to be a severe
form of influenza, the Western Australian Health Department says. The
department is urging parents to quickly see a doctor if their
children show signs of respiratory illness.
Director of Communicable Disease Control, Dr. Paul Van Buynder, said
the speed at which the 3 children fell ill was a concern. "While we
do not want to create unnecessary panic, it is important for parents
to be aware that the disease can cause serious illness within 24
hours," Dr. Van Buynder said. "Parents whose children have cold or
flu-like symptoms, including a cough and a fever, should see their
general practitioner (GP)." The Health Department is advising all
parents of young children to see a doctor for flu vaccination if they
have not already done so.
Dr Van Buynder said one of the children had been identified with
having the influenza A virus, which is covered by this year's flu
vaccine, and it was likely all 3 children had that strain of the
virus. They had been well and became very sick within a day, he said.
"It's not about large numbers, it's about that we had 3 children who
got sick very quickly," he said.
Of the children who fell ill in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital
for Children, tests revealed that 2 of them had developed a form of
pneumonia. "Samples taken from the 2 children who died in hospital
suggested they had secondary bacterial pneumonia. We'll be able to
confirm that over the next few days."
Dr. Van Buynder said the Department was advising parents to see a
doctor quickly if their children developed flu symptoms because
secondary chest infections could usually be stopped with antibiotics.
The 3rd child did not receive hospital treatment.

Parents urged to be vigilant after flu deaths
--------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities are urging parents to be on alert following news
that 3 young children died after contracting the flu in the past few
days. Pathology tests are being undertaken over the weekend [7-8 Jul
2007] to determine the exact cause of the deaths, but Health
Department Director of Communicable Disease Control Paul Van Buynder
suspected the children had died of secondary bacterial infections
after their immune systems had been compromised by the flu virus.
It is understood at least 2 of the children had contracted pneumonia
as a result of the virus, which could have contributed to their
deaths. All the children were aged under 5 and each is believed to
have died within 24 hours of showing the first signs of flu. Two died
at their homes before their parents could seek medical attention and
the 3rd died before being admitted to hospital.
They all came from the metropolitan area but authorities are unaware
of any links between the 3 children. Some of the siblings of those
who died are also believed to be recovering in hospital.
PathWest clinical virologist David Smith said the virus was the
influenza A(H3) strain, which was not particularly virulent. It is
one of the strains covered by this year's flu vaccination.
Dr. Van Buynder warned parents that listlessness, cough and fever
were the key symptoms parents should look for and urged them to seek
medical advice immediately. "While we do not want to create
unnecessary panic, it is important for parents to be aware that the
disease can cause serious illness within 24 hours," he said. The
emergency departments at Fremantle, Joondalup, Swan District and
Princess Margaret hospitals [PMH] were available to see children
after hours if they could not see a GP.
Panicked parents flooded hospitals and jammed the Health Department's
hotline with hundreds of calls last night [6 Jul 2007] after news of
the children's deaths was revealed. Executive director of the Child
and Adolescent Health Service Robyn Lawrence said last night PMH had
a 60 percent increase in patient admissions, which she attributed to
the flu panic. "Parents are obviously concerned," she said. "Children
are being processed as quickly as we can." Dr. Lawrence said the
waiting time at the PMH Emergency Department was up to 3 hours. She
assured parents that the hospital had staff in reserve to deal with
the increased patient numbers.
The medical clinic at Joondalup Hospital was forced to close its
doors at 8:30 last night [6 Jul 2007] when it became unable to deal
with any more patients. Waiting times at hospital emergency
departments blew out by hours, after-hours GP clinics were swamped
across Perth and the flu hotline had 130 callers at one time.
Australian Medical Association State president Geoff Dobb said the
influenza A strain was one of the most common during winter and that
West Australians were particularly vulnerable because it had been
several years since the last flu epidemic. He said parents should not
be worried if their children simply had a runny nose and headache,
though they should look out for a fever above 38 deg C [100.4 deg F].
"The critical thing is the combination of a fever and a cough," he
said. "What we're talking about here is not just having a runny nose
and feeling unwell, often people refer to that loosely as having the
flu. "A true influenza will make you feel really unwell, more severe
with cough, fever and muscular aches and pain." He said that unlike
the flu, people with a cold may have a sore throat and runny nose,
followed by a cough, but without a significant fever.
Many hospital staff, who did not want to be named, were critical that
the alert was issued without more advice being made available to
parents and doctors, some of whom were not told that the flu warning
was to be issued yesterday.
Parents can call Health Direct on 1 800 020 080 [in Australia] for
advice and locations of their nearest after-hours clinic.

[Death of unvaccinated children during outbreaks of seasonal
influenza virus infection, though distressing, is not an unusual
event and is usually a consequence of secondary infection. It is
probably a not infrequent accompaniment of the southern hemisphere
winter.
The influenza A virus responsible for these deaths is not considered
to be exceptionally virulent nor does it appear to differ
antigenically from the H3 component of the current seasonal vaccine
for use in the Southern hemisphere. Infants and the elderly are most
at risk and should be protected by vaccination. - Mod.CP]
