The detection of wheat stem rust at numerous locations in Ireland in 2020 [ProMED post 20200731.7630206] was unexpected and worrying. Most current European wheat varieties are susceptible to the disease and, therefore, it was important to determine if any novel strains had emerged.

After detailed characterisation of isolates obtained from the Irish outbreaks, they were assigned to the Digalu (TKTTF) race. Digalu was previously reported elsewhere in Europe -- for example, the UK and Germany [ProMED posts 20180219.5638265, 20140404.2379670], but also in significant outbreaks in Ethiopia [ProMED post 20140327.2360315].

Since no barberry [see comment below] was observed in the vicinities of the infections, the findings suggest that the outbreaks resulted from long-distance spread of spores. This shows that, although the last previous reports of the disease in the country were about 60 years ago, new outbreaks can occur at any time. It is important to ensure that stem rust does not become a significant threat.

[Wheat stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_, previously f.sp. _tritici_) has been reported to cause overall yield losses of up to 80%, but some fields are totally destroyed. Barley is also susceptible to this pathogen. Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw or other contaminated materials. The fungus can survive between seasons on some grasses or volunteer wheat, generating a "green bridge". Alternatively, it can also produce hardy teliospores to infect members of the genus _Berberis_ (barberries) in the next season, which then serve as a source of crop inoculum. Barberry is suspected to have given rise to a recent outbreak of stem rust in barley in the UK (ProMED post 20191008.6714735).

Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include fungicide applications; control of volunteer wheat and _Berberis_ reservoirs; as well as resistant varieties, if available. Resistance breeding programmes have been set up by several countries and international groups. However, new fungal races with increased virulence are emerging frequently.

The Ug99 family of strains have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. New strains not related to Ug99 are also posing a danger, including Digalu, named after the wheat variety on which it was first detected (ProMED posts 20170206.4820305, 20140327.2360315). Digalu first appeared in the Middle East, having overcome 2 host resistance genes that were still effective against Ug99 strains. It is rapid and destructive. Variants of the initial Digalu with virulence to 4 additional host resistance genes are currently considered to be the cause of a re-emerging stem rust threat in Europe.

Recombinants of different races would pose a high risk of becoming even more aggressive than the parents. Of the more than 50 known wheat resistance genes to stem rust, only very few are currently left that have not been overcome by a stem rust race.
