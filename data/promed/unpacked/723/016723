Outbreak of Powassan Encephalitis; Maine and Vermont, 1999-2001
----------------------------------------------------------------
Powassan (POW) virus, a North American tick-borne flavivirus related to the
Eastern Hemisphere's tick-borne encephalitis viruses (1), was first
isolated from a patient with encephalitis in 1958 (1,2). During 1958 to
1998, 27 human POW virus encephalitis cases were reported from Canada and
the northeastern United States (3). During Sep 1999 to Jul 2001, 4 Maine
and Vermont residents with encephalitis were found to be infected with POW
virus. These persons were tested for other arbovirus infections found in
the northeast after testing for West Nile virus (WNV) infection was
negative. This report describes these 4 cases, summarizes the results of
ecologic investigations, and discusses a potential association between
ticks that infest medium-sized mammals and the risk for human exposure to
POW virus. The findings underscore the need for personal protective
measures to prevent tick bites and continued encephalitis surveillance.
Case Reports [clinical details omitted - Mod.CP]:
Case 1. In June 2001, a 70-year-old man from Kennebec County, Maine, was
taken to a local hospital with generalized muscle weakness, somnolence,
diarrhea, and anorexia. He subsequently developed left-sided hemiplegia and
marked confusion. No causes for his apparent stroke were found. After 22
days of hospitalization, he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
Nearly 3 months after symptom onset, he remains in the facility and is
unable to move his left arm or leg. Serum specimens and CSF collected 3
days after hospitalization revealed POW virus-specific IgM; neutralizing
antibody (1:640 titer) also was found in serum specimens. Although some
cross-reaction with WNV and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus occurred in
the IgM assay, no neutralizing antibody was found. The patient had not left
Maine for 25 years. On ecologic investigation, overgrown bushes, leaf
piles, and stacks of old lumber and scrap metal covered his property.
Family members reported seeing woodchucks, skunks, and squirrels on the
property. During the 2 weeks before illness, the patient's main activities
were lying on the ground repairing a boat hull and yard work. Approximately
6 weeks after illness onset, 9 medium-sized mammals were trapped on or near
the patient's property. Collections from these mammals and the grassy and
brushy areas of the property yielded 31 ticks (_Ixodes cookei_). Tests for
POW virus infection were conducted at CDC. Of the 9 mammal serum samples, 4
(2 woodchucks and 2 skunks) contained neutralizing antibody to POW virus,
but no virus was isolated from the ticks.
Case 2. In September 2000, a 53-year-old woman from York County, Maine
sought medical care at a local hospital for loss of balance, visual
disturbance, and fever of 103 F (39.4 C). During hospitalization, she
developed altered mental status, generalized muscle weakness, and complete
ophthalmoplegia. After 13 days, she was transferred to a rehabilitation
facility, where she remained for 2 months. She was walking and had regained
her strength 9 months after onset of symptoms, but the ophthalmoplegia
continued. A serum specimen collected 19 days after illness onset was
positive for POW virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibody (1:640 titer)
and negative for WNV and SLE virus antibodies. The patient had not left
Maine in several months before illness onset. During 2 visits to a rural
vacation home in the month before illness onset, the patient removed
several squirrel nests but reported no contact with ticks or rodents. One
month after illness onset, an ecologic evaluation of her primary home noted
a well-manicured suburban property near brush and woodlands. No evidence of
medium-sized mammals was found, and only 3 _Ix. scapularis_ were collected;
no POW virus was isolated.
Case 3. In July 2000, a 25-year-old man from Waldo County, Maine sought
medical care at a local hospital for fever of 101.3 F (38.5 C), headache,
vomiting, somnolence, and confusion. On clinical examination, the patient
had difficulty answering simple questions and was intermittently
uncooperative. After 11 days of hospitalization, he was transferred to a
rehabilitation facility. When discharged home 44 days later, the patient
required assistance to stand and perform daily activities. Serum specimens
and CSF collected 3 days after illness onset were negative for antibody to
WNV and SLE virus but positive for POW virus-specific IgM antibody. The
serum sample also had neutralizing antibody (1:80 titer) to POW virus. At
the time of illness onset, the patient worked as a logger and lived in
rural Maine, where he raised livestock.
Case 4. In September 1999, a 66-year-old man from Washington County,
Vermont sought medical care at a hospital for somnolence, severe headache,
increasing confusion, and bilateral leg weakness that developed over 6
days. On clinical examination, he was afebrile but had slow speech, memory
loss, a wide-based gait, and bilateral weakness in proximal lower
extremities. When discharged home 11 days later, he could walk but had
cognitive difficulties, including severe memory lapses. Serum specimens
collected 19 days after illness onset contained POW virus-specific IgM and
neutralizing antibody (1:640 titer) but no antibody to WNV and SLE virus.
During the month before illness onset, the patient traveled frequently to a
vacation home, where he saw numerous squirrels and skunks.

MMWR Editorial Note:
These 4 cases of POW encephalitis are the first reported in Maine and
Vermont and the first in the United States since 1994 (4). Since the
introduction of WNV into the northeastern United States in 1999 (5),
testing for POW virus and other arboviruses that cause encephalitis has
increased (CDC, unpublished data, 2001). These cases were identified as a
direct result of requests for WNV testing. As surveillance continues,
knowledge of the epidemiology of POW virus in the United States may increase.
In North America, POW virus has been isolated from 4 tick species,
including _Ixodes cookei_, _Ix. marxi_, _Ix. spinipalpus_, and _Dermacentor
andersoni_; a variant POW virus also has been isolated from _Ix.
scapularis_; and evidence of infection has been found in 38 mammal species,
primarily woodchucks (1,6). Unlike _Ix. scapularis_, the primary vector for
Lyme disease, _Ix. cookei_ rarely search for hosts on vegetation and are
often found in or near the nests or burrows of medium-sized mammals.
Infections have occurred from May to December, with a peak during June to
September, when ticks are most active (1). Although neither the first nor
second patient recalled tick bites, ecologic investigations suggest that
their illnesses resulted from visiting or living in areas where ticks are
common. As with many infectious agents transmitted by Ixodid ticks, few
infected persons recalled tick bites, because these ticks are small and can
be easily missed (3).
POW encephalitis is associated with significant long-term morbidity and has
a case-fatality rate of 10% to 15% (1,3). Because there is no vaccine or
specific therapy for POW encephalitis, the best means of prevention is
protection from tick bite. This includes using insect repellents, wearing
light-colored clothing with long sleeves and pants tucked into socks or
boots, avoiding or clearing brushy areas, and removing ticks before they
attach or as soon after attachment as possible. Checking family pets also
can prevent ticks from entering the home. Because _Ix. cookei_ are often
found on woodchucks and skunks and may be the primary vector of POW virus,
environmental controls reducing human contact with small and medium-sized
mammals should reduce risk for exposure to POW virus-infected ticks.
Persons should keep areas adjacent to their home clear of brush, weeds,
trash, and other elements that could support small and medium-sized
mammals. When removing rodent nests, avoid direct contact with nesting
materials and use sealed plastic bags for disposal and to prevent direct
contact with ticks.
Because of the lack of awareness and the need for specialized laboratory
tests to confirm diagnosis, the frequency of POW encephalitis may be
greater than previously suspected. POW encephalitis should be included in
the differential diagnosis of all encephalitis cases occurring in the
northern United States, especially the northeast. Laboratory tests for POW
virus infection are not commercially available but can be requested through
state public health laboratories for testing at CDC. Awareness should be
promoted among clinicians and public health staff and tick-bite prevention
strategies emphasized for the general public.
