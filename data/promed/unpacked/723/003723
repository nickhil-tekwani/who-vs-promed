Bird flu resurfaces in Thailand
-------------------------------
Thailand's hopes of declaring itself free of the bird flu virus were dashed
again Friday after fresh outbreaks were detected in 2 provinces,
agriculture officials said. "We have found bird flu in 2 provinces,
Chonburi and Khon Kaen," deputy agriculture minister Newin Chidchob told
reporters. "They were still a problem and the affected areas were put on
surveillance, and if there are no new findings I expect we could declare
ourselves bird flu free on April 27," he said.
Both areas had recorded outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 strain of avian
influenza earlier in the year, when the country announced it was stricken
by an outbreak of the disease which eventually killed 8 people. Agriculture
officials detected the latest bird flu outbreaks in Chonburi on 7 Apr and
in Khon Kaen on 25 Mar 2004, and both provinces were now on a mandatory
21-day monitoring period.
Thailand slaughtered at least 36 million birds, mainly chickens, and
slapped quarantine regulations on affected zones in an effort to halt the
spread of the disease which hit 41 of its 76 provinces. The kingdom has
reported 12 bird flu infections in humans, including 8 deaths. 4 other
people made a full recovery. Bird flu has swept through 10 countries in
Asia and also killed 16 people in Vietnam.
The resurgent disease has vexed Thai authorities who for the past 6 weeks
have been eager to declare an end to the bird flu crisis which decimated
its massive poultry industry. "I cannot exactly say if we will be able to
declare ourselves bird flu free by April, as we have to be objective,"
Newin said. "If any new disease is detected, we have to publicise it."
Thailand originally planned to declare itself free of the disease by the
end of February following an initial wave of outbreaks in January, but was
forced to back track when 9 more cases were announced on 16 Feb 2004. A
similar announcement was then put off on 16 Mar when fears surfaced that
bird flu had re-emerged in 11 provinces. Newin said the new outbreaks meant
a further delay of resumption of chicken exports.

Viet Nam status of avian influenza
----------------------------------
Of all the countries in the region, Vietnam has been the most affected by
the avian influenza epidemic: not only was its poultry sector devastated,
but 15 human lives also were tragically lost to the disease. The earliest
recorded cases in Vietnam occurred on 25 Dec 2003. These were subsequently
confirmed as AI by laboratory diagnosis on 6 Jan 2004, and reported to OIE
on 8 Jan. 2 of these cases were in Long An Province and one in Tien Giang
Province: both these provinces are in the south of the country. Within the
next 2 months, the disease spread rapidly, with over 1700 outbreaks
recorded in 57 of the country's 64 provinces. The rapidity and intensity of
the outbreaks spread overwhelmed the capacity of the veterinary service and
its disease surveillance systems to get ahead and contain the epidemic.
Lacking the necessary field monitoring systems, diagnostic capability, and
other resources necessary to deal with the outbreak by early selective
strategic containment, the Government was obliged to adopt wide culling
practices, including noninfected (but at risk) flocks through large areas
surrounding identified foci of infection. All poultry movement was halted,
and all poultry markets were closed. Stringent disinfection and other
biosecurity measures were introduced. These measures, once enforced, were
quickly successful; and no new outbreaks have been reported in poultry
since 26 Feb, 2004. No human cases have occurred since 15 Mar 2004. The
toll upon the poultry sector, however, has been heavy: over 38 million
birds were destroyed -- equivalent to 15 per cent of the domestic poultry
population -- with serious consequence to the livelihoods of many farmers
and villagers.
Over and above this, with the nationwide closure of the poultry markets,
business and income has also been lost and a wider hardship experienced
throughout the country as a whole. Furthermore, the disappearance of
poultry products form the markets raised the demand, and in consequence the
cost of other meat, including fish. The price of these already more
expensive animal protein sources rose by a further 20 to 30 per cent,
placing them well beyond the reach of many of the poorer consumers.
Since early March, the control measures have been gradually relaxed, on a
province by province basis. Provinces are to be declared free from HPAI
after a lapse of 30 days since the last outbreak. Markets are re-opening
and the poultry trade is beginning to return to normal with the
normalisation of prices for other commodities as well. However, despite the
apparent disappearance of the disease, it is still too early to say that
the virus has been totally eliminated from all regions of the country.
It is in this period of renewed activity, and particularly when restocking
of infected areas is allowed to start, that the veterinary and other
supporting forces of government must be on continuous alert to any
re-emergence of the infection and its timely reporting. Recognizing this,
the Government is proposing a stringent programme of testing for all
breeding farms before they may once more begin to supply chicks to the
sector. It is also exercising a 3 month delay before allowing depopulated
farms to restock, and even then will impose strict conditions, regular
inspection, and monitoring of these farms for at least 3 weeks after their
restocking takes place.
