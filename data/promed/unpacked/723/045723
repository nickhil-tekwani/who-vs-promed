A dog named Darwin struggles to survive deadly disease
------------------------------------------------------
Darwin has been, and is being, evolved. For the past 5 months, [Darwin's owner] brought Darwin, his white German shepherd puppy, for daily dips into a campus pond at Florida Institute of Technology [FIT].

Darwin loved to swim. The dog, now 17 months old, gleefully fetched tennis balls and leapt into the pond, getting all muddied up -- like puppies do.

But it was there that man's best friend would meet his worst enemy: _Pythium insidiosum_. This rare, potentially fatal fungus-like organism would ultimately send Darwin into a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, and claim his oft-wagging tail and some tissue from his left hip.

And Darwin's struggle for survival still isn't over.

"If left untreated, it is fatal -- in humans as well," said [the dog's owner], a PhD student in chemistry at FIT. "The problem is many vets are not familiar with it."

[Darwin's owner] wants to warn other pet owners, especially those with German shepherds, about the risks of allowing pets to enter Florida ponds, lakes, or swamps, where potentially deadly pathogens like _Pythium_ lurk.

"German shepherds are a breed we see a lot of _Pythium_, and we don't know why," said Dr Justin Shmalberg, clinical assistant professor of integrative medicine who recently treated Darwin at University of Florida's Small Animal Hospital in Gainesville. [If Dr Shmalberg treated this dog, then presumably he is a veterinarian. - Mod.TG]

On [24 Jul 2015], Goldberg noticed a large, draining ulcer on the underside of Darwin's tail. He rushed his dog to a vet in Indian Harbour Beach, who diagnosed Darwin's condition as a bacterial skin infection and gave him an antibiotic injection.

A week passed. Darwin's ulcer worsened.

[Darwin's owner] searched the web for other skin conditions that might produce similar ulcers. He narrowed it down to pythiosis.

Darwin's deadly disease, also called "swamp cancer," affects horses, dogs, cats, and cattle. But even humans can be infected by _P. insidiosum_. The origin of this species is the warm-water swamps, lakes, and ponds of tropical and subtropical areas. The organism thrives in warm waters in Gulf of Mexico states, such as Florida and Louisiana, especially in the summer. It can enter the body through wounds on the skin or by drinking the water, which is much more dangerous.

The organism can cling to soil and grass, too, but it doesn't cause infection from those sources nearly as often.

"They're almost like bacteria, but they have features that are sort of like a fungus," Shmalberg explained. "They are sort of a distinct part of the evolutionary tree ... This is the same class that caused potato blight," he said, referring to the resulting potato famines in Europe and Ireland in the 1840s.

This branch of the evolutionary tree left Darwin in dire straits. After the dog's ulcers worsened, [his owner] bought Darwin to an animal hospital in Palm Bay and asked the vet to test for the rare disease. But the vet said that a secondary bacterial infection prevented a valid biopsy and prescribed an oral antibiotic and a topical wash, [EG] said. "Most vets don't know to look for it," He said. He knew he had to act fast or lose his beloved pet.

After discovering that the University of Florida [UF] had experience treating pythiosis in horses, [his owner] decided to drive Darwin 3 hours to UF's Small Animal Hospital emergency room in Gainesville.

They anesthetized Darwin and performed biopsies. They ruled out other fungal infections and cancer.

The diagnostic test for pythiosis would take a few days. So the vets bandaged Darwin up, and [his owner] drove him home to Melbourne.

On [5 Aug 2015], UF called. The tests showed a preliminary positive identification for _Pythium_.

The next day, [his owner] drove Darwin back to Gainesville, where the dog underwent a CT scan to check to see if the organism had infected his gastrointestinal tract and to evaluate surgical options.

They put Darwin in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Pure oxygen has been shown to inhibit growth of the organism. The next day, surgeons removed his tail and tissue from his hip.

As of [7 Aug 2015], the cost of Darwin's treatments have come to USD 5300. So [his owner] has started an online crowd-funding campaign to help raise money for Darwin's medical bills, which will continue to mount. Darwin will require follow up medications and tests over the next year. The surgery was not a cure. The skin ulcers often return. The next few months will tell.

"At this stage, we'd be very hesitant to say he's been cured from the disease," Shmalberg said. "When we think about infections from ponds, this is probably the worst one to get."

But risk of pythiosis is very low in dogs and humans, he said, and no cause for alarm or for keeping all dogs out of the water all the time.

Dogs can't spread the infection to humans, Shmalberg said, and most healthy dogs can fend off the organism.

"Probably thousands of dogs are exposed to it per year -- and people as well -- and they don't develop infections," said Shmalberg, who treats several dogs a year for the pathogen.

Water moccasins and alligators pose a much greater risk in Florida ponds than _Pythium_, he said.

Just to be safe, pet owners should use caution during warmer months, he added, and avoid stagnant waters. And they should ask their vet about pythiosis if antibiotics fail to cure their pet's skin infection.

Darwin takes more than a dozen pills a day.

Since returning home, his appetite has gradually returned. As his wounds heal, Darwin must adapt. For now, he can't run, jump, or roughhouse with other dogs. Vet's orders.

He wears a blue Elizabethan collar, so he won't lick or chew his stitches. He no longer swims. He no longer has a tail to wag.

Darwin shows affection, excitement, and loyalty in other ways: with his ears, eyes, and vocal cords. He barks and growls bashfully at strangers. [His ownerb]'s embraces calm the young shepherd.

Darwin will adapt.

[This is a sad story for Darwin, and we hope he improves. All pet owners and veterinarians, this one needs to be on your radar of differentials.
