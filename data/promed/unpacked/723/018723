[Fowl typhoid and pullorum disease are among the most important diseases of poultry. These conditions are caused by 2 very closely related organisms, which were once thought to be different species but have recently been classified as biovars of _Salmonella enterica_ subsp. enterica_. Pullorum disease is usually symptomatic only in young birds. The mortality rate varies, but it can be as high as 100 percent. Fowl typhoid resembles pullorum disease in young birds, but it is also a serious concern in growing and adult poultry. The control of these diseases is complicated by vertical transmission: hens can become subclinically infected carriers, and pass the infections to their embryos in the egg. Fowl typhoid and pullorum disease have been eradicated from commercial poultry in many developed countries including the United States and Canada, but they may persist in backyard poultry flocks and game birds.

Pullorum disease is an increasing concern in pheasant chicks. On rare occasions, these diseases have been reintroduced to commercial chicken or turkey farms.

While this information sheds more light on the disease itself, it may even shed some light on why this disease is hard to track. It may stay "underground", as in not reported and perhaps not recognized, or may be that it is relatively endemic in the courtry, and reported only when it affects the commercial poultry industry.

[It is hard to put this report in place as there are uneven reports of fowl typhoid reports for Central America in OIE and in ProMED-mail; it was reported by OIE in Belize in 2011, and in Honduras in 2010, but absent from Guatemala, and no reports either way from Panama and Nicaragua. Logically it has been there all along, just waiting to be found. - Mod.MHJ
