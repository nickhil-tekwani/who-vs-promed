2 million people suffering from Schistosomiasis in the Sudan
------------------------------------------------------------
Bahr Idriss Abu Garda Federal Minister of Health reports that there are some 2 million people in the Sudan suffering from schistosomiasis, with the state of North Kordofan recording the highest rate of 70 percent.

Abu Garda acknowledged during his address yesterday [24 Dec 2012], on "Bilharzia disease Silent Killer," that surveys confirmed the high incidence of the disease and called for International organizations to cooperate with the ministries to eradicate the disease.

For his part, Gabriel Noman the schistosomiasis program manager at the Federal Ministry of Health, said that schistosomiasis is 2nd after malaria (in the Sudan) but it is dangerous, and the number of cases of acute gastrointestinal bleeding referred to hospitals amounted to 6000, 10 of which developed bladder cancer. He demanded that the state give political commitment and material to combat the disease.

[A recent survey of schistosomiasis in Southern Kardofan State found that "the prevalence of _S. haematobium_ was 6.9 percent among the adult population" and that "the infection was associated with non-preference of latrine use." (Abou-Zeid AH et al. Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths among an adult population in a war affected area, Southern Kordofan state, Sudan. Parasit Vectors. 2012;5:133).

A study from Sudan of the efficacy of praziquantel, PZQ, found that "a single dose of PZQ reduced the prevalence of _S. haematobium_ by 83.3 percent (from 51.4 percent to 8.6 percent) and the geometric mean intensity of infection of positive individuals by 17.0 percent (from 87.7 to 72.8 eggs/10ml of urine) one year after treatment." and that "there was a significantly higher reduction of intensity of _S. haematobium_ infection among girls in comparison with boys." (Ahmed AM et al. Schistosoma haematobium infections among schoolchildren in central Sudan one year after treatment with praziquantel. Parasit Vectors. 2012;5:108). - Mod.EP]
