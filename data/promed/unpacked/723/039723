Rift Valley Fever Death Toll Rises to 109
-----------------------------------------
RIYADH: The death toll from Rift Valley fever (RVF), [caused by a virus
that has affected the Arabian peninsula for more than 2 months, has risen
to 109 in Saudi Arabia, the Health Ministry said on Fri 15 Dec 2000. "[A
total of 109 people have died from RVF up [to Saturday afternoon," the
Health Ministry said in a statement published by the official SPA news
agency. It [stated that 793 people had contracted the illness, of whom
665 had left hospital after [recovery. The symptoms of Rift Valley fever
include haemorrhagic fever, encephalitis and eye problems, although human
deaths are supposed to be rare, according to experts. The virus is usually
contracted from mosquitoes, or by contact with the blood, bodily fluids or
organs of infected animals.

date of assessment of the death toll. This may be a consequence of
different agencies reporting in different time zones. The number of
deaths, however, is not in dispute. - Mod.CP
