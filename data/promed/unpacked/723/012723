From: William Keene <keene@OHSU.EDU>

I don't have any first-hand knowledge about this, but I heard a fascinating
and possible quite relevant talk at the VTEC (Verotoxigenic E. coli) '97
meeting in Baltimore in June 1997. These guys (from ?Oklahoma, I think) had
solved the mystery of hemorrhagic colitis and kidney failure that was
killing greyhounds at the local track. Turns out that they are a pretty
good model for Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections, and indeed the illness
almost certainly stemmed from the apparently common practice of feeding
racing dogs raw meat. This diet has some kind of folk status as keeping the
animals in racing trim, although the speaker implied that the idea was
hogwash. Needless to say, the dogs were not being fed prime cuts, either,
and no effort was made to keep it refrigerated, &c. In other words, it was
pretty much what you might expect from feeding them raw meat. The authors
mentioned that this "mystery epizootic" was by no means unknown to
greyhound trainers nationwide.
Not knowing anything about how dog tracks are set up, I would have to
speculate that there might also be ample potential for dog-to-dog
transmission (not to mention dog-to-human). The authors went on to do a
number of experimental studies with greyhounds, suggesting that they might
indeed be a useful animal model.
If this sounds at all plausible, one could culture the stools for O157:H7
on appropriate media. It shouldn't be that hard to pick up if you have
fresh specimens.
