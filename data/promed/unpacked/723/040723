UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS - INDIA (EAST BENGAL): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Three members of a family have died of an unknown disease in Nadias
Betai village since February 2007. Health officials said a
35-year-old man died on 11 Feb 2007 after complaining of severe
headache, abdominal pain and diarrhea. His brother and wife, who died
this month [April 2007], also had the same symptoms. A medical team
has been sent to the village, about 150 km from Calcutta.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley, Ph.D
[Dr. Dudley has commented that the village referred to in this report
is located in the eastern district of West Bengal, close to the
border with Bangladesh, and near districts in western Bangladesh
where several outbreaks of Nipah virus infection have been reported,
including Kushtia, where currently there is a suspected Nipah
outbreak (see ProMED-mail post archived as Undiagnosed deaths,
encephalitis - Bangladesh (Kushtia)(02): Nipah, RFI 20070423.1330).
These 2 areas were in fact part of a single administrative district
in pre-partition India; see:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushtia_District>.
The geographic proximity of the Indian and Bangladesh outbreaks,
previous epidemiology features and clinical presentation are reasons
for suspecting the involvement of Nipah virus infection in these
outbreaks. Confirmation of preliminary laboratory diagnosis of Nipah
virus infection in several of the Bangladesh patients is awaited.
As in the original outbreak of Nipah virus infection in Malaysia in
1998, death may occur in 40-75 percent of human cases. The natural
reservoir for Nipah virus and related members of the genus
_Henipavirus_ are fruit bats of the genus _Pteropus_. Nipah virus
emerged in Malaysia in 1998 as a porcine neurological and respiratory
disease that spread to humans who had contact with live
virus-infected pigs. Nipah virus caused 5 subsequent outbreaks
between 2001 and 2005 in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, it appears to
have spilled over directly from bats to humans, and person-to-person
transmission was evident, suggesting a heightened public health risk.
Infection has also been associated with consumption of fruit
contaminated by bat saliva or urine. The presentation of Nipah virus
infection has been variable, ranging from the high mortality observed
in the original Malaysian outbreak to an outbreak of low mortality
disease among abattoir workers in Singapore, presenting as
neurological illness and atypical pneumonia.
During January and February 2001, an outbreak of febrile illness
associated with neurological features was observed in Siliguri, West
Bengal. Clinical material obtained during the Siliguri outbreak was
retrospectively analyzed for evidence of Nipah virus infection. Nipah
virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies were
detected in 9 of 18 patients. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assays detected RNA from NiV in urine samples from
5 patients. Sequence analysis confirmed that the PCR products were
derived from Nipah RNA and suggested that the Nipah from Siliguri was
more closely related to Nipah virus isolates from Bangladesh than to
Nipah virus isolates from Malaysia. It has been suggested that a
"Nipah belt" may exist in Bengal. Further information on the identity
of the etiologic agent in the current outbreak in the Indian region
of Bengal would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
