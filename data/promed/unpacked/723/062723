A Cuba-born New York high school teacher says it was bad enough that he contracted cholera during a family visit to Havana this summer [2013]. Then he got a bill from the government hospital -- USD 4700. His complaint came as Havana reported that a total of 12 foreign tourists and 151 Cubans have come down with cholera in recent months, although the teacher says his hospital ward alone had 6 to 15 foreigners on every one of the 6 days that he spent there.

The Havana report on cholera, the 2nd in August [2013] alone, seemed to hint at a growing transparency by Cuban officials who previously kept quiet about the disease in a bid to avoid damaging the island's USD 2.5 billion-a-year tourism industry, experts said.

A bulletin by the Pan American Health Organization [PAHO, on Fri 23 Aug 2013] said Cuba that same day had reported 163 cases in the provinces of Havana, Santiago de Cuba, and Camaguey. PAHO, the hemispheric branch of the WHO, indicated that those cases took place in 2013 but gave no specific time frame.

Among those cases were 12 persons who had traveled to Cuba from other countries -- 3 from Italy, 2 each from Germany, Spain, Chile, and Venezuela, and 1 from the Netherlands, PAHO noted. Cuba had reported 6 of those cases to PAHO earlier in August 2013.

Independent journalists and visitors like the high school teacher have been reporting hundreds more cases never confirmed by Cuba, where the state-run news media virtually never uses the word "cholera" and instead refers to cases of "acute diarrheic diseases."

The teacher, 49, who left Cuba in 1997 said he and 2 relatives were hit by intense diarrhea 2 days after they ate together at a state-run restaurant in Havana in late July 2013. Doctors at the Manuel Fajardo Hospital told them they had cholera, he said, and transferred him to the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical Medicine, where the 4th floor of the hospital is reserved for foreigners who contract the disease.

That same week more than 60 Cubans were being treated in Kouri hospital wards reserved for island residents with cholera, he said, and a nephew told him that a large number of people had been struck by the disease in the Havana suburb of Mantilla.

The treatment for foreigners at the hospital was very good and much better than the treatment for island residents, he added, but problems started when the foreign patients received huge bills as they were about the leave the hospital.

Cuba technically requires all visitors from abroad to obtain separate Cuban health insurance policies, which usually are purchased on arrival at an airport. It is not clear why those policies would not have paid for the foreigners' stays at the Kouri hospital.

Cholera reappeared in Cuba last summer [2012], after a 100-year absence, with the return of Cuban medical personnel who had worked in Haiti, where an epidemic has killed more than 8200 people since 2010. Havana has confirmed only 3 deaths on the island, although independent journalists have reported dozens more.

The number of people affected by cholera in the Dominican southern province of San Cristobal increased to 50 percent this weekend [24-25 Aug 2013], medical sources said here Mon 26 Aug 2013.

Doctor Manuel Geraldino, director of the Juan Pablo Pina Hospital, said 17 new cases were hospitalized between Saturday and Sunday [24-25 Aug 2013], the most serious, a woman with 38 weeks of pregnancy. Public Health Vice Minister Rafael Schiffino said the incidence of the outbreak may have its origin in the difficulties for drinkable water supply and the trash recollection.

After more than 100 years of absence, the disease was registered in the Dominican Republic in November 2010, one month after it had appeared in Haiti.

For almost 3 years, 25 000 cases were reported, the last of them at the northern province of Espaillat at the end of 2012.
