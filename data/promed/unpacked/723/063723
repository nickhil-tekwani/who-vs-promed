San Diego County health officials reported 3 new Shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 18 confirmed and 3 probable cases among individuals experiencing homelessness. The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between [16 Aug 2021] and [15 Oct 2021], with the 3 new cases occurring between [20 Sep 2021] and [15 Oct 2021]. The 21 cases in this outbreak represent 7.6% of the 275 total cases reported to date in San Diego County. The cases are all among individuals experiencing homelessness who resided at multiple locations in central San Diego. No source of the outbreak has currently been identified.

Clinical manifestations of shigellosis range from watery or loose stools with minimal symptoms to more severe illness including high fever, abdominal cramps or tenderness, tenesmus, and mucoid stools with or without blood. Symptoms usually resolve in 5 to 7 days but sometimes last for 4 or more weeks. Asymptomatic infection is possible.

Shigella bacteria are present in the stools of infected people while they have diarrhea, and for up to 4 weeks after symptoms resolve. The primary mode of transmission is fecal-oral, although transmission can also occur via contact with a contaminated fomite, ingesting contaminated food or water, or sexual contact. The incubation period is 1 to 7 days, but is usually less than 4 days.

[This cluster parallels the beginning of the hepatitis A epidemic occurring in many states in the USA which began in the homeless in San Diego county (Hepatitis A - USA (46): (CA) fatal Archive Number: 20171017.5386460).

Shigella was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL
