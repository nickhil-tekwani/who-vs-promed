Recently, several cases of yellow fever have been reported in Amazonian
Brazil, and one in French Guiana. Now, ProMED-mail has heard of suspected
cases in Suriname, the country bordered by French Guiana and Guyana.
If yellow fever is indeed spreading, we may expect to see cases in Guyana
also, and in neighboring areas of Venezuela, from which infected mosquitoes
could carry it to Trinidad, as it has in the past, and threaten the
Caribbean, where the urban yellow fever mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, is
widespread.
So far the cases are reported from jungle areas in the interior, with no
urban cases. But medical authorities in the towns of Guyana, French Guiana
& Suriname should be looking for cases of clinical hepatitis with an eye to
the possibility that they might in fact be yellow fever; medical
laboratories in the capitals should make sure they can diagnose the disease
rapidly; and health authorities should seriously consider the need to
vaccinate in the towns and capitals.
Vaccination requirements
------------------------
Source: International Travel & Health: Vaccination Requirements and Health
Advice, WHO, 1996. Updated information is available on the WHO website:
www.who.ch
BRAZIL: YF vaccination is REQUIRED for travellers from infected areas, and
is RECOMMENDED for travellers to the Amazon & forested areas.
FRENCH GUIANA: REQUIRED for all travellers over 1 year of age.
GUYANA: REQUIRED for travellers from infected areas, and from a long list
of African & South American countries.
SURINAME: REQUIRED for travellers from infected areas.
................................
Regardless of whether vaccination is required or not, it is strongly
recommended that all travellers to YF endemic zones in South America &
Africa receive the vaccine, which is safe, painless, and one dose is valid
for 10 years.
