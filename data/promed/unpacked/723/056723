Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype O
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: Makung City, [Penghu]
Date of start of the outbreak: 22 Mar 2011
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species: Swine
Susceptible: 30
Cases: 30
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 30
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: a slaughterhouse

Outbreak 2 Makung City, [Penghu]
Date of start of the outbreak: 22 Mar 2011
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species: Swine
Susceptible: 969
Cases: 110
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 969
Slaughtered: 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: 30 pigs, which have been transported to a
slaughterhouse for slaughter from a pig farm in Penghu Island, were
found with vesicular lesions. The incident was reported by the
prefecture animal disease control competent authority and the sick
pigs were immediately destroyed on 22 Mar 2011 after sampling. The
prefecture animal disease control competent authority traced back to
the farm of origin. The clinical investigation has shown that 110 pigs
in the farm of origin have the same vesicular lesions. All pigs in the
index farm were completely destroyed on 23 Mar 2011.
Enforced biosecurity measures including movement control, cleaning,
and disinfection have been implemented both in the slaughterhouse and
the index farm.
The positive results of real-time PCR tests were provided by the
national laboratory and confirmed that those pigs were infected with
foot-and-mouth disease virus, serotype O. One goat farm and one cattle
farm within 3-km [2 mi] radius of the index farm have been under
vigilant monitoring and no clinical or epidemiological evidence of
infection has been found. All cloven-hoofed animal farms of Penghu
Island have been put under movement control until the investigation
was completed.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside
the country; screening; disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of
affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Research Institute (national
laboratory)
Species: Swine
Test: real-time PCR
Test date: 23 Mar 2011
Result: positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[A little over a year ago 6 swine were found to have FMD in the same
district, Penghu. Taiwan does seem to have an ongoing problem with
introductions of the disease since 2009, with introductions and then
successful stamping out only to be followed by introduction again.
This kind of cycle makes epidemiologists very uncomfortable because if
the disease is introduced repeatedly one of these eradication efforts
may not be on time and a major epidemic is underway. Stamping out
quickly is an especially important disease control tactic for FMD in
Taiwan and elsewhere. Furthermore, Taiwan has suffered devastating
losses from FMD in swine in 1997 and markets in Taiwan have never
really recovered fully.

The disease has manifested over the last couple of years in both the
clinically obvious form as was the case here and the subclinical form,
which is decidedly harder to identify. - Mod PC]
