Two more deaths in children attributed to influenza
---------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) today
announced that 2 additional Minnesota children
with influenza have died. The deaths, together
with that of an 8-year-old Ramsey County boy last
week, bring Minnesota's total to 3. The
additional deaths occurred in another 8-year-old
and a 17-month-old. One of the additional cases
resided in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, and
one in greater Minnesota. All 3 children became
ill between 18 Jan 2007 and 1 Feb 2007.

"We are deeply saddened by these deaths and our
sympathies go out to the families of these
children," said Minnesota Health Commissioner
Dianne Mandernach. "While these deaths do not
necessarily suggest that there is anything
unusual about this season's flu, they serve to
underscore that influenza always has the
potential to be a very serious illness, even a
killer." she said. "The best way to protect
against influenza is through vaccination. It's not too late."

Although influenza is a serious illness,
flu-related deaths are uncommon in children,
according to Kristen Ehresmann, section chief for
immunizations for MDH. Most flu deaths occur in
older people, or people with underlying medical
conditions. But unfortunately, children do sometimes die of the flu.

The number of pediatric flu deaths in Minnesota
can vary from one season to the next. Some years,
there may be several flu deaths in children. In
other years, there may be none at all.
Nationwide, there has not been an uncommonly high
number of flu deaths in children. So far this
year, 13 children have died of the flu, including
Minnesota's 3. "That's still 13 too many but
unfortunately, that's not an unusual number," Ehresmann said.

Minnesota has had an increasing number of flu
outbreaks in schools recently, and the number of
reported outbreaks is higher than in recent
years. MDH has received reports of 224 influenza
outbreaks in schools this season; 190 (85
percent) were reported within the past 3 weeks.
By comparison, 199 school influenza outbreaks
were reported during the entire 2005-2006 season.
"However, the number of outbreaks is still not
more than we might expect to see in a year with
increased flu activity," Ehresmann said. Recent
years have been relatively mild for flu overall.

"If there can be any good news in something like
this, it would be that the predominant strain
that is out there is the H1 strain that is well
matched to the vaccine this season," Ehresmann
said. "Getting children or anyone vaccinated
now would still provide protection for the rest
of the season. Influenza disease is currently
widespread in Minnesota; however, we may not yet have reached our peak."

Vaccine in the state is reported to be in good
supply, health officials said. So those seeking
flu shots should be able to find them. People
interested in receiving vaccine should contact
their healthcare provider, their local public
health agency, or check the Minnesota Department
of Health website at and click
on Find a Flu Shot Clinic. Besides getting
vaccinated, thorough, frequent hand washing,
using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand
sanitizer, is also a very effective defense against influenza.

Influenza is spread when people who have the
illness cough or sneeze, expelling tiny droplets
of fluid that contain the virus into the air.

The virus can be spread directly through the air,
or by people touching contaminated surfaces or
objects and then touching their eyes or nose.
