Dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever for the first six months 1997 have
increased 118% compared to the corresponding period last year. Until June
28, health authorities nationwide were notified of 9,151 cases, with 22
deaths.
The viruses responsible are mainly dengue-1 followed by dengue-2 with very
few cases of dengue-3. Dengue-1 was the predominant virus in 1987 and 1988
and dengue-2 was active between 1989 and 1991.
>From 1 January to 28 June 1997, 86 cases of DHF/DSS [dengue hemorrhagic
fever/dengue shock syndrome] have been confirmed by the WHO Collaborating
Centre for DF/DHF. For the same period last year, only 31 severe cases were
diagnosed by the WHO Centre. 10% of the severe cases this year showed CNS
manifestations, including fits, epilepsy, meningitis and encephalitis.
A case of vertical transmission has been confirmed this season. Last year,
there were two such cases which resulted in the death of an infant who
developed respiratory distress and a large uncontrollable left intracerebral
bleed and the child expired at day 6 of life from multiorgan failure. Dengue-
2 virus was isolated from this fatal case.
Based on previous epidemiological patterns, it is expected that the outbreak
will peak in the next few weeks. The WHO Centre has alerted clinicians to
the possibility of these unusual presentations and to monitor their patients
closely.
The whole nation has been put on the alert and aggressive integrated control
programmes have been taken by the respective ministries and agencies.

[Thanks once again to Ken Lam for keeping us apprised of the situation in
Malaysia. How helpful it would be if all countries were as forthcoming and
responsible about their disease problems as is Malaysia. -- Mod CHC]
