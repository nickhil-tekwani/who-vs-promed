Just days after Worth County schools reopened after being shut down
for 2 days because of a shigellosis outbreak, Southwest Georgia Public
Health officials told us the illness has spread to at least 6
Southwest Georgia counties. They include Worth, Dougherty, Lee, Early,
Seminole, and Decatur County.

"It doesn't take a lot of the bacteria to cause infection, so this one
is a more difficult one to eradicate quickly," said district health
director Dr Jacqueline Grant. To prevent the spread of _Shigella_,
doctors recommend that you wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap
and warm water. Make sure to get in between the web of your fingers
and when you're done, dry your hands completely.

[It is difficult to assess how large this outbreak of shigellosis is
since no numbers are given. With cases occurring over 6 counties, the
number of infections may be large. As can be seen on a map of the
counties in the state of Georgia at
http://www.n-georgia.com/images/ga-counties-parks-map.gif, the 6
counties are all located in the southwestern part of the state but
several counties (Calhoun, Miller, Baker, and Mitchell) geographically
separate Lee, Dougherty, and Worth counties from Early, Seminole, and
Decatur. If this is all one outbreak strain, food, or students or both
had to be interchanged. - Mod.LL]
