Scientists find new strain of HIV
---------------------------------
Infections of SIV [simian immunodeficiency virus] among gorillas seem
quite low. Gorillas have been found, for the 1st time, to be a source
of HIV [human immunodeficiency virus]. Previous research had shown
the HIV-1 strain, the main source of human infections, with 33
million cases worldwide, originated from a virus in chimpanzees.

But researchers have now discovered an HIV infection in a Cameroonian
woman which is clearly linked to a gorilla strain, Nature Medicine
[Nature Medicine Volume 15 No 7. 2009] reports. A researcher told the
BBC that, though it was a new type of HIV, current drugs might still
help combat its effects. "There's no reason to believe this virus
will present any new problems, as it were, that we don't already face."

Although HIV/AIDS was 1st recognised by scientists in the 1980s, it
is thought to have 1st entered the human population early in the 20th
century in the region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The virus
probably originally jumped into humans after people came into contact
with infected bush meat. SIV viruses have been reported in other
primates, including gorillas.

French doctors treating a 62-year-old Cameroonian woman who was
living in Paris said they initially spotted some discrepancies in
routine viral load tests. Further analysis of the HIV strain she was
infected with showed it was more closely related to SIV from gorillas
than HIV from humans. She is the only person known to be infected
with the new strain, but the researchers expect to find other cases.

Before moving to Paris, she had lived in a semi-urban area of
Cameroon and had no contact with gorillas or bush meat, suggesting
she caught the virus from someone else who was carrying the gorilla
strain. Analysis of the virus in the laboratory has confirmed that it
can replicate in human cells. Co-author Dr David Robertson, from the
University of Manchester, said it was the 1st definitive transfer of
HIV seen from a source other than a chimpanzee, and highlighted the
need to monitor for the emergence of new strains. "This demonstrates
that HIV evolution is an ongoing process. The virus can jump from
species to species, from primate to primate, and that includes us;
pathogens have been with us for millions of years and routinely
switch host species. The fact the patient had been diagnosed in
France showed how human mobility can rapidly transfer a virus from
one area of the world to another."

Speaking to the BBC's Wold Today programme, Dr Robertson said there
was no reason to believe that existing drugs would not work on the
new virus. "If some day we do manage to develop a vaccine, there's no
reason to believe it wouldn't work," he said.

Professor Paul Sharp, from the University of Edinburgh, said the
virus probably initially transferred from chimpanzees to gorillas. He
said the latest finding was interesting but perhaps not surprising.
"The medical implication is that, because this virus is not very
closely related to the other 3 HIV-1 groups, it is not detected by
conventional tests. So the virus could be cryptically spreading in
the population." However, he said that he would guess it would not
spread widely and become a major problem. "Although the patient with
this virus was not ill, there is no reason to believe that it will
not lead to AIDS," he added.

Scientists Find New Human HIV From Gorillas
-------------------------------------------
Scientists who found a new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a
Cameroonian woman living in Paris, have discovered it is an unusual
variant of HIV-1 that could have come from gorillas. The research
that led to the findings was headed by Dr Jean-Christophe Plantier of
the University of Rouen in France and is published in the 2 Aug 2009
online issue of Nature Medicine. Drs David Robertson and Jonathan
Dickerson from the Faculty of Life Sciences at The University of
Manchester, UK, were also involved in the study.

There are 3 established lineages of HIV-1, known as M, N, and O,
which came from chimpanzees, but this new variant appears to be the
prototype of a new lineage derived from gorillas and shows no
evidence of recombination with the other known lineages, wrote the
researchers. They propose that the new lineage be called HIV-1 group P.

There are 33 million people worldwide living with AIDS which is
caused by the HIV-1 virus group M (groups N and O are mainly confined
to Cameroon). HIV is a product of cross-species transmission of
simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) found in chimpanzees, thought to
have crossed to humans from eating infected bush meat. While 1st
recognized in 1980, HIV is thought to have started some 80 years
earlier in and around the African country that is now called the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

The 62-year old Cameroonian woman at the centre of the study moved to
Paris in 2004 and began to have symptoms shortly afterwards. Her
blood sample showed discrepancies in her viral load, and further
tests revealed she was infected with a new strain of HIV that more
closely resembled SIV from gorillas than HIV from humans. However,
before moving to Paris the woman had lived in a semi-urban part of
the central west African Republic of Cameroon; she had not come into
contact with bush meat or gorillas.

Because of this information and the fact further tests showed that
the virus was able to replicate in human cells, the scientists
suggest the strain may well appear elsewhere. Robertson told the
media that: "The discovery of this novel HIV-1 lineage highlights the
continuing need to monitor closely for the emergence of new HIV
variants. This demonstrates that HIV evolution is an ongoing process.
The virus can jump from species to species, from primate to primate,
and that includes us; pathogens have been with us for millions of
years and routinely switch host species," he added.

In the same way as the current swine flu pandemic is showing us, this
is another example of how viruses can now move very quickly around
the world because nowadays large numbers of humans travel long
distances in a short space of time.

Plantier's team in France are part of a network of laboratories that
has been monitoring HIV genetic diversity, while The Manchester Life
Sciences team helped with the computer-based evolutionary analysis.

Summary:
--------
We have identified a new human immunodeficiency virus in a
Cameroonian woman. It is closely related to gorilla simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIVgor) and shows no evidence of
recombination with other HIV-1 lineages. This new virus seems to be
the prototype of a new HIV-1 lineage that is distinct from HIV-1
groups M, N and O. We propose to designate it HIV-1 group P.
