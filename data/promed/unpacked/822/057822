A 4-member team of the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, is
in Gorakhpur, hoping to crack the code of the mystery virus that has
killed over 100 people in Uttar Pradesh. The team has been assigned
the job of ascertaining the nature and characteristics of the virus,
how it is spreading, and eventually to find a way to control it so as
to provide guidelines to the state government that will implement
them as preventive measures.

Speaking to TOI on Friday [21 Aug 2009], AC Mishra, director, NIV,
Pune said, "Our team has been working in Gorakhpur for a long time,
particularly to study this virus. They are doing a surveillance of
the environment and the breed of mosquitoes and trying to understand
which family the virus hails from."

Since January [2009], UP has recorded 665 cases of acute encephalitis
syndrome (AES) a severe neurological condition associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. Around 137 people have already
succumbed to the viral infection.

When contacted, Milind Gore, who is leading the NIV team in
Gorakhpur, told TOI, "Since the virus is not entirely known and we
are still unable to distinctly classify it, we are finding out the
percentage of its presence in the environment and its transmission
into the body. We have noticed that most times it is found in
children. We know that it is an enterovirus."

This mystery virus has been causing brain fever and killing people in
UP since last year [2008] but no breakthrough has been made regarding
the virus's identity and nature. Gore said, "Right now we are trying
to figure out how many people have been infected by the virus, what
is the mode of spreading and in what other diseases is the virus or
its characteristics found."

Initially, a 4-member team went to Gorakhpur and started work on the
study. However, a full-fledged centre will soon be established and
more people will be recruited for this study. The NIV team is closely
working with experts from the Centre for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) Atlanta. "We are sharing the results of our finding
with the American team and vice-versa. We are working together and
the aim of both these teams is to know more about the virus," Gore
added.

Once the case of the mystery virus is solved, the team will be
recommending guidelines to the Uttar Pradesh government as well as
the preventive measures that can be implemented to curb the spreading
of virus.

It's a virus that has already claimed over 100 lives but Indian and
American scientists seem to have no clue about what it is. Since
January [2009], the state has recorded 665 cases of acute
encephalitis syndrome (AES) -- a severe neurological condition
associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Around 137
people have already succumbed to the viral infection.

Lab investigations have revealed that only 34 of the cases and 4 of
the deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis [virus infection] --
a known scourge in the state. However, scientists have no clue what
caused the rest of the 133 encephalitis deaths and 631 cases.
According to officials, this mystery virus has been causing brain
fever and killing people in UP since last year [2008] but no
breakthrough has been made regarding the virus's identity and nature.

Experts from Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Atlanta
had picked up 150 samples from UP to help identify the virus. But
they too have failed to make any headway. Speaking to TOI, director
of National Institute of Virology (Gorakhpur) Dr Milind Gore said,
"We are working on identifying the virus and its origin. At present
we don't know what's causing these cases of AES and deaths. We
suspect it could be a type of enterovirus."

Dr Gore added, "It is clear that JE [virus] alone isn't causing AES.
We recently checked 450 stool swabs and found that 68 percent of them
were positive for enteroviruses. However, we don't know exactly which
one from this family of viruses is the dominant one behind the
deaths. Even CDC experts haven't figured it out." Officials said the
search for the "real culprit" behind the AES cases had taken a
beating in the last few months with scientists in NIV Pune drowned
with H1N1 samples.

"H1N1 has proved to be a setback for the work on encephalitis in UP.
Improved methods of diagnosis and new primers were to be tested
against the unknown virus. But everybody at NIV Pune is busy with
H1N1," an official said.

AES is characterised by inflammation of the brain, seizures, and
convulsions among children.

International NGO PATH's senior programme officer for JE Dr Pritu
Dhalaria told TOI, "Usually, around 4-5 enteroviruses work in tandem,
in clusters in particular areas. It is therefore difficult to
identify exactly which virus is the deadly one. By this time last
year [2008], UP had recorded 435 AES cases of which only 15 were
caused by JE [virus]. This year [2009], the cases have increased, and
we don't know which virus is behind it."

Non-polio enteroviruses are very common across the globe. They are
2nd only to the common cold viruses, the rhinoviruses, as the most
common viral infectious agents in humans. Although infection often
has no symptoms and goes unnoticed, these viruses are also associated
with occasional outbreaks in which a larger-than-usual number of
patients develop clinical disease, sometimes with fatal consequences.
Transmission of enterovirus infections is increased by poor hygiene
and overcrowded living conditions. Measures that can be taken to
avoid getting infected with enteroviruses include frequent hand
washing.

Enteroviruses can be found in the respiratory secretions and stool of
an infected person. Other persons may become infected by direct
contact with secretions from an infected person or by contact with
contaminated surfaces or objects.

According to some experts, UP has seen a nearly 40 percent increase
in AES cases this year [2009], majority of them not belonging to the
enterovirus category.

[Clearly, some of these cases of encephalitis were cause by JE virus
infections. The 1st report above states that the non-JE cases were
caused by an enterovirus. The 2nd report is confusing, stating that
unidentified enteroviruses are involved but ending by saying the
majority were not. The basis on which these statements were made
would be of interest.

ProMED-mail requests further information about the etiology of these
encephalitis cases as it becomes available.

Encephalitis of enterovirus etiology has occurred previously in this
area, as reported in the following reference:
Sapkal GN, Bondre VP, Fulmali PV, Patil P, Gopalkrishna V, Dadhania
V, et al. 2009: Enteroviruses in patients with acute encephalitis,
Uttar Pradesh, India. Emerg Infect Dis. 15: 295-8 (full article
available at <http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/2/pdfs/08-0865.pdf>)

Abstract
--------
An outbreak of viral encephalitis occurred in northern India in 2006.
Attempts to identify an etiologic agent in cerebrospinal fluid by
using reverse transcription-PCR showed positivity to enterovirus (EV)
in 66 of 306 patients. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of PCR
products from 59 of 66 specimens showed similarity with EV-89 and
EV-76 sequences.
