Report on the H5N1 Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) Isolate in
Italy - November 2005
--------------------------------------------------
On 8 Nov 2005, a type A influenza virus isolate was submitted to the
National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza in Legnaro (Padova,
Italy) for detailed characterization. The virus was isolated from a
cloacal swab collected from a wild duck hunted in an area located in
the municipality of Mirandola, province of Modena, in Emilia-Romagna
Region.[Lat: 4:53:16N (44.8878), Lon: 11:04:03E (11.0674), about 45
km north of the city Modena].
On 9 Nov 2005, the isolate was typed as a Low Pathogenic H5N1 by
haemagglutination inhibition test, neuraminidase inhibition test, and
genetic analysis.
The amino acids sequence deduced from the cleavage site of the
haemagglutinin molecule (PQRETRG) is typical of low pathogenicity
avian influenza viruses (LPAI). Therefore it is a completely
different pathotype than the Asiatic highly pathogenic (HPAI) H5N1
viruses.
The Italian H5N1 represents a different virus, not related
genetically to the aggressive Asiatic H5N1. This has been
demonstrated by the analysis of the HA gene. The preliminary results
indicate that the Italian virus is genetically related to other LPAI
viruses commonly isolated in wild birds in Europe. The HA gene of the
isolate correlated with the following LPAI strains sequences
deposited in international databases: A/mallard/NL/3/99(H5N2);
A/mallard/Sweden/7/02(H5N2); A/mallard/DK/64650/03(H5N7).
More than 1000 samples collected from wild waterfowl in Italy have
previously been tested with negative results for H5N1 HPAI.

[This expedient and detailed report on the topics included in our
request for information is gratefully acknowledged.
Traditionally, the pathogenicity of avian influenza isolates is
defined in terms of intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) based upon
in vivo trials in susceptible chickens 4-8 weeks old. However, this
system has been undergoing modifications in the light of contemporary
genetic knowledge. See the following explanatory comment from 2005's
edition of OIE's terrestrial manual of Diagnostic tests and Vaccines:
"Now that the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the HA0
cleavage site is well-established as an accurate indicator of
virulence or potential virulence for H5 and H7 influenza viruses, it
appears inevitable that determination of the cleavage site by
sequencing or other methods will become the method of choice for
initial assessment of the virulence of these viruses and incorporated
into agreed definitions. This will have the advantage of reducing the
number of in-vivo tests, although at present the inoculation of birds
may still be required to confirm a negative result as the possibility
of virus cultures containing mixed populations of viruses of high and
low virulence cannot be ruled out".
The virological laboratory at IZSVe (Istituto Zooprofilattico
Sperimentale delle Venezie) in Legnaro, Padova, directed by Dr Ilaria
Capua, is one of the 6 HPAI reference laboratories of the OIE. The
other laboratories are situated in Riems, Germany; Weybridge, UK;
Geelong, Australia; Ames, Iowa, USA; and Sapporo, Japan. - Mod.AS]
