Statement from Dr. Masato Tashiro
---------------------------------
I am surprised to read the report in ProMED-mail, Avian influenza,human - East
Asia (180): China, RFI [part 1] {archive number 20051123.3399).
First of all, it is not correct. Therefore, I would ask you to correct it.
In my presentation at the meeting in Marburg, I stated that WHO's
official numbers of H5N1 human cases are only based on laboratory
confirmed cases. It should be therefore an iceberg phenomenon. Due
to poorly organized surveillance and information sharing systems in
many affected countries including China, it is reasonable to consider
that more cases have occurred actually. We have heard many 'rumors'
or unauthorized information which we cannot confirm. In this context,
I talked about a few examples of non-authorized information and rumors
about Asian countries which I received through private channels. I
clarified that I do not know the original sources and I cannot confirm
whether they are true, how these numbers were derived and what
laboratory tests and epidemiological investigation were done.
Therefore, the article cited in ProMed-mail is incorrect and
misleading. I did not receive any interview during my stay in Germany.
I did not say anything that I believe the figures of the unauthorized
information.
My message at the meeting was that international societies should help
China to establish and perform nationwide surveillance and information
sharing systems. I do not think that the Chinese Authority will
conceal the facts from the world. Since the SARS event, they are
collaborative to WHO. But they may have still limited capacity to
monitor all human cases particularly in rural areas.

[The article published in the Tue 22 Nov 2005 edition of the Frankfurter
Allgemeine, a reputable German newspaper, was referred to ProMED-mail
independently by two reliable correspondents. ProMED-mail was not able to
verify the accuracy of the newspaper report prior to posting and we
regret propagating inaccurate information [but see [2] below]. The hysteria
surrounding the outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 avian influenza in East Asia, and the
associated threat of an imminent pandemic of human influenza, has generated a
great deal of misinformation fueled by journalists competing to establish a
presence in the field, particularly with regard to events in the People's
Republic of China. We are grateful to Dr. Tashiro for clarifying his
position. - Mod.CP]

The Israeli daily "Haaretz" included the following information in a front-page
article earlier today [24 Nov 2005] (translation from Hebrew):

"One of the participants in the meeting, Prof Hans-Dieter Klenk from Marburg
University in Germany, confirmed -- in an interview with "Haaretz"
yesterday [23 Nov 2005] -- the quote from Dr Masato Tashiro of the Japanese
Ministry of Health. "Dr Masato presented a well-detailed table, in Chinese,
which included more than 300 human fatalities, resulting from avian influenza,
recorded in China during recent years", said Prof Klenk yesterday. "He
[namely Tashiro - A.S.] said that he had received the unofficial report during
his visit to China in recent weeks", said Klenk". End translated passage.

According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine, Dr Masato sharply criticised the
Chinese authorities, saying they are "deliberately misleading the West"; this
was denied by Prof Klenk. [As I understand it, the denial means that the said
criticism was not said by Masato - A.S.].

Assaf Uni, the "Haaretz" reporter who interviewed Klenk, is a reputable one.
