[1] South Africa (Gauteng, Mpumalanga): H5N8

Another 2 areas have been quarantined following the outbreak of bird flu. The Agriculture Department said the outbreak occurred on commercial layer chicken farms in Gauteng and Mpumalanga.

The 2 farms were placed under quarantine, which means no chickens and chicken products will be moved on and off the farms.

The H5N8 virus does not affect humans; however, the health department has tested workers from the affected farms.

This brings the number of locations affected by the virus to 4.

The South African Poultry Association said it was worrying that new bird flu cases had occurred. The SA Poultry Association's Kevin Lovell said: "This particular version of bird flu definitely doesn't affect human beings. What's at stake here is that it's come to South Africa. We've had 2 outbreaks within a few days from each other, and we had hoped that it had been contained. It's now been found in 2 unrelated sites. This particular strain has a preference for long lived birds."

[2] South Africa (Gauteng): H5N8

The H5N8 strain of bird flu has been identified in Germiston on a commercial egg-laying farm, which is home to about 400 000 birds, though not all the birds are in egg production, Germiston City News reports.

Kevin Lovell, CEO of the SA Poultry Association, said the virus was confirmed on Friday last week.

Depopulating the chickens started last weekend, and the area is under quarantine. This strain of bird flu has now been identified on 4 farms, with the other 3 being in Mpumalanga.

Despite 3 of the 4 farms having good bio-security, of which the Germiston site is one, the virus made it onto the farms, Lovell said.

He said between 95 to 98 percent of the chickens should be [euthanized] by the end of next week, and the 4 outbreaks will in the end result in the culling of about 900 000 chickens. He said there are roughly 145 million live commercial chickens in South Africa at any given time.

Bomikazi Molapo of the department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said she could not reveal the location of the farm but confirmed it was in Germiston.

Lovell said the virus is believed to have been spread by wild water birds. The H5N8 strain can also be spread by humans, droppings, feathers or contaminated water, to name a few, though the virus is not harmful to humans.

Meanwhile, Lovell said role players, which among others include the department and the SA Poultry Association, are sampling faeces from dams to identify water sources which could be home to the virus.

[3] South Africa (Gauteng, Mpumalanga): H5N8

The HPAI H5N8 virus was confirmed in 2 further locations in South Africa, bringing the total of affected properties to 4. The new locations involved commercial layer chickens on farms in Gauteng and Mpumalanga.

The 2 farms were immediately placed under quarantine by the state veterinarian. The quarantine includes, as a minimum, a prohibition of the movement of chickens and chicken products onto and off the farm. The necessary measures have been taken to contain and eliminate the disease as efficiently as possible on both farms.

Forward tracing was done, and cull chicken depots were identified, which had received live cull chickens from one of the affected farms in the last 21 days. The records of these cull depots are being followed up to trace as many of these chickens as possible. The new Poultry Disease Management Agency (PDMA) system of registration of persons buying and selling live chickens made it possible to trace these culls.

The PDMA registration process of sellers and traders of live chickens has progressed well, and a number of initial challenges were ironed out. All role players in the poultry industry involved in the buying and selling of live chickens are strongly encouraged to comply with the registration and other requirements that are designed to allow the trade of live chickens to continue without compromising animal health.

The depopulation of the 2 poultry sites affected in June 2017 is complete. The carcasses, waste material, affected eggs and manure have been contained and will be dealt with to ensure prevention of spread of the disease, as well as to prevent contamination of the environment.

Export of chickens and chicken products from registered HPAI-free compartments is continuing to countries that accept guarantees from such compartments. There is good cooperation from registered compartments to increase the testing frequency to monthly testing.

Exports of raw meat, eggs and live birds from South Africa to some trade partners have been disrupted, as one of the requirements for the certification is country freedom from highly pathogenic avian influenza, which cannot be provided since 22 June 2017. The export of products that had been processed to ensure destruction of the virus is also continuing, unless the trade partner has raised an objection.

The H5N8 virus does not affect humans. The Department of Health through the National Institute of Communicable Diseases tested workers from the affected farms, and no human cases have been detected.

The HPAI H5N8 viruses that have been isolated from these outbreaks are similar to the viruses isolated from Zimbabwe in June 2017 and from Egypt in 2016, which makes the likelihood of the involvement of wild birds high. Chicken owners and farmers are encouraged to prevent contact of their chickens with wild birds as much as possible.

Increased surveillance in wild birds, commercial chickens and backyard chickens is continuing. Chicken owners, farmers and the public should remain vigilant, and all cases of high mortalities in chickens and other birds should be reported to the nearest State Veterinarian.

The public is advised to avoid any gathering of chickens for shows, auctions and similar activities. However, should such activities continue, the organisers are advised to liaise with the State Veterinary Authorities, and the auction houses must also be registered with the PDMA.

[4] China: H7N9 vaccination program
Date: Tue 11 Jul 2017

http://kdal610.com/news/articles/2017/jul/12/china-program-to-vaccinate-poultry-against-bird-flu-will-be-nationwide/


China's program to vaccinate poultry against the H7N9 strain of bird flu will be carried out nationwide from this autumn [2017], the country's agriculture ministry said on Monday [10 Jul 2017].

The government had previously said the program would initially only be applied in some provinces, with other areas allowed to receive vaccinations if approved by veterinary authorities.

The step is part of a drive against bird flu after human cases of the virus spiked in the country last winter [2016-2017], claiming at least 268 lives since October 2016.

Beijing will also strengthen inspections and supervision on poultry being transported between provinces, the ministry said in a document.

Farmers in China have been debating the use of vaccines, with some experts saying vaccines reduce clinical disease but do not prevent a virus from circulating and can mask its prevalence.

[While H5N8 is of low risk to humans, it is not of zero risk to humans, as noted by the WHO (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/riskassessment_AH5N8_201611/en/). Although we haven't seen it in humans yet, a closely related H5N6 virus has spread to humans, and thus the use of appropriate PPE for people working in H5N8-affected flocks should be encouraged.

Vaccination of poultry against H7N9 to help reduce the cross-over of the virus to the human population may be of some benefit, depending on how widespread the virus is in the poultry flocks where spillover is occurring, and provided the vaccination effort can be sustained for a prolonged period with appropriate timing rather than a one-time mass vaccination effort. As noted here (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/03/usda-work-poultry-vaccine-h5n8-h5n2), vaccination in conjunction with flock replacement strategies have been used in the US in chicken and turkey flocks on occasion, although not with HPAI. The more important question may be whether widespread vaccination of poultry for H7N9 will lead to increased virus evolution via the selection of escape mutants, potentially enhancing the spread of the virus into the human population. - Mod.JH
