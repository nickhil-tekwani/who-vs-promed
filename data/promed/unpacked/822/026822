The Department of Agriculture and Food Security of Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta Special Region, confirmed that 10 residents of Hargomulyo Village, Gedangsari District, were suspected of being exposed to anthrax after consuming dead and slaughtered beef. The Head of the Animal Health Division of the Gunung Kidul Agriculture and Food Security Service, Retno Widyastuti in Gunung Kidul, confirmed on [Sat 29 Jan 2022] the suspicion of anthrax in Gedangsari District. "After we received the report, we immediately took samples to be tested in the laboratory. The results of the sample testing have not yet been released," said Retno.

The Secretary of the Gunung Kidul Health Service, Abdul Azis, said that his party had received a report regarding the alleged spread of anthrax in Gedangsari District. The Health Office together with the Department of Agriculture and Food Security have followed up on this report and joint efforts have been made to tackle it in accordance with their duties. "To confirm the case, samples have been taken from residents' blood, soil to samples of the remaining meat," he said.

Azis said the Health Office had given medicines to symptomatic residents. In addition, case tracking has also been carried out to reduce the risk of wider spread. "Certainty is still waiting for the results of laboratory tests. However, countermeasures have also been carried out," he said.

Meanwhile, the Head of Hargomulyo Village, Sumaryanta said the chronology of the alleged anthrax case began with a cow belonging to a resident who died suddenly on [Thu 20 Jan 2022]. A total of 65 people contributed Rp100 000 [approx. 7 USD] each to be handed over to the owner of the cow as compensation.

Furthermore, the beef was distributed to residents who participated in the contribution. There were 30 residents who had consumed this beef. "Of these 10 people have experienced symptoms such as anthrax, ranging from fever to blisters on their hands due to injuries. The 10 residents have been treated and samples have been taken to confirm their illness," he said.

In addition to taking samples for laboratory testing, the rest of the meat that has not been processed has also been destroyed by burning. "We hope that residents who experience symptoms go immediately to the health center for treatment," he said.

The Wates Veterinary Center recommends that the Government of Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta Special Region, does not remove livestock from the anthrax spreading location in Gedangsari and Ponjong Districts to prevent the spread of anthrax.

The Head of the Wates Veterinary Center Hendra Wibawa in Gunung Kidul said on [Mon 31 Jan 2022] that, based on the results of the BBVet Wates investigation with the Livestock and Health Service of Gunung Kidul in the 2 sub-districts, 11 cows and 4 goats were found to be positive for anthrax bacteria. "To prevent the spread of anthrax bacteria, we recommend that the district government should not remove cows or other livestock from the area until control is complete. Then, it is necessary to accelerate treatment of livestock and vaccinations in and around the spread of anthrax," said Hendra.

In addition, BBVet Wates recommends that the Gunung Kidul Regency Government tighten the entry and exit of livestock in the anthrax distribution area so that it is easy to control. "There needs to be strict supervision of animals that come out and enter Gunung Kidul, especially at the location where anthrax is spreading," he said.

According to Hendra, animals affected by anthrax can be cured if handled quickly, starting from administering drugs and administering vaccinations. Healing takes 3 to 4 weeks provided treatment is done quickly. "Treatment and vaccination, as well as rapid treatment can control the spread of anthrax bacteria," he said.

He also admitted that indications of the spread of anthrax bacteria in Gunung Kidul occurred in mid-December [2021], but BBVet Wates received a report in January [2022]. After receiving the report, BBVet Wates and the Gunung Kidul Livestock and Animal Health Service conducted an investigation. "Until now there has been no increase in livestock deaths, because the Livestock and Animal Health Service has moved quickly to avoid spread of the anthrax bacteria," he said.

Meanwhile, the Regent of Gunung Kidul, Sunaryanta, admitted that there were findings of animals exposed to anthrax bacteria. However, there are no people who are positive for anthrax from laboratory results. "People have indications of being exposed to anthrax bacteria, but no one has medically stated that condition. We'll just have to wait," he said.

Many thanks to Mahmoud for sending us these reports.

Anthrax can be difficult to diagnose in humans although it is very easy in animals -- for starters, swab the nasal turbinates. My good friend, Benyamin Cherkaskyi, who had a wealth of Soviet experience with this disease, told me that the best samples to take from humans was of the bloody fluid under the cutaneous lesion, similarly from the thoracic and abdominal cavities if it has spread there. Added to the problems of human diagnosis is their habit of self-treating with antibiotics before they see a doctor. _B. anthracis_ is normally very sensitive to antibiotics and you can culture nothing from the toxins.

Cattle will die from acute infections, and their carcasses usually initiate calls for veterinary help. But among the other animals still standing one will find animals with a temperature -- feeling with one's hand is usually sufficient -- and maybe on the edge of dying. Treated promptly with antibiotics they can be pulled back from death. Others may just be incubating an infection, and thus a benefit of treating with long-acting antibiotics. Among my veterinary field colleagues, there was a bit of a controversy about simultaneously vaccinating and antibiotic treatment. Both claimed success. I think that the reason for this is that the vaccine dose is large enough for a significant number of Sterne spores germinating after the antibiotic titer had fallen away.

Any herd subjected to an outbreak of anthrax should be vaccinated annually for up to 5 years to stop recurrences and neighboring herds should also be similarly vaccinated. Judging when an area is free of risk depends on the knowledge of the local livestock owners. At some point, one will stop vaccinating but it is vitally important for all to be aware of any unsuspected death, which must be called in and investigated. These usually are anthrax cases in unvaccinated animals, and thus the need to continue vaccinating for say 3 years. Effective control is usually some 8 years and then followed by active surveillance to confirm eradication. Whatever the textbooks say, this is an eradicable disease.

Not mentioned in this veterinary report was the disposal of anthrax carcasses, although obviously some were home butchered and the meat sold or given away. Carcasses, if possible, should be burnt and any bloody soil treated with disinfectant, the stronger the better. - Mod.MHJ
