Weekly reports No 4 and No 5, 2013
----------------------------------
Week 4: New outbreaks in 2 dairy farms in the subdistrict Acre (No 24), hitherto uninfected.
Several new outbreaks in the infected districts Golan (No 29) and Kinneret (No 22). [Administrative map at http://www.science.co.il/images/maps/Israel-Districts.pdf].
Vaccination is applied throughout the Northern District [Hazafon].
Safety testing of a new vaccine is anticipated within a month.

Week 5: Newly infected dairy farms added during the week, as well as additional new cases in farms initially infected earlier.
Disease control is carried out, so far, by selective culling, biosecurity measures and the strict implementation of vector control by the application of insecticides.
Approximately 140 cattle have been killed since the start of the epizootic in July 2012, including 120 in the dairy operations and the remaining in beef herds and feedlots. Their owners will be compensated by the Veterinary Services.

Some accumulated observations: in one dairy farm which was vaccinated after the commencement of disease, the morbidity (based upon clinical observation) was 29 percent, compared to 5 - 10 percent in 2 dairy farms vaccinated 10 days prior to the 1st clinical case. In other, vaccinated dairy farms the morbidity rate was about 1 percent.

Mortality rate in beef cattle (including feedlots) was about 1.5 percent (a total of 434 animals died). Morbidity ranged between 1 - 95 percent.

[The LSD [lumpy skin disease] epizootic in Israel, currently spread throughout 4 sub-districts out of the 5 in the Northern (Hazafon) District, started in early July 2012. The single subdistrict in the Northern District which has remained, hitherto, uninfected is Jezreel (Yizre'el, No 23).

Israel's most recent follow-up report to the OIE, addressing the LSD epizootic which reportedly had started on 1 Jul 2012 on the Syrian/Lebanese border, has been submitted to the OIE on 29 Dec 2012 (http://tinyurl.com/bzzyl6x).
