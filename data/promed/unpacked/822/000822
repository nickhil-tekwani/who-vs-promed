About 25 000 people are in hospitals in Kerala with symptoms of
chikungunya, the Health Minister P. K. Sreemati said here on Thursday
[31 May 2007]. [According to another news article, 25,000 are
hospitalized with fever of which over 25% are suspected to be
infected with chikungunya.-Mod.DK] Thousands more with fever and
other symptoms were undergoing outpatient treatment in districts such
as Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam, Kollam and
Thiruvananthapuram. The disease is spread by mosquitoes, which had
multiplied in the southern districts during the past few weeks.
The Minister said that the Health Department in association with the
Department of Local Self Government would undertake a week-long drive
starting on 5 Jun 2007 for vector control with public participation.
The mosquito density in the districts is greater than that observed
in an outbreak that occurred last year [2006] in Alappuzha.
Ms. Sreemati said that the cabinet had sanctioned a week's free
rations to poor families affected by the disease in all districts.
About Rs. 2 crores [INR 20 million or USD 496 000 - CopyEd.MSP] had
been sanctioned for providing mosquito nets for the patients and
acquiring fogging machines and sprayers.
Local bodies would be implementing special schemes for improving
sanitation and clearing waterlogged canals and streams.

with acute chikungunya fever has risen from around 100 to many
thousands on 31 May 2007. Although the outbreak is extensive and the
effects of infection severe and incapacitating in many cases, there
have been no reports of fatalities.
