MERS-CoV - update 7 Jun 2013
----------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The patient is [an] 83-year-old man with underlying medical conditions, who became ill on 27 May 2013 and died on 31 May 2013. He is from Al-Ahsa [Governorate], where an outbreak began in a health care facility since April 2013.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 55 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 31 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date [7 Jun 2013]: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[The WHO update above now reconciles the case count including fatalities reported in the ProMED-mail update of 5 Jun 2013 "MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (22): Saudi Arabia, new case(s), RFI 20130605.1756207." As of 7 Jun 2013, there have been a total of 55 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV, including 31 deaths (representing a case fatality rate of 56.4 percent).

From the information in the WHO update (and in the prior report on this case from the MOH Saudi Arabia website on 5 Jun 2013), it is unclear if this most recent case is associated with the healthcare facility or if it is in another part of Al-Ahsa. It would be of great interest to see results of investigations on the ongoing outbreak in Al-Ahsa, including information on probable source of exposure of the cases, including possible contacts between cases, and other information. This outbreak appears to be the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV to date, and results of epidemiological investigations of this outbreak will hopefully shed light on the epidemiology of this novel organism.

For the map of Saudi Arabia showing locations of cases within the country, see the Saudi MOH information page on coronavirus, available at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Corona/Pages/AboutCorona.aspx.

For the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Saudi Arabia and surrounding countries in the Middle East where primary MERS-CoV transmission has occurred, see http://healthmap.org/r/1HAJ. (This moderator does not mean to exclude the secondary cases of MERS-CoV that have occurred in the UK, France, Tunisia and Italy by the previous statement on "primary MERS-CoV transmission," as the index cases in the clusters with local transmission in the UK, France, Tunisia, and Italy all had exposure to the MERS-CoV in the Middle East). - Mod.MPP]

Update: severe respiratory illness associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- worldwide, 2012-2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC continues to work in consultation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners to better understand the public health risk posed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), formerly known as novel coronavirus, which was 1st reported to cause human infection in September 2012 (1-4). The continued reporting of new cases indicates that there is an ongoing risk for transmission to humans in the area of the Arabian Peninsula. New reports of cases outside the region raise concerns about importation to other geographic areas. Nosocomial outbreaks with transmission to health-care personnel highlight the importance of infection control procedures. Recent data suggest that mild respiratory illness might be part of the clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection, and presentations might not initially include respiratory symptoms. In addition, patients with comorbidities or immunosuppression might be at increased risk for infection, severe disease, or both. Importantly, the incubation period might be longer than previously estimated. Finally, lower respiratory tract specimens (e.g., sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial wash, or tracheal aspirate) should be collected in addition to nasopharyngeal sampling for evaluation of patients under investigation. An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) was recently issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow for expanded availability of diagnostic testing in the United States.

As of [7 Jun 2013], a total of 55 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to WHO. Illness onsets have occurred during April 2012 through [29 May 2013] [Figure 1. Number of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV (N = 55) reported as of [7 Jun 2013], to the WHO, by month of illness onset -- worldwide, 2012-2013, available at the source URL above. Note that in this figure, the case count for March 2013 assumes that the 2 cases included in the 23 Mar 2013 WHO announcement had symptom onset during March 2013 and that the case count for May 2013 assumes that 6 recently reported cases had symptom onset during May 2013. - Mod.MPP]. All reported cases were directly or indirectly linked to one of 4 countries: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates [Figure 2. Confirmed cases of MERS-CoV (N =55) reported as of [7 Jun 2013], to the WHO, and history of travel from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries within 14 days of illness onset -- worldwide, 2012-2013, available at the source URL above. In this figure, the dots representing the cases are not geographically representative of the exact location of the residence of the patient. - Mod.MPP]. Most cases (40) were reported by Saudi Arabia. Four countries, the UK, Italy, France, and Tunisia, have reported cases in returning travelers and their close contacts (5-8). Ill patients from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have been transferred to hospitals in the UK and Germany. To date, no cases have been reported in the United States. WHO and CDC have not issued any travel advisories at this time; updated information for travelers to the Arabian Peninsula is available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/coronavirus-arabian-peninsula.

The median age of patients is 56 years (range: 2-94 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.6 to 1.0. All patients were aged greater than 24 years, except for 2 children, one aged 2 years and one aged 14 years. All patients had respiratory symptoms during their illness, with the majority experiencing severe acute respiratory disease requiring hospitalization. 31 of the 55 patients are reported to have died (case-fatality rate: 56 percent) (5-8). Two cases in Tunisia, in siblings whose father's illness was a probable case, and a case from the UK, were in persons with mild respiratory illnesses who were not hospitalized (5,9). Information was not available for all cases; however, several patients had accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhea, and many cases occurred among persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or immunosuppression, as reported to WHO (5,9).

The original source(s), route(s) of transmission to humans, and the mode(s) of human-to-human transmission have not been determined. Eight clusters (42 cases) have been reported by 6 countries (France, Italy, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the UK) (5) among close contacts or in health-care settings, and provide clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. The 1st documented patient-to-patient nosocomial transmission in Europe was confirmed recently in France (10). The 1st French patient, a man aged 64 years with a history of renal transplantation, became ill on [22 Apr 2013], within one week after returning from Dubai. He presented with fever and diarrhea. Pneumonia was diagnosed incidentally on radiographic imaging, and he subsequently died with severe respiratory disease. The secondary case is in a man aged 51 years on long-term corticosteroids who shared a room with the index patient during [the period 26-29 Apr 2013] and who remains hospitalized on life support. The incubation period for the secondary case was estimated to be 9-12 days; this is longer than the previously estimated 1-9 days (10). A larger cluster, consisting of 25 cases including 14 deaths, ongoing since April 2013 in the [governorate] of Al-Ahsa in eastern Saudi Arabia, also has included cases linked to a health-care facility (5). Cases have included health-care personnel and family contacts. An additional 5 cases, not linked to the cluster in Al-Ahsa, were reported recently in another region of eastern Saudi Arabia (5). Thus far, no evidence of sustained community transmission beyond the clusters has been reported in any country.

In some instances, sampling with nasopharyngeal swabs did not detect MERS-CoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); however, MERS-CoV was detected by PCR in lower respiratory tract specimens from these same patients. In the 2 patients reported by France, nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive, whereas bronchoalveolar lavage and induced sputum were positive (10).

CDC guidance
------------
In consultation with WHO, the period for considering evaluation for MERS-CoV infection in persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness days after traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries* has been extended from within 10 days to within 14 days of travel. Persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness within 14 days after traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries should be evaluated according to current guidelines (available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html). Persons whose respiratory illness remains unexplained and who meet criteria for "patient under investigation" should be reported immediately to CDC through state and local health departments. Persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness who are close contacts** of a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness within 14 days of traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries may be considered for evaluation for MERS-CoV. In addition, CDC recommends that clusters of severe acute respiratory illness be investigated and, if no obvious etiology is identified, local public health officials be notified and testing for MERS-CoV conducted, if indicated.

To increase the likelihood of detecting MERS-CoV, CDC recommends collection of specimens from different sites (e.g., a nasopharyngeal swab and a lower respiratory tract specimen, such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial wash, or tracheal aspirate). Specimens should be collected at different times after symptom onset, if possible. Lower respiratory tract specimens should be a priority for collection and PCR testing; stool specimens also may be collected. Specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions (available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html).

Testing of specimens for MERS-CoV currently is being conducted at CDC. FDA issued an EUA on [5 Jun 2013], to authorize use of CDC's novel coronavirus 2012 real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay (NCV-2-12 rRT-PCR assay) to test for MERS-CoV in clinical respiratory, blood, and stool specimens. This EUA is needed because, at this time, there are no FDA-approved tests that identify MERS-CoV in clinical specimens. This assay will be deployed to Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories in all 50 states over the coming weeks. Updated information about laboratories with the capacity to conduct MERS testing with the NCV-2-12 rRT-PCR assay will be provided on CDC's MERS website (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html).

In consultation with WHO, the definition of a probable case of MERS-CoV infection has been updated to also include persons with severe acute respiratory illness with no known etiology with an epidemiological link to a confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection. Until the transmission characteristics of MERS-CoV are better understood, patients under investigation and probable and confirmed cases should be managed in health-care facilities using standard, contact, and airborne precautions. As information becomes available, these recommendations will be reevaluated and updated as needed.

Recommendations and guidance on case definitions, infection control (including use of personal protective equipment), case investigation, and specimen collection and testing, are available at the CDC MERS website (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html). The MERS website contains the most current information and guidance, which is subject to change. State and local health departments with questions should contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center (770-488-7100).

[The MMWR article is an updated summary of the known epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed cases to date. It provides a nice epidemic curve (by month of onset) of cases, as well as the current information on age distribution, and a summary of known information on clusters of cases.

Unfortunately, there is no information on studies in the countries of exposure directed at identifying the possible sources of the organism -- the key question being: how does a virus most closely related genetically to beta coronaviruses seen in bats, make the jump to infect humans? Or, better stated, where does the "index case" in each of the reported clusters get the virus? Is it from direct exposure to infected animals? Or indirect exposure to infected animals through contact with bodily secretions of these infected animals? What types of field studies addressing these questions have been conducted, and what have the results of such studies been? - Mod.MPP]
