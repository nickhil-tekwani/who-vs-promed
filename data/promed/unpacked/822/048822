Fukuoka Prefecture has announced that there is a suspected outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhoea [PED] at a pig farm in Yame. According to Asahi, this would be the 1st outbreak of PED in the province.

The authorities have stressed that the disease does not affect humans. They also called for a high level of biosecurity, including thorough disinfection of vehicles and only essential visitors to pig farms.

[Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is a viral disease of swine caused by a coronavirus and characterised by watery diarrhoea and emaciation affecting all ages of pigs. Clinical signs include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. The disease is clinically similar to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE).

The disease was 1st reported in the UK in 1971 and was subsequently identified in many other European countries, China, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, and Viet Nam. PED was 1st identified in the United States in May 2013 and, since January 2014, also in Canada.

The 1st case in Japan was confirmed in the 1980s. After an absence of about 7 years, PED reappeared in October 2013 in the Okinawa prefecture, followed by the prefectures of Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Ibaraki.

PED is restricted to porcines. It is not zoonotic and not included among OIE's listed reportable animal diseases.

Confirmation of the disease in Fukuoka and updated information on its distribution in Japan will be helpful.
