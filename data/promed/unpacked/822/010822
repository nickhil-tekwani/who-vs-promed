_Trypanosoma cruzi_ infection in cats
-------------------------------------
Cats serve as carriers for [the parasite that causes] Chagas disease. Kissing bugs take a bite out of mammals and leave a protozoan behind called _Trypanosoma cruzi_, which infects cats and cause Chagas disease in people.

Kissing bugs earned that nickname because they crawl out at night and usually bite mammals' faces. Not exactly a kiss, but who are we to say when insects are trying showing affection? The problem is, scratching the bite area makes it easy for the trypomastigotes to enter the host, whether it be a cat or human. The bugs can also transfer the disease when eaten, or by eating an infected animal.

Cats can serve as a [reservoir] for the parasite, and are important in the spread of Chagas disease in humans. Once _T. cruzi_ infects the host, it starts dividing. This causes the host's cells to rupture after a few days, which sends the protozoa through the circulatory system, where the kissing bug can ingest them after biting the host. Generally, symptoms from your cat can include convulsions and hind-leg paralysis. If a cat's cells have ruptured, he or she may have a fever as well. In utero transmission can occur through breast milk and/or across the placenta.

Diagnosing the parasite is done by looking at the heart muscle after the animal has died. Unfortunately, there is no cure for _T. cruzi_ infection in any animal. There are drugs that can be used as treatment, but resistance to the drugs have been found. There is another way to diagnose the disease, but it's fairly difficult: Laboratory-kept kissing bugs are fed blood or tissue from the cat showing symptoms. The kissing bug is killed, and its digestive system is inspected for _T. cruzi_.

Chagas disease is mainly found in Latin America, but there have been rare cases in dogs in Texas. No cats have been found to carry the protozoan in the United States; urban landscapes aren't the ideal place for transmission of the disease.

[Infection with _Trypanosoma cruzi_ is only called Chagas diseases in humans. It has been shown in an experimental setting, that cats and dogs can be infected with _T. cruzi_ by triatome bugs (Enriquez GF et al: High levels of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA determined by qPCR and infectiousness to Triatoma infestans support dogs and cats are major sources of parasites for domestic transmission. Infect Genet Evol. 2014; 25: 36-43; abstract at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732410).

A study from southern Mexico found that 8.6 percent of cats were seropositive to _T. cruzi_ and that 34 percent were PCR positive (Jimenez-Coello M et al: Epidemiological survey of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ infection in domestic owned cats from the tropical southeast of Mexico. Zoonoses Public Health. 2012; 59 Suppl 2: 102-9; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2012.01463.x/full). It is difficult to explain the high rate of PCR positive, antibody negative cats except that the PCR had false positive results or the antibody assay had false negative results. However, it probably demonstrates that cats can be infected.

Interesting, a study of the feeding behavior of _Triatoma infestans_ found that the bugs preferred dogs compared to chickens and cats (Guertler RE et al: Strong host-feeding preferences of the vector _Triatoma infestans_ modified by vector density: implications for the epidemiology of Chagas disease. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2009; 3(5); http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682203/). Similar studies comparing humans to other mammals are lacking and thus, whether the risk of transmission to humans from cats is a real risk or a hypothetical risk remains to be seen. - Mod.EP
