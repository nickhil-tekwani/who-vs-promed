FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory Report1 April-June 2010 Foot-and-Mouth
Disease: summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASIA
Republic of Korea
-----------------
A total of 7 new outbreaks of FMDV type O were reported in April
2010, with no further reports in May or June. After the completion of
stamping-out and disinfection in the restricted zones, clinical
surveillance and serological testing in the restricted zones were
completed by the government veterinary authorities. All results were
negative. Therefore, on 7 Jun 2010, the Ministry for Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MIFAFF) lifted the protection
and surveillance zones as well as the risk zone which had been
established within Kangwha-gun and Kimpo city on 8 Apr and 19 Apr
2010, respectively.

P.R. China
----------
9 further outbreaks of FMDV type O occurred between April and June 2010:
07 Apr 2010 Nanyuan, GANSU.
17 Apr 2010 Tianfeng, Wushan, Tianshui, GANSU.
13 Apr 2010 Guding, Shibing, Qiandongnanzhou, GUIZHOU.
23 Apr 2010 Xuanhe Town, Shapotou District, Zhongwei, NINGXIA.
20 Apr 2010 Yecheng, Yecheng, Kashi prefecture, XINJIANG.
17 May 2010 Shigatse, TIBET.
10 Jun 2010 Shayidong, Kuerle, Bayingolin Mongolia Autonomous
Prefecture, XINJIANG.
19 Jun 2010 The Aksu Western Suburb pig farming area, Aksu, XINJIANG.
22 Jun 2010 Haomen Town Qunawan Road Farm, Menyuan, Haibei Zhou, QINGHAI.
No information concerning the genotyping of viruses from these
outbreaks is yet available.

Taiwan POC
----------
An outbreak occurred on 22 Jun 2010 in pigs at Baozhong Township,
YUN-LIN. During routine active surveillance in the livestock markets,
a pig was found to be NSP antibody positive. The prefecture animal
disease control competent authority traced back to the farm of
origin. The clinical investigation showed that 112 pigs on the farm
had healed vesicular lesions.

The prefecture animal disease control competent authority immediately
destroyed a total of 163 pigs apparently all in the same pen.
Cleaning and disinfection was then carried out on the index farm.
Samples for serological tests and virus isolation were collected and
sent to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute).
The laboratory confirmed 6 positive results for NSP with all being
negative for RT-PCR and virus isolation.

Japan
-----
In early April 2010, FMDV type O was reported in Miyazaki Prefecture
on the island of Kyushu. Subsequently, a further 291 outbreaks have
been reported. The virus was identified as Southeast Asia (SEA)
topotype (Mya-98 lineage) and found to be closely related to viruses
occurring recently in the P.R. China, Hong Kong SAR, Republic of
Korea, Myanmar and Thailand. This is the 1st outbreak of FMD in Japan
since 2000. It appears that although disease was 1st identified on 9
Apr 2010, FMD was not confirmed by laboratory testing until 20 Apr
2010.

Mongolia
--------
An outbreak of FMD type O was reported on 21 Apr 2010 in cattle
(n=269/849) at Tashgai Bayanburd, Khalkh gol soum, Dornod.
Subsequently, 2 further outbreaks were reported: on 14 May 2010 in
cattle (n=37/375) at Zuun Shorvog, Buyanondor, Matad Soum, Dornod;
and on 14 Jun 2010 in cattle (n=17) at Bayasgalant, Bulgan soum,
Dornod. A VP1 sequence was submitted to the WRLFMD from ARRIAH and
shown to belong to the SEA topotype, Mya-98 lineage; Importantly, it
appears to be a different introduction to outbreaks in the P.R.
China, Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea and Japan, as it is most
closely related to viruses from Thailand and Malaysia from 2009.

Afghanistan, Iran & Pakistan
----------------------------
The O-PanAsia-2 and A-Iran-05 lineages continue to dominate in these
countries. A single example of the O-Ind-2001 lineage was detected in
a sample from Kerman province, Iran in 2009 (O/IRN/72/2009). No
further occurrence has so far been detected in 2010.

Kazakhstan
----------
An outbreak of FMD type O occurred on 09 Jun 2010 in cattle
(n=140/639) at Novodolinka, Ereymentau, Aqmola, Kokchetav. A sequence
was submitted to the WRLFMD from ARRIAH and found to belong to the
ME-SA topotype, PanAsia-2 strain.

United Arab Emirates
--------------------
An outbreak of FMDV type O occurred in gazelle the Al Ain Wildlife
Park & Resort, Abu Dhabi in March-April 2010. Analysis of VP1
sequences showed the virus to belong to the ME-SA topotype, PanAsia-2
strain and to be closely related to viruses from Iran and Pakistan.

AFRICA
Kenya
-----
FMDV types O, SAT 1 and SAT 2 were isolated from samples collected in
2009 and 2010. A single type O virus belonged to the EA-1 topotype
and was closely related to the vaccine strain K77/78. 19 SAT 1
viruses all belonged to topotype I (NWZ), but clustered with
previously isolated viruses in 4 different sub-lineages. The single
SAT 2 virus belonged to topotype IV and was closely related to 2
viruses previously isolated in 2009.

Namibia
-------
An outbreak of FMD (serotype pending) was reported on 09 Apr 2010 in
cattle (n=88/1066) on Impalila island, Kabbe constituency, Caprivi.
It is suspected that transmission of FMDV occurred from wild African
buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_) resident in the area.

Nigeria
-------
FMDV types O and A were isolated from samples collected in 2009. A
single type O virus belonged to the EA-3 topotype and was most
closely related to viruses from Nigeria (2007) and Sudan (2004-2008).
8 type A viruses belonged to the AFRICA topotype (lineage G-I) but
fell into 2 distinct sub-lineages, one of which clustered closely
with Kenyan viruses. The single SAT 2 virus belonged to topotype IV,
but was not closely related to other SAT 2's. 4 type A viruses all
belonged to the AFRICA topotype, G-IV lineage; but fell into 2
distinct sub-lineage which correlated with their place of collection.

Tanzania
--------
FMDV types O, A and SAT 2 were isolated from samples collected in
2008 and 2009. 3 type O viruses belonged to the EA-2 topotype, but
fell into 2 distinct sub-lineages.

Zimbabwe
--------
An outbreak of FMD type SAT 2 was reported in cattle (n=163/1377) at
Kitwe dip tank, Plumtree, Mangwe, Matabeleland South on 28 May 2010.
Further outbreaks have been reported: on 04 Jun 2010 at Inswingo Dip
Tank, Mangwe, Matabeleland South; and on 01 Jun 2010 at Kwite,
Mangwe, Matabeleland South and Ingwizi Dip Tank, Mangwe, Matabeleland
South. No sequence data is available yet and samples have not yet
been submitted to the WRLFMD.

SOUTH AMERICA
Ecuador
-------
9 FMD type O viruses were isolated from samples sent from various
locations in Ecuador. These are the 1st samples WRLFMD have received
from this region. With the gratefully appreciated assistance of
Panaftosa we were able to compare the VP1 sequences to those from 6
virus isolates from Ecuador in 2009. These all belonged to the
EURO-SA topotype and viruses from each year clustered together and
the clusters were most closely related to each other.

Uncharacterised FMD viruses
---------------------------
A number of other outbreaks have occurred where samples have not been
sent to the WRLFMD. It is probable that the countries involved have
performed their own genetic characterisation; however, through the
OIE/FAO laboratory network we would also like to encourage the
submission of samples (or complete VP1 sequences) to the WRLFMD.

An up-to-date list and reports of FMD viruses characterised by
sequencing can be found at the following website:

[Among others, the above quarterly report includes 2 awaited pieces
of information on genotyping results from the All-Russian "Federal
Centre for Animal Health" in Vladimir (ARRIAH), which is OIE Regional
Reference Laboratory for FMD for Eastern Europe, Central Asia and
Transcaucasia. According to ARRIAH:

1. The FMDV serotype O from Mongolia, belongs to the SEA topotype,
Mya-98 lineage, but appears to be a different introduction to
outbreaks in the P.R. China, Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea and
Japan, as it is most closely related to viruses from Thailand and
Malaysia from 2009.

2. The FMDV serotype O from Kazakhstan belongs to the ME-SA topotype,
PanAsia-2 strain. Thus, this strain is not related to the strain
recently spreading in China, S Korea, Japan, Mongolia.

Annex 3 of the quarterly report includes the most recent (June 2010)
recommendations from WRLFMD on FMD virus strains to be included in
FMDV banks (namely vaccine strains). For FMDV serotype O of the
panasian topotype, the recommended vaccine strain is O Manisa. No
recommendation for the vaccine strain against SEA topotype, Mya-98
lineage is yet available. Vaccinations against this strain has
reportedly been undertaken in China, Japan and Mongolia. - Mod.AS]
