State Veterinarian Dr. Barry Pittman advises Utah livestock owners that the presence of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has now been detected in the following counties: Beaver, Carbon, Duchesne, Emery, Grand, Kane, San Juan, Uintah and Weber. Livestock owners should take appropriate measures to protect their animals. The affected premises are in various stages of quarantine.

Tests conducted by USDA Plum Island Animal Disease Center, Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in New York, confirmed the 1st case in early August [2015]. Since then other animals at different locations have tested positive for VSV.

VSV is a livestock disease that rarely affects humans. It primarily affects cattle and horses but can occasionally affect swine, sheep and goats. VSV produces lesions in animal's mouths and udders, but is not generally fatal to adult cows.

Livestock owners are cautioned that 2015 has been an active season for vesicular stomatitis in the southwest and to be aware and alert. Veterinarians caution livestock owners to not mingle their animals and take appropriate biosecurity measures.

When a definite diagnosis is made on a farm, the following procedures are recommended: Separate animals with lesions from healthy animals, preferably by stabling. Animals on pastures tend to be affected more frequently with this disease.

As a precautionary measure, do not move animals from premises affected by vesicular stomatitis until at least 14 days after lesions in the last affected animal have healed.

Implement on-farm insect control programs that include the elimination or reduction of insect breeding areas and the use of insecticide sprays or insecticide-treated eartags on animals. [Be sure to check the label and use sprays or eartags only for the animal the product is recommended for. - Mod.TG]

Use personal protective measures when handling affected animals to avoid human exposure to this disease.

Owners intending to travel out of state with their animals are advised to check with the destination state animal health authorities before entering another state.

Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) Veterinarian's Office asks livestock owners to report any signs to a local veterinarian, or UDAF at (801) 538-7109, (801) 538-7161, <bpittman@utah.gov>.

Many states have applied interstate movement restrictions of various types to livestock from states where this disease has been diagnosed. Care should be taken to comply with regulations in the state of destination regarding interstate movement of livestock from Utah.

It is essential that veterinarians and livestock owners be on the alert for animals displaying clinical signs characteristic of the disease such as lesions in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves, and teats.

These blisters leave raw tissue that is so painful that infected animals generally refuse to eat or drink and may show signs of lameness. Severe weight loss usually follows and in dairy cows, a severe drop in milk production commonly occurs.

While vesicular stomatitis can cause economic losses to livestock producers, it is a particularly significant disease because its outward signs are similar to those of foot-and-mouth disease, a foreign animal disease of cloven-hoofed animals that was eradicated from the U.S. in 1929.

There is no specific treatment or cure for vesicular stomatitis in livestock. Livestock owners can protect their animals by avoiding congregation of animals in the vicinity where vesicular stomatitis has occurred.

For additional information on vesicular stomatitis refer to the following APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] web page: http://1.usa.gov/1Iwv2qc.

[Utah has been hit as hard as Wyoming has regarding this disease. Wyoming had a freeze, and hopefully Utah has had a freeze or will soon get a killing freeze. Since this disease is a virus spread by insects, a frost of sufficiently low temperatures will help kill the insects that transmit this disease.

The APHIS web page cited in the article is quite useful. - Mod.TG
