Government urged to act to curb mysterious camel disease
--------------------------------------------------------
Pokot pastoralists have asked the Government to probe an unknown
disease that has killed 9 camels in Pokot County (map
at <http://healthmap.org/r/01fN>). The outbreak of the disease
threatens the success of a Sh16 million camel project by the
Government aimed at improving the livelihood of the local pastoralists.

Through the North Rift Kenya Camel Association, the farmers said the
disease outbreak threatens the lives of the more than 80 000 camels.
The association's regional coordinator Henry Tingoria said the
animals died at Nakuyeni village in Pokot North District.

A local herder, who lost 4 camels, said the animals had no sign of
any sickness and he found them dead as he prepared to take them out
for grazing. "Vets have not visited us to establish the cause of the
deaths," said the herder.

Affected herders told the The Standard on Saturday [12 Feb 2011] that
the camels had no symptoms of any disease. Tingoria urged local
veterinary officers to visit the affected area and probe the cause of
the death to save lives of other animals.

The Government, through the department of Arid Lands and Drought
management, purchased 200 camels and distributed them to local
herders. There are an estimated one million camels benefiting some
2.5 million people. At least 80 percent of populations living in arid
and semi arid areas depend on camels.
