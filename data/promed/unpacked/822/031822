Regarding the message asking for information on dengue in Dominican
Republic. Dengue is an endemic disease in Dominican Republic as it is in
other Caribbean countries. Dengue 1, dengue 2, and dengue 4 (not dengue 3)
viruses have been confirmed as circulating in the country.
This year has been more active than the past one. 1796 probable cases has
been registered in a surveillance system throughout week 35 (Sept. 5).
About 25% of them have been confirmed by serology or virus isolation.
National authorities called the public's attention on January when dengue 3
virus was [identified in Puerto Rico. An Epidemiological Alert was issued
in July because the number of notified probable cases were more than those
of last year. Recently, they have been reinforcing this alert and a
intensive public campaign by radio and media is being developed regarding
reduction of _Aedes aegypti_ by domiciliary measures. Complementary
measures regarding clinical attention of cases are being set.
