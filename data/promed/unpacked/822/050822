Indonesia: The Health Ministry confirms the 57th bird flu fatality
-----------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry announced Tuesday [28 Nov 2006] that a
35-year-old woman, a resident of Taman Adiyaksa, Tangerang, Banten
Province, died of bird flu early Tuesday morning at the Sulianti
Saroso Infectious Disease Hospital in Jakarta. Her death is the 57th
human fatality out of 74 confirmed human H5N1 cases in Indonesia.
The announcement was made public by the Health Ministry's Center of
Public Communication after receiving the latest updated data on
Indonesia's bird flu situation from the ministry's Bird Flu
Information Center on Tue 28 Nov 2006.
The woman fell sick on 7 Nov 2006. The next day, she was admitted to
Paramita Hospital, Tangerang. Having shown no sign of recovery, the
woman was transferred to Honoris Hospital on 10 Nov 2006, and the
same day, she was again transferred to Sulianti Saroso Infectious
Disease Hospital. Before she died, she experienced severe coughing,
fever and respiratory problems. A history of contact with poultry has
not been established.
Based on Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, carried
out by the Health Ministry's Research and Development Agency and the
Jakarta-based NAMRU-2 laboratory, she was confirmed as having bird
flu on 13 Nov 2006. She is the 57th Indonesian bird flu patient who
has died since the 1st human H5N1 fatality was recorded in Indonesia
in July 2005.
The Health Ministry's Bird Flu Information Center reported that as of
Tue 27 Nov 2006, Indonesia has recorded 74 confirmed human cases, of
which 57 have died; 12 probable cases, of which 4 died; 187 suspect
cases, of which 50 died; one exposure case; in addition, 539 cases
have tested negative for bird flu.
In Indonesia, confirmed human cases have occurred in 9 provinces,
they are: Jakarta (with 18 cases, of which 16 were fatal); Banten (9
cases, of which 8 died); West Java (25 cases, of which 20 died);
Central Java (4 cases, of which 3 died), East Java (5 cases, of which
3 died), North Sumatra (7 cases, of which 6 died), South Sulawesi
(one fatality), Lampung (3 cases, all of which survived), and West

[These reports partially resolve the confusion highlighted in
ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (183): Indonesia, susp
20061128.3375. It is now confirmed that the 57th fatality is the
35-year old woman from Banten province. It is presumed, therefore,
that the 6-year-old boy and the 36-year-old woman from West Java
province previously identified as suspected 57th deaths are included
among the 4 deaths among the 12 "probable" cases.
