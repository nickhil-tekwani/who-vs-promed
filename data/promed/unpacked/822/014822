A medical source at a hospital in the Red Sea governorate has told local media that a woman infected with bird flu died at the Hurghada General Hospital on Tuesday [5 Jan 2016]. The source stated there were currently 6 other cases of bird flu in quarantine.

The source said the woman was suffering from severe pneumonia and was quarantined in intensive care. She later died late Mon [5 Jan 2016] night at the hospital.

Mahmoud Ibrahim, in charge of the Red Sea governorate's Directorate of Veterinary Medicine, said that health awareness campaigns targeting bird flu were ongoing through daily shop inspections.

The governor formed a committee, which includes the regional branch of the Environmental Affairs Agency, the Directorate of Veterinary Medicine, the Public Administration for Environmental Affairs, the Directorate of Supply, the Directorate of Health, and the Directorate of Agriculture. The committee also includes city councils, local units, and police facilities to provide health guidelines and emphasise hygiene practices in shops, such as sanitary ways to dispose of dead birds.

[Hurghada is a city in the Red Sea Governorate (Al Bahr Al Ahmar) of Egypt. It is the 3rd largest city (after Suez and Ismailia) in Egypt located on the Red Sea coast.

H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian (bird) flu virus that has caused serious outbreaks in domestic poultry in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The virus has been reported throughout the years also from Europe, in poultry and wild birds, without human cases. Highly pathogenic refers to the virus's ability to produce serious disease in poultry, according to internationally agreed pathogenicity criteria. Although H5N1 does not usually infect humans, 844 human cases of H5N1 have been reported from 15 countries since 2003.

Most human cases of "highly pathogenic" H5N1 virus infection have occurred in people who had recent contact with sick or dead poultry that were infected with H5N1 viruses.

H5N1 usually does not spread between people. - Mod.LK
