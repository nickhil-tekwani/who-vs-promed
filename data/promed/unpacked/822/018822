After sightings of murder hornets in the US, tiger mosquitoes have been taking over France. The Asian tiger mosquitoes are dangerous because they are a known carrier of dengue fever, chikungunya and the Zika virus. Just as France emerges from its lockdown, almost 65% of the region has been put on alert because of these tiger mosquitoes.

Out of 101 departments, 57 of them have a red warning for these insects. The tiger mosquitoes are black and white striped ones, and the females deliver a painful bite which can cause tropical diseases. These insects were 1st spotted in France in the year 2014. Since then, they have said to be expanding their territory as the temperatures around the globe rise. Reported cases of dengue fever and chikungunya are thought to be spread in France by tiger mosquitoes. As per experts, these insects will colonize in France by 2030. And mosquito repellents do not really work against these insects.

Asian tiger mosquitoes (_Aedes albopictus_) are black with silvery white markings on them. Striped black and white legs are a characteristic identification of them. The females' bites can cause mild irritation to intense inflammation and swelling. In warm regions, Asian tiger mosquitoes are active year-round. The species are a threat because they can transmit numerous diseases like Zika virus, West Nile virus and dengue fever virus. It is also a primary vector for chikungunya virus. [The main vectors of West Nile virus are mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_. - Mod.TY]

The Asian tiger mosquito was responsible for the chikungunya epidemic on the French Island La Reunion in 2005-2006. It was the 1st and only outbreak of chikungunya fever on the European continent.

These mosquitoes are difficult to suppress because they have the ability to adapt to different environments. Control begins with destroying places where they might be laying eggs, like puddles, gutters, litter, flower pots, vases, anything that holds standing water.

[_Aedes albopictus_ has been expanding its geographic range in southern Europe for several years. The rapid expanse northward in France is noteworthy. It has gone from 41 departments reported in April 2018 to 51 departments in 2019 and now to 57 departments. The established mosquito surveillance system in France doubtless will detect further expansion, which seems likely. The risk of initiation of ongoing transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses following introduction from elsewhere will depend on population abundance of mosquito vectors and susceptible human population densities as well as the amount of time that people spend out-of-doors in areas where there is risk of bites by these mosquitoes. Eradication of this mosquito from France is not possible with current pest control measures. This will be an interesting situation to watch over the coming months and years. - Mod.TY
