Health authorities of the department of La Guajira in northern
Colombia have banned the consumption of goat meat after news of a
case of anthrax in an indigenous girl who had ingested the meat.

Claudia Meza, secretary of health for La Guajira, noted that goat
meat is an essential part of the diet of the indigenous Wayuu people
who inhabit the Guajira Peninsula [in northern Colombia and
northwestern Venezuela.] "We have information that the meat from
animals which died from disease is being sold; what we want is to
[stop] the transmission, in case what we are seeing is
gastrointestinal anthrax, which is a more serious illness and prone
to more complications," Meza said.

According to the official, the disease has killed several goats and
apparently the girl ate contaminated meat. She is recovering in a
hospital in the city of Riohacha, the departmental capital of La Guajira.

Meza indicated that other possible cases of infection are being investigated.

[Anthrax is seldom reported in Colombia. Previous outbreaks have been
in Caqueta (SE of Bogota), in the Colombian llanos since 1998, and in
Cesar (2006) and Cundinamarca (2007). It would seem from this report
that this disease is below the Colombian veterinary radar. Granted
that paramilitary activities and drug activity are not an
encouragement to be proactive in some areas of the country though
presently reduced.

The wording of the report above indicates that the diagnosis may be
preliminary. Clarification from our Colombian members would be appreciated.

This is the 1st ProMED-mail posting for anthrax in Colombia. - Mod.MHJ]
