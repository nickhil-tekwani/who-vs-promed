Disease outbreaks reported
(page updated when new information becomes available)

27 March:

Cerebrospinal meningitis

In a recent report from the WHO Office for the African Region the
accumulated number of cases of meningitis had increased to 51 541
with 6 504 deaths (case fatality rate 12.6%). The increase was
largely from the over 9 000 additional cases reported in Nigeria.
More than 4 000 of them were new cases reported in the past week.
Major increases were also reported in Burkina Faso, Mali, and
Togo.

The following number of cases (deaths) have been reported in:
Benin: 424 (56); Burkina Faso: 11 866 (1 064); Cameroon: 5 (1);
Central African Republic: 155 (22); Chad: 505 (53); Ghana: 18
(0); Mali: 1 404 (227); Niger: 6 518 (676); Nigeria: 30 212
(4 346); Tanzania: 99(8); Togo: 505 (53), Zaire: 69 (5). No cases
have been reported in Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, Eritrea,
Mauritania, and Senegal.


21 March:

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)
The UK has analyzed cases of CJD that have occurred
in 10 adults below 42 years of age during the past year.
The disease in these cases differs from
classical CJD in several respects:
- early age (CJD is usually a disease of older people)
- differences in pathological changes in the brain
- absence of any hereditary factors (which are involved in typical
CJD)

There is no direct evidence of a link between these cases and
bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE). However, in the absence of any
apparent cause, the most likely explanation at present is that these
cases are linked to exposure to BSE before control measures were
instituted in the UK in 1989. The measures now in force in the UK are
considered to have minimized any possible risk from eating beef.

No similar pattern of disease has been recognized in humans in any
other country although BSE has also occurred in animals in Ireland,
France, Portugal, and Switzerland. Precautions have been taken in
these countries to avoid any possible risk to people from beef
consumption.

WHO recommends that national health authorities be notified if any
unusual occurrence of CJD is recognized in any other country.


19 March:

Cerebrospinal meningitis

Over 38 000 cases and over 5 000 deaths caused by cerebrospinal
meningitis have been reported in 11 countries in the African Region
since the beginning of the year. Most of these have been reported in

Nigeria. According to the most update received from the WHO Regional
Office the following number of cases (deaths) had been reported:
Benin: 362 (46); Burkina Faso: 9 532 (859); Cameroon: 5 (1); Central
African Republic: 155 (22); Chad: 244 (19); Ghana:18 (0); Mali: 787
(158); Niger: 5 529 (584); Nigeria: 20 982 (3 634); Tanzania: 99(8);
Togo: 183 (33). No cases have been reported in Burundi, Cote
d'Ivoire, Mauritania, and Senegal.

Cerebrospinal meningitis

Chad: Outbreaks of cerebrospinal meningitis have been declared in three
different Prefectures. As at 11 March information had been received on

Abeche in the Prefectures of Moyen-Chari, Logone Oriental and Ouaddai.

other prefectures. A technical committee was established on 5 March
to coordinate control activities and an international appeal for
support to the national control efforts. The committee include
representatives from the Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF, the Red
Cross, the European Union, MSF, and other non-governmental
organizations. Vaccine and equipment were available in the country
from an emergency stock provided by WHO in 1995 which with additional
support from MSF and the European Union have permitted control
activities to start in Kumra, Dobba and Abeche.

Nigeria: Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A has been confirmed in
specimens received recently at the WHO Collaborating Centre for
Reference and Research on Meningitis, National Institute of Public
Health, Oslo, Norway.
