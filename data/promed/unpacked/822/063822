A Cumbrian farm has been linked to a devastating outbreak of tuberculosis [TB] in cattle. Investigators are trying to trace any possible contacts between the herd involved and other livestock amid fears hundreds of cattle may have to be slaughtered to halt the spread of the disease. The outbreak has come as some farmers continue to point the finger at badgers as the most likely cause of spreading TB to cattle. But some Cumbrian wildlife campaigners insist that any form of badger cull would be futile and cruel.

More than a 100 dairy cows from the west Cumbrian farm were sold at the end of February [2014] at a market in Cheshire to buyers from across England, Wales, and Scotland. When some of the cattle tested positive for bovine TB, government vets launched a nationwide operation to trace all the animals.

The government said it had not yet been able to pinpoint the source of the disease, but added that the outbreak had been confirmed. However, experts have discovered that the infected cattle did come from the west Cumbrian farm. It has been placed under cattle movement restrictions, and vets this week began the process of testing livestock on around 10 neighbouring farms.

A government spokesman said they were unable to divulge the name of the farm for reasons of confidentiality. He said: "It is not normal practice for us to comment on a specific location because of the data protection act."

The crisis is bound to fuel the debate about what action is necessary to protect Cumbria from a disease so devastating that it has the potential to paralyse dairy and beef farming.

Government vets said: "Investigations are at an early stage and it would be premature to speculate on the origin of infection in the herd in Cumbria. "We do not comment on individual cases, but this incident highlights how serious a problem TB is for all cattle farmers, regardless of where they farm."

A beef and sheep farmer said his Ravenglass farm was just outside the 3 km [1.9 mi] testing area. "How this disease has occurred in this relatively isolated area is a complete mystery. This farm operated a fairly closed herd, and therefore had limited herd movements," he said. "We have a lot of upset farmers, which is understandable." he added.

Low levels of TB have persisted in Cumbria for a number of years. Defra figures reveal 16 herds were under TB restriction at the end of 2013. There were 17 new herd incidents during the year.

Last week [week of 1 Apr 2014] tha government launched its measures to achieve TB free cattle in England by 2038. This includes a grant-funded scheme for badger vaccination projects in the 'edge area' at the frontier of the disease, and improvements to the 4-year badger cull pilots in Somerset and Gloucestershire.

After an outcry from campaigners a series of changes will be made to improve the humaneness and safety of culling. These changes will be monitored. A Cockermouth campaigner is urging the public to get behind a move to stop the "needless" culling of badgers. 2 online petitions have been posted on Cumbria County Council and Allerdale council websites on behalf of BRAVE, an organisation dedicated to promoting badger vaccination and research.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary [for references, please go to the original paper at the source URL above]

Context
-------
Tuberculosis (TB) in British cattle caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_ has only sporadically affected companion animals. Between December 2012 and March 2013, 7 laboratory confirmed cases of _M. bovis_ infection in cats were seen at one veterinary clinic in Newbury, Berkshire, UK. 2 more cats with suspected _M. bovis_ infection were identified in the same time frame. All 9 cats were from separate households and lived within a 5 km [3.1 mi] radius; 6 lived within a 250 m [0.2 mi] radius.

Main conclusion
---------------
The most likely source of infection for at least some of the cats is infected wildlife -- probably rodents and/or badgers. Genotyping showed that the polymorphism in these cat isolates reflects the polymorphism found in the local cattle/wildlife population and supports the idea that cats are occasional spillover hosts for _M. bovis_ from a local wildlife or cattle reservoir.

Approach
--------
Traditional field epidemiological investigations were conducted to characterise this incident. Isolates from local cats, cattle, and an alpaca were genotyped. Selected isolates were whole genome sequenced.

Results
-------
A history of likely bite wounds in 4 cases, and popliteal lymphadenitis (possibly due to distal hindlimb inoculation) in 3 others, offers a route of infection through biting for 7 out of the 9 cases. All _M. bovis_ isolates from the culture-positive cats were of the rare 10:u genotype, previously identified in another cat, an alpaca, and 21 cattle herd breakdowns from the same area since 2008. Whole genome sequence of the 10:u isolates from cats and cattle showed common characteristics suggesting that at least 2 transmissions had occurred into these cats from local wildlife/cattle.

Interpretation
--------------
It is impossible to be more precise about the exact origin of infection for the cats in this cluster, but the balance of evidence and our knowledge of the way in which this disease spreads suggests that a wildlife/environmental source is more likely than a cattle source.

Significance of findings
------------------------
Most cases of tuberculous disease in cats caused by _M. bovis_ are sporadic and diagnosed in areas of endemic infection in cattle and wildlife. The incident reported here was unusual and does not change the view that cats represent occasional spillover hosts of the bacterium, playing a limited role in the epidemiology of bovine TB in Great Britain. Nevertheless, the infection in cats can give rise to a serious and potentially zoonotic disease. Therefore, practitioners should remain alert for (and seek differential bacteriological diagnosis of) suspected mycobacterial disease in cats.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
No one connected with farming or veterinary science could fail to know that bovine TB caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_ is a major problem in cattle in Great Britain, especially in the west of England and Wales and, unfortunately, that its prevalence is increasing. Most people are also aware that _M. bovis_ infects badgers. However, people are generally less aware that in Great Britain, _M. bovis_ is now quite commonly found in cats, pigs, South American camelids (llamas and alpacas), and deer, and it can be found less frequently in many other species, including dogs, goats, sheep, feral mink, ferrets, rats, and mice. It is only by understanding the full complexity of _M. bovis_ ecology that we will eventually be able to control it.

_M. bovis_ infection in cats is of significant importance as feline TB is being recognised with increased frequency in Great Britain. Approximately 1 per cent of feline tissue samples submitted to diagnostic laboratories for routine histopathology have been found to have changes consistent with mycobacteriosis and, when cultured, _M. bovis_ is identified in 15 per cent of these samples. Infected cats are almost exclusively from the west of England and Wales, co-incident with the areas where cattle, badgers, mice, and other small rodents are also infected.

_M. bovis_-infected cats are very rarely seen elsewhere in Great Britain. Unfortunately, while increasing numbers of cases of feline TB are being diagnosed, many veterinary surgeons still fail to recognise this condition. This is because, instead of presenting with wasting and a cough (as might be expected), cats with TB typically present with cutaneous lesions and/or lymphadenopathy. The skin lesions are single or multiple raised nodules, which may or may not be ulcerated, and/or have associated draining sinus tracts [Fig 1 "Typical case of feline tuberculosis" available in the original paper, subscription required. -Mod.AS]. Extension of granulomatous tissue may involve subcutaneous structures, muscle, and/or bone, and lesions are commonly associated with either local or generalised lymphadenopathy. In some cases, local lymphadenopathy may be the only finding. Chronic cases may progress to involve the lungs, with affected cats presenting with dyspnoea and, occasionally, a soft cough.

An important piece of work on feline TB, summarised on p 326 of this issue of Veterinary Record [see item 2 above], describes an unusual cluster of 9 cats with _M. bovis_ infection, which were all presented to the same small animal practice. The clinical signs were similar to those seen in other studies, with cutaneous lesions at 'fight and bite sites' and/or local lymphadenopathy (four cases had popliteal lymphadenopathy), with or without pulmonary signs (7 cases had interstitial pneumonia). However, what was unusual about these cats is that they all lived in very close proximity (within 5 km [3.1 mi]; 6 lived within a 250 m [0.2 mi] radius). While the epidemiology of feline _M. bovis_ infection is still unclear, it is currently thought that most cats are infected when bitten by _M. bovis_-infected small rodents while hunting. Rodents probably become infected when visiting contaminated badger setts; the _M. bovis_ spoligotypes found in cats are the same as those found in cattle, badgers, and small rodents in any particular area. Cats could also be infected via environmental contamination from infected badgers (or possibly deer), as _M. bovis_ can survive for extended periods in certain environments. While it is possible that badgers could directly infect cats, this is unlikely, as they rarely interact closely. Drinking tuberculous milk is also unlikely as most cows' milk is pasteurised in Great Britain and infected cattle are removed early in infection (as reactor cattle), so tuberculous mastitis is rarely seen [comment].

Previously, cases have been reported where a number of cats within a single household have been infected, but in most cases the cats had little close contact with each other, and the infections appeared to result from hunting the same group of infected prey). However, a small number of cases have occurred in cats that did not go outside, but that lived with another cat (or in one case a dog) that was known to be infected and/or which went outside and hunted. These cases appear to represent spread via close contact, particularly sleeping with and grooming an infected companion. Based on details in the short communication by Roberts and others (2014), it is not possible to tell how these cats were infected, but the authors suggest it was via rodents and/or badgers. They also stated that cat-to-cat transmission could not be ruled out.

Importantly, there has now been a small number of nosocomial cases, where cats naturally infected with _M. bovis_ have infected other cats via contamination within a veterinary practice, particularly during routine neutering.

All of the cats reported by Roberts and others (2014) were seen within the same small animal veterinary clinic, and one developed a tuberculous lesion at the site of castration 3 weeks after the operation. I have seen this startlingly rapid progression in 2 confirmed nosocomial cases, with clinical signs arising as soon as 14 days after ovariohysterectomy and rapid progression to the point of euthanasia at 42 days after castration. Rapid disease progression has previously been seen in experimental and naturally occurring infections, and may result from a large inoculation of _M. bovis_.

The information presented by Roberts and others is important as it reinforces the evidence that feline TB is now a significant disease in cats in Great Britain. It shows that infection clusters can occur, probably resulting from interactions with wildlife. It also shows that failing to recognise these infections can result in nosocomial infection. All veterinary practitioners need to know how to recognise feline TB so they do not misdiagnose it, resulting in a poor prognosis for that particular cat, while also putting themselves and their other patients at risk of _M. bovis_ infection.

Unfortunately, diagnosis is not always easy; specialist culture is the gold standard, but it can take many weeks. The interferon gamma test is proving helpful, but we urgently need rapid and accurate antemortem diagnostics so that these cats can be accurately identified as quickly as possible. What we then do is up for serious debate, as while _M. bovis_-infected cats can respond well to the correct treatment, there are no drugs licenced for the treatment of feline TB, and although rifampicin is usually given, some people feel that this antibiotic should be kept solely for the treatment of people with TB.

[The short communication in item 2 above is complementary to the information included in ProMED-mail posting 20140327.2361967. Prof Gunn-Moore's editorial includes essential clinical and pathological observations in cats, which should be very useful, in addition to UK's small-animal practitioners, to their peers globally.

Viewing cow milk as an "unlikely" source of infection for cats since "most cows' milk is pasteurised in Great Britain and infected cattle are removed early in infection," is in need of further discussion. According to this moderator's best knowledge, milk, while on the farm, remains raw since pasteurisation is applied only after the milk is transported to the dairy plant/factory.

TB in cattle may be detected "early in infection" only if tuberculination is applied periodically and frequently, on each farm. The event described in item 1 above, when, apparently, some 100 dairy cows from a TB-infected west Cumbrian farm were reportedly sold at a market to buyers from across England, Wales, and Scotland, is illustrative of the current challenging situation.
