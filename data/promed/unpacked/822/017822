1. Presentation on 3-4 Mar 2009: bluetongue situation in Lesvos
---------------------------------------------------------------
On 3 Nov 2008, Greece notified to the European Commission suspicion of
bluetongue in 3 sheep holdings on the island of Lesvos. The symptoms found
were high fever, morbidity, and edema in their heads. These suspected cases
were confirmed as BT positive by RT-PCR. The number of cases was 83 and we
found them in the central and eastern part of the island. We had no
seroconversions in bovine sentinels by December 2008.

Serotype of virus
-----------------
Firstly the NRL [National Reference Laboratory, Athens] found the serotype
BTV-16 using the conventional method (Agar-Gel) but we had one sample with
inconclusive result. We sent 10 samples to CRL [Central reference
laboratory, Pirbright] for confirmation and they replied that they found in
one sample the BTV-8 using the RT-PCR [see comment below].

Then, in early February 2009, we decided to take 200 random blood samples
from the whole island including the infected holding [which had]
inconclusive results, and to test them with the Kits of RT-PCR that were
purchased recently. In 2 samples coming from indigenous sheep of this
infected holding, we found the serotype BTV-8.

Entomological data
------------------
In November 2008 the NRL found _C. imicola_ and in January 2009 _C.
obsoletus_. In February 2009 we did not find any vector (vector free
period). In the past, we have found serotypes 1, 4, 9, and 16 in Lesvos.

Investigation
-------------
Initially, we could not exclude the possibility the virus had entered the
island with bovines for fattening and slaughter from France, for rearing in
a holding situated 3 km [2 mi] from the infected farm. The investigation
will be continued.

2. Presentation on 1-2 Apr 2009: bluetongue situation in Chios
--------------------------------------------------------------
On 12 Mar 2009, the NRL in Athens informed the Central Veterinary Authority
of the Ministry of Rural Development and Food that in Chios, according to
the National Surveillance for BT program for 2009, 5 bovine and one ovine
blood samples were found positive in ELISA test.

The bovines belong to 4 holdings: 2 of them are situated in Kampochori, 1
in the capital of the island, and the last in Kardamyla -- where the ovine
[outbreak] was found. All of them are situated in the eastern part of the
island.

Updated results
---------------
No symptoms were found [during the] inspection visit; 3 bovines were found
PCR positive.

We have not obtained conclusive results with the primer method regarding
the serotype. For this reason, the NRL has performed the cell inoculation
method. The results will be ready as soon as possible.

[Results of the virus isolation attempts from the Chios samples are
anticipated with interest. In any event, clearly the unique BTV-8 strain
was (is?) present on Lesvos, which is situated to its north, similarly
adjacent to the Turkish mainland (see map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/list/greece/english>). Both islands could
have been infected by introduced animals, or (probably more likely) by
windborne infected culicoids from the mainland.

The dsRNA virus collection at IAH Pirbright includes the following 2008
Greek isolate:
Isolate number GRE2008/01, identified by seg-2 specific RT-PCR.
Source: Greece, Agia Paraskevi. Isolated from sheep blood.
Herd No: EL83306344, animal ID: EL833063440340.
Isolated at IAH-Pirbright on 1 Dec 2008.
Further details at
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//ReoID/btv-8.htm#GRE2008/01>.

Notably, the 2008 BT outbreak in Lesvos was initially attributed to BTV-16.
When the "immediate notification" was submitted by Greece to the OIE, on 7
Nov 2008, the isolated BT virus was reportedly untyped. In early December
2008, the Greek Authorities announced that the outbreak was caused by
BTV-16. The later identification of BTV-8 in samples from the November
[2008] outbreak is indicative of a mixed infection.

Of interest, we are informed that, according to a very recent laboratory
report, a rather similar scenario has been observed in north western
Israel, where an outbreak in a bovine dairy farm, in November 2008,
initially attributed to BTV-16, has now been found to be related to BTV-8
as well. This strain, responsible for the epizootic in north and central
Europe since 2006, has never before been seen in Israel (or, for that
matter, in any Asian country, including Turkey's mainland). Details will be
posted as soon as they become available. - Mod.AS
