Seneca Valley virus cases found at slaughterhouses
--------------------------------------------------
Over the past 10 days (8-17 Jul 2016), there have been 12 cases of vesicular disease that have been discovered at 2 slaughter plants in the state of Iowa.

All cases have tested negative for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), but 75 percent of them have tested positive for Senecavirus A (Seneca Valley virus). In all cases, there was NO report of seeing clinical lesions at the site at the time of loading the market pigs, but the lesions and/or lameness were discovered during ante-mortem inspection by the USDA FSIS [US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service] veterinarian.

This release is an awareness piece to be shared with veterinarians, pork producers, contract growers and employees that during the load out process to be looking for any combination of the following clinical signs:

- Vesicles (intact or ruptured) on the snout or in the oral mucosa (any muco-cutaneous junction): ruptured nasal vesicle [see figure at https://www.aasv.org/images/images/SVVFigure1a.jpg]; may or may not be seen in association with lame pigs
- Acute lameness in a group of pigs
- May see ulcerative lesions on or around the hoof wall (coronary band)
- May see redness or blanching around the coronary bands
- May see eventual sloughing of the hoof wall
- In the early course of the disease, fevers up to 105 degrees F have been reported
- Anorexia, lethargy and/or febrile

What to do if you see or are made aware of clinical signs consistent with vesicular disease?
- Immediately contact the State Animal Health Official and/or APHIS Assistant District Director (ADD). They will decide if a Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) investigation is warranted and how to proceed.
- Quarantine the farm (and yourself if on farm) until directed by State and Federal Authorities.

[The best recommendations to follow when a herd is suspected of having Senecavirus A (SVA) are to follow the USDA guidelines regarding animals with vesicular lesions. Those guidelines from USDA may be found on the American Association of Swine Veterinarians document: https://www.aasv.org/documents/VSG7406.2_SVA_Guidelines_4516.pdf. The article is USDA's recommendations for handling herds suspected of having SVA to ensure that foreign animal disease investigations occur per agency guidelines.
