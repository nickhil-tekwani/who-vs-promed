ST STEPHEN, New Brunswick: A Canadian Customs inspector, who lives in a
wooded area where wildlife is abundant just outside St Stephen, became
aware of rabies last January when her dogs came across a young, dying
raccoon, which she rescued. The animal was tested for rabies by the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and found to be negative. In March,
however, when the woman encountered a dead raccoon at a time when she had
an open wound and she called the rabies hotline the animal was retrieved,
and 5 days later she learned it had tested positive for rabies. She was
told to go the hospital, where she was given a series of 5 needles in the
hip and 1 in the arm, followed by a series of 4 more shots over a 28 day
period. The womans dogs, which had been vaccinated against rabies, were
quarantined for 90 days.
To date [from when to when? - mod.SH], 45 positive cases of rabid animals
have been reported in St Stephen, a community of 4000 located on the border
between New Brunswick and Maine [closest US neighbor is Calais]. Canadian
officials believe the strain of rabies turning up on their side of the St
Croix River, known as the Mid-Atlantic strain, is [implicated in] the
rabies problem in Washington County, which had its first reported case last
year. In Calais, 4 cases have been reported to date.
Dr James Goltz, a pathologist with the provincial Department of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture, said more cases have been reported
in the St Stephen area than in the Calais area because Maines testing is
limited to animals which have had contact with people or domestic animals.
In New Brunswick, he said, tests are performed not only on animals that
have come in contact with people and domestic animals, but also on all
animals having shown abnormal behavior. In the Charlotte County area, he
said, all animals found dead, including "roadkill", are tested.
Julie Crosby, a microbiologist with the Maine Department of Human Services
rabies laboratory, said that the state cannot afford to test every dead
animal. "If there is animal or human contact, we certainly will test it,
and we recommend people call the lab," she said. Crosby said pet owners
need to act responsibly and have their animals vaccinated. She also
suggested people instruct their youngsters to leave wild animals alone.
Rabies is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system. Once
symptoms appear, the disease is always fatal in animals and humans. The
animals that most often carry the disease include raccoons, foxes, skunks,
and bats. The virus is most commonly transmitted through saliva, primarily
as a result of a bite, but also when saliva comes in contact with an open
cut or wound, according to a pamphlet issued by the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency.
