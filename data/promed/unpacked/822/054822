Viet Nam: suspected avian influenza case hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City
-----------------------------------------------
A 35 year old woman from Viet Nam's southern province Tra Vinh was admitted
to hospital on Tue 11 Jan 2005 [on suspicion] of suffering from avian
influenza, according to the local newspaper Saigon Liberation. The woman
named was admitted to the Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City
with symptoms of high fever and lung infection 14 days after she killed and
ate a diseased chicken. The patient, who needs respiratory assistance in
the hospital, also lives in an avian influenza affected area, said the paper.
To date, at least 15 local people have been hospitalized [on suspicion] of
having contracted the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. Of the cases, 4 were
confirmed to have contracted H5N1 serotype virus: these include an 18 year
old girl from southern Tien Giang province, a 16 year old girl from
southern Tay Ninh province, a 9 year old boy from southern Tra Vinh
province, and a 6 year old boy in southern Dong Thap province, all of whom
have died.
To control the spread of the disease, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development on Tuesday [11 Jan 2005] issued an anti-bird flu urgent message
asking localities to take measures to tighten monitoring of poultry flocks,
to intensify propaganda via media, to update information on new outbreaks
and the number of dead, to cull fowl every day, to slaughter all sick
poultry, and to ban transporting of poultry and their products out of the
disease-hit areas.
According to the Department of Animal Health, since last December 2004,
[recurrence of avian influenza] has been seen in 13 localities across the
country, killing or leading to the forced culling of around 103 000 fowl.
In late March 2004, Viet Nam declared an end to the outbreak of avian
influenza that killed 17 per cent of its poultry population and claimed at
least 21 human lives during the previous outbreak starting in December
2003. A total of 43.2 million fowl nationwide either died or were culled,
causing a total loss of VND 1.3 trillion (USD 82.8 million) to the local
poultry industry.
