Summary of outbreaks: total outbreaks: 4
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep/goats / 2022 / 19 / 0 / 19 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Sheep, goats / 0.94 / 0 / 0 / 0.94
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comment: the peculiarities of the current event are as follows: Unlike this event, previous events were characterized by massive waves of abortions and detection of virus circulation in animals (sentinel flocks) preceding the occurrence of human cases.

Control measures
Measures applied: modified stamping out; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country; disinfection / disinfestations; traceability; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; control of vectors

Future Reporting:
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

[The event is said to have started on 29 Sep 2015 and was confirmed on 4 Nov 2015. The 4 reported outbreaks are, reportedly, located in 4 different provinces in the southern regions of Mauritania -- 1 outbreak per province (see map). It will be interesting to note if there have been additional outbreaks or the 4 mentioned flocks have been selectively tested, following the appearance of RVF cases in humans.

Though the diagnosis of RVF in the affected animals was reportedly obtained by advanced laboratory tests, no further information is included (for example, name/location of the laboratory, species, date, test method applied, results). Such information is requested.

RVF was initially reported from West Africa (Senegal and Mauritania) in 1987, following the opening of Diama Dam at the mouth of the Senegal River, in an area where the virus was, most probably, present earlier but not generally recognized. The dam project created additional breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying the disease and resulted in more than 200 human deaths from RVF. It is regarded as endemic with flare-ups every several years.

According to the most recent available annual report (2013) from Mauritania, RVF (in animals) is not officially notifiable in this country. It is "present, limited to 1 or more zones". No vaccination is applied. During 2013, 5 outbreaks were reported, affecting sheep and goats (mixed flocks; 190 cases out of 750 susceptible, no mortalities), sheep (90/300, no mortalities) and camels (11/100, 3 mortalities). Such mortality rates are rather low; in 2012, the figures were higher, accompanied by human infections including fatalities.

The disease's lethality rate is traditionally known to be particularly high in offspring (for example, in southern and east Africa, with death rates nearing 100 per cent in lambs and kids under the age of 4 weeks). It will be interesting to note if the affected flocks in Mauritania included young lambs/kids during the outbreaks. - Mods. AS & CRD
