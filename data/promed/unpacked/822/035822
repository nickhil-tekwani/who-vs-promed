With 4 cases of mumps discovered among Londoners, the Middlesex-
London Health Unit is urging returning university and college-age
students to get [vaccinated against] measles, mumps and rubella. The
close quarters that bring together young people from a wide area are
prime breeding grounds for the airborne disease.

"It's not an epidemic," said Marlene Price, manager of vaccine and
preventable diseases for the health unit. But anyone born since 1970
is advised to seek a 2nd dose of vaccine, because most have had only
one. Persons born before 1970 are seen as having natural immunity, she
said, because they have likely already been exposed and have stronger
defense mechanisms. [However], persons born before 1970 who work in
health care or the military also should seek a 2nd vaccination, she
said.

Mumps can lead to fever, muscle aches, headaches, fatigue, swelling of
glands and can develop into complications that include infections of
the brain, ovaries, breasts or pancreas. Price said anyone who
develops mumps symptoms should stay home and consult their health-care
provider, student health services or attend health unit walk-in
immunization clinics in London and Strathroy.

To prevent the spread of mumps, things that have been in other
people's mouths should not be shared, kissing avoided, and coughs and
sneezes should be stifled into the elbow. Frequent hand-washing is
recommended.

Price said the imminent arrival of students will create ideal
conditions to promote the spread of mumps.
