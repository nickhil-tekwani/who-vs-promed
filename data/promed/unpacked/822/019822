Three people have tested positive for scrub typhus at Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital between 5 and 11 Aug 2013. According to hospital officials, one of them was brought from Alwar and 2 from Dausa. All 3 were suffering from fever, chills, and other symptoms of scrub typhus. Suspecting that the patients might be suffering from scrub typhus, the doctors advised them to undergo the test, which is available at the SMS hospital. The patients were tested positive for the deadly disease. Mortality is high with scrub typhus if patients fail to get immediate treatment. At least 14 people died of the disease in 2012, and more than 140 cases were reported from different parts of the state.

The deadly disease was 1st reported 3 years ago in Alwar. In 2012, it spread to 10 different districts. Some cases were reported from Jaipur as well. An SMS hospital official said that the 3 cases reported now are the 1st cases of scrub typhus of the season [2013] in the state.

Health officials said that, mostly, those in rural areas are likely to fall victim to the disease, as there are mites, known as chiggers, which are found in grass and green areas. The chiggers are found in scrub vegetation. The mites bite a person and leave behind a black spot (eschar) on the body.

Apprehensive about the spread of the disease, the health department has started taking all precautionary measures in the area where the scrub typhus cases were reported in 2012.

Dr Bairwa said that since mortality among scrub typhus cases can be high, they are administering doxycycline tablets for those coming with fever, as it is the best available medicine for the disease.

[There are a number of diseases with typhus literally, or figuratively, in their names, including epidemic typhus, Brill-Zinsser disease (recrudescent epidemic typhus), murine typhus, scrub typhus, and typhoid (so-called because it is typhus-like and sometimes called abdominal typhus). The term typhus comes from the Greek, _typhein_ (to smoke), which may refer to the smoky or clouded mental status that patients present with.

Typhus fever, the classical epidemic typhus, is a vectorborne disease with a complex epidemiology. Lice, the vectors, live in clothing; therefore, weather, humidity, and hygiene determine their prevalence. Consequently, the body or clothing louse is more prevalent during the colder months, and epidemic typhus is more frequently reported during the winter and early spring.

The permanent foci of the body louse exist in regions subject to cold weather, where inhabitants need to wear multiple layers of clothes, and in poverty-stricken communities whose inhabitants lack multiple sets of clothes. Such populations are most common in mountainous regions of countries in intertropical zones, including Ethiopia, Burundi, and Rwanda in Africa, Peru in South America, and Nepal and Tibet in central Asia. The prevalence of body lice increases with altitude. Infestation with lice is more frequent during wars, in trenches, and in jail, where conditions are cramped, when it is cold, and where hygiene is limited. Large outbreaks of lice have been associated with the recent civil wars in Burundi. An outbreak of typhus occurred in a jail in Burundi, and subsequently, a huge outbreak of typhus occurred in several refugee camps, where nearly all inhabitants were louse-infested.

The body louse attaches its eggs to clothing, not to the body or hair, often on the inner belts of underwear, pants or skirts. When removed from the body, even in the absence of insecticides, the unwashed clothes will [lose all] viable lice and eggs within 7 days. Raoult and Roux (1) cite Maunder (2), who hypothesized that religious Sabbath and Sunday ritual days of rest with a change of clothes could [have contributed] to a delousing cycle. _Rickettsia prowazekii_, the causative agent of typhus fever, is considered a category B biowarfare agent because of the propensity for infective louse feces to be aerosolized.

Scrub typhus is spread to humans as a zoonosis by the bite of the larval stage of trombiculid mites (chiggers). The term scrub comes from the type of local vegetation, scrub, between forests and cleared areas, where the vector is found. The disease is also referred to as tsutsugamushi fever. The organism, _R. tsutsugamushi_, or _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, causes natural disease in eastern Asia and in the western Pacific. In any area, because of high rates of transovarian transmission in the mite, highly focal areas of high risk exist. Symptoms are often nonspecific, but severe headache and myalgias (common in rickettsioses), and an eschar [dry scab] with regional lymphadenopathy [swollen lymph nodes in the same area], can be helpful to diagnosis in endemic areas. The diagnosis can be made serologically, although early treatment (doxycycline) may blunt the antibody response.

Weil and Felix described the classical assay for rickettsial antibody detection in 1916. The methodology took advantage of heterophilic (cross-reacting) antigens of members of the genus _Rickettsia_ and several species of the Gram negative bacillus _Proteus_. In the Weil-Felix test, bacteria of _Proteus vulgaris_ OX-19 agglutinate with sera of those infected with the typhus group organisms and with the Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) organism _R. rickettsii_. Cells of _P. vulgaris_ OX-2, on the other hand, agglutinate with sera from individuals with spotted fever infection, except RMSF. The OX-19 agglutination is seen in epidemic typhus, but usually not in Brill-Zinsser recrudescent disease. _P. mirabilis_ OX-K can be similarly used in the serological diagnosis of scrub typhus. Because of the relatively poor sensitivity, and specificity, of this test, more specific assays can be used for diagnosis, including complement fixation. Dipstick enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (3) and polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) (4) have now been added to potential diagnostic tests.
