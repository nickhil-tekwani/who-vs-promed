A deadly, hard-to-treat fungal infection that has been spreading through nursing homes and hospitals across the United States is becoming even more dangerous, according to researchers, who for the 1st time have identified several cases in which the fungus, _Candida auris_, was completely impervious to all existing medication. The finding, released Thursday [22 Jul 2021] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], is an alarming development in the evolution of _C. auris_, a tenacious yeast infection discovered in Japan in 2009 that has since spread across much of the world.

Federal health officials say the bug has spread even more widely during the coronavirus pandemic, with overwhelmed hospitals and nursing homes struggling to keep up with the surveillance and control measures needed to contain local outbreaks.

In the new report, the CDC said, 5 of more than 120 cases of _C. auris_ were resistant to treatment. The CDC did not identify the facilities where the novel infections took place, but health officials said there was no evident link between the outbreaks, which occurred in Texas at a hospital and a long-term care facility that share patients, and at a single long-term care center in Washington, DC. The outbreaks took place between January and April [2021].

Nearly 1/3 of the infected patients died within 30 days, according to the CDC, but because they were already gravely ill, officials said it was unclear whether their deaths were caused by the fungus.

Over the past 8 years, the CDC has identified more than 2000 Americans colonized with _C. auris_ -- meaning the fungus was detected on their skin -- with most cases concentrated in New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and California. Between 5 and 10% of those colonized with the pathogen go on to develop more serious bloodstream infections. Once it gains a foothold, the fungus is difficult to eliminate from health care facilities, clinging to cleaning carts, intravenous poles, and other medical equipment. While relatively harmless to those in good health, the yeast infection can be deadly to seriously ill hospital patients, residents of long-term care facilities, and others with weakened immune systems.

While _C. auris_ has long been notoriously hard to treat, researchers for the 1st time identified 5 patients in Texas and Washington, DC, whose infections did not respond to any of the 3 major classes of antifungal medication. So-called panresistance had been previously reported in 3 patients in New York who were being treated for _C. auris_, but health officials said the newly reported panresistant infections occurred in patients who had never received antifungal drugs, said Dr. Meghan Lyman, a medical officer at the CDC who specializes in fungal diseases.

Infectious disease specialists say the coronavirus pandemic has probably accelerated the spread of the fungus. The shortages of personal protective equipment that hobbled healthcare workers during the early months of the pandemic, they say, increased opportunities for the fungus's transmission, especially among the thousands of COVID-19 patients who ended up on invasive mechanical ventilation. The chaos of recent months also did not help. "Infection control efforts at most health care systems are stretched thin in the best of times, but with so many COVID patients, resources that might have gone to infection control were diverted elsewhere," Dr Cornelius J Clancy, infectious diseases doctor at the VA Pittsburgh Health Care System, said.

For many health experts, the emergence of a panresistant _C. auris_ is a sobering reminder about the threats posed by antimicrobial resistance, from superbugs like MRSA to antibiotic-resistant salmonella. Such infections sicken 2.8 million Americans a year and kill 35 000, according to the CDC.

Dr Michael S Phillips, chief epidemiologist at NYU/Langone Health, said health systems across the country were struggling to contain the spread of such pathogens. The problem, he said, was especially acute in big cities like New York, where seriously ill patients shuttle between nursing homes with lax infection control and top-notch medical centers that often draw patients from across a wider region. "We need to do a better job at surveillance and infection control, especially in places where we put patients in group settings," he said. "_Candida auris_ is something we should be concerned about, but we can't lose sight of the bigger picture because there are a lot of other drug-resistant bugs out there we should be worried about."

Abstract
--------
_Candida auris_ is an emerging, often multidrug-resistant yeast that is highly transmissible, resulting in healthcare-associated outbreaks, especially in long-term care facilities. Skin colonization with _C. auris_ allows spread and leads to invasive infections, including bloodstream infections, in 5%-10% of colonized patients (1). 3 major classes of antifungal medications exist for treating invasive infections: azoles (such as fluconazole), polyenes (such as amphotericin B), and echinocandins. Approximately 85% of _C. auris_ isolates in the United States are resistant to azoles, 33% to amphotericin B, and 1% to echinocandins (2), based on tentative susceptibility breakpoints.* Echinocandins are thus critical for the treatment of _C. auris_ infections and are recommended as 1st-line therapy for most invasive _Candida_ infections (3). Echinocandin resistance is a concerning clinical and public health threat, particularly when coupled with resistance to azole and amphotericin B (pan-resistance).

Pan-resistant _C. auris_ isolates have been reported previously, although rarely, from the United States (4) and other countries (5). 3 pan-resistant _C. auris_ cases reported in New York developed resistance following echinocandin treatment and lacked epidemiologic links or common health care (4), suggesting that resistance resulted from antifungal pressure rather than via person-to-person transmission. Since January 2021, however, the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network has detected independent clusters of pan-resistant or echinocandin-resistant cases in Texas and the District of Columbia (DC). Each cluster involved common health care encounters and no known previous echinocandin exposure, suggesting transmission of pan- and echinocandin-resistant strains for the 1st time in the United States.

Among 101 clinical and screening cases of _C. auris_** in DC during January-April 2021, 3 had an isolate that was pan-resistant. All resistant isolates were identified through skin colonization screening at one long-term care facility for severely ill patients, including those requiring mechanical ventilation.

Among 22 clinical and screening cases of _C. auris_ in Texas during the same period, 2 were pan-resistant and 5 were resistant to both echinocandins and fluconazole. These 7 cases were identified in patients who were cared for at 2 facilities that share patients in the same city; 2 patients were at a long-term acute care hospital, 3 at a short-term acute care hospital, and 2 at both facilities. Among these cases, 4 were identified through colonization screening and 3 through clinical isolates (2 blood isolates and one wound isolate).

No known epidemiologic links were identified between the Texas and DC clusters. No patients with pan- or echinocandin-resistant isolates in either cluster had received echinocandins before _C. auris_ specimen collection. 30-day mortality in both outbreaks combined was 30%, but the relative contribution of _C. auris_ was unclear.

These 2 simultaneous, independent clusters of pan- or echinocandin-resistant _C. auris_ cases in patients with overlapping inpatient health care exposures and without previous echinocandin use provide the first evidence suggesting that pan- or echinocandin-resistant _C. auris_ strains might have been transmitted in U.S. health care settings. Surveillance, public health reporting, and infection control measures are critical to containing further spread. Clinicians should consider early antifungal susceptibility testing in patients with _C. auris_ infection, especially in those with treatment failure. Data are lacking about the most appropriate therapy for pan-resistant infections. Combination and investigational antifungal treatments can be considered, but evidence in clinical settings is limited (6). More information is needed to evaluate patient outcomes and identify proper treatment for _C. auris_ cases with pan-resistance or echinocandin resistance.

["In the United States, the CDC reports that about 90% of _Candida auris_ isolates have been resistant to fluconazole, about 30% have been resistant to amphotericin B, and less than 5% have been resistant to echinocandins; isolates that are resistant to fluconazole may respond to other triazoles, such as voriconazole and posaconazole, occasionally" (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-antifungal.html).

Invasive _C. auris_ infections are initially treated empirically with an echinocandin drug, with patients needing careful monitoring as _C. auris_ can develop resistance quickly during therapy (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-treatment.html). However, in the outbreaks in Texas and Washington DC, the isolates of _C. auris_ were echinocandin-resistant without the patients having been exposed to echinocandins previously, suggesting transmission of pan- and echinocandin-resistant strains for the 1st time in the United States.

Several patients had isolates of _C. auris_ that were panresistant, that is, resistant to azoles (fluconazole), amphotericin B, and echinocandins.

The CDC recommends that infection controls for _C. auris_ in health care settings include hand hygiene, transmission-based precautions (isolation of patients in single rooms or housing people with the same MDR infection in the same room), disinfection of the patient environment, communication with other facilities when transferring patients, screening contacts of patients, and prospective laboratory surveillance to identify new cases in facilities where _C. auris_ has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-infection-control.html). - Mod.ML
