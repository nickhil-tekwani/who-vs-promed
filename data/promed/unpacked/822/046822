4-year-old girl dies of bubonic plague
------------------------------
A 4-year-old girl died of bubonic plague on Saturday in the south-central
Kazakh province of Kzyl-Orda, while another 27 people who had been in contact
with her were now under treatment.
"We have a confirmed the diagnosis [of plague] regarding the dead child -- a
girl born in 1999, who had lived in the Aral District of the Kzyl-Orda
Province and passed away on 16 Aug 2003," Baurzhan Bayserkin, the deputy
head of the epidemiological inspection agency of the Kazakh health ministry,
told IRIN from the capital, Astana, on Monday.
Bayserkin explained that the disease had been caused by the bite of a flea
carrying the plague bacterium, noting that the child had lived in the village
of Shomysh in Kzyl-Orda Province, which was located in a natural reservoir of
the disease.
"27 people have been in contact with her, including people where she resided,
as well as those who were in contact with her before she reached the medical
unit, and medical staff involved in examining her," the health official said,
adding that no quarantine (in the region) would be announced, because the
case had been one of bubonic plague, which was not as dangerous as the
pneumonic form of the disease.
According to Bayserkin, efforts were being made to tackle the issue, with
resources from local budgets being allocated in an effort to ensure preventive
treatment of those with whom the child had been in contact, adding that steps
would also be taken to disinfect the village and kill all its rats, which
normally host fleas. Additionally, the local population, mainly cattle
breeders and small-scale farmers, would be inoculated against plague, he
added.
The health official maintained that the situation on the ground was under
control, while comprehensive epidemiological and preventive measures were
being taken, adding that there had been no other cases of plague.
3 people contracted bubonic plague in the western Kazakh province of
Mangistau at the end of July [2003] by way of contact with the meat of an
infected camel [see ref. below).
Recent outbreaks have shown that plague may reoccur in areas that have long
remained free of the disease. Untreated, mortality -- particularly from
pneumonic plague -- may reach high levels. When rapidly diagnosed and
promptly treated, plague may be successfully managed with antibiotics such as
streptomycin and tetracycline, reducing mortality from 60 percent to less
than 15 percent.

given the increased amount of tourism & trade to & from remote areas, it is
important that travelers realise the risk. - Mod.JW]
