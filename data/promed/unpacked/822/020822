A 2nd Dutch person has been diagnosed with the human variant of mad
cow disease after a woman died from the disease in 2005, Dutch health
authorities said on Thu [22 Jun 2006]. The Dutch Institute for Health
and Environment (RIVM) did not disclose any further details to
protect the privacy of the patient. It said in a statement that the
person most probably became infected by eating contaminated meat
products. A 26-year-old Dutch woman who had been diagnosed with the
brain wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob (vCJD) disease -- the human form of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- died in May 2005.
Over 150 cases of vCJD have been reported around the world, mostly in
Britain, but also in France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Canada and the
United States. [Most if not all of the cases found outside of Europe
had resided for periods in the UK and are believed to have contracted
the disease at that time. - Mod.CP] The disease is fatal and
incurable. It is thought to be caused by eating food tainted with
material from cattle with BSE, a progressive neurological disorder.
The Netherlands has imposed stricter restrictions on blood donation
over concerns about the transmission of vCJD. Mad cow disease first
emerged in Britain in the 1980s and forced the destruction of
millions of cattle. The Netherlands is one of the world's biggest
exporters of meat and dairy products and its livestock sector has
undergone major intensification in the past few years, with most
animals raised on specialised farms.
The country has suffered a series of animal disease crises in the
past decade, including swine fever, foot-and-mouth and avian
influenza, leading to the culling of millions of animals.

The Dutch health ministry reported a 2nd case of a patient who
suffers from the human form of mad cow disease. In April 2005 the
ministry announced the country's 1st case of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), as the human form is known. The 1st
patient died in May 2005. On Thursday 22 Jun 2006 the Health Ministry
gave no details of the new case, other than to say that the usually
fatal disease was probably contracted by eating infected beef some
time in the past.
vCJD is a human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
dubbed mad cow disease, caused by a rogue prion protein that
proliferates in the brain, turning it spongy. It is believed to have
leapt the species barrier to humans who ate beef from infected
cattle. The epicentre of the outbreak of BSE in the 1980s was
Britain, which exported cattle and beef products to many countries
within the European Union and further afield. The source was not
curbed until 1996 with tough EU-wide laws on animal feed, slaughter
of suspect animals and bans on the sale of animal parts most likely
to have the prions.

[To date, there have been 191 definite or probable clinical cases of
vCJD reported worldwide: 161 in the United Kingdom (UK), a further 25
from other European countries and 5 cases outside Europe. All of
those tested have been methionine homozygous (MM) at codon 129 in the
PRNP gene, which is found in approximately 40 percent of the UK
population. There has also been one previous case of iatrogenic
infection (via a blood transfusion) reported in a patient who was
methionine/valine (M/V) heterozygous at PRNP codon 129. - Mod.CP]
