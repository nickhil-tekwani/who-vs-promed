Coxiella burnetii in ticks, Argentina
------------------------------

The Gammaproteobacterium _Coxiella burnetii_ is the causative agent of acute Q fever and chronic endocarditis in humans worldwide. It is transmitted primarily by aerosol route or by ingestion of fomites from infected animals, mostly from domestic ruminants. Although over 40 tick species can be infected with _C. burnetii_, direct transmission of this agent to humans from infected ticks has never been properly documented. However, ticks may play a critical role in the transmission of _C. burnetii_ among wild vertebrates. Only a few studies, mostly related to human clinical cases or sero-epidemiologic evaluation of healthy animals, have reported _C. burnetii_ in South America. However, to our knowledge, _C. burnetii_ has never been reported in ticks in the continent.

During ecologic studies on _Amblyomma parvum_ and _A. tigrinum_ ticks in Cordoba Province, Argentina, engorged nymphs were collected from the common yellow toothed cavy (the rodent _Galea musteloides_) (92 _A. tigrinum_, 13 _A. parvum_). In the laboratory, engorged nymphs molted to adults, which were individually submitted to the hemolymph test with Gimenez staining for detection of rickettsiae-like organisms. By the hemolymph test, one _A. tigrinum_ female, and 2 _A. parvum_ male ticks were found to contain red-stained rickettsiae-like structures. These 3 ticks were processed individually by the shell vial technique, with the purpose of isolating intracellular bacteria in Vero cell culture. DNA from the infected cells of each of the 3 isolates was extracted and processed by PCR protocols selective for portions of 3 genes of the genus _Coxiella_. We sequenced the PCR products, finding that they were 99.9 percent (99.6 percent (556/558 nt) and 99.6 percent identical to the corresponding GenBank sequences of the North American _C. burnetii_ genes 16S rRNA, cap, and pyrG, respectively.

Ticks negative for rickettsiae-like organisms by hemolymph testing were subjected individually to DNA extraction, and 40 _A. tigrinum_ ticks yielded amplicons of the expected size for the pyrG gene. DNA sequences generated from these ticks were identical to the pyrG partial sequences obtained from the _C. burnetii_ isolates mentioned above.

[The initial description of Q fever as an illness was among abattoir workers in Australia. The main route of infection is the inhalation of _C. burnetii_. This desiccation-resistant obligate intracellular bacterium is shed from infected animals, usually cattle, sheep, goats or cats, especially at the time of parturition. Air samples are positive for weeks following parturition, and viable organisms are present in the soil for periods of up to 150 days.

Wild animals may be very important in the epidemiology of Q fever. Doves are thought to be responsible for introducing _C. burnetii_ to Northern Ireland. A wide variety of fish, rodents and marsupials have been shown to be infected by _C. burnetii_. Ticks are probably of great importance in maintaining the cycle of _C. burnetii_ in nature. The pathogen multiplies in the cells of the midgut of the tick and is excreted in the feces of the tick during feeding. - Mod.PMB
