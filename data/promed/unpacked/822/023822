Koi herpesvirus disease, Austria
-------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 6 Nov 2015 from Mr Dr Ulrich Herzog, Chief Veterinary Officer, Verbrauchergesundheit, Bundesministerium fur Gesundheit , VIENNE, Austria

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 22 Sep 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 22 Oct 2015
Date event resolved: 22 Oct 2015
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: CyHV-3
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Weiz, Weiz, Steiermark
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 Sep 2015
Outbreak status: resolved 22 Oct 2015
Epidemiological unit: Pond
Water type: Fresh water
Population type: Farmed
Production system: Semi-closed
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Koi Carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) (kg) / 5 (scale 0 to 5) / 5 (scale 0 to 5) / 400 / 400 / 340 / 60 / 0
Affected population: Closed hobby carp pond with purchase of 24 koi carps in March 2015.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Koi Carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) (kg) / 100 percent / 85 percent / 85 percent / 100 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals.
Epidemiological comments: Cell culture negative. Note by the OIE World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department: Since this is the 1st time that koi herpesvirus disease is identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact limited to a zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country; disinfection/disinfestations; traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; zoning

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2015, chapter 2.3.6 "Koi Herpesvirus Disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a herpesvirus infection capable of inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp.

The aetiological agent is koi herpesvirus (KHV) in the family although prior to taxonomic classification, it was also known as carp interstitial nephritis and gill necrosis virus (CNGV) provided evidence to support the classification of the virus as a herpesvirus, and named it cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), following the nomenclature of other cyprinid herpesviruses: CyHV-1 (carp pox virus, fish papilloma virus) and CyHV-2 (goldfish haematopoietic necrosis virus). Sequence analysis of part of the genome has shown that KHV is closely related to CyHV-1 and CyHV-2, and distantly related to channel catfish virus (_Ictalurid herpesvirus_: IcHV-1) and Ranid (frog) herpesvirus (RaHV-1).

Recently, CyHV-3 was designated the type species of the new Cyprinivirus genus within the Alloherpesviridae family, that also contains CyHV-1 and CyHV-2.

Comparisons of the genomes of KHV isolates from different geographical areas by restriction enzyme analysis or nucleotide sequence analysis have shown them to be practically identical. Likewise, the polypeptides of KHV isolates from different geographical areas were similar, although 1 isolate from Israel had 2 additional polypeptides. Aoki et al. (2007) compared the complete genome sequences of 3 KHV strains isolated from Japan, Israel and the United States of America (USA). The genomes were found to be highly similar to each other at the sequence level (over 99 percent), with the Israel and USA strains more closely related to each other than either is to the Japan strain. The 3 isolates were interpreted as having arisen as 2 lineages (J and U/I) from a wild-type parent. However, further studies in Japan suggest that the lineages were independently brought to those regions and caused KHV epidemics. A more recent study in France has identified a 3rd intermediate between the J and U/I lineages and suggested that the 3 lineages of CyHV-3 have been introduced into Europe since 2001 via imported koi carp."

Signs of disease
----------------
Animals with disease may show 1 or more of the signs below, but the pathogen may still be present in the absence of any signs.

Disease signs at the farm, tank or pond level are:
- mass mortalities, with many dead and moribund fish floating at the surface
- disorientation and erratic swimming behavior (sometimes hyperactivity)
- fish coming to the surface and gasping
- fish separated from the shoal.

Gross pathological signs are:
- pale patches on the skin
- overproduction or underproduction of mucous on the skin and gills
- superficial branchial (gill) and skin haemorrhages
- enophthalmia (sunken eyes), erosion of the fins (occasionally), and blistering of the skin
- severe gill necrosis and/or erosion, seen as red and white patches
- focal or generalised loss of skin
- adhesions in the abdominal cavity and abnormal colouration of internal organs (lighter/darker or mottled)
- enlargement and surface haemorrhages of the kidney and liver.

Microscopic pathological signs are:
- inflammation and necrosis of gill tissues, and adhesion of gill filaments
- nuclear swelling, margination of chromatin and pale eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions of the epithelium
- non-specific inflammation and necrosis in other organs.

Koi herpesvirus has no implications for human health. - Mod.CRD
