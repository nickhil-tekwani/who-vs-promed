Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF): clinical cases have been reported from dairy farms in the southern coast region [Hadarom region]; PCR confirmations in [9 named dairy farms/locations]. In a considerable number of the affected holdings, cow mortality has been reported. Clinical signs included mobility difficulties, recumbency, dyspnea and high fever. In several cases, subdermal emphysema has been reported.

[Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF; "3-day sickness") is an insect-transmitted, noncontagious, viral disease of cattle and water buffalo that is seen in Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. The BEF virus (BEFV) is classified as a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family Rhabdoviridae. Signs, which occur suddenly and vary in severity, can include biphasic to polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous nasal discharge, drooling, increased heart rate, tachypnea or dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression, stiffness and lameness, as well as a sudden decrease in milk yield. Affected cattle may become recumbent and paralyzed from 8 hours to more than one week. Morbidity may be high, and the mortality rate low. BEF causes considerable economical losses in the dairy and beef cattle industries.

In Israel, the disease has been reported in previous years from dairy and beef cattle farms in various parts of the country; it is characterized by seasonal patterns related to vector activity. Recent BEF epizootics took place in 2014 and 2018.

Preventive vaccinations against BEF are voluntary in Israel, applied in certain dairy operations in vulnerable regions. This Australia-sourced vaccine is a 2-part vaccine, with freeze-dried and liquid components that must be mixed prior to administration. Two injections of the vaccine, 2 weeks to 6 months apart, under the skin of the neck, are necessary for long-lasting protection. Annual boosters are recommended.

According to the manufacturer, "great care must be taken with this vaccine if the full benefit is to be obtained. Use all reconstituted product immediately". The said BEF vaccine must be stored between 2 and 8 deg C (refrigerate, do not freeze, and protect from light).

BEF may be currently circulating in other Middle Eastern countries sharing the same eastern Mediterranean ecosystem. When infection occurs in tandem with other (seasonal) bovine diseases, such as lumpy skin disease and bluetongue, this could lead to aggravated disease signs in the affected animals.

BEF is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
