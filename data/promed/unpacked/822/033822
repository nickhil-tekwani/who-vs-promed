"Apart from the unusual increase of cancer cases among the people in Wadi Halfa [Northern State, Sudan], fish are dying, and birds drop
dead from the sky," a resident from Wadi Halfa told Radio Dabanga. A resident said the government was allowing gold exploration. "It
allowed its gold exploration companies to use cyanide."

"Cyanide spreads through the air, and can reach places over a distance of 150 km [about 93 miles]. [But see comment below]. This has caused the large increase of cancer cases, and the pollution of the water and the air, with the result that large numbers of dead fishes are now floating on the Nile, and birds are dropping dead."

The Sudanese government planned to transform the Nile, the only stretch of fertile land north of Khartoum, into a string of 5 reservoirs. The Merowe dam, built by Chinese, German and French companies on the Nile's 4th cataract, was completed in 2009. It doubled Sudan's electricity generation, but displaced more than 50 000 people from the Nile valley to arid desert locations. Thousands of people who refused to leave their homes were flushed out by the reservoir, and protests were violently suppressed.

"Next in line are the Kajbar and Dal dams," Peter Bosshard, the policy director of International Rivers wrote in 2011. The Kajbar dam on the Nile's 3rd cataract would create a reservoir of 110 square kilometers [about 42 square miles], and generate 360 megawatts of electricity. The project would displace more than 10 000 people and submerge an estimated 500 archeological sites. The Dal Dam on the 2nd cataract is planned to have a capacity of 340-450 megawatts. It would displace 5000 to 10 000 people.

[[Cyanide is a naturally occurring chemical that is found in low
concentrations throughout nature including in fruits, nuts, plants,
and insects. It has been used by the mining industry to separate gold
and silver particles from ore for over 120 years. With proper
management, cyanide can be used safely and without harming the
environment, despite its toxicity.

Cyanide is also a useful industrial chemical; over one million tonnes
of it are used annually in electroplating, metal processing, the
production of organic chemicals and plastics, and in photographic
applications [2]. The mining industry uses less than 20 percent of the
global production of industrial cyanide [2, 4].

Cyanide, in the form of a very dilute sodium cyanide solution, is used
to dissolve and separate gold from ore [3]. Cyanide leaching is
considered to be a much safer alternative to extraction with liquid
mercury, which was previously the main method of removing gold from
ore [5]. Cyanide leaching has been the dominant gold extraction
technology since the 1970s, although small-scale and artisanal miners
continue to use mercury in some areas of the world [3]. In Canada,
more than 90 percent of mined gold is extracted from ore using cyanide
[3].

The concentration of cyanide used in this process is normally in the
range of 0.01 percent and 0.05 percent sodium cyanide (100 to 500
parts per million) [2]. As part of their best practices, mines use as
little cyanide as possible for safety, environmental, and economic
reasons [2]. Cyanide leaching is usually done along with a physical
process like milling, crushing, or gravity separation. The pH of the
resulting slurry is raised by adding lime or another alkali to ensure
that cyanide ions do not change into toxic cyanide gas (HCN) [6]. The
gold is then further concentrated and reduced, before being smelted
into gold bullion.

Cyanide is toxic in large doses and is strictly regulated in most
jurisdictions worldwide to protect people, animals, and the aquatic
environment. Cyanide prevents the body from taking up oxygen,
resulting in suffocation, which may be fatal to humans and animals
without prompt 1st aid treatment [7]. However, people and animals can
rapidly detoxify non-lethal amounts of cyanide without negative
effects, and repeated small doses can be tolerated by many species
[3]. Some long-term health effects including goiter and depressed
thyroid function have been observed in people who have a diet high in
cyanide-containing plants such as cassava, and [8].

In fact, "[d]espite its high human toxicity, there have been no
documented accidental human deaths due to cyanide poisoning in the
Australian and North American mining industries over the past 100
years. which indicates that the hazard of cyanide to humans has been
controlled by minimizing the risk of its handling and of industrial
exposure" [6, p. 4]. Even in areas where cyanide is used extensively
by artisanal miners with limited waste containment and safety
practices, "human fatalities are relatively minimal particularly when
compared with [those due to] mercury or other hazards" [9, pp.
109-110].

In high concentrations, cyanide is toxic to aquatic life, especially
fish, which are 1000 times more sensitive to cyanide than humans [10].
Because the greatest environmental threat from cyanide to aquatic life
is from intentional or unintentional discharges into surface waters,
water monitoring and water management on mine sites is very important
[11]. Regulations frequently limit the amount of cyanide which may be
discharged into the environment, and there are a number of water
treatment technologies available to remove cyanide from mine water
[2].

Birds and other wildlife are also potentially at risk from cyanide
poisoning if they are using tailings ponds for drinking or swimming
[12]. [Tailing ponds are areas where tailings (leftover waterborne
rock) is pumped into a pond to allow the settling out of solid
particles from the water. - Wikipedia]. In order to prevent wildlife
fatalities, cyanide levels in tailings ponds can be reduced to safe
levels by minimizing the amount of cyanide used, removing cyanide in
waste streams and recycling it, and by using chemical or biological
reactions to convert the cyanide into less toxic chemicals [13]. A
standard of 50 mg/L weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide is widely
accepted to be a safe level for water accessible to wildlife, and has
essentially eliminated the number of migratory bird deaths from this
cause [6, 11]. Only a few hundred birds are killed by cyanide each
year [11]. Deterrents like fencing, polyethylene balls, and netting
are also used to keep birds out of water bodies on mine sites [3].

Cyanides do not cause cancer, and do not build up in the food chain
[12]. They do not persist in the environment, and are quickly broken
down into less toxic chemicals by sunlight and air. So if birds are
falling from the sky and fish are dying, the concentration of cyanide
must be very high. However, it is unlikely to travel the distances
mentioned in this article, as it would dissipate in the air. If it did
travel that far, there would be scores of dead people. So while this
article discusses hydro-power plants, dead animals, sick people and
gold mining, it seems like a thorough epidemiological investigation is
needed into why the people are ill and there are dead birds and fish.
It may likely not be cyanide but some other chemical or metal.
