Poliovirus vaccine link to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease dismissed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists investigating a possible link between a poliovirus vaccine
and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD
(new var.) in ProMED-mail say they have found no evidence to connect
them. A brand of oral poliovirus vaccine made from foetal calf serum
was withdrawn last year [2000 after fears that it could be
contaminated with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent.
The Department of Health said that of 5 people who had developed vCJD
in the Southampton area in 1994, 2 had been given vaccine made from
UK-sourced bovine calf serum. But a meeting of the independent
Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) later found no
evidence that the vaccine carried a risk of vCJD. Wellcome produced
around 30 million doses of the vaccine between the late 1980s and
October [2000. It was then withdrawn after the Department of Health
learned that the manufacturer's assurances over the foetal calf serum
were inaccurate.
SEAC also stressed that any historical theoretical risk had to be
balanced against the "overwhelming benefits" of the immunisation
programme. Many scientists believe that humans can contract vCJD after
eating contaminated products from cows with BSE. Current vaccines use
bovine material sourced in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, or Canada.
There were 113 cases of definite or probable vCJD in the UK between
1996, when doctors distinguished it as a new form of the rare
brain-wasting disease CJD, and 3 Dec 2001. At that date 10 patients
were still alive. The National CJD Surveillance Unit looks for common
factors, including medical and personal history, in all vCJD cases.
The Department of Health said in a statement: "Finding common factors
does not mean that a cause has been identified - but we report such
findings to SEAC so that any implications can be assessed."
