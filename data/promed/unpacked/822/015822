Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda - WHO Update
---------------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 7 Dec 3007, the number of suspected cases of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever in the Bundibugyo District of western Uganda has
now risen to 93, including 22 fatalities. Laboratory analysis has
confirmed the presence of a new species [see comment below] of the
virus in 9 of these cases. A total of 4 health care workers are among
the fatalities. A total of 5 sub-counties of Bundibugyo District are
affected with a total population of approximately 250 000.

So far, a total of 327 contacts have been identified. Tracing and
follow-up of these contacts is being performed with the involvement
of Village Health Teams and Community Medicine Distributors.
Specimens from suspected cases are being collected and referred for
confirmation as part of intensive surveillance activities. Laboratory
experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta, are providing support to the Uganda Virus Research Institute
in diagnosis and analysis of samples.

Isolation wards have been established at hospitals in Kikyo and
Bundibugyo, and training provided for health care workers and
auxiliary staff in appropriate triage and infection control measures.
Teams are being trained in safe burial practices. Additional peer and
social support is being offered to staff at the 2 hospitals. Agencies
in the field, including UNICEF, Medecins Sans Frontieres and WHO, are
providing support to the health authorities with logistics and
provision of drugs and Personal Protection Equipment. The Ministry of
Health and IFRC are conducting intensive social mobilization
activities, including the use of radio broadcasts and mobile film
vans to reach at-risk communities. Fact sheets, brochures and posters
are also being distributed.

Ecological studies into the new species of Ebola [virus] that has
been detected in this outbreak are also being planned.
WHO advises that there is no indication for restrictions on travel or
trade with Uganda.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[The numbers of confirmed cases and fatalities are similar to those
reported in the previous report from Uganda dated Thu 6 Dec 2007.

The ranking of this new Ebola virus as a new virus species (rather
than as a new strain or new subtype) is premature. A decision on the
taxonomic status of the Ebola virus responsible for the current
outbreak in Uganda must await further characterization and
determination of the complete genome sequence.
