"A Transplant Breakthrough...With One Big Catch" Business Week (04/07/97) P.
137; Baker, Stephen: Genetically engineered pigs, designed with human genes
to make their organs more acceptable to the human immune system, are being
hailed by some as a solution to the critical shortage of transplant organs.
Pig organs could help save 200,000 Americans a year, says transplant expert
John J. Fung, of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
A potential obstacle to the use of pig organs was recently discovered,
however, when researchers at London's Institute of Cancer Research found
that a pig virus could infect human cells, suggesting that the use of pig
organs in humans could result in a new human viral epidemic. "From an
infectious disease standpoint, transplanting animal organs is a really bad
idea," claims Jonathan S. Allan of the Southwest Foundation for
BiomedicalResearch. While the British government placed a moratorium on
animal-to-human transplants in January, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved the practice, under strict regulations to
guarantee safety. Transplant recipients are especially vulnerable to
cross-infection, because they are given immune-suppressing drugs to prevent
organ rejection.
Researchers, meanwhile, are also investigating ways to transplant live
animal tissues and cells to treat diseases like Parkinson's disease, AIDS,
and diabetes.
