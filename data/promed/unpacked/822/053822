Officials confirm rabies throughout Sullivan County, urge owners to
keep animals vaccinated
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Officials with the Sullivan County Regional Health Department are
asking all pet owners to make sure their pets are current on rabies
vaccinations after a raccoon recovered in the Bluff City area tested
positive for rabies.

"There have now been confirmed cases of animal rabies throughout
Sullivan County," Dr. Stephen May, regional medical director for the
Sullivan County Regional Health Department, said. "These cases
highlight the importance of making sure your pets are current on
their rabies vaccinations."

Health department officials said 2 adult dogs and 3 puppies were
exposed to the rabid raccoon at a residence in Bluff City. None of
dogs were current on their rabies vaccination. Health department
officials have recommended that all 5 dogs be euthanized in
accordance with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines.

They said the only other option for non-vaccinated pets bitten by or
exposed to a rabid animal is to be placed in strict isolation for 6
months. This is done for protection for the animals as well as their
owners and others with whom they may come in contact.

Tennessee law requires that all dogs and cats be vaccinated against
rabies and their shots be kept up to date.

Rabies is a viral disease of mammals that affects the central nervous
system and if left untreated, ultimately results in death.

According to the CDC, more than 90 percent of rabies cases occur in
wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats. Domestic animals
account for less than 10 percent of rabies cases. Most often reported
domestic rabies cases include cats, dogs, and cattle.

Mercer County records 1st rabies cases of 2008
----------------------------------------------
Possible exposure to a person and pets is part of Mercer County's
first 2 positive rabies cases for 2008.

"The Mercer County Health Department wants to advise the citizens of
Mercer County that 2 raccoons tested positive for rabies on 5 Mar
2008," said Doris Irwin, RN BSW. "These are the 1st and 2nd specimens
to test positive for rabies in 2008. These cases occurred in the
Athens-Lerona area; however in the last few years Mercer County had
positive cases throughout the whole county."

In the 1st situation, a resident used a shovel to kill a raccoon
after it tried to attack his dog, Irwin said. A dead raccoon was
found near some pets in the 2nd case.

Both cases had a "definitely high potential" for exposure to rabies,
so the health department recommended visits to both physicians and
veterinarians, Irwin said.

A total of 54 rabies cases have been identified in Mercer County
since 1997. In 2007 there were 14 identified cases and 18 pets known
to have been bitten by rabid raccoons, she said.

In West Virginia the primary rabies host animal has been the raccoon,
but rabies has also appeared in dogs, cats, skunks, foxes, coyotes
and wolves. Bats are a host animal, too, Irwin said. Cattle and
horses occasionally contract the disease from a bite or scratch from
another infected animal. The virus is spread through saliva.

Infected animals often display a change in temperament, Irwin said.
Friendly animals may become aggressive and wild animals may appear
friendly. Other signs include drooling or the appearance of choking,
tremors, lack of coordination, loss of balance, staggering or erratic
behavior and finally paralysis or respiratory failure.

Irwin said residents were advised to make sure their pets' rabies
vaccinations were up-to-date. In West Virginia only a licensed
veterinarian can give the rabies vaccination. Rabies shots are
required every 2 years under state law.

"Check with your veterinarian if you are unsure if your pet is
up-to-date," she said.

People are also advised to avoid stray dogs and cats. Raccoons,
skunks, bats and other wild animals should not be approached, either.

Irwin had tips to keep rabid animals away from homes.

"Do not leave pet food outside unattended. A number of pet exposures
have occurred at pet feeding areas. If you have a pet door into your
home consider securing it so other animals may not enter," she said.

All food garbage should be secured in vermin proof trash cans and
containers. Many of the rabies exposures have occurred near unsecured
garbage cans and dumpsters.

"If you are bitten by a domestic pet or wild animal, immediately wash
the wound with warm soapy water. Consult your family physician or
health care provider. Contact the Mercer County Health Department to
report the bite so your risk of infection can be assessed. Rabies is
almost 100 percent preventable if treatment is received before
symptoms occur," Irwin said.

If a pet or livestock is bitten or scratched by a wild or stray
animal, call the health department to report the incident and check
with a veterinarian to see that the animal is up-to-date on its
rabies vaccination.

[It is always a good idea have current rabies vaccinations for your
pets and livestock, especially if you or your children are involved
in showing the cattle. And always vaccinate the horses. Rabies
vaccination as prevention from this disease is a very cheap
insurance, especially when you compare it to the worth of your life
or that of a loved one.

Every state has their own rabies law regarding the type of
vaccination used and how often. So please visit your veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
