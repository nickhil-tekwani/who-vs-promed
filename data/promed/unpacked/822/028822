In Romania, 2 people have died of the West Nile virus [and] 5 others
have been infected with the virus, announced Cseke Attila, Romania's
Health Minister. The West Nile fever has already caused 4 deaths in
Greece and 6 in Russia. The Romanian fatalities occurred in the
capital, Bucharest, and in the Black Sea city of Constanta. The other
cases of inspections were discovered in the eastern and southern
parts of the country.

The Romanian Health Minister urged the population to avoid contact
with insects as the West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes.

[West Nile virus infections in humans continue to pop up in central
Europe this summer. Romania has had sporadic outbreaks in the past,
as recently as 2 years ago (2008, see ProMED-mail archive number
20080926.3042). In that report, a serological survey of horses done
in 2007 indicated that about half of a small number of animals
sampled had IgG antibody. There was no mention made of clinical cases
in equine animals. There was a major outbreak in 1996, with 352 human
cases reported (see ProMED-mail archive number 20010731.1499). The
vector for West Nile virus present in Romania is _Culex_ spp. (_Cx.
molestus / pipiens_), which is active from May to October each year.
