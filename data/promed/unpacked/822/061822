Re: Peridomestic Birds as Reservoirs of West Nile Virus
-------------------------------------------------------
In response to Dr. Steve Kells' inquiry about the role of peridomestic birds
as reservoirs for West Nile virus (WNV), I believe that numerous groups are
looking at the potential role of these birds as free-ranging sentinels and
as potential reservoirs. Very little has been published in the peer-reviewed
literature, but I will draw your attention to some publications from our
research group on this issue.
In 1999, we evaluated the exposure of WNV to house sparrows (_Passer
domesticus_) and Rock Doves (_Columba livia_, domestic pigeons) in the
epizootic zone of Queens, New York City. There we determined that both
species were exposed to a high degree (sparrows 60%, pigeons 26%), and
should be useful as free-ranging sentinels (ref #1). A similar serologic
evaluation of peridomestic birds was undertaken in Staten Island, New York
City, after epizootic activity there in 2000 (ref #2). That study determined
that 55% of pigeons, 9% of house sparrows, 69% of cardinals (_Cardinalis
cardinalis_) and 40% of house finches (_Carpodacus mexicanus_) were exposed.
Although small numbers of European starlings (_Sturnus vulgaris_) were
sampled in both studies, none were seropositive (total combined sample size:
9).
To determine whether these exposed peridomestic birds are in fact important
as vertebrate reservoir hosts (amplifying hosts), we need competence data
based on viremias, which would indicate if they are indeed infectious to
mosquitoes. Viremia profiles have been derived for all of these birds
(except the cardinals) along with derivations of competence index values
(ref #3). These data indicate that pigeons are not important reservoir
hosts, starlings are probably not important as well, but the other passerine
species (house sparrows and house finches), may be very important in some
locations.
Investigations within each focus of transmission (to determine abundance of
birds, infection rates, and other data) will be needed to determine the
relative importance of different peridomestic bird species in the WNV
transmission cycle. The potential role of communal bird roosts as
transmission foci is an attractive concept that needs hard data to support.
