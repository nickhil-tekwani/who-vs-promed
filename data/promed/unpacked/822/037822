AP Worldstream has reported an unusual surge of liver abscesses in Georgia,
most cases in Tbilisi. In a span of 15 days, 63 cases were diagnosed,
leading Georgian health officials to suspect bacterial involvement. While
liver abscesses usually result as a complication of other health problems,
these cases appear to have a different etiology, and people in the Georgian
republic have been urged to drink only bottled or boiled water. Treatment
consists of surgery. There have been 26 such operations, and the
government is offering to pay surgical expenses in order to get people to
come forward for medical assistance.
