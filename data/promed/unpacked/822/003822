The incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a skin infection transmitted by bites from a species of fly (sandfly), in the western region has been growing steadily for several years, notes a bulletin from the Oran Regional Health Observatory (ORS). The recently published document, which traces the evolution of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the western region, indicates that the incidence of this disease has risen from 0.6 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2014, to 2.8 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2019.

The number of cases in the 10 wilayas [provinces] of the western region rose from 46 in 2014 to 251 in 2019. The document adds that the wilaya of Saïda is the most affected by cutaneous leishmaniasis. The incidence in the wilaya of Saïda is estimated at 26.5/100 000 inhabitants, followed by Tiaret with 10.5/100 000, Sidi Bel-Abbes with 1.7/100 000, and Tissemsilt with 1.3/100 000. The other wilayas record less than 0.4/100 000.

The ORS bulletin indicates that the under 14 age group is most affected by this infection, with a ratio in favor of males.

Cases of visceral leishmaniasis (a more severe form than cutaneous leishmaniasis) remain rare, it was noted; no cases were recorded in the Western region during 2019.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a serious public health problem in Algeria, which is the second largest focus in the world after Afghanistan. Three outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis occurred in 2004-2006, with respectively 17 100, 32 200, and 15 000 cases.
