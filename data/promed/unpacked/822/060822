California: Norovirus outbreak affects 772 people in healthcare
facilities in Sonoma County
-----------------------------------------------
The number of [cases of] norovirus [infection], which causes flu-like
symptoms, has risen to 772, according to the Sonoma County Public
Health Department. Since the outbreak began in mid-March 2006, 16
care facilities have reported patients with symptoms of norovirus
infection, but the county has refused to name them until 48 hours
pass without a new case being reported, when the outbreak will be
considered over.
"The number in the past week was 26 cases. It has gotten down to a
steady level, which may be the normal background level, and we are
just watching it more carefully," said Dr. Leigh Hall, deputy public
health officer. Hall also cautions that the number of cases may be
inflated because patients are not being tested and are being counted
if they display any of the symptoms.
Facilities are required to report an outbreak of any diarrhea-related
infection. He said that 2 long-term care facilities on Thursday [29
Jun 2006] each reported 3 possible new cases of the virus. Elderly
patients at long-term care facilities are particularly susceptible to
[norovirus] infection because it spreads rapidly in close living
quarters.

[Somona County is located in a coastal region of northern California; see
<<http://www4.hmc.edu:8001/humanities/indian/california/countymap.gif>http://www4.hmc.edu:8001/humanities/indian/california/countymap.gif>.
This is an unusually widely dispersed outbreak of viral
gastroenteritis affecting at least 16 health-care facilities in a
single county in California. The diagnosis of norovirus infection
appears to be based on symptoms alone, and to what extent the
individual care-home outbreaks are linked is unclear. The use of the
term "flu-like" (febrile?) is inappropriate in relation to norovirus
gastroenteritis. In recent weeks (see below), outbreaks of presumed
norovirus infection have also affected several prisons elsewhere in
California, illustrating the vulnerability of any form of closed
community to outbreaks of sudden-onset viral gastroenteritis. -

[2] Norovirus outbreaks in 22 hospitals - China (Hong Kong)

Viral Gastroenteritis outbreaks affect 22 public hospitals
-----------------------------------------------
An abnormally high number of people and staff in 22 public hospitals
have come down with stomach flu, or gastroenteritis, since May 2006,
the Department of Health said on Mon 3 Jul 2006, adding it is still
investigating the source of the infection. "The bug [norovirus] is
usually prevalent in winter or early spring, but it appears to have
mutated to a more adaptable form and is still active in summer," said
Raymond Yung Wai-hung, head of the Centre for Health Protection's
Infection Control Branch. He said the norovirus is highly contagious,
causes vomiting and diarrhea and appears to have mainly occurred in
hospitals and homes for the elderly, with more than 800 cases since
May 2006.
However, it is rare for those who have been infected to become
seriously ill. The source of infection remains unknown, Yung said.
"In the past, the bug mainly appeared in contaminated seafood such as
oysters. But we haven't come across any collective food poisoning in
the community," he said. "We suppose it may have started as a mild
case, which was not noticeable and which then became the source of
infection and was transmitted to others." Yung said the norovirus
could be transmitted via food or water or contact with patients.
Hospital Authority Central Committee on Infectious Disease chairman
Liu Shao-haei said the outbreak in most of the hospitals was under
control, except for 5 public hospitals.
Liu sidestepped the question of whether beds in these hospitals were
in short supply, saying the private and public sectors will work
closely. Liu said the symptoms were not clear at the onset, and
consequently many patients were not isolated. But he stressed the
authority was monitoring the situation closely and that the alert
level had been increased. Yung added: "Proper management and adequate
disinfection of vomit and feces is of crucial importance in
preventing and controlling the spread of the disease."
According to the Department of Health, 50 confirmed norovirus
outbreaks in homes for the elderly and 22 in public hospitals
affecting 699 and 165 people, respectively, have been reported since
May 2006, compared with 19 and 7 outbreaks in elderly homes and
hospitals, respectively, and 295 people in the 1st 4 months of this
year [2006].
A total of 99 noroviral infection outbreaks in institutions,
including child care centers and schools, involving 1301 people, have
been reported in the 1st 6 months of this year [2006]. Last year
[2005], there were 42 norovirus outbreaks in institutions, affecting
643 people. Asked when he expected the infection to subside, Yung
said: "I cannot predict when, but we'll try our best to contain the
virus."

[No evidence is presented to substantiate the statement that the
norovirus responsible for these outbreaks has undergone mutational
change. However, the UK Health Protection Agency has reported recently
that a new variant of the previously prevalent genotype II.4
norovirus is spreading in the UK (see Viral gastroenteritis update
2006 (02) 20060626.1776). - Mod.CP]
