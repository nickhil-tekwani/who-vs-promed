Protecting the United Kingdom Blood Supply from Variant CJD: Donors
Who Have Received a Blood Transfusion Can No Longer Donate Blood
-------------------------------------------------
On Tue 16 Mar 2004, the Department of Health in England announced
that people who have received a blood transfusion in the United
Kingdom (UK) since 1 Jan 1980 will no longer be able to donate blood
(1,2). This additional donor selection criterion will be implemented
by all four of the UK Blood Services (UKBS), including the National
Blood Service on 5 Apr 2004.
(<http://www.blood.co.uk/>)
This additional precautionary measure to safeguard the blood supply
is being taken in the light of the 1st possible transmission of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var,) or
vCJD in ProMED-mail] by blood transfusion, which was reported in
December 2003 (3).
The transfusion occurred in 1996; the blood donor was well at the
time but developed symptoms of vCJD in 1999 and died the following
year. The recipient was diagnosed with vCJD in 2003.
Since 1997, in view of the uncertainty as to whether vCJD could be
transmitted by blood or blood products, the UKBS have put in place a
number of other measures to reduce the risk of a potential onward
cycle of transmission:
(1) Withdrawal and recall of any blood components, plasma
derivatives, or tissues obtained from any individual who later
develops vCJD (December 1997);
(2) Importation of plasma from the US for fractionation to
manufacture plasma derivatives (announced May 1998, implemented
October 1999);
(3) Leucodepletion (removal of white blood cells) of all blood
components (announced July 1998, implemented Autumn 1999);
(4) Importation of fresh frozen plasma from the United States for
patients born on or after 1 Jan 1996 (announced August 2002, to be
implemented spring 2004);
(5) Promotion of appropriate use of blood and tissues and
alternatives throughout the National Health Service (NHS).
This is a highly precautionary approach, and the benefit of receiving
a blood transfusion when needed far outweighs any possible risk of
contracting vCJD. To date there has been only one possible case of
vCJD being transmitted by blood, yet the UKBS issue over 2.5 million
units of blood every year.
As of 1 Mar 2004 there have been 146 definite and probable cases of
vCJD in the UK, one case each in the Republic of Ireland, Italy,
United States, Canada, and Hong Kong, and 6 cases in France. The
eventual number of individuals within the UK population likely to
develop vCJD remains uncertain; estimates range from the current
numbers up to 540. It is not known how many current or past blood or
tissue donors may develop vCJD in the future. Further information and
advice to blood donors and members of the public who are concerned
about the risk of contracting vCJD from a blood transfusion are being
offered via the NHS Direct service
(<http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/>).
