High Death Toll Among Medical Staff
-----------------------------------
Dr. Matthew Lukwiya, the Medical Superintendent at Lacor Hospital and one
of the doctors who had been at the forefront of the fight against the
highly [lethal Ebola virus in Uganda, has died of the disease. In the same
hospital, 12 nurses have also died after contracting the disease, which is
characterized by high fever, muscle pain and massive hemorrhaging. Dr.
Lukwiya fell ill after treating a sick nurse who later died. There had been
reports that Dr. Lukwiya's health was improving, but his condition suddenly
worsened and he died on the morning of Tue 5 Dec 2000.
Health Minister Crispus Kiyonga is calling for [more medical volunteers to
tackle the epidemic in Gulu. In total 14 medical staff have now died. A
further 8 health workers are dangerously ill after being infected with the
[virus. On Mon 4 Dec 2000, nurses in Uganda demanded that the government
pay danger money to those working with patients suffering from the disease.
The head of the Ugandan Nurses and Midwives Council also called on the
government to provide compensation for the families of medical staff.
Ebola virus is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids. Most of
the victims have been health workers or people who have attended
traditional burials. Soon after the outbreak began, hospitals in Gulu were
provided with boxes of special clothing to try to ensure that staff had
effective protection against the disease. However, the heavy demands made
on health workers have often kept them from using the protective wear.
