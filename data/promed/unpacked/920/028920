The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has notified WHO of 2 cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.

The 1st case is a 2 year old girl from Cairo governorate. She visited the Helwan Fever Hospital as an outpatient on 30 Oct 2011 with symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI). The case was confirmed by RT-PCR at the Central Public Health Laboratory through periodic testing of samples collected from ILI outpatients from sentinel ILI surveillance sites. The epidemiological team investigated the case after confirmation of the laboratory test. Retrospective investigation through data collected from her family identified a positive history of exposure to backyard poultry. Samples from the case have been sent to the US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) for further sequencing.

The 2nd case is a 31 year old man from Fayium governorate. He developed symptoms on 1 Jan 2012, received oseltamivir on 14 Jann 2012 and is still hospitalised in the critical care unit. The case was confirmed by the Central Public Health Laboratory, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network.

Epidemiological investigations into both the cases indicated that they had exposure to backyard poultry.

Of the 159 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 55 have been fatal.

Viet Nam on Thursday [19 Jan 2012] reported its 1st human death from bird flu in nearly 2 years, as the virus also claimed the life of a toddler in Cambodia.

Concerns about avian influenza have risen in the region after China in late December [2011] reported its 1st fatality from the H5N1 virus in 18 months, but Vietnamese authorities said there was no need to be alarmed. "The bird flu situation is still within our control," said Le Minh Hung, a doctor from the Health Department of Ho Chi Minh City. "Some healthcare teams have been sent to check on the situation in southern provinces."

The Vietnamese victim, who died on 11 Jan 2012, was a duck farmer from the southern Mekong delta province of Hau Giang, and experts were investigating whether the infection came from his flock. It was Viet Nam's 1st human death from the disease since April 2010.

In neighbouring Cambodia, a 2 year old boy from north western Banteay Meanchey province, who is thought to have been exposed to sick poultry, died on 18 Jan 2012 from the virus, WHO said. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has killed more than 340 [now 342] people worldwide since 2003, according to WHO statistics.

Viet Nam has recorded one of the highest numbers of fatalities from bird flu in South East Asia, with 59 deaths since 2003, according to WHO. In Cambodia, 17 people have died of H5N1, according to the UN agency. All of Cambodia's 8 bird flu cases last year [2011] were fatal, the last of them in August 2011. Seven of the victims were children.

Winter is the season when the virus tends to boom. Since early January 2012, more than 3000 birds have been culled in Viet Nam's Mekong delta area in an effort to contain bird flu outbreaks.
