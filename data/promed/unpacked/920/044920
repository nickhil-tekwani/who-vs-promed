[ref: B Lokossou, et al. Occurrence of _Banana bunchy top virus_ in banana and plantain (_Musa_ sp.) in Benin. New Disease Reports (2012) 25, 13; DOI: 10.5197/j.2044-0588.2012.025.013]
----------------------------------------------------------------
_Banana bunchy top virus_ is one of the most serious pathogens of banana and plantain and is well established in central and southern sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2011, banana and plantain that displayed stunting and leaf symptoms typical of banana bunchy top disease were observed to be widespread in Dangbo Commune, Ouémé Department, Benin. A survey was conducted in 9 locations in Ouémé. In each location, incidence of symptom-bearing plants was estimated, and samples were collected for BBTV assessment. About 60 per cent of the 94 banana mats [cluster of plants from one root system] assessed had symptoms of BBTV.

25 leaf samples from plants with symptoms were tested for BBTV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amplicons of expected size were obtained from 23 of the 25 samples suggesting the presence of BBTV in the affected plants. Two PCR products were sequenced and showed 100 per cent nucleotide sequence identity with a BBTV isolate from Cameroon and 99-100 per cent identity with several other BBTV isolates from the GenBank database belonging to the South Pacific group, comprised of BBTV isolates from Africa, Australia, India and South Pacific. This finding confirmed that the virus isolate associated with the diseased plants in Benin was of the South Pacific type.

This constitutes the first report of BBTV in Benin. The disease is widespread in all the 4 communes surveyed. Further surveys are necessary to assess the extent of BBTV occurrence in Benin.

Until now, Cameroon was the western most frontier of BBTV presence in sub-Saharan Africa. This finding confirms spread of the disease into West Africa, and underscores an urgent need for intensive surveys in neighbouring countries and implementation of strict phytosanitary measures to prevent movement of planting material from the infected zones and to prevent further spread of BBTV.

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the only member of the genus _Babuvirus_ and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting, and death of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia, and the Pacific Islands. BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material. The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools).

Genome analysis of BBTV isolates from different regions has shown that there are 2 groups: the South Pacific group (from, for example, Australia, Burundi, Egypt, Fiji, India, Tonga, and Western Samoa) and the Asian group (from the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam). The mean sequence difference between the 2 groups has been reported as approximately 10 per cent (see link below). This is thought to suggest that the virus has spread after the initial movement of its hosts from the Indo-Malaysian region, where edible _Musa_ species originated, to Africa and the Americas.

BBTV disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material, and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting is usually impossible. Tolerant varieties can be used to enable some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs.
