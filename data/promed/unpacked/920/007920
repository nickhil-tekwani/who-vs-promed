Birds at a commercial poultry farm in Abbotsford have tested positive for avian influenza, according to the British Columbia (BC) Ministry of Agriculture and Food. Detection of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus usually requires euthanization of every bird in an affected flock.

In this case, the ministry announced in a [19 May 2022] release, the farm was put under quarantine by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and all other poultry farms within a 10-kilometre [6.2 mi] radius received notification of the outbreak.

Avian influenza has been spreading globally since late 2021, and cases in Canada this year [2022] had so far mostly affected commercial and private flocks of poultry and egg producers in Alberta and Ontario, So far, according to CFIA figures, millions of birds in Canada have either died of the virus or been culled as a result of outbreaks. Avian influenza is not a food-safety concern for humans eating cooked poultry or eggs.

The news of the latest outbreak, confirmed by the CFIA, comes after confirmed positive tests in seven small private flocks throughout the province. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, those "backyard" flocks were in Richmond, the central Kootenays region, Kelowna, and Armstrong. The Abbotsford case is the 1st farm to be affected in the Fraser Valley during this latest outbreak, the ministry said.

The BC ministry release noted that after the first confirmed case of H5N1 in BC this year [2022] -- in mid-April, at a commercial poultry producer in the Regional District of North Okanagan -- the province issued a general order requiring commercial producers (with more than 100 birds) to keep their flocks indoors. This order has been extended until [13 Jun 2022].

An order that prevents producers from travelling with birds to co-mingling events has also been lengthened, until [19 Jun 2022].

The H5N1 virus is rarely transmitted to humans, but when that does occur, there has been a mortality rate of more than 50 percent. It is highly transmissible between birds, though, including wild birds, which can transmit the virus to domestic poultry and even pet birds.

The H5N1 virus is believed to originate in wild aquatic birds -- including geese, swans, ducks, gulls, and terns, as well as shorebirds -- which are considered to act as reservoirs for avian influenza A viruses. Domestic poultry such as chickens, turkeys, and ducks can be infected by some of these viruses.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, avian influenza A viruses fall into either of 2 categories: low pathogenicity avian influenza A (LPAI) viruses or highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) viruses. LPAI viruses, typically, result in few or no signs of illness. Some avian influenza A(H5) and A(H7) viruses are considered to be HPAI A viruses; these viruses and some subtypes can spread quickly in domesticated poultry and kill 90 to 100 percent of a flock within 48 hours.

Infected birds can remain asymptomatic or become ill and die rapidly. The ministry said that positive cases of H5 influenza strains in wild birds have been recorded in or around Metro Vancouver, Chilliwack, 100 Mile House, Bowen Island, Kelowna, Vanderhoof, and Williams Lake. One of the biggest concerns of health officials regarding avian influenza is the LPAI A(H5) and A(H7) viruses' potential to mutate into HPAI viruses.

The town of New Richmond, which is part of the municipality, issued a warning to its residents on Monday [16 May 2022] asking them to report any dead or dying birds. The Quebec government has been monitoring the spread of avian flu in the province, particularly in poultry farms where the mortality rate among flocks is heightened.

In an interview with Breakaway, biologist Ariane Massé, who works for Quebec's wildlife ministry, said the discovery was not surprising. "It's normal to see wild birds with the virus, and specifically for birds like crows, they are predators and scavengers," she said. "It's possible that that bird scavenged on another dead bird that was infected with [the virus]. As a result, it's not unusual for crows to die of the virus," she said.

The crow was sent to Quebec's centre for wildlife health in Saint-Hyacinthe, about 60 kilometres [37.3 mi] east of Montreal, where researchers performed a post-mortem examination to determine the cause of death. The centre said it suspected avian flu to be the cause of death but could not confirm it until further analysis is done by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

Efforts made to prevent spread
------------------------------
Massé said aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, and seagulls are especially prone to carrying the virus. She explained that the birds spread it during their migrations. The biosecurity and wildlife health expert urged people to refrain from touching any dead or injured wild birds with their bare hands to prevent further contamination.

Instead, people should report their sighting to the wildlife ministry, which will send officers to investigate.

Some organizations that work with animals have been putting additional measures in place to protect their animals, such as the Bonaventure Bioparc.

[3] Utah: backyard flocks

The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food [UDAF] has confirmed 5 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or bird flu. Officials reported the latest case this week in Salt Lake County. It is the 2nd case of bird flu in Salt Lake County. 3 cases have been reported in Cache County, and another in Utah County.

According to the UDAF, officials found the latest case of bird flu in Utah on the west side of Salt Lake County. Officials detected the case in a flock of backyard birds. The owner reportedly told officials that their flock had access to wild waterfowl, and they contacted the Utah state veterinarian after experiencing a high death rate among the flock.

"We urge bird owners with flocks of all sizes to take extreme caution with their bird's habitats," said Utah State Veterinarian, Dr Dean Taylor. "The more potential exposure the birds may have to wild and migrating birds, the greater the risk of the flock contracting the disease."

Officials ask anybody that owns birds in Utah for continued vigilance against avian flu. Symptoms of avian flu in birds include nasal discharge, decreased appetite, decreased water consumption, lack of coordination, and high death loss among flocks. Utahns with birds or flocks experiencing these symptoms are asked to immediately contact the state veterinarian's office at statevet@utah.gov. And in general, Utahns are advised to limit contact with wild birds.

Nationally, as of [19 May 2022], the CDC reports that 35 states have reported poultry outbreaks. US officials have detected bird flu in nearly 38 million poultry since January 2022. As of [28 Apr 2022], there has been one human case of bird flu in the United States.

An avian quarantine has been put in place for part of Lane County Thursday [19 May 2022], just 2 days after state officials said bird flu had been detected in the region. On Tuesday [17 May 2022], the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife announced that multiple Canada goose goslings collected from Alton Baker Park in Eugene had tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. State officials said a case of the disease was confirmed by the USDA [US Department of Agriculture].

Oregon counties told to 'consider' wearing masks indoors amid BA.2 surge. Earlier in the month [May 2022], officials in Oregon and Washington announced they had detected bird flu in some residents' backyard flocks.

The quarantine will keep anyone from transporting any species of bird and prevent the movement of poultry in the designated area of the county. While the disease can devastate poultry trade, officials have said there is no immediate danger to the public. The area includes large portions of Eugene and encompasses both sides of I-5 north of the city, extending as far north as Harrisburg.

The Oregon Department of Agriculture [ODA] has uploaded the area to an interactive map online where residents can enter their address to see if they are included.

An outbreak of bird flu was also detected in Linn County near the I-5 and Route 34 junction. Its radius extends several miles out and is also visible on ODA's map.

ODA did not give an expiration date for the avian quarantine but said it will last long enough for state and federal officials to study the area and ensure no more HPAI cases exist.

[5] Alaska (Sitka National Park): eagle

https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/05/19/eagle-that-died-in-sitka-park-tests-positive-for-bird-flu/


An eagle that died in the Sitka National Historical Park this month [May 2022] tested positive for the avian influenza. A 2nd eagle that died in the park was also tested for the virus, and results are pending.

Also, a Sitkan reported a 3rd eagle in his yard on Lance Drive that was exhibiting symptoms of the virus, said Jennifer Cedarleaf is the avian director at the Alaska Raptor Center. "The last time I heard he was laying under a bush ... in the gentleman's yard, and I told him, 'Just leave the bird be and let me know what's happening, and I can come check it out later," Cedarleaf said.

She said a handful of bald eagles have tested positive for the virus in Alaska so far this month, including several in Dutch Harbor, two in Anchorage and one in the Mat-Su Valley. The highly pathogenic bird flu is the worst the country has seen since 2015 and has a high mortality rate for raptors.

Cedarleaf says neurologic symptoms are one indicator that a bird may be suffering. "Like holding its head strange, or having tremors or having a hard time walking, like stumbling, almost," Cedarleaf said. "Those are really good signs for avian influenza."

Once a bird has been tested, it takes a couple of weeks to get results from the samples. Dr Vicki Vosburg at Pets' Choice is collecting local samples and sending them to the Washington State University Lab through Alaska's state veterinarian.

Vosburg said it has been challenging for her office and the Raptor Center to suspend their bird rehabilitation services in response to the outbreak. "Please be understanding when we can't go out and save a bird," Vosburg said. "If there's a situation where an eagle gets hit by a car and its clearly got a broken wing, I will definitely pick up that bird. Unfortunately I won't be able to do surgery and rehabilitate it. But I will be able to euthanize it and prevent it from suffering out in the wild."

Cedarleaf said people who own chickens should keep a close eye on their coops. Those with indoor birds should be very aware. She recommends leaving shoes outside in a bucket to prevent tracking in infected bird feces.

If anyone notices a bird behaving strangely, they can call the Alaska Raptor Center's emergency line at 738-8662 for next steps.

[6] Idaho (Dominifarm Animal Sanctuary, Ada County): wild bird

Avian influenza killed more than 50 birds at Dominifarm Animal Sanctuary in Kuna after a sick goose infected the rest of the birds. "The goose looked completely alright," Dominifarm Owner Dominique Delobbe said. Dominifarm welcomed in the goose on Monday [9 May 2022]. Within 48 hours, 13 birds died from an illness. Delobbe's veterinarian contacted the Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA).

ISDA tested the remaining birds, finding avian flu -- commonly known as the bird flu -- in 5 birds. ISDA euthanized all birds on Dominifarm in response. "It hit us really hard and really quickly. Our birds got sick so fast," Dominifarm volunteer Sara Meyrovich said. "A lot of these birds were with us for years, and we were very close with them."

Bird flu is moving through Idaho, and is especially prevalent in the Treasure Valley, Idaho Fish and Game wrote in a press release. The virus has no treatment or vaccine and must run its course.

"We are aware sick and dead birds are being seen by the public in many ponds, irrigation ditches, etc., especially in the Treasure Valley, and we do not know how long this avian influenza outbreak will last," said Fish and Game's Wildlife Health Program Coordinator Stacey Dauwalter. "Infected geese, ducks, and other birds will continue to be found until the outbreak has abated."

People should leave sick birds alone and wash their hands if they touch any bird, according to Fish and Game. It is not common for people to catch the avian flu.

"We're cleaning everything out. Whether an animal was in there or not. All the straw is coming out. All the hay is coming out. We're putting all fresh hay in. Fresh blankets in," Dominifarm volunteer Gail Muzzey said.

After the outbreak, Dominifarm cannot have birds for 150 days. By their own decision, they are temporality closed to sort out their next steps. "It's traumatic. It's like when people know they have to put their dog down. It's very hard. When it's so many animals, it's a huge shock," Delobbe said.

Fish and Game encourages the public to report sick or dead wild birds in an effort to monitor the avian flu spread.

Parts of North America are still experiencing the northerly migration of wild birds. Consequently, this outbreak is still raging.

Guard your birds from other birds, and limit the foot and vehicle traffic onto your premises. Check to be sure drivers and other individuals coming onto your property have not been around other known sick birds. Disinfect tires, shoes, and change coveralls, and perhaps wear a face mask when entering a bird facility. Do not let your birds have access to wild birds. While many wild birds, especially migrating birds, may not show clinical signs, they may still be carrying the virus and able to transmit it to your birds. Keep the birds inside and away from other birds.

While it may be trite: Practice extreme caution and strict biosecurity. - Mods.TG/MHJ]
