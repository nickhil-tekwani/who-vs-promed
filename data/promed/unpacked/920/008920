Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: When we performed active surveillance program, the samples collected from 2 duck farms in Nantou County on [19 Dec 2017], were sent to the National Laboratory, Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for analysis. Low pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 subtype was confirmed by AHRI on [24 Dec 2017]. The farms have been placed under movement restriction. All animals on the infected farms were culled. Thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3 km [approx. 1.8 mi] radius of the infected farms are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses; by-products and waste; disinfection; ante and post-mortem inspections; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / gene sequencing / 24 Dec 2017 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 21 Dec 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and some wild bird species (such as wild ducks and swans).

AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity--the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic chickens.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to domestic poultry, and can spread rapidly from flock-to-flock.

Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl and shorebirds without causing illness. LPAI can occur in domestic poultry, with little or no signs of illness https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian-influenza-disease/defend-the-flock/defend-the-flock-ai-overview.

Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection, the area must be clear of organic material https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian-influenza-disease/defend-the-flock/defend-the-flock-lpai-info.

In 2017 HPAI subtype H5N6 was also reported in Taiwan. See reports 20171226.5523125, 20170213.4836200 and 20170206.4820215. - Mod.CRD
