In New Caledonia, 3 fruit bats tested positive for Nipah virus at the Noumea National Park. This is a previously unknown virus on the territory that is potentially transmissible to humans.

Earlier this week, 3 of the 14 bats at the Noumea Zoo tested positive for the Nipah virus.

"Nipah virus is an emerging virus that was recently discovered," explained Dr. Jean-Paul Grangeon, Director of Health and Social Affairs of New Caledonia (DASS).

Nipah virus was discovered in 1999 and named after the place where it was 1st identified in Malaysia. Its natural reservoir is the bat. Harmless to them, the virus has caused serious infections in other animals, including pigs. It is also potentially transmissible to humans. "Infection occurs via secretions from the bats and the pigs, so it is best to avoid direct contact with these animals," Grangeon added.

Some safety precautions need to be observed when handling fruits and meat. Make sure the bats did not nibble on fruits, and cook the meat of bats and pigs thoroughly before consumption.

"As far as we know, the risk of animal-to-human infection is very low," Grangeon said.

No human case of Nipah virus infection was reported to date in New Caledonia. "The presence of this virus was previously unknown in New Caledonia," said Almudena Lorenzo, director of the Noumea National Park. These fruit bats may have been infected for many years. According to Almudena Lorenzo, it is unlikely that they contracted the virus in the park.

The 3 bats that tested positive for the Nipah virus were killed on Wednesday [6 May 2015] morning. Additional samples were taken from the dead bats in order to get more information. The other 11 bats were placed in quarantine.

[The species of flying fox bats sampled in New Caledonia is not mentioned but probably is the insular flying fox or Pacific flying fox (_Pteropus tonganus_), which occurs on that and other Pacific islands.

The finding of Nipah virus in New Caledonia bats is a new observation. It would be of interest to know which tests were done to identify the virus, whether its genome is similar to Nipah viruses in Southeast Asia, and whether it or similar viruses occur in flying fox bats in other Pacific islands. Fortunately, no human cases of Nipah virus infection have been reported in New Caledonia or other pacific islands, in contrast to the situation in Malaysia, and especially Bangladesh, where it is a significant public health problem.

Nipah virus is related to Hendra virus, a human pathogen found in flying foxes in Australia. These 2 viruses are sufficiently different from previously described paramyxoviruses to be classified as a new genus, _Henipavirus_.

[In S.E. Asia most Nipah infections are contracted from drinking palm sap contaminated by fruit bat excreta at the collection point. There is no mention of palm sap being drunk in this island, but preparing bats for cooking is a potential hazard. It would be interesting to do a serosurvey of local pigs to see if they have been infected, since it is rather impractical to avoid contact with pigs in farms. - Mod.JW]
