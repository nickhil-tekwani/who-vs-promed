Going bananas over a deadly disease
-----------------------------------------
The banana plant, erroneously called tree, is being wiped out on
thousands of hectares by disease in Guangzhou and other areas of
Guangdong Province.
The Panama disease (or fusarium wilt) has been wreaking havoc in
Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia, for more than the past half a
decade and could devastate banana plantations in China if it goes
unchecked. In fact, many international experts fear the disease
could wipe out bananas from the face of the Earth in the next couple
of decades.
The disease has already affected 38.5 percent of the 8667 hectares
under banana plantation in Guangzhou, including its major bases in
Panyu, Zhongshan and Nansha, and is spreading. In fact, the 1st case
in Guangzhou was detected as early as 1995.
But bananas on sale in the markets are absolutely safe for human
consumption, South China University of Agriculture professor Chen
Houbing says, because plants attacked by the disease wilt before
bearing fruits.
Guangdong has about 120 000 hectares under banana plantation, 5
percent of which are already under attack by the fungus that causes
Panama disease, Chen says.
The alarming fact, says Liu Shaoqin, director of Guangzhou
Association of Science and Technology, is that after about 5 percent
infection in the 1st year, the disease could spread more than
exponentially. The 2nd year could see 20 percent of a plantation
being affected, and the 3rd, up to 50 percent. An entire plantation
could be wiped out by the 4th year. "Millions of banana plants have
died, and unfortunately we have found no cure for the disease," Liu says.
Besides Guangdong, banana plantations in neighboring Fujian, Hainan
and Guangxi, which are major banana production areas of China, too,
have fallen victim to the disease.
But an expert with the Ministry of Agriculture, Zhang Xiyan, has
allayed fears: "Banana plantations won't disappear completely if all
necessary precautionary steps are taken." Farmers should dig out the
roots of the stricken plants, burn them on the spot and disinfect the
soil. And to prevent the spread of the disease, they should mix lime
with the soil. The disease can be combated by flooding the
plantation for 6 months, or, if it's not too serious, by planting a cover crop.
The fungus originates in the soil, travels to the secondary roots and
enters the corm through fresh injuries. It passes into the
pseudo-stem and starts turning the leaves yellow starting with the
oldest at the base 1st, then along the margins, and finally at the
center. The interior leaves turn bronze in color and droop, and the
pseudo-stem turns brown.
This disease has seriously affected banana production in Central
America, Colombia and the Canary Islands. It started spreading in
southern Taiwan in 1967 and has become the worst local banana disease.
"Cavendish" bananas are considered resistant, but they succumb to the
disease if planted on land earlier occupied by "Gros Michel."
Incidentally, "Gros Michel" bananas were the most favored in the West
till the mid-1960's when they were attacked by the disease and [had
to be] replaced by "Cavendish."

["Banana and plantain are the most important agricultural products in
the tropics, with annual production of over 100 million metric tons.
Of the various pathogens encountered in the tropics, Panama disease
[PD] (aka Fusarium wilt), is the most significant. PD is caused by
the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp _cubense_ [FOC]. PD was
considered a major threat to banana production in the 1940s-1950s,
but planting of a PD-resistant banana cv. Gros Michel was a
breakthrough. Over time, Gros Michel was replaced by the
Cavendish-type cultivar, which has remained in production to date. A
new variant of FOC, tropical race 4 (TR4), has been responsible for
the Southeast Asian outbreaks. Unlike subtropical outbreaks that
affect cold-stressed Cavendish in Australia, the Canary Islands, and
South Africa, TR4 affects Cavendish in the absence of predisposing
factors. Although it is found only in Southeast Asia, TR4 continues
to spread in that region. The great fear is that FOC will spread to
the Americas and Africa, where it could have a great impact on
production of export bananas and plantains that normally resist PD.
