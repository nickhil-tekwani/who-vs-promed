Predicting the prevalence of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the
United Kingdom
A survey of prion protein in tonsils or appendices in the United Kingdom
would not enable the size of the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(nvCJD) epidemic to be predicted (1). The current detectable prevalence of
infection is between 0.7 and 120 000 infections per million people,
according to a mathematical model of nvCJD based on human exposure to
tissues from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and assuming
that the diagnostic test can detect prion for the last 75% of the
incubation period.
Sample sizes would have to be enormous in order to estimate prevalence with
any accuracy. If 40,000 specimens were screened and one was found to be
positive, the 95% confidence interval for the prevalence in 1998 would be
from 0.6 to 140 infections per million people, which is consistent with an
epidemic ranging from the 29 observed to 15,000 cases. If infectivity is
detectable only in the last 50% of the incubation period such a survey
would yield even wider estimates. The authors argue for further thought
before unlinked anonymous studies are introduced (1,2).
