I apologise for the slowness of my reply but I was travelling in Yemen
until today. I would like to comment very briefly on the moderator's
comments to the 20 June posting on rinderpest eradication. One can not help
but agree it would be crass stupidity to "destroy the vaccine". "Ending
vaccination" is an entirely different issue and is a pre-requisite for
verifying freedom from rinderpest which will rely heavily on
serosurveillance studies.
For more information on the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme, your
readers might be interested to view

[I appreciate Peter's reply. However, it seems when one ends a vaccination
program, some time thereafter, there is a move to destroy the vaccine. I
hope this is not the case. - Mod.TG
