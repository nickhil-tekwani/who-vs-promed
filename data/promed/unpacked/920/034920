The 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] is confirmed in the Valparaiso Region
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Valparaiso Health SEREMI [regional ministerial administrative unit], María Graciela Astudillo, announced this Friday [25 Mar 2016] the 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the area [this year, 2016]. The infected individual is a 22 year old man who is currently in a stable condition admitted into the intensive care unit in the Reñaca Clinic.

After a series of tests, the presence of this disease was established; the Public Health Institute (ISP) confirmed that this is the 1st one found this year [2016 in the Valparaiso region].

The Health SEREMI reiterated that the virus is transmitted by [virus-containing] particles coming from feces and urine of the long-tailed rat [long-tailed pygmy rice rat].

The main symptoms are sudden fever, muscle pain, gastrointestinal distress, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache. To these symptoms, respiratory difficulty may be added with the need of administration of additional oxygen, a condition that may become fatal [hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome].

Since 1995 to date, the ISP has registered 16 cases in the region. The last one was detected in 2013. [Interestingly, there was a suspected case in the region in 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151107.3774972), for which confirmation was never received. - Mod.TY]

[The conditions under which this young man acquired his hantavirus infection is not given, nor if there will be an epidemiological investigation of the area where he worked and resided. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
