Nine cases (1 fatal) of bubonic plague have been detected in a village
close to Tafraoui, in Oran prefecture, 450 km west of Algiers, according to
a source close to the Ministry of Health. The fatal case arrived late in
the course of the illness at hospital mid-week, and could not be saved. The
others are being treated and their condition is improving.

[Plague is not commonly reported from North Africa, and ProMED-mail has not
reported a case from Algiers in its 10 years of existence, but consumption
of the meat of an infected camel has been reported to cause plague in
neighboring Libya (Christie AB, Chen TH, Elberg SS. Plague in camels and
goats: their role in human epidemics. J Infect Dis 1980; 141: 724-6). I
also heard of a similar case in Saudi Arabia years ago. The remoteness of
this location in Algeria means that these cases are very unlikely to have
implications for international trade or travel. - Mod.JW/DS]
