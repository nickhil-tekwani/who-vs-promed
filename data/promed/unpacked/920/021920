I can add another one to this list. Back in 1985 one of the German Shepherd
breeders in this area had a problem with _Clostridium perfringens_ which
can cause a toxic gut syndrome resembling "Pigbel" in German Shepherds. I
boarded one of her dogs that later died of it and it infected a bitch which
had just whelped for me. While cleaning up the diarrhea from her whelping
box, I got a diarrheal illness strongly resembling clostridial food
poisoning. I confirmed by culture the heavy growth of _Clostridium
perfringens_ in the grape jelly-like mass left of the upper bowel of the
dog that died, the stool from my bitch, and the stool from myself.
