Data in WHO as of 28 Aug 2012 for 2012 data and 27 Aug 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights of this week:
- The outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in the Horn of Africa, which affects Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia, has spread into 2 new states of Somalia.
- In Israel, the number of sewage samples which have tested positive for WPV1 has reached 85; one sewage sample collected in West Bank and Gaza has tested positive for WPV1.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV case was reported in the past week.
- All 4 WPV cases this year [2013] were reported from Eastern Region. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [23 Jul 2013], from Kunar province.
- No WPV3 has been detected in Afghanistan since April 2010.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) were held on [1-3 Jul 2013], with resources focusing on strengthening campaign quality in Southern and Eastern Regions.

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV case was reported in the past week. The total of WPV1 cases for 2013 remains 43. The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [23 Jul 2013] (from Borno).
- The most recent WPV3 detected in Nigeria was reported in November 2012.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013], from Borno).
- The next subnational Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) are planned across northern states in September [2013].

Pakistan
--------
- One new case of WPV was reported in the past week, a WPV1 from FR Bannu in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas [FATA], with onset of paralysis on [27 Jul 2013]. This is the most recent case in the country and brings the total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 to 25.
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 12.
- FATA remains the major poliovirus reservoir in Pakistan and in Asia, both due to WPV1 and cVDPV2.

Chad, Cameroon and Central African Republic
-------------------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac).
- In Chad, no new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- In Cameroon, one new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 to 3. This new case had onset of paralysis on [19 Jul 2013] (from Extreme-Nord).
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at serious risk of re-infection due to proximity with Chad, ongoing insecurity and humanitarian crises, and destruction of health infrastructure. To minimize the risk and consequences of potential re-infection, 2 subnational immunization campaigns were conducted in June and July [2013]. A SNID is planned for September [2013] and a NID for October [2013].

Horn of Africa
--------------
- 20 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week in Somalia and one in Kenya. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 is 142 (128 from Somalia, 13 from Kenya, 1 from Ethiopia). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [30 Jul 2013] (from Somalia).
- The outbreak is spreading geographically in Somalia, with 2 new states reporting cases: Galgadud and Gedo. Anticipation of this spread has driven intense vaccination activities across the country, in an effort to raise immunity.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- WPV1 has been detected in 85 sewage samples from 27 sampling sites in Israel, collected from [3 Feb to 18 Aug 2013]. Initially restricted to southern Israel, WPV1 has now also been detected in environmental sampling sites elsewhere in Israel, indicating transmission throughout the country. A sampling site in Tulkarem in the West Bank has also reported a positive sample, collected on [30 Jun 2013]. No case of paralytic polio has been reported in either Israel or the West Bank and Gaza.
- To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) targeting children up to the age of 9 years was initiated in the southern district of Israel during the week of [5 Aug 2013]; since [18 Aug 2013], the SIA was expanded to all of Israel. The objective of the SIA with OPV is to boost intestinal immunity in children vaccinated with IPV only in order to rapidly interrupt wild poliovirus transmission.
- Following the positive sample from Tulkarem, subsequent samples in the West Bank and Gaza have all tested negative. Discussions have begun for a vaccination response to the positive sample in the West Bank.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- One new cVDPV2 was reported in the past week from Niger's Diffa province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Niger has not reported a case of cVDPV since 2011. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to those seen in Cameroon, Chad and (Borno) Nigeria.
- Multi-country immunization campaigns are planned in West Africa for mid-October [2013] and mid-November, as well as subnational campaigns in Niger in September [2013].

[In the past week since the last global update (20 Aug 2013), the number of cases of confirmed WPV associated disease has increased from 192 to 214 (see Poliomyelitis update (20): Ethiopia, global 20130823.1897833). All but one of the newly confirmed cases have been outbreak associated, with the only new case confirmed from one of the 3 endemic countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan), occurring in Pakistan.

The number of wild poliovirus (WPV) cases associated with the ongoing outbreak in the Horn of Africa (Somalia, Kenya, and now Ethiopia) has increased from 121 to 142 in the past week, with 20 newly confirmed cases in Somalia and one in Kenya.

Another worrisome occurrence is the continued spread of WPV northward in Israel and now to the West Bank. Fortunately to date there have not been any cases of paralytic polio resulting from the transmission of WPV in the region.

The occurrence of cases of polio associated with infection with circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) in Cameroon and Niger reflects the high risk of recurrent WPV associated disease should the WPV be introduced into these areas, as cVDPV cases occur in areas with suboptimal vaccination coverages.
