The title of public enemy number one is a close-run competition in the wheat-growing world. While Ug99 [group of stem rust strains] poses a huge potential threat, its cousin stripe rust (also known as yellow rust) currently causes the most damage. Just like stem rust, in recent years it has got tougher. New, highly-aggressive strains have emerged, able to overcome a key resistance gene, Yr27, that many widely-grown varieties rely on.

In many locations, resistance to one disease simply is not enough. [In Africa], stem rust is the chief problem in the short-season (February-May), whereas in the main season (June-November) stripe rust is the biggest menace, causing a major epidemic in 2010 and serious losses in 2011.

The tide is turning. A significant proportion of farmers is shifting to new varieties that are resistant, or moderately resistant, to yellow rust. Crucially, these new varieties are also resistant to Ug99 and give high yields. Around 5000 advanced wheat lines are screened for both rusts each year, with a special focus on durum wheat.

The next challenge for breeders is septoria blotch, a different fungal disease that is causing infections in CIMMYT lines. In the race to protect the world's wheat yields from ever-evolving disease, there's no time to sit back and relax.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw. Some grasses or volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management may include fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat, and resistant varieties if available. New races are emerging, and the most dangerous at present is strain Ug99 (see ProMED-mail post 19990519.0812), which has overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Since then Ug99 strains have spread and were reported from southern Africa for the 1st time in 2009 opening up routes of transmission for the southern hemisphere (ProMED-mail post 20100602.1834).

Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent in wheat. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Between seasons, the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge". Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New, more virulent stripe and stem rust strains overcoming additional host resistance genes and/or with added fungicide resistances are emerging worldwide. Such strains are even more difficult to control and counteract traditional resistance breeding efforts. Development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple pathogens is particularly difficult since the pathogens can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains.

Septoria leaf blotch diseases of wheat and some other cereals are caused by the fungi _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties (for more information see links below).

Hard (durum) wheats (_Triticum turgidum_, used for example for pasta) and winter (soft) wheats (_T. aestivum_, used mostly for bread) are different species and may therefore show different levels of susceptibility to pathogen strains.
