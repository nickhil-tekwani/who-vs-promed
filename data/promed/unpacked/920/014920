WHO Influenza Update number 143
-------------------------------
Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The countries in the northern hemisphere temperate zone are in their
inter-seasonal period for influenza. Nearly all of the countries in
this zone reported low or no influenza activity.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------

http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2011_09_23_influenza_southern_asia_circulation_main.pdf

In Central and tropical South America, generally low levels of
influenza transmission are reported; RSV [respiratory syncytial virus]
continues to be the predominant virus in Central America and the
Caribbean since week 24. Cuba reports low level of circulation of
influenza A(H3N2) since week 29. Honduras has had recent circulation
of influenza A(H3N2), which peaked in mid August. The H3N2 circulation
there was associated with smaller amounts of influenza A(H1N1)2009 and
type B. Bolivia has reported sporadic detections of influenza
A(H1N1)2009 and influenza A(H3N2). The previously reported influenza
transmission in Colombia (H1N1 with smaller numbers of H3N2) and
Brazil (roughly equal numbers of H1N1, H3N2, and type B) has largely
finished.

In sub-Saharan Africa, some influenza transmission has continued in
the west, notably in Cameroon where transmission has been
predominantly influenza type B with smaller but increasing numbers of
influenza A(H1N1)2009 in the last weeks. In eastern Africa, continuous
transmission of a mixture of influenza type B, A(H3N2), and
A(H1N1)2009 since the peak of transmission in March are reported.
Transmission in Kenya has decreased with fewer positive samples for
influenza in recent weeks, which have been a mixture of influenza B,
A(H3N2), and A(H1N1)2009.

Influenza activity in most of tropical Asia has been active in
localized areas. Moderate transmission of primarily influenza A(H3N2)
was reported in India, Bangladesh, Singapore and Thailand, though
transmission in India has now peaked and returned to low levels. Small
numbers of influenza type B and H1N1(2009) have also been reported
from those countries. In contrast, Viet Nam continues to report
sustained transmission of predominantly influenza A(H1N1)2009 since
the beginning of 2011, which reached higher levels in mid August. 27
percent of severe viral pneumonias reported to Viet Nam's sentinel
surveillance system have been positive for influenza, 96 percent of
those influenza A(H1N1)2009. Lao People's Democratic Republic has
predominant transmission of influenza A(H3N2), though at low levels.
Cambodia reports a slight increase in the number of specimens positive
for influenza A(H1N1)2009 and influenza type B. In Singapore
influenza-like illness (ILI) made up only one percent of polyclinic
attendances for acute respiratory illness, which is considered low.
Influenza A(H3N2) constituted 69 percent of all the influenza virus
specimens collected in August 2011 followed by influenza type B at 20
percent and influenza A(H1N1)2009 at 6 percent.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
South America

Lower levels of influenza activity were reported in the temperate
regions of South America, where the season appears to have peaked and
is declining. In Chile, influenza A(H1N1)2009 detections were
substantially lower than the past 4 weeks, ILI activity and
consultations for respiratory disease in emergency departments also
remained at low levels; 10 deaths from influenza A(H1N1)2009 were
reported in week 35, 9 of which had co-morbidities. The situation in
Argentina is similar with low and decreasing levels of ILI and severe
acute respiratory infection (SARI) activity and fewer samples testing
positive for influenza, with co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1) 2009
and influenza A(H3N2) among the subtyped influenza A viruses. In
Paraguay, the proportion of ILI consultations was slightly higher than
the previous week (about 9 percent) and the proportion of SARI
hospitalizations, SARI ICU admissions, and SARI related deaths were
below 5 percent, all either similar to or decreased from recent weeks;
in the samples tested, no influenza virus was detected. In Uruguay the
proportions of SARI hospitalizations and SARI deaths continues to
decline below five percent; the proportion of SARI ICU admissions also
continued to decrease (5 percent) after peaking in week 31.

Southern Africa

Influenza transmission in South Africa has continued at low levels
since peaking in early June. The influenza season was dominated by
influenza A(H1N1)2009 with smaller numbers of influenza type B and
some influenza A(H3N2). Notably, South Africa experienced a secondary
peak of influenza in late August primarily associated with influenza
A(H3N2) and B.

Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific
----------------------------------------

The weekly number of laboratory confirmed influenza notifications has
continued to decline in Queensland, New South Wales (NSW) and most
other states except the Northern Territory; but in many states these
notifications are still above the peak levels observed in 2010.

An additional 2 cases of oseltamivir resistant influenza A(H1N1)2009
have been reported in NSW associated with the previously reported
cluster of cases in that state. These new cases have no prior travel
history to the originally affected region of the state; all of the
viruses from the cluster were found to be sensitive to zanamivir and
without any antigenic changes that would have affected their
recognition by vaccine-induced antibodies. (see the Influenza Update
from 2 weeks ago for more details about this cluster). This represents
a wider area of spread of this cluster of viruses though the numbers
appear to be declining as the season in Australia wanes.

The majority of states and territories have reported mostly influenza
A(H1N1)2009 with co-circulation of influenza B; except in Tasmania and
NSW where influenza B predominates, and Western Australia reporting a
mix of influenza A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2) and very little influenza B. By
2 Sep 2011, the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System
(NNDSS) had reported 19 987 confirmed cases of influenza of which the
peak this season was in the week ending 5 Aug 2011, with 1952 cases.
>From 1 May to 1 Sep 2011, there were 118 influenza hospitalizations
(13 ICU admissions) in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia
and the Australia Capital Territory. About 56 percent of the
hospitalizations and 77 percent of the ICU admissions were associated
with influenza A(H1N1)2009; mean age of the hospitalized patients was
46.6 years.

In New Zealand, the rate of national ILI consultations was 50.7 per
100 000, and is at or above baseline levels but has not reached high
levels in this season. Influenza type B virus accounts for a large
proportion of influenza viruses detected in New Zealand. In the
Pacific Islands, most countries reported low influenza activity, with
the exception of Samoa, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, Tonga
and Kiribati.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response
System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member
States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and
quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[In brief:
-- Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere remains low or undetectable.
-- Countries in the tropical zone mostly reported low influenza
activity but with some transmission reported in countries of the
Americas (Cuba, Honduras and Bolivia), western Africa (Cameroon), and
southern Asia (India, Thailand, Viet Nam and Singapore).
-- Transmission in South Africa has declined to low levels.
-- In Australia, the number of laboratory confirmed influenza
notifications is reported to be declining in Queensland, New South
Wales (NSW) and other states with the exception of the Northern
Territory. Oseltamivir-resistant (but sensitive to zanamivir)
influenza A(H1N1)2009 was identified in a cluster of cases in the
Newcastle region of New South Wales; no travel history was found among
the cases, and none have died.
-- ILI activity in New Zealand continues around national baseline
levels and the majority of viruses detected have been influenza B.

Interested readers are recommended to view the the WHO maps and graphs
referenced above that provide a pain-free appreciation of the current
influenza situation.

Currently there is no evidence suggesting the appearance of a novel
epidemic strains not containable by the currently available vaccine. -
