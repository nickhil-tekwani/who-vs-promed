High disease risk to spring barley
----------------------------------
Plant pathologists from Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) are warning that there is an almost unprecedented disease risk to spring barley this year [2013] after the heavy rains last season.

After finding that in some regions nearly 50 per cent of the seeds are infected with at least one strain of fungal disease they are stressing that farmers in all regions should get their seeds tested and treated. Very high concentrations of fusarium and microdochium have been found in barley seed all over the country.

Dr Fiona Burnett, SRUC, said, "Our trial fields were decimated, and many farmers suffered similar problems in 2012. Due to the bad harvest we are seeing a rise in seed prices, which may mean more farmers using their own seeds. However, our tests have shown that it is likely these will be heavily infected. Some samples we tested had 2 strains of fusarium and one of microdochium. Cold wet soils, slow emergence, and high infection levels on seed could really reduce plant counts."

[Several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_ can affect barley, wheat, and other cereals causing foot rot, seedling blight, and head blight symptoms. The pathogens form a complex of diseases on seeds, seedlings, and adult plants. Current names of the fungi include _Gibberella zeae_, _Fusarium poae_, _Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_ (previously _Fusarium_ or _Microdochium nivale_), and _Microdochium majus_.

The diseases are generally favoured by humid conditions, and stress factors may increase plant susceptibility. Besides dramatically reducing yield and quality, the grain may also become contaminated with fungal toxins. The fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues, spores are spread by wind, water, and mechanical means. For seedling blights, the main pathogen source is contaminated seed. Disease management includes fungicides as crop sprays or seed treatments, and crop varieties with reduced susceptibility.

New fungal strains are emerging worldwide. A re-emergence of some fusarium diseases thought to be driven mainly by changes to climate and agronomic practices has been reported from the UK (ProMED-mail post 20100726.2497).
