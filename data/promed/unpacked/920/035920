------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since October 7 [2017], when the outbreak was reported and special precautionary measures started, no new cases were reported that would have been subsequently housed in the area.

All the cases are tourists who were staying in hotels in the area between September and the 1st week of October [2017]. There is only one Spanish resident case, but it is a worker from a hotel in the area who showers in the hotel where he works.

Public health authorities have inspected and identified any possible source of infection and environmental samples have been taken, the result of which will be known shortly. They have closed the hotels with more cases; they have closed beach showers and ornamental fountains in the area.

No case has appeared so far in Spanish residents of the area or other workers in the facilities of the area.

Since the incubation period of _Legionella pneumophila_ is up to 10 days maximum, we are 4 days from closing 2 periods of maximum incubation without new cases.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gimenez, an EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member, for his report above.

Up to 19 tourists in Palmanova on the island of Mallorca, Spain have developed legionnaires' disease; 13 of the 19 are from the UK (http://www.dailymail
.co.uk/news/article-4994420/Outbre ak-deadly-Legionnaires-disease-Majorca-resort.html). We are not told over what period of time this event occurred. Another news report said that since mid-September [2017], 17 British tourists who returned from Palmanova developed Legionnaires' disease (https://www.euroweeklynews.com/3.0.15/news/on-euro-weekly-news/mallorca/146101-travel-warning-issued-after-17-brits-infected-by-legionnaire's-disease-in-mallorca). We are told by Dr Giménez above that one additional case of legionnaires' disease occurred in a local Spanish resident, who is a worker from a hotel in the area and who showered in the hotel where he works.

A total of 9 of the British tourists with Legionnaires' disease, one of whom died, stayed at the same hotel in Palmanova and samples from this hotel were positive for _Legionella_. We are told by Dr Giménez above that samples were taken from possible sources, which have been shut down. We now await results of culture and genotyping of any _Legionella_ cultured from the suspected environmental sources. No new cases have been reported.

Palmanova is a major holiday destination for Europeans, especially from Germany and the UK, on the Balearic island of Mallorca (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_Nova). - Mod.ML
