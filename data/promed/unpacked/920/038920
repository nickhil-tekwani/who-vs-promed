EHEC update - 28 Aug 2013
-------------------------
Brisbane is currently experiencing an outbreak of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, which causes severe diarrhea. So far, 9 people are confirmed to have EHEC and a further 17 people are being tested for the infection. 3 of these people have been so ill they have been admitted to hospital.

If your child displays symptoms of EHEC (which include bloody and persistent diarrhea and stomach pain) you should take them to your GP for testing. They should not attend their child care centre or school until the diarrhoea has settled.

If their doctor believes they may have EHEC, they should not attend child care or school until testing shows they do not have EHEC.
