SURVEILLANCE DICTIONARY: REQUEST FOR INFO

Subject: A dictionary of surveillance [elementary]
The Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network is initiating a range of
activities to improve surveillance of diseases and other health events in
the Pacific Islands. These activities will be planned and implemented in a
manner that will enable informed decision-making and public health action at
the local as well as national and regional levels.
An important component of these activities will be developing/adapting
training modules covering the science and applications of surveillance.
Among our needs is a dictionary of terms used in surveillance. While we
will use Last's dictionary of epidemiology, and various standard texts on
surveillance, we feel that their content may not be readily comprehensible
to workers who have limited or no training in epidemiology and public health.
Is there a dictionary of the terms used in surveillance to address this
specific need?
