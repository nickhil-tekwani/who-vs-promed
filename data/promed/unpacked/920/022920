After Oregon legalized marijuana for recreational use, the number of pets poisoned by pot has risen.

Recently, U.S. authorities has been looking into the health benefits marijuana can bring to pets suffering from seizures, anxiety, and other illnesses. Studies show many pet owners have turned to marijuana to treat their pets. However, the increase in pet pot poisoning cases in Oregon may dissuade U.S. authorities from allowing veterinarians to prescribe pot-based treatments to their patients. [Having veterinarians prescribe is far better than owners not understanding how sensitive dogs are and overdoing their animal. It would be the same for federal law to prohibit helpful treatments from the hands of veterinarians. - Mod.TG]

According to The Bulletin, Oregon has seen an increased number of cases of pot poisoning in animals. In fact, The Pet Poison Helpline -- a 24-hour animal poison control hotline -- has estimated a 448 percent increase in poisoning cases caused by marijuana from 2012 to 2018.

Experts seem to attribute the rise of pet pot poisoning cases to recent laws which legalized the sale of recreational marijuana. For instance, Dr. Adam Stone, who works at the Bend Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Center, has reported that staff sees at least 1-3 pets -- usually dogs -- with signs of marijuana poisoning in every 12-hour shift.

The signs of pot poisoning include nausea, which could lead to vomiting, lethargy, urine dribbling, instability, and even being comatose. It must be noted that pot poisoning in dogs is not lethal, but it can lead to fatal complications. The uncertain effects of marijuana toxicity in pets may be the reason U.S. Federal Law does not allow veterinarians to prescribe marijuana-based treatments. [Pets which could possibly benefit from this therapy could be denied help. Colorado State University has some wonderful studies ongoing which are promising for pain reduction and seizure control. - Mod.TG]

Despite the law's aversion to pot for pets, more and more owners have turned to marijuana to treat their animal companions, based on a 2018 nationwide survey by veterinary medicine researchers from Colorado State University. According to Reuters, the survey had 1068 participants, and about 80 percent of the respondents admitted to purchasing hemp or marijuana products for their pets. [Dogs and cats do not respond to this drug in the same fashion as humans. It should be in the hands of the veterinarian, not the lay person for treating their animals. - Mod.TG]

A high percentage of the pet owners who participated in the survey reported pot products were more effective in treating anxiety and relieving pain in their pets compared to the usual medicines.

Based on the rise in pet pot poisoning cased in Oregon and the survey by Colorado State University, it is evident animals can have strikingly different reactions to marijuana. Dr. Curt Nitzchelm, a resident at Redmond Veterinary Clinic, may have the answer as to why animals, especially pets, respond differently to pot products.

According to Dr. Nitzchelm, most dogs brought in for pot poisoning have consumed a high concentration of a psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, a cannabinoid called tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC.

"It's usually dogs, and it's usually edible products. From what I understand, they have a higher concentration of marijuana or the active ingredient. In most of the cases that we see, it has been the higher concentrated products like butter, and edibles, brownies, those type of things," Dr. Nitzchelm said.

In contrast to the dogs brought in for pot poisoning, those treated with marijuana consume CBD products. CBD is a plant extract called cannabidiol. Reuters explains that CBD is more associated with pain relief, whereas THC in high concentration is responsible for the "high" feelings caused by marijuana. Researchers at Colorado State University found pet owners specifically look for CBD products to treat their pets.

It must be noted that the different effects THC and CBD have on pets and animals, in general, have not been thoroughly studied.

[Veterinarians are qualified to handle the effects of marijuana in pets, whether treating a toxicity, often brought on by the owner, or treating the animal therapeutically. Colorado State University has and is conducting some extremely beneficial studies to understand dosages in canines and uses for the therapy. This work will soon be reported and will give veterinarians a better understanding of using this drug therapeutically. As pointed out in the article, CBD [cannabidiol] seems to be more useful in pets than THC [tetrahydrocannabinol]. I would hope the FDA would not throw out a useful treatment, especially for some neurological conditions, just because people want to try and get their pets high. - Mod.TG
