WHEAT STEM RUST, STRAIN UG99 - YEMEN (02): GOVERNMENT RESPONSE

Yemen's government has launched a campaign to combat a virulent and
potentially devastating wheat disease after the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recently warned of its spread to
the Arabian Peninsula from east Africa. "Yemen, in particular, should
be on the alert, step up field monitoring and training, and prepare
for direct control interventions in disease hot spots," FAO said in a
statement on 12 Apr [2007]. "Most important, control measures in
affected countries should include the introduction of more resistant
wheat varieties and restricting planting dates to break the disease cycle."
The disease is known as wheat stem rust, wheat black rust, or
_Puccinia graminis_. FAO confirmed in a recent field mission to Yemen
that a particularly virulent strain of the disease, called Ug99, had
affected wheat fields in the country for the 1st time. Ug99 gets its
name from its place and date of discovery -- Uganda in 1999.
According to FAO, it subsequently spread to Kenya and Ethiopia.
"It appears that the Ug99 strain found in Yemen is already more
virulent than the one found in east Africa," FAO said. It is
estimated that as much as 80 percent of all wheat varieties planted
in Asia and Africa are susceptible to the Ug99 strain.
"The fungus can spread rapidly and has the potential to cause global
crop epidemics and wheat harvest losses of several billion dollars.
This could lead to increased wheat prices and local or regional food
shortages. Developing countries that are relying on wheat and do not
have access to resistant varieties will be particularly hit," Dr
Jacques Diouf, FAO director-general, said in a recent statement.
In response to this potential threat, the Yemeni Ministry of
Agriculture and Irrigation has begun a programme to combat wheat stem rust.
Dr Mansour al-Aqil, general director of the General Department for
Agricultural Information at the ministry, told IRIN on Sunday [15 Apr
2007] that the programme aims to plant detection samples among crops,
which help discover the existence of the disease.
Al-Aqil said 2 experts from the International Center for Agricultural
Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) and FAO travelled to Yemen in
February [2007] and visited nurseries where they saw samples
revealing wheat stem rust in different provinces.
According to al-Aqil, there are 3 kinds of wheat rust disease in
Yemen: yellow rust, orange rust, and black rust. Yellow and orange
rust mostly attack leaves, while black rust attacks the stem, he
said. The disease affects the southern parts of Yemen more than the
northern areas, which are colder, he said.
Wheat is the 3rd most grown cereal in Yemen. It is planted in more
than 86 000 hectares in most provinces of the country. In 2005, Yemen
produced 115 000 tonnes of wheat. A wheat rust epidemic in Yemen
would be devastating to the food security of the impoverished nation
and to other major wheat-producing countries, should it spread.

[Yemen is setting a good example for other countries that may be
affected in the future. Planting reporter varieties as mentioned in
this press release is a start towards monitoring the disease.
However, countries will need to use certified seed, develop resistant
varieties suitable for their region, increase vigilance, and develop
contingency plans in case of an outbreak. To combat Ug99 worldwide,
long-term projects, international collaboration and ongoing
commitment are required.
The other 2 rust diseases referred to above are stripe rust, also
called yellow rust, caused by _Puccinia striiformis_; and leaf rust,
also called orange rust, caused by _P. recondita_.
