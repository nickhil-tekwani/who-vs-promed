In the last 2 weeks, 2 cases were diagnosed with scrub typhus at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital among admitted cases.

The 1st case, a 23-year-old male from Gulmi (province 5), was admitted with acute undifferentiated fever for 5 days and diagnosed with scrub typhus; [he] fully recovered with docycycline.

The 2nd case, a 40-year-old female, was admitted last week with acute febrile illness for 8 days from Kumari, Nuwakot (province 3) and diagnosed with scrub typhus. She also recovered fully with doxycycline.

Numbers are expected to increase in the coming days. There have been no fatalities reported this season due to scrub typhus.
