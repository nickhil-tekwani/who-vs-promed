The owners of the cattle told me in an interview that they had at least one
lightning [strike death last summer with no effort to check for anthrax.
Maybe 2 deaths depending on whom you ask. [And no vaccination in 2000.
To date they have lost 9 adult cows. They elected to vaccinate only (no
penicillin) upon removal from pasture; there have been 6 deaths since
vaccination. They treated the herd yesterday with penicillin. They will
have to return the cattle to the index pasture within a couple of weeks. My
advice was to get the booster into those cattle (second vaccine dose)
before they go back.

[Which reveals that this herd probably was affected last summer; this
summer there are simple recurrences from the contaminated soil. All of
which reinforces Heidi Kassenborg's suggestion that "lightening strike"
deaths should be checked for anthrax before the insurance company pays out;
and that all anthrax carcasses should be properly dealt with, preferably by
burning, and the bloody soil burnt as well. If stock cannot be checked at
least twice a day, it is better to first treat the whole herd with
long-acting antibiotics and follow this about 10 days (i.e., 8-12 days)
later by vaccination. Mod.MHJ
