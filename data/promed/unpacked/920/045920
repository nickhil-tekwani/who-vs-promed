This is the 1st time that HPAI subtype H5N5 has been reported in Serbia and Slovenia. Since November 2016, HPAI H5N5 is being detected with increased regularity on the European continent. This subtype has been reported in Germany (in wild birds and poultry), Montenegro (wild birds), the Netherlands (wild birds), Italy (wild birds and captive birds), Croatia (wild birds), Greece (wild birds), Poland (wild birds), and the Czech Republic (captive birds).

"Wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species." (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/web-portal-on-avian-influenza/about-ai/)

Yearly notifications of highly pathogenic avian influenza (subtypes H5 and H7) reported by countries can be seen at http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/2017/, (last report received on 27 Feb 2017). - Mod.CRD]
