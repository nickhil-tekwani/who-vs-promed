A total of 10 people were sick and one died in China [in July 2021] after eating a toxic plant. The food poisoning was caused by the wild plant _Anisodus tanguticus_, which contains tropane alkaloids. The outbreak occurred in a remote village on the Tibetan Plateau, according to a study published in China CDC Weekly (https://weekly.chinacdc.cn/fileCCDCW/journal/article/ccdcw/2022/41/PDF/220120.pdf).

Patients included 9 men and 1 woman (aged 27 to 57 years). They were migrant workers for a construction company in Henan Province involved in road maintenance. They lived in 3 tents around the work site on a temporary basis.

In mid-July 2021, 30 minutes after dinner, the 1st person came down with fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. Another 9 workers had similar symptoms, and only 1 had no signs of illness. All patients were sent to a hospital.

A total of 4 patients had severe neurotoxic symptoms with unconsciousness and dilated pupils, and the other 6 had dizziness, fatigue, nausea, blurred vision, irritability, and tachycardia. Clinical presentation resembled atropine poisoning, which indicated it was caused by atropine-containing plants.

A 49 year old man died but the other patients were discharged from the hospital later in July 2021.

Finding the source
------------------
An investigation showed 10 male migrant workers lived in 2 tents, while another tent was the kitchen and living room of the female migrant worker, who was a chef; their living and sanitary conditions were poor.

All vegetables and ingredients were purchased in Maqin County every 2 days. The only difference in the dinner was the excess consumption of cold wild vegetables. All patients had the cold dish, while the worker who was unaffected did not eat it.

Wild vegetables were picked by 3 workers from near the construction site. About 1 kilogram [2.2 lb] was blanched by the chef, and a cold dish was prepared.

Health officials took pictures and videos of the wild vegetables and experts said the plant belonged to the _Anisodus_ genus. Plant specimens were collected in the field and identified as _Anisodus tanguticus_.

The remainder of the dinner and plants were collected to screen and confirm the toxicants. Tropane alkaloids -- atropine, anisodamine, scopolamine, and anisodine -- were present in the wild vegetable plant and the cold dish.

"This outbreak indicated eating _Anisodus tanguticus_ by mistake as a wild vegetable might cause severe public health problems, and the public should be alerted and educated to avoid poisoning incidents," said researchers. "With the rapid development in China, many people working in different locations may be exposed to a different environment; thus, the possibility of harvesting and ingesting wild poisonous plants have significantly increased."

[While this plant does contain tropane alkaloids, which can be used medicinally, we do not know the concentration of these alkaloids in this plant, nor do we know the amount consumed by each individual. It is possible this plant looked similar to one eaten before in a different region, which may not have been toxic. Some of these finer details have not been provided.

"Anisodus tanguticus Maxim. (Solanaceae), a traditional endangered Tibetan herb, is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36421800/

"_Anisodus tanguticus_ is found growing (on grassy sunny slopes) principally on the Tibetan Plateau, its range extending from the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan and Yunnan in the east, through Qinghai and Gansu to the northwest, Tibet in the west, and Nepal in the south [8][9]. It is present from altitudes of 2800 to 4200 metres (9200-13 800 ft). Populations of _A. tanguticus_ in this region have decreased significantly due to extensive harvesting of the species for medicinal purposes, resulting (since the roots are the part harvested) in the removal of plants in their entirety."

"_Anisodus tanguticus_ is 1 of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine.

"It contains high levels of the tropane alkaloids hyoscyamine and scopolamine, which affect primarily the parasympathetic nervous system and can act as anticholinergic agents.

"_Anisodus tanguticus_ is grown and harvested in order to extract 2 alkaloids, anisodamine and anisodine, which can be obtained from the roots of the plant. These alkaloids are used as anticholinergic drugs in China for acute circulatory shock. Anisodamine in particular was introduced into clinical use in China in 1965 through the manufacture of a synthetic drug concentrating the alkaloids from the plant. It was first used to treat epidemic meningitis, but was later used to treat other ailments, including glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and circulatory shock. Anisodamine has also been found to be highly beneficial in cases of noise-induced hearing loss, dilating the capillaries and improving microcirculation in the bony labyrinth; while Anisodine has been used clinically for migraine and diseases of the fundus occuli due to vasospasm."

"Tropane alkaloids (TPA) occur mostly in the Solanaceae and include the anticholinergic drugs atropine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine, as well as the narcotic, topical anesthetic cocaine. TPAs are typically produced near the root apex but accumulate within the vacuoles of leaves and roots."

"The tropane alkaloids are a structurally well-defined group of natural products and have mydriatic and anesthetic properties. They are biosynthesized primarily in plants of the family [Solanaceae], which includes _Hyoscyamus_, _Duboisia_, _Atropa_, and _Scopolia_.

"The tropane alkaloids hyoscyamine and scopolamine function as acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are used clinically as parasympatholytics. The illegal drug cocaine is also a tropane alkaloid. Nicotine, although perhaps not apparent immediately from its structure, is related biosynthetically to the tropane alkaloids."

"About 200 tropane alkaloids have been isolated and most of the medicinally important tropane alkaloids are obtained from plants."
