This is a comment on the information received from IRNA (Islamic
Republic News Agency) and posted on ProMED-mail on Sun 14 Oct 2001
[see ref. above
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus was reported in Iran for
the first time in the 1970s (1). Prof. Sureau from the Institut
Pasteur Paris (France) described in 1980 the results of his
collaboration with the Institut Pasteur Iran (IP Iran) concerning the
Iranian tick vectors of CCHF vius (2).
After a long silence, mainly due to the lack of diagnostic and
reference laboratory facilities, the Central Disease Control of Iran
(CDC of Iran), a branch of the Iranian Ministry of Health, decided to
collect blood samples throughout the country and to create, in IP
Iran, a national Laboratory of Arboviruses and Hemorrhagic Fevers
(LAHF). Before the setting up of LAHF, blood samples were confirmed as
CCHF virus-positive by Professor Swanepoel's laboratory in South
Africa (in January 2000).
From October 2000, a collaboration supported by the General Delegation
to the Network of Institutes Pasteur and Associated Institutes in
Paris has been established between Iran and Dakar (Senegal). The LAHF
of the Institut Pasteur of Iran is the only national laboratory in
charge of the diagnosis of these viruses in humans and animals. The
identification and description of cases is in progress thanks to a
collaboration with the WHO Collaborating Reference Centre for
Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic Fevers, Institut Pasteur of Dakar.
The results reported in the information you received previously were
not sent by these laboratories, so they need some comments. Recent
infection (IgM) in humans and animals has been detected in 11 out of
the 28 provinces composing the country. Between June 2000 and October
2001, 71 human cases (patients with anti-CCHF virus IgM) were
diagnosed out of 150 suspected patients; the case fatality ratio was
15%. More investigations are necessary to determine the epidemic or
endemic status of CCHF virus in Iran.
From October 2000 to the end of September 2001, 458 animals (sheep,
cows, and goats) were tested. Only 7 sheep were found recently
infected . [During the same period 153 animals were found anti-CCHF
virus IgG positive. A team of virologists and epidemiologists from IP
Iran and IP Dakar is working in the field to understand the
transmission of the disease. At the moment transmission from domestic
stock to humans [has not been documented.
