In recent years, white nose syndrome has wiped out bat populations in the Maritimes [Canada's eastern provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island]. Until this summer [2015], one of the last places with healthy populations was Cape Breton [Island, Nova Scotia], but new research shows those bats are also in steep decline.

The 1st confirmed case of white nose syndrome in Nova Scotia was in 2011; since that time, millions of bats have been lost to the fungus.

"What happens is the fungus is introduced into these caves, it ends up growing on the muscle and wing tissue. [It wakes them prematurely from their hibernation, causing them to search for water and food] at a time when it's limited, so they often die of starvation," says project manager Jared Tomie.

Tomie and his team at ACAP [Atlantic Coastal Action Program] Cape Breton are using scientific measures to monitor bats on the island. They've been using acoustic equipment that allows them to listen in to bat activity. Then, they compare their year to year findings.

"We've had 3 summers worth of monitoring. We noticed a small difference last year [2014]. This year we've noticed a 10 times decrease in a few of our locations," says Tomie.

The large drop in [bat] numbers began in 2006 in the United States, making its way up the eastern seaboard.

Newfoundland may be the last hope for refuge from the disease in Atlantic Canada.

Experts expect the fungus will spread toward the western provinces and, in Nova Scotia, white nose syndrome has killed somewhere in the tens of thousands of bats so far.

"The little brown bat and northern long haired bat have been listed as species at risk in areas where the fungus has taken hold in caves and mines. There's over a 90 percent decrease in their numbers," says Tomie.

Bats have a very low reproductive rate, which means it will take a long time to recover from this deadly disease.

Tomie says treatment for white nose syndrome is in preliminary stages and may not be ready for many years to come.

[The continued spread of this disease, especially into an area that has been without it for so long is very disheartening.

Previous research has shown that _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ (Pd; previously known as _Geomyces destructans_) on bats throughout Europe did not differ from the North American Pd at 2 molecular markers (PLoS ONE, 5(11): e13853 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013853; Emerg Infect Dis. 16(2): 290-3 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958029/; Emerg Infect Dis 16(8): 1237-43 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3298319/; and PLoS ONE 6: e19167 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019167), suggesting an European origin or a holarctic distribution with a recent mutation/change in pathogenicity of North American strains. Later, experimental evidence supported the recent introduction of the pathogen to North America from Europe ('novel pathogen hypothesis'), as exposure of North American bats to European and North American Pd ruled out a possible mutation or environmentally driven change that rendered the fungus more pathogenic.

This new research, published at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215000792, provides important detailed genetic data showing that the fungus has been in Europe for a very long time, existing as several haplotypes, whereas only one haplotype was found in North America. This haplotype introduced into North America is present in Germany and France, suggesting Western Europe as the most likely origin for North American Pd. - Mod.TG/PB
