Following the disappearance of clinical signs from the initially
affected fattening calves in Kibbutz Bet Zera [see ProMED-mail 20110311.0782], new cases with characteristic signs have been seen
this week [27 Mar-1 Apr 2011] in several young (2-4 months old) female
calves. These calves had been vaccinated once while, probably, still
having maternal immunity to some degree.

The farm remains to be subjected to the implemented quarantine
measures.

A suspected case in a single calf within another cattle fattening
operation in the Beit Shean Valley has been found negative; the
restrictions implemented upon the farm and the protection zone around
it have been waived.

[Israel's official notifications on the Bet Zera outbreak (immediate
notification submitted on 13 Mar 2011 and follow-up no 1 on 24 Mar
2011), including a map, are available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10345.
According to the information about the affected population, presented
in the follow-up report, the herd contained 575 dairy cows and 3
groups of fattening calves. One group contained 40 calves and no signs
have been seen. A 2nd group contained 20 calves, 15 of which showed
clinical signs. The 3rd group contained 15 calves, 5 of which showed
clinical signs. 2 cows (out of 575) showed clinical signs as well.
These data testified for solid immunity conferred by the (trivalent,
including serotypes O, A, Asia1) vaccine, obligatorily applied
annually in Israel, particularly in the animals which had been
revaccinated. Though the virus penetrates Israel intermittently, with
an enigmatic seasonal pattern, FMD is extremely rare in adult dairy
cows.

On 23 Mar 2011, 2 samples from Bet Zera were submitted to the World
Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (WRLFMD) at Pirbright,
UK, where they have been serotyped and genotyped. The results are
included in WRLFMD Ref ISR/1/2011, issued 31 Mar 2011.

Summarising the WRLFMD report, the main findings are the following:
Report date for this batch: 31 Mar 2011
No of samples: 2
Location: Kibbutz Bet Zera, Israel
Date collected: 10 Mar 2011
Date received by WRLFMD: 23 Mar 2011
Species: cattle
Serotype: O
Topotype: ME-SA
Genotype/strain: PanAsia-2ANT-10

Most closely related virus: O/BUL/1/2010, serotype O, topotype ME-SA,
strain PanAsia-2ANT-10 (98.59 per cent identity)
Most closely related reference virus: O/IRN/88/2009, serotype O,
topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2ANT-10 (97.34 per cent identity).

The current outbreak, which has affected, so far, one single farm (a
sentinel?), adjacent to the Jordan river and to the Kingdom of
Jordan's territory, has been caused by an FMD strain which has not
been recorded earlier in Israel. For earlier genotypes (such as
topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2, 2007-2008) please refer to
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/isr.htm.

The current PanAsia-2ANT-10 strain is known to be circulating in
Iran, Afghanistan, Turkey, and Bulgaria. It may be assumed that this
virus is currently widely disseminated within other countries in the
Middle and Near East.

As remarked earlier, Bet-Zera is situated in an area which maintains
an abundant wild boar population. Remarkably, the recent FMD outbreak
in Bulgaria, caused by the same virus strain, was initially detected
in a wild boar. FMDV-O circulation in wild boars has been recorded
several times in the past in northern Israel (see ProMED-mail 20070517.1571). It will be interesting to check for the possible
current circulation of FMD virus within wild boar populations along
the Jordan and the Yarmouk rivers in the territories of Israel, the
Kingdom of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Surveillance in livestock,
particularly small ruminants, within the region deserves to be
intensified. - Mod.AS
