V�s killed monkeys in Capibara Mountain National Park
-------------------------------------------------------
The Park, located 548km from Teresina [state capital] in the south of Piau�state, was closed to visitors last Friday [14 Dec 2007] because of the
deaths of 4 monkeys in a section called Serra Branca (White Mountain) which
is normally closed to visitors.
The cause of death was said by Romildo Mafra, Superintendent of Ibama
[Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources] in
Piaui, to be an unidentified virus. A team of veterinarians and researchers
from North Rio Grande state, the Center for the Protection of Primates in
Sao Paulo state, the Chico Mendes Institute, and the Carlos Chagas
Foundation, is on the spot trying to identify the cause of death, and
whether it poses a danger to humans. The Park receives on average 12 000
visitors a year.
