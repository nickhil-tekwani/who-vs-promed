Department of Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture,
GABORONE, Botswana

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 13 Jul 2008
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 29 Jul 2008
Report date: 5 Aug 2008
Date submitted to OIE 5 Aug 2008
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2006
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: SAT 2
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: Satau, Kasane, KASANE
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Jul 2008
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 3296 / 25 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Adult cattle were affected and showed oral and
feet vesicular lesions. Affected cattle are in a communal grazing
system sharing the same river watering points.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection
- Contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering
- Contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: A brought-in cow was the source of the
infection for the 2nd herd. The area has no resident African buffalos
(_Syncerus caffer_), but they may visit. Cattle share the same river
water with those of a neighbouring state. The affected cattle were
vaccinated in March 2008 with a trivalent SAT FMD vaccine.

Control measures
Measures applied
-Quarantine
-Movement control inside the country
-Zoning
-Vaccination in response to the outbreak (s):
Administrative division / Species / Total Vaccinated / Vaccine details
KASANE / Cattle / 14 099 / Inactivated Trivalent SAT 1,2,3 FMD vaccine
-Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
-No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Botswana Vaccine
Institute (OIE's Reference Laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / typing ELISA / 29 Jul 2008 / Positive

[This is the 1st FMD outbreak in the Kasane area since 2006. Kasane
is situated on Botswana's northern border, within the Chobe province,
bordering Caprivi (Namibia), and close to the territories of Zambia
and Zimbabwe, which are regarded as endemically FMD-infected. See map
at <http://www.mapsofworld.com/botswana/maps/botswana-map.jpg>.

In Botswana, much attention is paid to the control of FMD because
beef exports contribute significantly to the economy of the country.
Continued access to lucrative world markets is dependent on freedom
from diseases such as FMD and CBPP. The country enforces a strict
livestock disease control policy based on early detection and
effective response. Capable enforcement is, in turn, enabled by
effective disease control operating structures and programmes among
government authorities in conjunction with private interests. The
structures are made up of a disease control committee, an FMD alert
team, an FMD contingency plan and public awareness campaigns,
combined with bilateral collaboration with neighbouring countries.

The effective disease control and prevention programmes include
disease reporting, surveillance and monitoring, vaccination
activities, animal movement control, a permit system, veterinary
infrastructure and extension delivery services. FMD control in
Botswana is based on zoning. The disease control zones are divided
into 4 groups: FMD vaccination zones, FMD free zones, National Parks
and Game Reserves. The zones, recognised as free without vaccination,
are located mainly in the centre and southern parts of the country.

In 2002-03, however, the country experienced FMD outbreaks near the
Zimbabwe border that were successfully controlled through quick
action by central and local authorities. All previously affected
areas have since been restocked with cattle. A 10-km-wide
surveillance zone has been created along the border with countries
where FMD has been reported in recent times, and patrols have been
intensified. The height of cordon fences has been raised from 1.4
metres to 2.4 metres, and fences are now electrified. Cattle are
mouthed during the annual vaccination campaigns, and the disease
control committee reviews the situation regularly. Cloven-hoofed
animals are quarantined for at least 21 days before leaving their districts.

The newly infected Kasane Zone (No 1 in the map; see further) is one
of the non-exporting vaccination zones, similar to Maun (Zone 2C),
which has been reportedly infected with FMDV serotype SAT2 since
October 2007. The outbreak there has been recently (5 Aug 2008)
reported as resolved.

A comprehensive description of Botswana's FMD control system,
including -- on page 16 -- the map of the FMD control zones, showing
also the disease control fences, is available in ref 1.
