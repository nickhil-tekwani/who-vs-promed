BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy] case confirmed in Alberta
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a 6-year-old beef cow from
Alberta. No part of the animal's carcass entered the human food or
animal feed systems.

The animal's birth farm has been identified, and an investigation is
underway. The CFIA is tracing the animal's herdmates at the time of
birth and examining possible sources of infection. The age and
location of the infected animal are consistent with previous cases
detected in Canada.

This case was detected through the national BSE surveillance program,
which has been highly successful in demonstrating the low level of
BSE in Canada. The program continues to play an important role in
Canada's strategy to manage BSE.

Canada remains a Controlled Risk country for BSE, as recognized by
the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Accordingly, this
case should not affect exports of Canadian cattle or beef.

New mad cow case found in Canada
--------------------------------
A new case of mad cow disease was confirmed in Canada, its 14th case
since 2003.

Government inspectors say no part of the animal entered the human
food system. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says the
disease was found in a 6-year-old beef cow. The agency did not say
where the cow was born. The agency says it is tracing other cattle in
the herd and is trying to determine how the cow became infected with
the disease. They say the new case should not affect exports of
Canadian cattle or beef.

Mad cow disease causes spongy holes in the brain. In people, a rare
but fatal form of the disease has been linked to eating infected
tissue from cows.

The inspection agency has said a ban on using animal materials in
feed products has virtually eliminated the spread of BSE in Canada,
but it said a small number of mad cow cases are still expected to surface.

Another mad cow case confirmed
------------------------------
A 6-year-old beef cow was confirmed Friday [15 Aug 2008] as the 13th
case of mad cow disease in Alberta, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said.

It is the 14th confirmed case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
BSE, in Canada.

"At this point, it is too early to say how it could have been
infected," said Natalie Bragg, a veterinary program specialist with
the food inspection agency.

The cow was born, raised, and died on the same farm in northern
Alberta, Bragg said. The agency does not release specific locations
of infected animals. The animal was euthanized after it became sick.
A sample from the animal was tested twice and confirmed as carrying
BSE on Friday [15 Aug 2008].

The agency said no traces of BSE made it into either human or animal
food supplies. Bragg said the investigation is now focused on the
feed on the farm, including how it was transported and stored. The
animal was born after a 1997 ban on feed containing cattle or other
ruminant parts was introduced.

The agency is also tracking all other animals that were born within a
year, and on the same farm, as the dead cow.

Last month [July 2008], it was revealed that Alberta plans to test 50
per cent fewer cattle for BSE by stopping targeted tests of elderly
bovines or those without proper documentation. The step was taken
because animals that are 9 years old or older are far less likely to
contract the diseases, the Alberta government said. Between 2004 and
mid-2006, 54 per cent of cattle tested in the province were 9 years
or older. 2 of those cows tested positive.

Alberta tests up to 30 000 cattle a year, roughly half of the
national BSE monitoring.

Cattle industry officials downplayed the latest BSE discovery, saying
it should have little impact on their business, including
international beef exports. "So far there has been no major reaction
and no markets have closed, and that's because we have kept our
international clients educated," said Cam Daniels of Canada Beef
Export Federation.

Daniels regularly travels to Japan, China, Mexico, Macau, the Middle
East, and other places to talk to importers and distributors. "They
understand clearly the control measures we have in place, and they
know we're expecting more cases because we are working diligently to
find them," he said.

While everyone looks forward to the time when mad cow is eradicated
in Canada, some overseas clients view the climbing number of cases as
positive right now because it means our surveillance programs are
working, said Alberta Beef Producers spokeswoman Lori Creech. "They
prefer we find them, rather than in the words of Ralph Klein, 'Shoot,
shovel and shut up,' " she said.

"We are very transparent and open as a country. This latest case
doesn't affect our status in the world at all because it's not
unexpected that they would find another animal with BSE."

The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) lists Canada as a
controlled risk country for BSE.
