["Cattle of all ages are susceptible to infection with bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV). Distribution is worldwide although some countries have recently eradicated the virus. BVDV infection results in a wide variety of clinical manifestations, including enteric and respiratory disease in any class of cattle or reproductive and fetal disease following infection of a susceptible breeding female. Infection may be subclinical or extend to severe fatal disease. Animals that survive in-utero infection in the 1st trimester of gestation are almost always persistently infected (PI).

"PI animals provide the main reservoir of the virus in a population and excrete large amounts of virus in urine, faeces, discharges, milk, and semen. Identification of such PI cattle is a key element in controlling the infection. It is important to avoid the trade of such animals. They may appear clinically healthy, or weak and unthrifty. Many PI animals die before reaching maturity. They may infrequently develop mucosal disease with anorexia, gastrointestinal erosions, and profuse diarrhea, invariably leading to death. Mucosal disease can arise only in PI animals. Latent infections generally do not occur following recovery from acute infection. However, bulls may rarely have a persistent testicular infection and excrete virus in semen for prolonged periods."
