[2] Dengue virus neutralization
Date: Tue 30 Nov 2021
Source: Cell [edited]
https://bit.ly/3F5FCoS


Citation: Xin-Xiang Lim, Bo Shu, Shuijun Zhang, Aaron W K Tan, Thiam-Seng Ng, Xin-Ni Lim et al. Human antibody C10 neutralizes by diminishing Zika but enhancing dengue virus dynamics. Cell. 30 November 2021. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.11.009

Highlights
- Different mechanisms of dengue and Zika neutralization by monoclonal antibody C10
- C10 stabilizes Zika but enhances dynamics of dengue virions
- Dengue presents a dynamic, nonuniform epitope landscape for C10
- C10 elicits differential dynamics at various stoichiometric ratios

Summary
The human monoclonal antibody (HmAb) C10 potently cross-neutralizes Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus. Analysis of antibody fragment (Fab) C10 interactions with ZIKV and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) particles by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) shows that Fab C10 binding decreases overall ZIKV particle dynamics, whereas with DENV2, the same Fab causes increased dynamics. Testing of different Fab C10:DENV2 E protein molar ratios revealed that, at higher Fab ratios, especially at saturated concentrations, the Fab enhanced viral dynamics (detected by HDXMS), and observation under cryo-EM showed increased numbers of distorted particles. Our results suggest that Fab C10 stabilizes ZIKV but that with DENV2 particles, high Fab C10 occupancy promotes E protein dimer conformational changes leading to overall increased particle dynamics and distortion of the viral surface. This is the first instance of a broadly neutralizing antibody eliciting virus-specific increases in whole virus particle dynamics.

[The report in item 2 indicates that dengue viruses are neutralized not only by blockage of cell receptor attachment, but by distortion of the virus particle itself that interferes with cell attachment and entry. - Mod.TY]
