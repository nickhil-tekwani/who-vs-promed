A recent article published in Emerging Infectious Diseases is of
direct relevance to this and will be of interest to your subscribers.
It can be accessed on the EID website:

Karesh WB, Cook RA, Bennett EL, Newcomb J. Wildlife trade and global
disease emergence. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. July
2005 [date cited]. Available from

[Dr. Karesh is the director of the Wildlife Conservation Society's
Field Veterinary Program and is a co-chair of the World Conservation
Union Veterinary Specialist Group. The article abstract reads: "The
global trade in wildlife provides disease transmission mechanisms
that not only cause human disease outbreaks but also threaten
livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife
populations, and the health of ecosystems. Outbreaks resulting from
wildlife trade have caused hundreds of billions of dollars of
economic damage globally. Rather than attempting to eradicate
pathogens or the wild species that may harbor them, a practical
approach would include decreasing the contact rate among species,
including humans, at the interface created by the wildlife trade.
Since wildlife marketing functions as a system of scale-free networks
with major hubs, these points provide control opportunities to
maximize the effects of regulatory efforts."

Another website worth visiting in this regard, because it is only a
toss away from an illegal immigrant to an invasive species, is that
for the National Invasive Species Advisory Council
<http://www.invasivespecies.gov>,
which is a US government body made up of the Secretaries of the
relevant US Government Departments. It carries clout. The increasing
numbers of newspaper articles and TV documentaries on invasive
species come from its activities and hard working staff. - Mod.MHJ]
