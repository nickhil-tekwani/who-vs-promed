_Campylobacter spp._ infection is the leading cause of bacterial enteritis worldwide. The epidemiology of campylobacteriosis in developing countries differs substantially from that in industrialized countries. In many studies from the USA and other industrialized countries, _Campylobacter spp._ are among the most common bacterial causes of diarrhea (1), with an incidence of about 10 percent in persons with diarrhea. Reports from developing countries also suggest that _C. jejuni_ and _C. coli_ have been isolated mostly from patients with diarrheal illness (2). We investigated for the prevalence of campylobacteriosis in patients hospitalized with diarrhea at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Kolkata, India and their resistance patterns to different antimicrobial drugs.

During January 2008-December 2010, we screened 3186 fecal samples on brain-heart infusion agar with 5 percent defibrinated sheep blood and antimicrobial drugs (bacitracin, cycloheximide, colistin sulfate, cephazoline sodium, novobiocin) and incubated under microaerophillic environment (5 percent O2, 10 percent CO2, and 85 percent N2) at 37 C for 48 h. Each isolate was tested by Gram staining, cytochrome oxidase, and hippurate hydrolysis for presumptive identification and species-specific PCR (3) to identify 5 species from _Campylobacter_ genus. The overall isolation rate of _Campylobacter spp._ was about 7 percent (222/3186). Sole infection with _Campylobacter spp._ accounted for only 40 percent of cases; others were mixed infection. _C. jejuni_ was the predominant species (78 percent), with species _coli_, _fetus_, _lari_ and _upsaliensis_ isolated less frequently. _Campylobacter_ infection prevailed throughout the year, with no seasonality. The _C. jejuni_ isolation rate was significantly higher (10.0 percent; p less than 0.001) for children less than 5 years of age who had diarrhea than for persons in other age groups (3.7 percent). Although we used the culture method, which is the standard for screening fecal samples, some molecular methods, such as PCR and real-time PCR, are now used for screening _Campylobacter spp._from fecal samples on the Indian subcontinent (4,5). The results from molecular methods are showing more infection with _Campylobacter spp._ and high mixed infection cases and suggest the usefulness of molecular methods in combination with cultures.

Macrolides and fluoroquinolones generally are the 1st- and 2nd-line choices, respectively, of antimicrobial drugs for treating _Campylobacter_ enteritis. Since the late 1980s, resistance to these drugs has complicated treatment. In India, resistance of _Campylobacter spp._ to several antimicrobial drugs has been reported since the early 1990s (6). Fluoroquinolone resistance was not reported in 1994 but reached 79 percent during 2001-2006 (2). Likewise, ciprofloxacin resistance in _Campylobacter spp._ increased markedly in Dhaka, Bangladesh during 2005-2008 (7) and in Karachi, Pakistan during 1992-2002 (8). We tested 142 _C. jejuni_ isolates for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar with 5 percent sheep blood and incubated them at 37 C in microaerophillic environment for 48 h before obtaining results. All tested strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and most (97 percent) were resistant to quinolone (nalidixic acid) and fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin) (Figure [for figure, see original URL. - Mod. LL]). Approximately 26.1 percent and 17.6 percent of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline, respectively. Susceptibility to erythromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, furazolidone, and chloramphenicol was very high (greater than 97 percent) in most isolates. Multidrug resistance was frequent among many of the isolates: ampicillin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (19 percent); tetracycline, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (10.2 percent); and tetracycline, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (6.8 percent). These results indicate that macrolides may be useful for treating campylobacteriosis in this region.

The resistance patterns are influenced by various factors, possibly including pressure exerted by use of antimicrobial drugs. Various reports have stated that introduction of fluoroquinolones for use in veterinary practice has been associated with a dramatic rise in _Campylobacter_ strains showing resistance to these drugs (9). Increasing antimicrobial drug resistance limits the number of therapeutic options, which makes empirical treatment more difficult. Therefore, constant monitoring of _Campylobacter_ susceptibility to antimicrobial agents is essential. We could not detect any allele of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes (qnr) among _C. jejuni_ isolates and the different class of mobile genetic elements that generally carry the antimicrobial resistance gene cassettes. However, we found that most of the _C. jejuni_ isolates had a mutation in the quinolone-resistance determining region of gyrA (Thr-86 to Ile), which led the isolates to become resistant for quinolone and fluoroquinolones.

Recent microbiome analysis of the gut of a malnourished child residing in an urban slum in Kolkata showed 35 times more _Campylobacter_ bacteria than in a healthy child in the same setting (10). This finding suggests that intestinal inflammation may directly influence malabsorption of nutrients. Hence, it is essential to examine the effect of _Campylobacter_ infection in the developing world in the context of many recent developments in the human gut microbiome.

Human campylobacteriosis, a notifiable disease in Canada, is the most common cause of bacterial enteric infections among persons in Canada; in 2005, the incidence rate of campylobacteriosis was 30.9 cases per 100 000 population (1). In chickens, _Campylobacter spp._ are not clinically relevant; however, the presence of these bacteria in poultry represents a potential threat to public health (2).

Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, is indicated for the treatment of respiratory, urinary, skin, and bone/joint infections and gastroenteritis in adults (3). In 2008 in Canada, fluoroquinolones were the 4th most frequently dispensed class of antimicrobial drug (dispensed for oral use by retail pharmacists; http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cipars-picra/2008/4-eng.php#Hum0). A study investigating antimicrobial drug use and resistance in 2 health units in Ontario found that ciprofloxacin was the antimicrobial drug most frequently used to treat human campylobacteriosis (4).

Fluoroquinolones are considered "critically" or "very" important to human medicine by the World Health Organization (5) and the Veterinary Drugs Directorate (VDD), Health Canada (6). The veterinary fluoroquinolones enrofloxacin and danofloxacin are VDD Category I antimicrobial drugs labeled for use in companion animals and beef cattle, but they are not labeled for use in poultry. The VDD has established a policy recommending against the extra-label use of Category I antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals (7); however, Canada does not have legislation restricting this extra-label use.

The Study
---------
The Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS), Public Health Agency of Canada, collects samples of fresh chicken, beef, and pork from retail outlets in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritimes (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island) on a routine basis and cultures them for select bacteria. Retail food samples best reflect the level of consumer exposure to drug-resistant foodborne bacteria. Methods used for sample collection, culture, and antimicrobial drug-susceptibility testing are described in the CIPARS annual reports (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cipars-picra/2008/6-eng.php#Ant).

Up to and including 2010, _Campylobacter spp._ were isolated from retail chicken meat samples in the provinces of British Columbia (since 2007, 225 isolates/536 samples [42 percent]), Saskatchewan (since 2005, 276/884 [31 percent]), Ontario (since 2003, 845/2288 [37 percent]), Quebec (since 2003, 683/2215 [31 percent]), and the Maritimes (since 2008, 117/444 [26 percent]) (Table [For table, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). Temporal trends in ciprofloxacin resistance among _Campylobacter spp._ isolates are shown in the Figure [For figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL]. Since initiation of surveillance, prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance has significantly increased in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The highest recovery of ciprofloxacin-resistant _Campylobacter spp._ was in British Columbia in 2009 (28.6 percent, 22/77), when recovery of all _Campylobacter spp._ (52.7 percent, 77/146) was also highest.

Significant differences in prevalence between 2 periods were assessed by using chi squared tests. The increased trend in British Columbia seems more abrupt, especially from 2008 to 2009, relative to Saskatchewan, where the increase is relatively more gradual. Combined data from 2009-2010 showed that 23 percent (34/147) of _Campylobacter spp._ isolates from British Columbia and 13 percent (11/84) of isolates from Saskatchewan were resistant to ciprofloxacin, compared with 6 percent (5/78, p = 0.002) and 6 percent (11/192, p = 0.04) of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin in combined data before 2009 in British Columbia (2007-2008) and Saskatchewan (2005-2008), respectively. By comparison, in 2009-2010, the overall prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant _Campylobacter spp._ from retail chicken collected in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes has remained less than 3 percent (10/395), significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than the overall prevalence in British Columbia and Saskatchewan (19 percent, 45/231). The current prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in British Columbia and Saskatchewan is also higher than that reported by studies of antimicrobial drug resistance in _Campylobacter spp._ in Ontario (8) and Quebec (9).

Several factors contributing to the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance have been hypothesized and include antimicrobial drug use in broiler breeder and broiler chickens and importation of poultry products. Data for antimicrobial drug use in the poultry industry are not currently available. Fluoroquinolone use can select for ciprofloxacin resistance and result in the emergence and persistence of resistant _Campylobacter spp._ (10). Evidence indicates vertical transmission of fluoroquinolone-resistant _Campylobacter spp._ (11). Surveillance data from the USA showed the persistence of ciprofloxacin resistance, despite a 2005 ban on fluoroquinolone use in chickens (12). Ciprofloxacin resistance also persisted in broilers raised in Denmark after fluoroquinolone use decreased in 2006 (13). Current use of ciprofloxacin in US poultry is unknown. However, in Denmark, use in few broiler breeders has been reported (13). It is plausible that fluoroquinolone use in breeder and broiler chickens could explain the generation and maintenance of ciprofloxacin resistance.

Another antimicrobial drug-use practice might play a role in ciprofloxacin resistance. Tetracyclines are labeled for use in broiler chickens. Across the regions sampled by CIPARS, a high proportion (64 percent) of ciprofloxacin-resistant _Campylobacter_ isolates were also resistant to tetracycline. Although the prevalence rates for ciprofloxacin and tetracycline resistance were quite different, the resistance trends in British Columbia and Saskatchewan were strikingly similar in shape. Tetracycline resistance was significantly associated with ciprofloxacin resistance in isolates from British Columbia and Saskatchewan (odds ratio 3.04; 95 percent CI 1.70-5.48; p less than 0.001) but not in those from the eastern part of the country (odds ratio 0.99; 95 percent CI 0.54-1.38; p = 0.951). A similar phenomenon has recently been noted among _Campylobacter spp._ recovered from domestically raised and imported broiler chickens in Denmark (13).

We currently have no explanation for this observation; gyrA mutation and overexpression of the multidrug-resistant efflux pump CmeABC (14), as a result of exposure to ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin/tetracycline, respectively, might have played a role. Molecular investigations of organisms isolated from retail chicken by CIPARS have yet to be conducted.

Another factor to consider is the importation of poultry products. CIPARS collects raw, fresh (never frozen) chicken primarily produced and distributed in Canada. It is possible that a small proportion of the fresh retail meat sampled originated in other countries, but the volume of imported meat (about 75 tons [167 million pounds] or 7.5 percent of the previous year's production [15]) is unlikely to explain the regional increase in _Campylobacter spp._ resistance. Furthermore, importation of meat is not restricted to only British Columbia and Saskatchewan. According to trade agreements, about 141 million chicks/eggs (about 21.1 percent of the previous year's grown broiler production) are imported annually from the USA. These imported broiler chicks/eggs might be an additional source of drug-resistant subtype introduction into the Canadian poultry production system. To evaluate the prevalence of resistance in domestically raised flocks, the CIPARS abattoir component added _Campylobacter spp._ surveillance in chickens in 2010. From this surveillance, 4/111(4 percent) isolates from domestically raised chicken ceca were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 3 from British Columbia, and one from the Maritimes, confirming the potential domestic origin of these strains in retail chicken.

Conclusion
----------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is concerned by the emergence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, which is critically important for treatment of _Campylobacter spp._ infection in humans. Extra-label use of fluoroquinolones in the broiler breeder or broiler chicken sectors might have contributed to the emergence of this resistance. The role of importation of poultry products as a potential source of resistant strains requires further investigation. The broiler industry is collaborating with CIPARS to create a farm surveillance program, which would capture data on antimicrobial drug use and resistance.

Veterinary fluoroquinolones are not labeled for use in poultry in Canada. The VDD policy recommends against the extra-label use of Category I antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals. More research is required to assess mechanisms responsible for the trends observed for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin resistance. Furthermore, genotyping of isolates from humans and chickens (retail and/or abattoir) from British Columbia and Saskatchewan is required to determine whether strains are epidemiologically related.

[The increased resistance to antimicrobial agents in strains of _Campylobacter_ are of concern in the treatment of human campylobacteriosis for sure. Fortunately, most cases of clinical campylobacteriosis in humans are self-limited enteritides. The overuse of antimicrobial agents in human medicine and as food supplements in animal husbandry certainly are factors contributing to this problem. - Mod.LL
