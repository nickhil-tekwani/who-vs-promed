Yikes! I made an error in the post on Balclutha horse syndrome. Horses
are not thought to be susceptible to foot and mouth disease. That
should not have been included in the list of differential diagnoses.
Primarily cloven-hoofed animals are susceptible and few lab
animals [sucking mice and guinea pigs - Mod.PC.

[Since this disease is in horses there is definitely minuscule chance of it
being foot and mouth disease. The high level of concern for any vesicular
disease is always that it might be foot and mouth disease. If FMD were
introduced in the U.S would cost some 1 billion dollars in the first year
alone. There has been great progress eradicating this disease in South
America. Introduction in places like Argentina, Chile or the historically
free regions of Central America would indeed be very costly. The fourth
vesicular disease of domestic animals not mentioned in these posting is
swine vesicular disease. The viral agents associated with these diseases
are not closely related but the clinical symptoms are indistinguishable in
susceptible species and can only be definitively diagnosed with laboratory
investigations. - Mod.PC

Dr. Donoghue wrote "Horses presented with oral ulcerations could have
vesicular stomatitis, foot and mouth disease or vesicular exanthema, but
not equine herpes. Any of these could have serious repercussions in New
Zealand!"
Horses may indeed get vesicular stomatitis but are definitely not affected
by FMD. Only experimental infection with some strains vesicular exanthema
of swine virus has led to disease in horses (Blood and Henderson).
Many ProMED-mail subscribers are not formally trained in medical subjects.
Messages like this one may lead to false conceptions. I strongly suggest
either editing or comment from the moderators prior to posting.
ProMED-mail is the greatest thing that has happened lately, but as the number
of participants increase it is becoming more difficult to distinguish
facts from fiction.

[Several people caught this error including the author herself. We
appreciate the nice words and take the criticism to heart, our subscribers
should be aware of the fact that ProMED-mail is literally run by handful of
people who have other full time jobs. We are clearly human with all our
fallibilities definitely intact. It is for this reason that we welcome,
encourage and depend on the fact that subscribers correct the record, as
has happened here. In fact, ProMED-mail is more authoritative because we
know that if something slips by one the moderators it is highly unlikely
that it will slip all our subscribers. To paraphrase another expression:
you can fool the moderators some of the time but you can't fool all our
subscribers most of the time. Until further information from New Zealand
comes in this string is cut. - Mod.PC
