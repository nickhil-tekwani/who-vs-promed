Presence of Monkeypox Virus in Imported Rodents Confirmed
-------------------------------------------------
Federal health officials confirmed on Wed 2 Jul 2003 the presence of
monkeypox virus in 6 African rodents that were part of a shipment of
animals imported to the U.S. on 9 Apr 2003. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) is confident that this shipment is the
source of the current U.S. outbreak of monkeypox. As a result, the
agency is recommending the quarantine and euthanasia of all animals
from the shipment, as well as prairie dogs from the U.S. that were
exposed to the imported species or to other animals suspected of
having monkeypox.
Pet prairie dogs are believed to be the main source of the human
monkeypox outbreak that emerged in the U.S. last month. "The goal is
to protect people, pets and wildlife in the United States, by
preventing the monkeypox virus from spreading or becoming established
permanently," the CDC's Dr. Martin Cetron said in a statement.
The CDC previously recommended quarantine of animals infected or
exposed to monkeypox. The new recommendations call for euthanizing
these animals. "These measures are essential in order to effectively
address this public health issue," Cetron said. "This truly
collaborative effort requires the support of public health officials,
the pet industry, and pet owners to successfully contain this
outbreak."
As of Tue 1 Jul 2003, the CDC was investigating 81 suspect or
probable human cases of monkeypox -- 39 in Wisconsin, 22 in Indiana,
16 in Illinois, 2 in Missouri, and one each from Kansas and Ohio. 32
human cases have been laboratory-confirmed. Wisconsin has the highest
number of lab-confirmed cases at 14, followed by Illinois with 8,
Indiana with 7, Kansas with 2, and Missouri with one.

Update: Multistate Outbreak of Monkeypox --- Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, 2003
CDC and state and local health departments continue to investigate
cases of monkeypox among persons who had contact with wild or exotic
mammalian pets or persons with monkeypox (1--3). This report updates
epidemiologic, laboratory, and smallpox vaccine use data for U.S.
cases, and summarizes the laboratory-based evidence implicating
imported African rodents as the probable source of the outbreak.
As of 2 Jul 2003, a total of 81 cases of monkeypox have been reported
to CDC from Wisconsin (39), Indiana (22), Illinois (16), Missouri
(2), Kansas (one), and Ohio (one) (Figure); these include 32 (40
percent) cases laboratory-confirmed at CDC and 49 (60 percent)
suspect and probable cases under investigation. One case was excluded
from those reported in the previous update because it met the
exclusion criteria outlined in the updated case definition, and 3
were added (3). Of the 81 cases, 43 (53 percent) were among females;
the median age was 27 years (range: 1--51 years). Age data were
unavailable for one patient. Among 78 patients for whom data were
available, 19 (24 percent) were hospitalized. The previously reported
child with painful adenopathy associated with diffuse pox lesions
improved clinically and was discharged from the hospital after 6 days
(3). Confirmatory testing of skin rash lesions at CDC was positive
for monkeypox virus.
Of the 81 reported cases, 31 have been laboratory confirmed at CDC
for monkeypox by detection of virus in skin rash lesions by using
culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemical
testing, and/or electron microscopy; one case was confirmed by virus
isolation and PCR testing of an oropharyngeal specimen. The number of
confirmed cases by state includes Wisconsin (14), Indiana (7),
Illinois (8), Missouri (2), and Kansas (one). For these
laboratory-confirmed cases, the onset of illness ranged from 16 May
to 20 Jun 2003. All confirmed patients reported a rash, and all but
one reported at least one other clinical sign or symptom, including
fever, respiratory symptoms, and/or lymphadenopathy. The median
incubation period* was 12 days (range: 1--31 days). The majority of
patients with confirmed monkeypox reported exposure to wild or exotic
mammals, including prairie dogs; some patients also had contact with
other persons with monkeypox virus infection in a household setting.
No cases of monkeypox that could be attributed exclusively to
person-to-person contact have been confirmed.
Use of Smallpox Vaccine
To prevent further transmission of monkeypox, 28 residents of 6
states have received smallpox vaccine since 13 Jun 2003; recipients
included 26 adults and 2 children. Vaccine was administered to 2
laboratory workers and 2 health-care workers pre-exposure and to 24
persons post-exposure (10 health-care workers, 7 household contacts,
3 laboratory workers, 2 public health veterinarians, one public
health worker, and one work contact). One child vaccinated
post-exposure had a rash 6 days after vaccination; PCR testing of
skin lesions from the child was positive for monkeypox virus. The
child lived in a household with 2 ill prairie dogs and an adult with
laboratory-confirmed monkeypox virus infection. One prairie dog had
been present in the household for approximately 1 year and became ill
after the introduction of a second ill prairie dog into the home. The
child's period of exposure began 25 days before vaccination, when the
ill prairie dog was brought into the home; the child's rash began 12
days after the onset of rash illness in the adult household member.
Animal Laboratory Testing
Traceback investigations have implicated a shipment of animals from
Ghana that was imported to Texas on 9 Apr 2003 as the probable source
of introduction of monkeypox virus into the United States (1,2). The
shipment contained approximately 800 small mammals of 9 different
species, including 6 genera of African rodents. These rodent genera
included rope squirrels (Funiscuirus sp.), tree squirrels
(Heliosciurus sp.), Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys sp.), brushtail
porcupines (Atherurus sp.), dormice (Graphiurus sp.), and striped
mice (Hybomys sp.). Gambian rats from this shipment were kept in
close proximity to prairie dogs at an Illinois animal vendor
implicated in the sale of infected prairie dogs.
CDC laboratory testing of some animals by using PCR and virus
isolation demonstrated that one Gambian giant rat, 3 dormice, and 2
rope squirrels from the 9 Apr 2003 importation were infected with
monkeypox virus. Evaluation of other animals associated with the
shipment is ongoing. Evidence of infection was found in some animals
that had been separated from the rest of the shipment on the day of
their arrival into the United States, indicating early and possibly
widespread infection among the remaining animals in the shipment. The
laboratory investigation confirmed that multiple animal species are
susceptible to infection with monkeypox virus.
CDC had recommended previously that state health officials place
quarantines on commercial facilities or households that had infected
animals or received African rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment (1).
CDC has issued guidance on the quarantine and euthanasia of all
rodents from the shipment, as well as prairie dogs that were exposed
to the imported rodents or other animals with illnesses consistent
with the case definition for monkeypox.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/quarantineremoval.htm>
Animals that are euthanized according to the guidance should be
incinerated and not buried in a landfill or backyard setting.
CDC and the Food and Drug Administration issued a joint order on 11
Jun 2003 prohibiting the importation of any African rodent. In
addition, the order prohibits the sale and transport within the
United States of prairie dogs and 6 genera of African rodents.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/pdf/embargo.pdf>
To prevent the spread of monkeypox virus into domestic or wild animal
populations, the order also prohibits releasing any of these animals
into the wild. State and local health departments or departments of
agriculture should be consulted for guidance on the safe disposal of
animals. The joint order remains in effect regardless of the actions
related to the guidance for quarantine and euthanasia of animals of
concern.
Health-care providers, veterinarians, and public-health officials who
suspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to
their state and local health departments. State health departments
should report suspect cases to CDC, telephone 770-488-7100. An
updated case definition with revised case exclusion criteria is
available:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/index.htm>
Clinical specimens should be submitted for testing after consultation
with the state and local health department. Interpretation of
laboratory results requires completion of specimen submission forms,
which are available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/diagspecimens.htm>.
