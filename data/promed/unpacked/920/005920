Epidemiological comments: causal agent was highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus serotype H5N1, as confirmed by Veterinary Research
Institute.
Stamping out (1-km-radius zone around the index case) and
disinfection started on 6 Jun 2007, and were completed on 10 Jun
2007. The total number of birds culled was 4127, consisting of
village chickens (63.17 percent), fighting cocks (16.89 percent),
ducks (2.43 percent), quails (1.89 percent), and other birds (15.62
percent).
Clinical and laboratory surveillance is ongoing in the surveillance
zone (10-km-radius zone around the index case). Similarly,
surveillance in the whole country is also ongoing.
Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Veterinary Research Institute, Ipoh
(National laboratory)
Species: birds
Test: real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR)
Test date: 5 Jun 2007

[The location of the outbreak is in the middle of the peninsular
section of Malaysia can be seen at the WAHIS (World Animal Health
Information System) OIE report site referenced above. Of interest in
the follow-up report is that fighting cocks were almost 17 percent of
the culls in this clean up or "stamping out" campaign. I wonder what
density of fighting cocks in a population constitutes an excess risk
for ongoing transmission. - Mod.PC]
