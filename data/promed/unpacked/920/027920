Barely 2 weeks after a Bea Mountain [Mining Corporation, BMMC] truck crashed -- spilling ammonium nitrate in [Small Bomi] roadside village in Grand Cape Mount county -- residents of the town are now experiencing different illnesses whose signs are consistent with the inhalation of the dangerous chemical, an investigation by The DayLight has found.

This reporter observed villagers coughing, while others spoke of running stomach [diarrhea?] severe headache, chest pain, eye irritation dry throat, and swollen feet. Some of the sick people we interviewed said they were directly involved in the cleaning of the chemical from the village. Eyewitnesses said townsmen who helped clear the area after the chemical spillage, were not issued protective gear.

"I am feeling as if one side of my head is bursting. I am also feeling severe pain in my eyes and in my throat," [DK], a resident of Small Bomi, said through an interpreter. "I can barely sleep at night because of the continued coughing.

"I saw the white dusty smoke with people shouting all around the big car [truck]. I ran to my house and realized the smoke had taken over my entire room," Kawa said.

According to Zwannah Zoduah, town chief of Small Bomi, 36 villagers have fallen sick, "I was in Monrovia when it happened but, I came and joined my people, and we all have started coughing seriously," he said. The sick include women, children, and the elderly, this reporter observed.

An elderly woman said she suffered irritation in her eyes after the car [truck] crashed with ammonium nitrate onboard in her village.

Used as an explosive and fertilizer, ammonium nitrate can affect humans. People who come in close contact with the chemical can experience a burning sensation on the skin and in the eyes. Other symptoms include irritation of the nose, throat, and lungs, studies showed. High-level inhalation of the substance can lead to severe headaches, fatigue, blue color to the skin and lips, and even death.

Villagers in Small Bomi are now showing most of these symptoms, nearly 3 weeks after they participated in clearing the chemical from their town.

Bea Mountain said it would issue a statement on the development on Wednesday [23 Mar 2022]. "We have done our own assessment of the situation and management is expected to make a statement soon," said Henry Vincent, community relations superintendent of Bea Mountain Mining Corporation.

On Sat 19 Feb 2022, a truck carrying the company's explosives crashed in the Small Bomi village, spilling 26 tons [about 57 320 lb] of ammonium nitrate. The truck, marked "TR-007," was transporting the chemical from Buchanan, Grand Bassa, to the company's Liberty Goldmine in Kinjor, nearly 2 kilometers [1.2 mi] away from the scene of the crash. The consignment was part of 5000 metric tons [about 11 million lb] of chemical compound shipped to Liberia by KAPEKS, Bea Mountain's Turkish supplier.

Following the incident, authorities at the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency], the agency which oversees the transportation of chemical materials had said the spillage was "unlikely to cause any adverse environmental or health risk to the residents of the Small Bomi community." The agency denied the current condition of the villagers was connected to the spillage of the chemical.

"The agency, therefore, submits the alleged symptoms presented by the patients...are completely unrelated to the [19 Feb 2022] ammonium nitrate accident," EPA said in a statement to The DayLight on Friday [18 Mar 2022].

Ammonium nitrate can have both long and short-term effects on people, according to experts. The short-term effect may happen immediately or shortly after exposure. The long-term may last for months or years.

The situation in Small Bomi has claimed the attention of health authorities in the area. Doctors at the Sinje Health Center became concerned after they found no evidence of common cold, typhoid, and malaria -- the most common sicknesses they treat in that area -- after examining 2 villagers. It prescribed multivitamins, paracetamol, chloramphenicol, and amoxicillin for 2 patients, according to the prescriptions seen by us.

"After physical examination of the patients, I found out that their condition is stable," said Daniel Kofa, Medical Director of the Sinje Health Center, announcing the county health team was to shortly conduct an assessment of the situation.

"Given the history of the patients, we have alerted the county health team on this matter. It is a community matter which has drawn interest," Kofa said.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called for calm after a truck carrying tons of ammonium nitrate, a deadly chemical substance, crashed when it veered off the road in Sinje district.

EPA, at a press conference yesterday [22 Feb 2022] called on the public to [not] panic as its scientists and other technicians have since put the situation under control and the chemical no longer poses danger to human lives and the environment.

The truck, belonging to gold mining company Bea Mountain [Mining Corporation, BMMC], departed the port city of Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, in the early hours of Saturday morning [19 Feb 2022], carrying 26 metric tons (22 bags) of the chemical to the company's New Liberty Gold Mines.

Ammonium nitrate, which is one of the world's most widely used fertilizers -- is also the main component in many types of mining explosives, where it's mixed with fuel oil and detonated by an explosive charge. While ammonium nitrate might be good, it is deadly as occurred on 4 Aug 2020, when the Lebanese capital Beirut experienced a massive explosion caused by more than 2700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate improperly stored near the city's cargo port.

At high enough temperatures, however, ammonium nitrate can violently decompose on its own. This process creates gases including nitrogen oxides and water vapor. It is this rapid release of gases causing an explosion.

The incident occurred along the Small Bomi Community, a town located after Sinje, approximately 3 Kilometers [about 2 mi] from the Daniel Town laterite road, which leads to the mines. It happened over the weekend [19-20 Feb 2022].

The truck, with registration number TR-007, driven under the fleet of Sayminee Transport Services, a registered chemical transporter, accidentally veered off the left side of the road about 75 meters along the drainage and hit an embankment causing the vehicle to tip over.

"The tip over resulted into a spill of about 10 metric tons [about 22 000 lb] of ammonium nitrate at the top of the embankment," said EPA Executive Director Wilson Tarpeh.

"The Agency immediately dispatched a team of technicians to assess the situation, engage the community, record environmental data, and supervise the recovery process," he said. This was after being alerted by EPA technicians, assigned to the Joint Security Team escorting the chemical convoy, notified the Agency about the incident. An emergency response team from the entity arrived onsite 4 hours after the incident. "This is to show how effective our level of response to the crisis is," he said.

EPA Assistant Manager for Environmental Research and Radiation Safety Laboratory, Rafael Sarji Ngumbu, disclosed the site of the spillage has been cleaned since.

He said the team had a town hall meeting with the community and explained the incident management system -- allaying public fear and providing an overview of ammonium nitrate.

"After the town hall meeting, the EPA recorded environmental quality data and supervised the complete cleanup of the spill by the Bea Mountain Mining [Corporation's] Environmental Team," he disclosed, noting the EPA certifies no residue of ammonium nitrate remained after the cleanup process.

"No water sources were observed within 10 meters radius of the area and the incident is unlikely to cause any adverse environmental or health risk to residents of the Small Bomi Community," Ngumbu said.

No casualty has been reported, but the driver of the truck, Mr Raymond S Howard, is reported to be in a critical condition after sustaining multiple injuries to the head, right arm, and left leg. He is undergoing treatment at the St Timothy Hospital in Robertsport. The incident also caused substantial damage to the cabin of the truck.

The agency has, however, dispelled reports the substance was illegally imported into the country.

"The EPA also clarifies Bea Mountain Mining [Corporation] and its supplier, KAPEKS, complied with all guidelines governing the importation, transport, handling, and storage of the current consignment of 5000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate," Tarpeh noted.

"BMMC and KAPEKS also obtained all documents required to meet full compliance (Ministry of Mines and Energy Clearance: RL/MME/GEM/018/2022/RL; Ministry of Justice Clearance: FMD/M-AG/MOJ/039/2022/RL; EPA Clearance: ED/EPA-01/00298/22/RL)."

He added during the transportation of the ammonium nitrate from Buchanan to New Liberty Gold Mine, the Joint Security Team (MOJ [Ministry of Justice], MME [Ministry of Mines & Energy], and EPA) provided escort for each convoy.

"We remain committed to working with all stakeholders, both public and private, to ensure the environment remains safe at all times," he said, "the Agency reassures the public of its inalienable commitment to ensuring a clean, healthy and safe environment for this and succeeding generations.

Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound. It is a white crystalline solid consisting of ions of ammonium and nitrate. It is highly soluble in water. Predominantly, it is used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer and also to carry on explosions in mining activity.

[Those individuals cleaning up the fertilizer material may have had a prolonged exposure, especially to dust, which may cause more prolonged inhalation of the ammonium nitrate and more eye exposure. There is no mention of protective eye or respiratory gear. Nitrates cause vasodilation by being converted to nitrites and eventually to nitric oxide. The toxicity of nitrates is due to in vivo (within the body) conversion to nitrites. Excessive vasodilation may cause hypotension and hypoperfusion. Nitrates are potent oxidizers and can produce methemoglobinemia and hemolysis.

Many questions come to mind. Did the company consider the conversion of nitrate to nitrite? Did the company provide measures to protect the respiratory system from the likely high concentration of the dust? What about eye protection? Did they provide medical follow up for these individuals? The unusual symptom is swollen feet. Were the individuals helping barefoot? Prolonged contact on the soles of the feet may have caused a reaction? Perhaps this product was not ammonium nitrate but a different product or there was a contaminant in the ammonium nitrate?

"What is ammonium nitrate?
Ammonium nitrate is an odorless, colorless or white, crystal salt produced by the reaction of ammonia and nitric acid.

"How is ammonium nitrate used?
Ammonium nitrate is an important component of many fertilizer mixtures. It provides a source of nitrogen to plants, which increases growth and crop yields. Small quantities of ammonium nitrate are also sold as an additive for mining explosives and other nonagricultural uses.

"What are the potential hazards?
Under normal handling conditions, ammonium nitrate is not harmful. However, inhalation of high concentrations of ammonium nitrate dust can cause respiratory tract irritation. Symptoms may include coughing, sore throat, shortness of breath, or even suffocation. When swallowed in high concentrations, ammonium nitrate may cause headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, weakness, a tingling sensation, heart and circulation irregularities, convulsions, collapse, and suffocation. Ammonium nitrate forms a mild acid when mixed with water. This acid can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and skin.

"Is ammonium nitrate flammable or explosive?
Ammonium nitrate rating is non flammable, a fire from ammonium nitrate is very unlikely, but it is a strong oxidizing agent that can cause combustible materials (such as wood, paper, and oil) to ignite. Only under extreme conditions of heat and pressure in a confined space will ammonium nitrate explode. Should such an incident occur, there may be a visible cloud of ammonia, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

"What are the emergency response procedures?
In the event of a spill or accidental discharge, the fire department will collect the spilled solid in suitable containers for reuse or disposal.

"What should you do if you are exposed to ammonium nitrate?
"For eye contact:
1. Check for and remove contact lenses.
2. Immediately flush eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, keeping eyelids open.
3. Obtain medical attention if irritation persists.

"For skin contact:
4. Wash irritated skin with soap and water.
5. Dry and cover skin with a good quality dermatologic skincare lotion.
6. If irritation persists, seek medical attention.

"For minor inhalation:
1. Loosen tight clothing.
2. Rest in a well-ventilated area.
3. Obtain medical attention if irritation or symptoms persist.

"For severe inhalation:
4. Use proper respiratory protection to evacuate affected individuals to a safe area as soon as possible.
5. Loosen tight clothing around the neck and waist.
6. Administer oxygen if breathing is difficult.
7. Perform artificial respiration if not breathing.
8. Obtain immediate medical attention.

"For ingestion:
9. If conscious, drink several glasses of water or milk and induce vomiting
10. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.
11. Lower the head so that the vomit will not reenter the mouth and throat.
12. Obtain medical attention.

"What should you do in the event of a local or regional spill?
-Follow any special instructions given over the radio, TV, or by someone in authority
-If there is a fire or explosion, stay away from the site. Follow marked emergency routes or directions from police to travel to your destination.

"If there has been a release of toxic vapors follow these steps:
1. Go indoors immediately and close all doors, windows, and openings.
2. Turn on your radio or television to a local news station. (Be prepared to wait a few minutes for news.)
3. Follow any special instructions given over the radio or television, or by someone in authority.
4. Shut off all air conditioning units, fans, ventilation systems, and clothes dryers. In winter, turn your furnace to its lowest setting.
5. Evacuate only if advised to do so by local authorities.

"You may wish to:
1. Place wet towels at the base of doors or breathe through damp towels.
2. Bring in pets if they are nearby and easily found.
Unless you are told to do so by authorities:
- Do not evacuate or travel.
- Do not bring home children from school, or other family members from work.
- Do not call 911 or any other authority for information. Keep your telephone line free.

"When you have been advised of an ALL CLEAR, open your house to let it air out by opening windows and doors across from each other to create cross ventilation."
