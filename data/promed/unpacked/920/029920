Indonesia: avian influenza situation - WHO update 35
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an additional 4 cases of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Of these cases 2 were
fatal. There is no evidence of an epidemiological link between the cases.

The 1st case, a 31 year old woman from East Jakarta, Jakarta Province,
developed symptoms on 18 Jan [2008], was hospitalized on 22 Jan, and is
currently in hospital. The investigation indicated that she visited a wet
market where live poultry are sold 3 days prior to symptom onset.

The 2nd case, a 9 year old boy from Depok Municipality, West Java,
developed symptoms on 16 Jan 2008, was hospitalized on 23 Jan 2008, and
died on 27 Jan 2008. Investigations into the source of his infection
indicate that the case lived next door to a wet market where live poultry
are sold.

The 3rd case, a 32 year old man from Tangerang Municipality, Banten
Province, developed symptoms on 17 Jan 2008, was hospitalized on 24 Jan
2008, and is currently in hospital. Investigations into the source of his
infection are ongoing.

[2] Indonesia: 101st death

Indonesian dies of bird flu, source remains unknown
---------------------------------------------------
A 32 year old Indonesian man who had tested positive for bird flu has died,
a health ministry official said on Wednesday [30 Jan 2008], adding the
authorities are still investigating the source of infection. The man, from
Tangerang west of Jakarta, died on Tue 29 Jan 2008 at Jakarta's
Persahabatan hospital, said Toto Haryanto from the ministry's bird flu centre.

His death takes the country's toll from the H5N1 bird flu virus to 101.
Initially, the authorities suspected the man had contracted the virus from
pet doves kept in his neighbourhood, but subsequent tests revealed the
birds and other fowl in the neighbourhood were H5N1-free. "It's a big
mystery that has yet to be solved," said Zulkarnain Hassan from the
agricultural ministry's bird flu control unit tasked with investigating the
source of infection. "There are 3 out of 4 people who died of bird flu this
week whose virus source remains unknown," Hassan told Reuters.

The country's death toll hit 100 on Monday [28 Jan 2008] when 2 separate
laboratory tests confirmed a 23 year old woman from East Jakarta and a 9
year old boy from the capital's outskirts had died of bird flu. The source
of infection in both cases is still unknown. The number of bird flu deaths
has spiked recently, with 6 people dying of the virus in January [2008].
Emil Agustiono, a top national bird flu committee official, said the recent
surge in cases was caused by a combination of several factors, including
poor sanitation and wet weather. "The virus is happy when it's wet. It
thrives during the rainy season ... combine that with poor sanitation and
lack of awareness. The people in the slums are at greater risk," Agustiono
told Reuters.

Contact with sick birds is the most common way of contracting the virus,
which is endemic in poultry populations in most of Indonesia. Fighting bird
flu has been difficult in Indonesia as millions of backyard fowl live in
close proximity to humans, while health education campaigns have often been
patchy and rules difficult to enforce. Not including the latest death, bird
flu has killed 223 people in a dozen [14 - Mod.CP] countries since the
virus reappeared in Asia in late 2003, according to World Health
Organization data.
