Dr. D.A. Henderson and I have been chatting back and forth about
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). As always, he had a number of questions and
comments and, as always, I could not answer them. Here is what he said,
modified slightly by me as follows:
"It seems to me that with the enormous increase in movement of people and
animals that takes place, the concept of controlling FMD by the elaborate
rituals to assure FMD free countries is no longer tenable or appropriate.
What is wrong with a vaccination program?
The cost per animal is surely not a limiting factor. The vaccine has to
match a prevalent or likely-to-be-prevalent strain. We do this now with
influenza. Is anyone investing significant effort to develop a more broadly
antigenic vaccine?
I've always thought that the present approaches to FMD are antiquated but
the implications of pursuing the present strategy look to me to be
absolutely devastating."
My sentiments exactly. No matter what the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses says (i.e., that there is one FMD virus species and 7
serotypes of that single virus species), any of 7 viruses can cause FMD. It
may be taxonomically sound to consider 7 viruses that do not cross-protect
against each other as representing a single species, but it is
counterproductive in practical terms. For example, if one immunizes against
one serotype and then challenges the animal with that serotype and the
animal withstands that challenge, that animal must be immune to that
serotype. If one then challenges that animal with another serotype and that
animal succumbs to infection with the second serotype, how can anyone say
that the two serotypes are the same virus? Same species, sure, but not the
same virus.
Given the broad and remarkable advances in modern studies of viral
molecular genetics, why is it not possible to clone a conserved portion
(possessed by all these viruses, else they would not be so closely related)
of the genome of these viruses and prepare a vaccine against any and all of
them? We ask this simply because we do not know the answer. Present
vaccination programs appear to be based on vaccination against the specific
serotype circulating in one place at one time. Surely topotypic variations
cannot make much of a difference with respect to application of a vaccine
comprised of a broadly cross-reactive antigen, one that would protect
against all serotypes. Alternatively, if a DNA vaccine has not been
considered, now would be the time to do so.
It is my own opinion/observation that research into the intricacies of FMD
and the viruses that cause it likely has been inhibited by economics
constraints as much as by intellectual ones. Markets for illegal sales of
livestock is a world-wide problem. Hypocritical functionaries who look the
other way when cattle are slaughtered or moved from their country to
another country and slaughtered there, who look the other way when beef
carcasses are moved by train, in broad daylight, from country to country,
are known to function with impunity in the name of national sovereignty.
Few countries are willing to stick their noses into the affairs of another
country. So, disgusting traditions continue without hope for abatement and
maintenance of "markets" are the sine qua non of the industry and of
political goals.
Perhaps there is a need for a W.H.O.-type organization for livestock. Not
an organization that counts bodies but a proactive organization, one that
will send people to the problem area and assist the local authorities in
making decisions and in taking actions.
The situation in England, and now elsewhere, is no different from the
situations faced by other countries in other times. Is this story destined
to be told again and again and again? Checking the shoes of walkers just
does not seem to be the most enlightened of techniques for control of a
disease, particularly when modern molecular methods are practically
screaming to be applied. We ought all to reread Santayana.
