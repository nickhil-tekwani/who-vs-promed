'Panama disease' found in Mindanao banana farm
----------------------------------------------
A devastating disease that targets banana plants has been spotted in
a portion of Central Mindanao region, the regional Department of
Agriculture admitted. Pepito S. Leysa, chief of the Agriculture
department's Regional Crop Protection Center (RCPC), said that
visible manifestations of panama disease, or fusarium wilt, were
discovered in a 3-hectare lakatan banana plantation in Alabel,
Sarangani. Lakatan is a banana variety.

The banana varieties susceptible to panama disease are latundan,
senorita and lakatan. Cavendish banana has succumbed to the new
strain (race 4) of the disease. Saba or cardaba, on the other hand,
is a resistant cultivar, the statement added.

Panama disease was 1st reported in the Philippines in 1920 on
latundan variety in Los Banos and Calamba, Laguna, and in
municipalities of Batangas. It was confirmed in commercial Cavendish
farms in 1974 and 1979. The pathogen ended up totally destroying 13
hectares of latundan farms in Eden, Toril in Davao City.

Aside from panama disease, the affected banana farm was also infested
by the banana bunchy top virus, moko and sigatoka diseases, Mr. Leysa
said. It was the 1st time that crop protection experts confirmed the
presence of the devastating panama disease in Central Mindanao
region. The region hosts at least 3 large banana producers.

[2] Control measures

Re: control of panama disease
-----------------------------
The problem with rotation as a disease control measure is that it
does not work with some soilborne pathogens such as panama wilt
because the pathogen will persist in the soil for at least 20 years.
Not many farmers can wait that long between cycles.

So a more proactive approach is needed. We are combining 4 discrete
treatments into an integrated control programme:

1. a beneficial endophyte applied to fresh tissue cultured plants;

2. a _Trichoderma harzianum_ biocontrol agent applied as a drench every month;

3. potassium silicate drenches applied every 2 months (5L x at 1000 ppm);

4. 75 mm of lignitic mulch (macademia nut husks) covering the drip zone.

So far this integrated package is working well, far better than
control measures we have tried previously (including fungicides) to
control _Fusarium_ which is a major problem in South Africa. We are
also using the same approach on other tree crops (citrus, avocado,
coffee, macademia, papaya) and it is working well there also.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt)
is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp.
_cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of
pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread
by infected planting material, mechanical means, soil, and water, and
can survive in the soil for decades.

Several races of the pathogen exist. Races 1 and 2 attack several
different cultivars of eating and cooking bananas, but not Cavendish
varieties (for information on banana genotypes please see link
below); race 3 attacks ornamental _Heliconia_ species only; temperate
race 4 and the recently emerged tropical race 4 (TR4) attack
cultivars in the Cavendish subgroup as well as hosts of races 1 and 2.

Disease management is difficult for PD and mostly relies on
phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. Constant vigilance is
required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups.
Since no effective chemical or cultural control measures are
available, the integrated approach described in item 2 represents a
very important development.

_Trichoderma harzianum_ is a fungus that is also used as a fungicidal
biocontrol agent for foliar applications as well as seed and soil
treatments. It has been reported to be successful for suppression of
various fungal pathogens including soil-inhabiting species of
_Fusarium_, _Rhizoctonia_, _Sclerotium_, _Sclerotinia_ and _Botrytis_.

Cardaba and saba are cooking bananas, all the other cultivars
mentioned in item 1 are dessert varieties. The other diseases
mentioned are _Banana bunchy top virus_ (more information via
ProMED-mail post 20090204.0486), moko disease (caused by the
bacterium _Ralstonia solanacearum_; more information via ProMED-mail
post 20071112.3676), and the fungal sigatoka diseases (black and
yellow sigatoka caused by _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ and _M.
musicola_, respectively; more information via ProMED-mail post
20071012.3351).
