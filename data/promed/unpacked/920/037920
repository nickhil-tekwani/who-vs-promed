Health secretary Robert S Zimmerman Jr today reported that preliminary test
results show that a 66 year old man from Lancaster County in Pennsylvania
has contracted West Nile virus (WNV) infection. The man is currently
recovering from the illness.
The Department of Health State Health Laboratory in Lionville, Chester
County, performed the tests and the results are 95 per cent accurate. A
final confirmatory test will be done by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). If confirmed, this will be the first human case of WNV
infection in Pennsylvania this year and the fourth in Pennsylvania since
the disease was identified in the United States in 1999.
Secretary Zimmerman said "The case is not unexpected since we've known for
several months -- through bird, mosquito, and animal testing -- that WNV is
present in Pennsylvania." Zimmerman urged Pennsylvanians to keep proper
perspective on the health risks of WNV. "The chance of contracting West
Nile virus from an infected mosquito is small," Zimmerman said. "And even
if you're bitten by an infected mosquito, your chances of becoming
seriously ill are small. Nevertheless, we are urging residents --
particularly older adults and people with compromised immune systems -- to
take simple precautions [through October] to reduce their risk."
Because of the high number of mosquitoes found by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) in Lancaster County, DEP had already sprayed
for WNV. The need for additional spraying is being analyzed. The Health
Department's Public Health Laboratory this year has performed tests on
nearly 200 people with clinical symptoms of encephalitis. There is no
specific treatment for WNV infection. Most people recover fully, but severe
cases need hospital treatment.
So far this year in Pennsylvania, WNV has been found in 377 birds, 148
mosquito samples, and 24 sentinel and veterinary samples. The virus has
been detected in 46 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. Pennsylvanians should
presume that WNV is throughout the state and should take appropriate
precautions. In his 2002-03 budget, Governor Schweiker provided $5.1
million to prevent and lessen the potential public health effects of WNV on
Pennsylvanians. The funds provide necessary staffing and an improved
epidemiological infrastructure to detect the virus in Pennsylvania.
