Cholera has broken out in Petauke District, killing one person.
District Director of Health Kennedy Kabuswe confirmed the outbreak of
the disease during a District Epidemic Preparedness meeting
yesterday, 8 Feb 2006.
Dr Kabuswe said the other 6 people have been admitted with the
disease which broke out last week. He cited the affected areas as
Kakwiya and Misoro in Chief Nyamphande's area, attributing the
outbreak to poor source of water villagers were using. He said that
villagers were drinking from shallow streams, as there was no
borehole in the area. He has since appealed to Petauke residents to
take precautions by boiling water before drinking and to wash their
hands after using pit latrines.

[3] Diarrhea - Sudan (Central Equatoria State) Date: Tue, 7 Feb 2006

At least 12 people, 2 of them children, have died from an outbreak of
acute watery diarrhea in the southern Sudanese town of Yei, the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has said. The outbreak,
UNICEF said in a statement on Mon, 6 Feb 2006, was first reported on
4 Feb 2006 when 3 deaths occurred and 48 patients were admitted to
local health facilities. The disease left hundreds of people needing
medical attention -- about half of them children.
"There are large numbers of cases and we are going through medical
supplies very rapidly," Ben Parker, communication officer for UNICEF
southern Sudan, told IRIN. "There is an especially urgent need for IV
[intravenous] fluid in the treatment centers."
Southern Sudan remains largely underdeveloped after 21 years of civil
war between the former rebels of the southern Sudan People's
Liberation Movement/Army and the Khartoum-based government.
"Clean water supply in southern Sudan is generally lacking, with less
than a third of the population having access to a safe source,"
UNICEF said. "Yei town is typical of southern Sudan's urban centers
in having insufficient boreholes for its growing population, leading
to many people taking water directly from the river Yei, which is
used for drinking, bathing and watering livestock," the agency added.

[4] Cholera - Mozambique (Central Provinces)

At least 3 people have died of cholera, out of a total number of 1506
cases diagnosed in 3 central Mozambican provinces -- Sofala, Manica,
and Zambezia -- since the start of 2006, reports an issue of the
Maputo daily "Noticias".
Sofala, where the 3 deaths were reported, is the worst-affected
province, with 1327 cases notified. In Beira, the provincial
capital, 533 cases were diagnosed, followed by the district of Caia,
on the south bank of the Zambezi, and the town of Dondo, about 30
kilometers from Beira, with 426 and 291 cases respectively. Other
affected areas in Sofala are the districts of Nhamatanda, where 53
cases were notified, and Marromeu, with 24 cases.
To illustrate the seriousness of the situation in Sofala, the health
authorities told reporters on Wed, 8 Feb 2006, that in the previous
24 hours Beira had notified 18 new cases while another 18 were
diagnosed in Dondo.
In Zambezia, 128 cases have been reported, 75 of them in Gile
district, 24 in the provincial capital, Quelimane, 15 in Namacurra,
and 14 in the Mopeia. As for Manica, so far 51 cases have been
detected, the vast majority of them (49) in the provincial capital,
Chimoio.
The health authorities say that the epidemic has been stable in
Manica and Zambezia, with an average of 1 to 2 cases a day, but a
cholera alert remains in place. It is feared that the disease could
spread to other provinces: heavy rains, and poor sanitation and
drainage provide ideal conditions for the spread of a water-borne
disease such as cholera. Prevention education campaigns against this
epidemic are being carried out across the country.

The Prosecutor's Office of the Krasnoshchekovsky district of Russia's
Altai Territory has instituted an investigation related to an
intestinal infection outbreak in the Maralikha settlement
correctional school.
An official of the regional department of the Russian Emergency
Situations Ministry told Itar-Tass, "At present 54 children remain
hospitalized, and dysentery was diagnosed in 25 children. There is no
disease among teachers. A set of control measures is in place."
An inspection conducted in the boarding school has found that the
main infection source was one of the canteen workers who had
dysentery. Additionally, sanitary rules were not observed in the
canteen.
Moreover, the boarding school is overcrowded, with twice the number
of children allowed by regulations in its dormitories. The chief
sanitary doctor of the territory made a decision to close the
boarding school.

Health teams in eastern Yemen continued work on Mon, 6 Feb 2006, to
halt the spread of dysentery, from which several children have
already died, according to local health officials. The prime symptom
of dysentery is diarrhea containing blood. The illness can be fatal
when caused by the shigella bacterium, which has been found in recent
cases.
"More than 400 children have been treated since Saturday, 4 Feb 2006,
in the Khub wa Shath district, where 6 teams from the Ministry of
Health have been working to combat the disease," said Ali Naji Abu
Hadra, a health official supervising field teams in al-Jawf province,
167 km east of the capital, Sana.
"There were 11 confirmed cases of death among children in the
district of Khub wa Shath up until Mon, 6 Feb 2006, as a result of
the disease," he added.
Abu Hadra declined, however, to say how many children are already
infected, but confirmed that medical teams would carry on working in
the affected area.
"We can't estimate how many children are infected in the whole
district, but teams will continue until the disease is eradicated,"
Abu Hadra said. According to the health ministry, the disease first
broke out in al-Jawf province on 2 Feb 2006.
