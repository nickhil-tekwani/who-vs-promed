Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) confirmed equine infectious anemia (EIA) in 9 racing Quarter Horses located on a Smith County premises on [Thu 31 Jan 2019].

Through subsequent testing, 7 of the EIA-positive horses and one additional horse on the property were confirmed positive for a secondary infectious disease, equine piroplasmosis (EP).

The Smith County premises remains in compliance with TAHC rules, which require owners to maintain EIA- and EP-exposed horses in a quarantine zone of no less than 200 yd [183 m] from unexposed equines and retest exposed animals until cleared. Permanent quarantine and treatment are available options for EP-positive horses, while EIA-positive cases must remain quarantined for the life of the animal or the animal must be euthanized.

EIA is an incurable, infectious viral disease spread through blood-to-blood contact, not through close proximity or casual contact. The virus can be transmitted from an infected equine to a "clean" equine by biting flies, the use of unsterilized or contaminated medical instruments, or a blood transfusion. The most common clinical sign of acute EIA is fever, which often precedes the development of other signs. In chronic cases, signs such as weight loss, weakness, anemia, and swelling of the lower legs, chest, and abdomen may occur. For more information on EIA please visit <www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_EIA.pdf>.

EP is a blood-borne protozoal disease affecting horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras. EP is currently not considered endemic in Texas or in the USA; however, isolated outbreaks of the disease have occurred. Like EIA, EP can also be spread directly between animals by transfusions and blood-contaminated instruments such as needles. Cases of EP can be mild or acute. Signs of acutely affected equine include fever, anemia, jaundiced mucous membranes, swollen abdomens, and labored breathing. For more information on EP please visit https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_Piroplasmosis.pdf.

Further updates on EIA cases will be posted on the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) website, <www.equinediseasecc.org/alerts/outbreaks>.

[There are 2 entwined diseases here. The horses were being tested for equine infectious anemia and, according to Texas regulations, may be retested. However, on the retest there was still a problem, and a 2nd disease was discovered, which was equine piroplasmosis.

The article gives a brief summary of both diseases. Please note the description of the clinical signs of these diseases: there are some similarities. A veterinarian and testing are required to make an accurate diagnosis.

Regarding EIA: "No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine is available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m [219 yd]) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; however, detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months if ELISA testing is used."

Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoal infection of horses by _Babesia caballi_ or _Theileria equi_ (formerly _Babesia equi_) of the phylum Apicomplexa. The 2 organisms may infect an animal concurrently.

Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range from acute fever, inappetence [lack of appetite], and malaise, to anemia and jaundice, sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. The disease may be fatal in up to 20% of previously unexposed animals. The tick vectors exist in the USA, and epidemics of piroplasmosis were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The incubation period for _T. equi_ infections is 12-19 days, and infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10-30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often nonspecific.
