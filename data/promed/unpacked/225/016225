Bat disease threat down under
------------------------------
Bats can pass diseases to humans. An article in New Scientist (Bats
out of hell, Ian Anderson, 5 Dec 98 no 2163 pp 40-44) summarises
recent observations in Australia of viruses carried by bats that
have reached humans and animals, with sometimes fatal consequences.
[With the exception of the first and second ladies dying with the
bat Lyssavirus, we do not know that any of the people or animals
infected with the other viruses had contact with bats - CHC
Bat lyssavirus
-----------------
The Australian bat lyssavirus, more properly known as Ballina virus,
was first isolated in 1996. This virus is most closely related to
rabies virus, differing by only 8% of base pairs. In October 1996,
Ballina virus killed a woman from Queensland who had been looking
after sick and orphaned bats.
Fred Murphy, a viral disease expert at the University of California
at Davis, told New Scientist that, as far as he is concerned, the
woman died of rabies. Australia is officially rabies-free.
The Australian Animal Health Laboratory has just started research to
find whether cats and dogs can be infected with the virus. Experts
think this is likely. If they are also found to shed infectious
virus, there may be important implications for human and animal
health. Rabies vaccine protects against Ballina virus so bat handlers
are being advised anew to take it.
Bats are common in Australia, particularly the large fruit bats which
inhabit two thirds of the country. As their natural habitat is being
destroyed by man, the bats are moving closer to urban areas. Colonies
have been found in botanic gardens outside Melbourne and Sydney.
Chris Tidemann, an ecologist at the Australian National University in
Canberra, says some women have been known to feed their breast milk
to orphaned bats [Now that is one way to get bitten! - CHC. He says
they do not understand that diseases can be passed from bats to
humans (and vice versa? - ed.).
Horse virus
--------------
Another bat-related virus capable of infecting humans was first
identified in thoroughbred horses in a Brisbane suburb. The horses
came down with a respiratory disease in 1994 and 13 died. So did
their trainer, Vic Rail. [First identified from trainer Vic Rail,
then it was shown that his horses had it - CHC
Scientists at the Australian Animal health Laboratory near Melbourne
isolated a virus they first thought was a morbillivirus related to
measles and canine distemper, which they called equine morbillivirus.
They now wish to create a new genus name for it, _Megamyxovirus_,
because of the large size and the organisation of its genome. In
1995 a sugar cane farmer in northern Australia developed severe
muscular seizures and died. He was found to have been infected by a
horse with the same virus a year earlier.
The virus also showed up in bat uterine fluid. The horses may have
caught the virus from the uterus fluid from female bats which had
just given birth. Fluid may have dropped onto the ground from the
trees where the bats were nesting and entered the horses' bloodstream
after they ate or licked it. It may then have passed to the farmer
through cuts on his arms, and among horses through a shared syringe.
[SOME EPI! - CHC
Pig virus
----------
In a third link between bats and disease, sows near Sydney gave
birth to mummified or deformed piglets. A paramyxovirus was isolated
from them. Two piggery workers who became ill with flu-like symptoms
had antibodies to the virus, as did a nearby colony of flying foxes
(bats).
Zoonoses
------------
There are also worries in Australia about the viruses for which bats
can act as a wild reservoir. Those which may infect humans include
Ross River and Japanese encephalitis viruses, both carried by
mosquitoes and potentially fatal. [I don't know of anyone who ever
died of RRv infection -- birds, macropods, dogs, pigs, horses I know
about. RRv in bats? JEV in bats, yes - CHC
However, experts caution against a panic reaction to bats since only
a small number of humans have become infected by bat-borne viruses.
Also, most bats eat mosquitoes and therefore help to prevent the
transmission of diseases carried by these insects. Unfortunately,
there was a spate of shootings of fruit bats in Australia when news
broke of the source of _Megamyxovirus_.
[There has been a recent report from Australia that a woman has been
diagnosed with a clinical Ballina virus virus infection two years
after exposure. A posting is being prepared on that report
