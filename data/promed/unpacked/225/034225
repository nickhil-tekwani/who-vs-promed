[The following information comes from the Fish Disease Guide found on The Fish Site website available at https://thefishsite.com/articles/a-guide-to-koi-herpesvirus-disease-how-to-detect-treat-and-prevent.

"Koi herpesvirus (KHV) is a highly contagious virus that causes significant morbidity and mortality in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) varieties. Common carp is raised as a foodfish in many countries and has also been selectively bred for the ornamental fish industry where it is known as koi.

"Clinical signs of KHV are often non-specific. Mortality may begin very rapidly in infected populations, with deaths starting within 24 to 48 hours after the initial onset of clinical signs. In experimental studies, 82% of fish exposed to the virus at a water temperature of 72 deg F (22 deg C) died within the first 15 days (Ronen et al. 2003). KHV infection may produce severe gill lesions which exhibit as gill mottling with red and white patches. The white patches are due to necrosis (death) of the gill tissue. Gill lesions caused by KHV disease are the most common clinical signs in affected koi. Other external signs of KHV may include bleeding gills, sunken eyes, and pale patches on the skin. Some KHV-infected koi may have a notched nose. In some cases, secondary bacterial and parasitic infections may be the most obvious problem, masking the damage caused by the primary viral infection. Microscopic examination of gill biopsies often reveals high numbers of bacteria and various parasites.

"Internal signs of KHVD are variable and non-specific but may include greater than normal adhesions in the body cavity and enlargement and/or mottled appearance of internal organs.

"Behaviorally, affected fish often remain near the surface, swim lethargically and may exhibit respiratory distress and uncoordinated swimming.

"There is no zoonotic concern with KHV. The herpesvirus responsible for causing KHV disease in fish will not cause disease in humans." - Mod.CRD
