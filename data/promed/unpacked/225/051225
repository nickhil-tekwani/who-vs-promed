According to the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (Afsca), 13 countries have now officially announced the suspension of Belgian pork imports, following the discovery of 10 dead wild boars infected with African swine fever [ASF] in [Luxembourg province of Wallonia].

Afsca specifies that the trade restrictions vary with respect to different pork product imports, some only affecting gelatine products, while others target the exportation of living animals.

The list of countries that have suspended their pork imports from Belgium have been extended, and now comprises of South Korea, China, Taiwan, Belarus, Mexico, The Philippines, Japan, South Africa, Serbia, Singapore, Uruguay, Australia, and Malaysia.

No trace of ASF has however, been detected at any Belgian pig farms. The swine fever is not transmittable to humans, but affects wild boars, pigs, and warthogs.

The DNA samples taken from the contaminated wild boars found in Wallonia are still under analysis.
