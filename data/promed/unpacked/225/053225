The Tasmanian Government has acknowledged the outbreak of the devil
facial tumor disease in a wildlife park in the state's north is a
serious setback to the preservation of the species. The state's chief
veterinary officer has been sent to the Trowunna Wildlife Park at
Mole Creek to try to determine the cause of the outbreak.
Tests for devil facial tumor disease came back positive late last
week for 2 devils at the park.
It is the first time the disease has been found in a wildlife park.
The animals, a 4-year-old male and a 5-year-old female, were bred at
the park and are now in isolation.
Alex Schaap of the Primary Industries and Water Department says the
intrusion of a wild devil is the most likely explanation for the outbreak.
"The discovery of infected devils in that captive population is a
blow because we have a number of devils in captivity which are now at
risk of the disease. That doesn't mean that other devils in captivity
are at risk," he said.
The 4 devils sent to Denmark as a gift to celebrate the birth of
Denmark's Prince Christian came from Trowunna.
