The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority, MAST, announced Friday night [10 Sep 2021] that a case of scrapie had been confirmed in a sheep on the farm Syðra-Skörðugil in Skagafjörður, North Iceland, mbl.is [Iceland Monitor] reports. There are 1500 sheep on the farm, including lambs. This is the 2nd time Syðra-Skörðugil is hit by a case of the disease; the previous case was confirmed 30 years ago. The extent of the spread of the disease is being assessed.

Scrapie is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease that affects sheep. It is caused by a prion. The disease, which affects the sheep's brain, does not appear to be transmissible to humans. It was carried to Iceland in 1878 with an English ram, transported from Denmark to Skagafjörður.

In October 2020, a case of scrapie was confirmed on another farm in Skagafjörður that belongs to the same disease prevention area, and last year, the disease was confirmed on 5 farms on the eastern side of Skagafjörður, which belong to a different disease prevention area.

According to britannica.com, "Scrapie has a long incubation time, typically between about 18 months and 5 years following transmission. The 1st signs to arise are usually behavioral changes such as general apprehensiveness and nervousness. As the disease progresses, the animal loses weight and weakens, develops head and neck tremors, loses muscular coordination, and begins to rub or scrape its body against objects, wearing away its fleece or hair; hence the name 'scrapie.' The disease inevitably causes death within 1 to 6 months. No treatment or palliative measures are known."

The farm Syðra-Skörðugil was the most productive farm in Skagafjörður last year [2020]. "It will take me many, many years to build up another herd like this," states a farmer.

Typically, when a case of scrapie comes up, all the sheep at the relevant farm need to be slaughtered to prevent further spread of the disease, so the damage is always substantial.

[Iceland's sheep population is highly susceptible to exotic disease agents due to its location in a territory physically isolated from animal populations elsewhere. It has been suggested that the susceptibility may have been historically supported by genetic uniformity due to inbreeding. Over the years, several transboundary diseases penetrated the country by imported animals, in spite of the severe veterinary control, with devastating results, such as paratuberculosis (which affected cattle as well) and the lentiviruses of jaagsziekte/ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma and of ovine progressive pneumonia (the latter obtained the Icelandic term/name Maedi-visna, which has become its common name globally). The Icelandic animal-health establishment handled the said events efficiently, gathered vast experience, developed scientific expertise, and gained a remarkable reputation worldwide.

The following commentary, by Mod.CRD (see 20210320.8259468), is applicable:

"According to the "Surveillance Report on Animal Disease Notification and Surveillance," published in Nov 2020 by the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority MAST, 'scrapie [in Iceland] has been endemic since 1878. A decision was made in 1986 to start an eradication programme. On farms where scrapie is detected, all sheep are culled. Areas where scrapie has been detected, are kept under special surveillance for 10 years. Samples are taken annually from sheep at slaughter and sheep displaying clinical signs compatible with scrapie."

"A table with the number of samples analyzed for scrapie since 2000 can be seen in the mentioned report, available at https://www.mast.is/static/files/skyrslur/ad_notificationsurveillance_iceland_nov2020.pdf.

"Regulation pertaining to the eradication of scrapie and compensation for culling in Iceland is available at https://www.mast.is/static/files/library/Reglugerðir/651_2001ReglugerdUtryminguariduveikiogbaeturEN1505.pdf."
