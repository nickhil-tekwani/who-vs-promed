CDC change US recommendation for malaria prophylaxis to the Dominican Republic
--------------------------------------------------
Revised Recommendations for Malaria Prophylaxis in Dominican Republic.
Travelers to the Dominican Republic whose visits were limited to Punta Cana
(La Altagracia Province) and San Francisco de Macoris (Duarte Province).
During the same period at least 2 more cases have been reported in
European travelers who visited Punta Cana. CDC has recommended malaria
prophylaxis for travelers to rural areas in the Dominican Republic but not
for travel to resorts. In light of these reports, as a precautionary
measure, CDC is expanding the recommendations to include chloroquine
prophylaxis for travelers to all areas in La Altagracia Province, including
the Punta Cana area, and also to all areas of Duarte Province. The Ministry
of Health in the Dominican Republic has implemented malaria control
measures, including intensified surveillance, prompt case management, and
intensive mosquito control activities. CDC will continue to monitor the
situation and provide updates on these recommendations.

[Cases continue to be reported in visitors returning from the Dominican
Republic, and an assessment of the situation by the local authorities is
urgently needed. This risk of malaria is now regarded as so high that
prophylaxis is recommended by the CDC for all travellers. - Mod.EP]
