Authorities closed parts of an 8-story Senate office building Tuesday and
began testing and treating hundreds of people for possible exposure to
anthrax after overnight results confirmed the presence of spores in mail
addressed to Majority Leader Tom
Daschle.
FBI Director Robert Mueller, whose agency is investigating the incident,
said there appears to be a link between the letter opened in Daschle's
office on Monday and one sent to an employee of NBC in New York last week.
Both carried a Trenton, NJ postmark. But in addition, the letters to
Daschle and NBC contained similar markings and a similar threatening
message, said people speaking on condition of anonymity who attended a
briefing authorities gave to senators. Mueller said that "so far we have
found no direct link to organized terrorism" in the Washington or other
anthrax cases across the country.
In one ominous note, Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said the strain of
anthrax found in the letter to Daschle was "very refined, very pure."
Another participant in the Senate briefings said this led law enforcement
officials to believe that "this isn't a bunch of amateurs." White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer ruled out that any government stockpile of anthrax
may have been involved. Any U.S. stockpile intended for offensive purposes
was destroyed under a 1972 treaty, and "any other supplies that may be
available for bio-defense purposes are all accounted for," he said.
Daschle said he wasn't certain of a direct connection between a rash of
anthrax scares and Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind behind the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that killed thousands in New York and
Washington. "I'm not at all sure that all of this is related directly" to
him, he said on ABC. "I wouldn't be surprised if others are getting into
the act as well," he said. He declined to elaborate.
"There will be several hundred people that will be screened today," said
Dr. John Eisold, the attending physician at the Capitol. All of them will
receive enough antibiotics to protect them until test results are known. But
Eisold said that as a precaution, staff, police, cleaning crews, visitors,
and anyone else who had been in the corner of the building that houses
Daschle's office were being urged to undergo nasal-swab testing. He said
officials decided "to draw up the net as widely as possible and err on the
conservative side and test and treat."
At a news conference outside the Capitol, police spokesman Dan Nichols
repeated numerous times that the only "positive" identification of anthrax
spores had come on the mail itself. The police spokesman said that all mail
delivery had been suspended in the Capitol complex while authorities put
new security procedures in place. He announced on Monday that all public
tours of the Capitol had been suspended indefinitely, although he said that
was unrelated to the delivery of anthrax-tainted mail.
Daschle said earlier in the day that so far, test results have been
negative for the 50 or so people who were checked on Monday, when an
employee opened a piece of mail that contained a white powdery substance.
The letter, postmarked in New Jersey, tested positive for anthrax in 2
quick field tests. It was then sent to Fort Detrick, MD for more
sophisticated tests, and Nichols told reporters that results late Monday
confirmed the results. In an interview on NBC's "Today," Daschle said the
letter was taped in a fashion designed to keep electronic detectors from
picking up the anthrax.

[I gather from a reporter that the 2 rapid field tests involve [1 a
TETRACORE monoclonal antibody-based test for the exosporium that is wrapped
around the spore; if this is negative [2 a second test is run for DNA from
inside the spores. This essentially is a screening test for more exact
laboratory testing, presumably by John Ezell, at USAMRIID. - Mod.MHJ

[Someone has been posting a statement seemingly by myself concerning
microwaving envelopes. ProMED-mail did not post such a statement.
We have done this for an extended period and saw no change in the viability
of spores. It is now being repeated for longer time periods. But again, so
far we have not been able to demonstrate that microwaving anthrax spores
does anything harmful to them. I wish it did. Life would be much simpler. -
