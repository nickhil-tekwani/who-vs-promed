New York: Human Case of Avian Influenza A (H7N2) Virus Infection Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
The case of a Westchester County man who survived an extremely rare case of
avian influenza during the fall of 2003 has local, state and federal health
officials grappling with a troubling mystery. 5 months after the patient
checked into Westchester Medical Center complaining of fever and cough, no
one can say how he [contracted] avian influenza. The man recovered and went
home after a few weeks, but it was not until a month ago [March 2004] that
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suspected an avian
virus had caused his illness, and only last Friday [16 Apr 2004] that the
Centers confirmed that diagnosis.
As health officials continue to interview the man, his family, and people
he has contacted, they have found no evidence that he had contact with
contaminated birds, the only proven way avian influenza can be contracted,
forcing them to consider another means of transmission.
Health officials say that any new case of avian influenza must be taken
seriously, because it can spread rapidly among birds and it can be quite
serious in humans on the rare occasions when they are infected. In recent
years, cases of avian influenza in Asia, Europe and North America have
prompted the slaughter of millions of chickens and ducks. The World
Health Organization has sounded an alarm because some strains of the virus
-- not the one found in Westchester -- have killed people, including at
least 16 victims in Viet Nam and Thailand early in 2004 [23 according to
WHO as of April 2004]. Invariably, the human victims have turned out to be
people who had close contact with birds. In the only previous case in the
United States, in 2002, the patient was a poultry worker in Virginia.
Human cases that do not fit that pattern are particularly worrisome,
because scientists theorize that inside a human host, the viruses for avian
and human influenzas could swap some genetic material, creating an avian
influenza virus that transmits readily from person to person. They fear
that such a development could lead to a influenza pandemic like the one
that killed tens of millions of people in 1918 and 1919.
Local and federal health officials say they have found no evidence that the
Westchester County patient had direct contact with birds or had traveled to
any region affected by avian flu. "We can't figure out how he was exposed
and why he's an isolated case," said Nancy J. Cox, an influenza expert
at C.D.C. "We need to understand how he got infected." Dr. Joshua Lipsman,
the Westchester County health commissioner, said, "While we can't rule out
it being person-to-person transmission, the likelihood is still very
small." He added that the patient "had some potential exposures that we're
looking into," but declined to elaborate.
Officials said the man was infected with influenza A(H7N2) virus, the same
virus that hit chicken farms in New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware in 2004.
The H7-type avian viruses are thought to be less virulent in humans than
the H5-type strain that appeared in Southeast Asia in recent months. Other
H7-type strains were responsible for outbreaks in Canada [H7N3] during
2004, and in the Netherlands in 2003 [H7N7].
The Westchester patient, a Caribbean immigrant, lives in Yonkers with his
wife and children, officials said. He entered the hospital in November 2003
suffering from other serious ailments that weakened his immune system and
that might have masked the symptoms of avian influenza. One official said
the patient had symptoms of a respiratory illness, including coughing and
an abnormal chest X-ray. Doctors at first suspected tuberculosis. "We knew
it was something weird, but we didn't know what it was," said Claire
Palermo Flower, spokeswoman for the hospital. "They did an elaborate
culture and asked the lab to do more than the usual tests."
The county's laboratory tentatively identified the virus as a human
influenza A (H1N1) virus, and sent sputum samples to C.D.C. in Atlanta. The
specimen was set aside because few H1N1 cases were reported during the
winter of 2003-2004, and the centers routinely concentrate on testing the
most prevalent strains. It was not until February 2004 that C.D.C. tested
the sample, when scientists there found that the virus was not a H1-type
virus, nor influenza B virus.
Further testing showed that it was an influenza A virus, but not tH1, H3
nor H5 subtype. Finally, on 17 Mar 2004 scientists using other tests
identified the virus as H7N2. The next day, Dr. Cox said, C.D.C. notified
health officials in New York that they had a suspect human case of avian
influenza. To be certain that the sample had not been contaminated in a
laboratory, they did further tests. Doctors asked the patient for another
blood sample, to compare antibody levels in it with another sample kept
from the initial phase of his illness. Last week, the tests confirmed a
recent infection with H7N2, and the C.D.C. alerted state and local
officials in a conference call on Friday.
Westchester officials and the state Department of Health have also tested
the man's family, co-workers and close contacts -- none of whom were sick
-- without finding evidence that any had also been infected. C.D.C.
officials said the federal agency did not believe that the case represented
an imminent threat to public health. Dr. Cox said C.D.C. reported the case
on mon 19 Apr 2004 to the World Health Organization, which has repeatedly
warned about the threat of avian influenza. But a W.H.O. spokesman said
that as of 5 p.m. in Geneva, where the agency is based, no such report had
been received.

[This may be the 1st recorded human case of H7N2 infection. The nature of
the exposure to this low pathogenicity strain of avian influenza A virus is
unknown, but the immune-deficient status of the patient may have been a
relevant factor in both susceptibility to infection and the seriousness of
the disease process. - Mod.CP]
