11 children and 2 adults came down with _E. coli_ [presumably O157:H7
- Mod.LL] days after visiting the petting zoo at the Pacific National
Exhibition. It was the 1st time the PNE has been linked to cases of
_E. coli_ since the agricultural fair opened in 1910 [For the 1st 73
years of this span, this disease had not even been described, which
was in March of 1983 in the New England Journal of Medicine - Mod.LL].

Thousands of children passed through the petting zoo every year during
the fair. A spokesman for BC Children's Hospital in Vancouver
confirmed Tuesday [15 Sep 2009] 3 of the 13 cases were serious enough
to warrant hospital care. One child remained in hospital Tuesday in
fair condition, and 2 children have been sent home. The ages of the
victims ranged from 21 months to 69 years.

The bacterium is more commonly transmitted in uncooked [or
undercooked] meat. However, the pathogens can be transmitted through
contact with fecal matter that is picked up by petting the animals or
touching hand rails, fences or other surfaces. Reports of _E. coli_
O157 linked to the PNE surfaced on the same days as reports of Great
Britain's biggest ever outbreak spread from farm animals. A London
newspaper reported 36 children had _E. coli_ after visiting a petting
farm in Surrey, England; 3 of the children were reported to be
seriously ill.

Vancouver's PNE and its petting zoo with sheep, goats, horses and a
donkey were open from 22 Aug 2009 to 7 Sep 2009. The incubation period
ranges from 2 to 10 days, but most people show symptoms, from mild
diarrhea to extremely bloody and severe diarrhea, within 3 or 4 days.
The 1st case was identified Thursday [10 Sep 2009], 3 days after the
fair closed.

An electronic alert was sent on Friday [11 Sep 2009] to all public
health departments in Canada notifying them of cases that were
possibly linked to exposure to animals at the PNE and requesting
information about any cases they had in their area.

Petting zoos will always be a potential risk because they mix animals,
little kids and poop, Dr. John Carsley, a medical health officer with
Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, said yesterday in an interview.
The PNE had taken the required precautions for a petting farm, he
said. "The innate difficulty is the clientele of petting zoos tends to
be families with small children. So no matter how fastidious you want
to be, and try to be, you cannot reduce the risk to zero," Dr. Carsley
said.

All the people with _E. coli_ were in the barn, Dr. Carsley said.
However, they may have also all eaten somewhere at the PNE, he said.
So far, the barn is the only common characteristic, but the
investigation is continuing, he said.

Laura Ballance, a spokesperson for the PNE, said the fair has
undertaken extensive precautions to prevent the spread of disease from
animals to humans. The procedures "have been successful for several
decades and for hundreds of thousands of kids who have been passing
through," she said. When leaving the barn, children must walk through
an alleyway that has washing stations with hot and cold water, and
staff is there at all times telling everyone to wash their hands. 18
hand sanitizers are in the vicinity. Also, staff receive training on
ways to prevent the spreading of the germs, Ms. Ballance said.

[In 2006, ProMED posted an outbreak (E. coli O157, fair grounds - USA
(WI) 20061006.2872) where one of the notable observations was that
several of the cases had no direct exposure to the farm animals at the
county fair, and the exposure was related to a contaminated
environment. A previous report (Varma JK, Greene KD, Reller ME, et al:
An Outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157 Infection Following Exposure to
a Contaminated Building. JAMA 2003;290: 2709-12) suggested a similar
conclusion. The exact source of the pathogen here is being evaluated
and may never be known. We await confirmation of the O157:H7 serotype
in this outbreak. - Mod.LL]
