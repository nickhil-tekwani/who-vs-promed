Man dies from anthrax, neighborhood in Mongolia quarantined
----------------------------------------------------------------
A neighborhood in the Mongolian province of Darhan-Uul has been quarantined
and disinfection procedures are being carried out in the surroundings after
a man died from anthrax several days ago in a local hospital, authorities
said on Tuesday.
Another man was also confirmed to have caught anthrax, the Mongolian
General Authority for Emergency Management (GAEM) said, adding that the
person was now in hospital and his condition was stable.
The man who died from anthrax was about 50 years old and was a tramp in the
Darhan-Uul province, the GAEM said. He was found to have symptoms of
anthrax in mid-July 2005 and was sent to hospital, where he was confirmed
to have caught the fatal infectious disease, it said.

[The previous outbreak, in sheep, was in Bulgan Province, which is to the
south of Darhan-Uul, which is on the northern central border of Mongolia.
Obviously this tramp got infected from contact with an infected carcass,
possibly a dead sheep which they (presuming that the 2 were exposed at the
same time) might have butchered for themselves or were given. I would put
my money on them taking lethal advantage of the opportunity presented by a
dead sheep. - Mod.MHJ]
