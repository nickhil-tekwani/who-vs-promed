Jordan olive farms threatened by disease
----------------------------------------
Olive farms in Irbid are being threatened by a bacterial disease that
could destroy this year's [2009] harvest, an Agriculture Ministry
official warned.

Northern Mazar [Mazar Shamali sub-district] Department director
Abdullah Kanaan said that officials have detected dozens of cases of
olive knot disease in farms in the district where many residents
depend on olive production. The disease spreads among trees through
pruning with infected tools during rainy months and leads to the
formation of "knots" on infected trunks that dry out and spoil
olives. "The bacterial disease may destroy the produce as it damages
branches, leaves, and fruit of the tree," he explained.

Following visits to the area, ministry experts estimate that 70
percent of the district's olive farms have been infected with olive
knot, he added. "We are awaiting the results of the examination to
start chemical treatment to ensure that the disease does not spread
to neighbouring districts," he said, adding that the measures will
include removing diseased branches and spraying all area farms.

"Several cases of olive knot were discovered 4 years ago, but not as
widespread," Kanaan said, highlighting farmers' role in managing the
disease by following certain precautionary measures. These include
pruning healthy plants before the infected ones, cleaning tools after
pruning, and immediately burning diseased branches on site. He
explained that the department is currently estimating the total area
planted with olive trees in the district, in addition to the number
of infected trees, to develop a strategy to combat the disease.

[Olive knot is a potentially serious disease caused by the bacterium
_Pseudomonas savastanoi_. Symptoms include rough galls of variable
size on any organ of the plant. These grow rapidly and are most
common on young branches but will also form around wounds on the main
trunk and on damaged leaves. The disease reduces yield by girdling
branches and causing dieback, and young trees may be killed if trunks
are girdled.

The bacteria enter the host through wounds, live in the galls, and
ooze out in wet weather. Infection occurs at low temperatures, but
time from infection to galling can vary from a week to several months
depending on environmental conditions. The disease is spread with
infected plant and other material (including contaminated cutting
tools, as mentioned above), by water, and mechanical means. All
commercial olive cultivars are susceptible.

Disease management mostly includes pathogen exclusion, reducing
inoculum levels by removal of galls, phytosanitation (for example
disinfection of pruning equipment), and preventative copper treatment
of all types of wounds.
