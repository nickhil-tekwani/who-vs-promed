Health officials alarmed over soar of typhoid cases
-----------------------------------------------
Dumaguete City health officer Erlinda Cabrera is alarmed over the
increasing number of typhoid fever cases in the town of Sibulan in the
province of Negros Oriental. The town and the city share a common boundary,
and residents from Sibulan go to Dumaguete daily.
Cabrera said it is possible that some individuals visiting Dumaguete City
daily might already have the bacteria in their system but are not yet
showing any symptoms of the disease.
Records show that the number of confirmed typhoid fever cases from Sibulan
town, as of 2 Feb 2005, has soared to 170, from the 133 reported incidents
at the end of January 2005. In Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital (NOPH),
24 patients with typhoid fever were admitted. However, patients admitted to
the 2 other hospitals in Dumaguete City remained unaccounted for.
Dr. Clarita Cadiz, head of NOPH's Department of Medicine, said the hospital
admitted some 50 typhoid fever patients at the start of the week, but most
have been treated.
Governor George Arnaiz cautioned the public against blaming the spread of
the disease on the water supply from the Sibulan Water District (Siwad).
Arnaiz told reporters that some of the patients were from outside Sibulan
and, therefore, not using Siwad supply.
Earlier, Sun Star learned that, out of 24 patients admitted for typhoid
fever at NOPH, 11 used Siwad water supply, and the rest get their water
from pumps and springs.
So far, most of the typhoid fever cases were from the villages of Looc,
Poblacion, San Antonio, Cangmating, Bolobboloc, Ajong, and Tubod.
