[Equine rhinopneumonitis is cause by 2 distinct viruses: Equine
herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4. They both produce an acute febrile
respiratory disease upon primary infection, which manifests as a
fever of 39-42 C, neutropenia and lymphopenia, nasal and conjunctival
serous discharge and congestion, malaise, pharyngitis, cough and
inappetence. Outbreaks in foals are often caused by EHV-4, while
abortions are more frequently due to infection with EHV-1 and occur
often in months 7 to 11 of pregnancy. EHV-1 is also associated with
neurological disease. Since this outbreak is definitely clinical in
nature, the clinical findings and identification of which type of
equine herpesvirus is involved will be informative. This disease is
found commonly worldwide, and transmission occurs by direct or
indirect contact with infective nasal discharges, aborted fetuses,
placentas, or placental fluids. - Mod.PC]
