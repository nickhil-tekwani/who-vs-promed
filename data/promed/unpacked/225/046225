Macao: Fatal Case of Enterovirus 71-associated Encephalitis
----------------------------------------------------
A 17-year old schoolgirl was confirmed to have died of encephalitis
after contracting enterovirus type 71 (EV71), the Macao Health
Service announced on Wed 14 Apr 2004. This is the 1st locally
confirmed case of encephalitis caused by EV71 in Macao. The girl died
on Wed 3 Mar 2004 in the Government Hospital's intensive unit after
nearly a month of treatment. The Macao Center for Disease Prevention
and Control confirmed the patient's infection with EV71 one month
after her death.
Encephalitis is an inflammatory disease of the membranes that
surround the brain and spinal cord and is caused by bacterial or
viral infections. EV71 is one of the etiologic agents of epidemic
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). It spreads through fecal-oral
contact and [multiplies] in the intestine before it is released into
the bloodstream [and can spread to other tissues].
Outbreaks of EV71 have been reported around the world since 1969. In
order to prevent the spread of EV71, pupils suffering from HFMD have
since 2000 been required by the Macao Health Service to be
temporarily suspended from attending school. Macao recorded 330 HFMD
cases during 2003.
The health bureau warned that the EV71 disease is highly infectious
among small children below the age of 5 years. It advised residents
to ensure personal hygiene at all times, namely before taking meals
and after using the toilet.

[Since its discovery in 1969, human enterovirus 71 (EV71) has become
recognised as a frequent cause of epidemics of HFMD. HFMD is
generally a benign disease with severe neurological sequelae in a
small proportion of cases and is relatively rare in Europe, North
America, and Australasia.
Since 1997 there has been a significant increase in EV71 epidemic activity
throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Recent HFMD epidemics in this region have
been associated with a severe form of brainstem encephalitis associated with
pulmonary edema and high case-fatality rates. The emergence of large-scale
epidemic activity in the Asia-Pacific region has been associated with the
circulation of 3 genetic lineages that appear to be undergoing rapid
evolutionary change. A vaccine is not currently available. The fatal case in
Macao reported above is unusual, in that it does not appear to be associated
with an ongoing outbreak of HFMD. - Mod.CP]
