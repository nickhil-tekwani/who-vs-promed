Horses in several states have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), animal health officials and the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) have reported.

New York
--------
The EDCC reported late last week [week of 5 Sep 2016] that 2 horses from New York -- one from St Lawrence County and one from Suffolk County -- tested positive for WNV.

"The 1st, an 18 year old mare from Lisbon, New York, had depression, blindness, difficulty eating, and ataxia," the EDCC relayed. "The mare eventually went down and was euthanized on [24 Aug 2016].

"The 2nd, an unvaccinated 23 year old gelding from Manorville, New York, had front leg weakness which progressed to both front legs," the EDCC said. "The gelding went down and exhibited whole body tremors. The horse was euthanized on [2 Sep 2016].

In both cases, WNV was confirmed via serology performed at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York.

Oklahoma
--------
The EDCC also reported that Oklahoma confirmed its 3rd WNV case of the year on [12 Sep 2016].

"The 16 year old quarter horse gelding located in Jackson County was showing severe neurologic signs including hind limb ataxia," the EDCC said. "Vaccination history is unknown."

Wisconsin
---------
Meanwhile, a total of 5 horses have now tested positive for WNV in Wisconsin. On [7 Sep 2016], Raechelle Belli, public information officer for the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection's Divisions of Animal Health and Food Safety, told TheHorse.com that 3 cases were confirmed in Clark County, one in St Croix County, and one in Rusk County so far this year [2016].

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

The single most important step in prevention is vaccination.

The next steps are to spray a horse approved product to prevent mosquito bites. Elimination of any kind of standing water, which is a mosquito breeding ground, is also helpful in reducing the mosquito population in the immediate vicinity. A catch pot under potted plants or a puddle water in an old tire are great mosquito breeding grounds. Look around an clean up.
