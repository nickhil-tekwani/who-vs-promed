A beloved fire fighter from Melipal died this morning of [a] suspected hantavirus [infection] and [samples] for study were sent to Buenos Aires for confirmation [of the diagnosis]. The Director of the Area Hospital, VÃ­ctor Parodi confirmed the need to await the results which are expected on Monday [13 Aug 2012].

The 55 year old man died at 8:45 this morning [9 Aug 2012]. He was a firefighter of the Melipal station and worked as chief of the Catedral Detachment. He was admitted to the Private Regional Hospital and according to their statement he was suspected of having [a] hantavirus [infection].

According to the Director of the Area Hospital, Victor Parodi, this is a suspected case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. Given this situation, he commented that there is need for followup with the man's family and co-workers, in case anyone presents with symptoms and informed them what they are so they can seek [medical] consultation in case it is necessary.

[The samples] were sent for study to the Instituto Malbran in Buenos Aires, but according to the physician's statement given the clinical evolution of the patient the suspicion [of a hantavirus infection] is high.

[Although the virus involved in the above case is not specified, if the infection is confirmed as due to a hantavirus, it is likely to be Andes hantavirus. Monitoring family members is prudent, as Andes virus is the only hantavirus show to be capable of person-to-person transmission among people in very close contact, usually family members.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg.
