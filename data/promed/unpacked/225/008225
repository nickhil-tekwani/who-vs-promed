On Tuesday [6 Jul 2021], a domestic cat tested positive for the plague at a local veterinarian hospital in San Miguel County [Colorado]. The cat was hospitalized, tested, and treated and is recovering well. No fleas were found during treatment and those who handled the cat did not experience high risk exposures though will monitor for symptoms for the next week.

This is one of a few instances of the plague in domestic and wild animals so far this summer [2021] across the state of Colorado though there have been no human cases to date.

Plague has been present in Colorado since at least the 1940s and is most frequently discovered amongst rodents in the summer months. Domestic animals can be infected with the plague when the infection spills over from rodent populations. It can be transmitted by infected animal tissue, such as an animal carcass, fluid, or respiratory droplets spread through coughing or sneezing.

Plague is most often spread to people through a bite from an infected flea. While there is no human vaccine for plague, it can be treated successfully with antibiotics when caught early.

The infection occurred in San Bernardo at 9400 feet [2865 m] of elevation. San Miguel County Public Health is currently working with regional campgrounds to watch for dead rodents, fleas, and other possible signs of disease prevalence.

"Throughout the summer, as you and your pets enjoy being active outdoors, it's important to keep an eye out for disease and infections," said Public Health Director Grace Franklin. "If you or your pets have contact with fleas, wild animals, or rodents, please monitor for symptoms throughout the season. When caught early, the plague is highly treatable."

The symptoms of the plague in human beings include, but are not limited to:
- swollen or tender lymph nodes;
- shortness of breath;
- pain in the abdomen or muscles;
- fever;
- chills;
- fatigue

If you or someone you know has been in contact with an infected rodent, wild, or domestic animal and is experiencing symptoms of the plague, please contact your primary care physician right away. If you do not see a local physician, please reach out directly to San Miguel County Public Health by emailing <publichealth@sanmiguelcountyco.gov>.

[A quick scan of ProMED archives indicates Colorado is reporting one or more cases of plague, in animals, or people, about monthly. Please be sure you are treating your pet with veterinarian recommended products for your area.

Plague, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is an infectious disease found in small mammals, such as squirrels, small rodents, sometimes our domestic animals, and because it is a zoonotic disease, it may also affect people. It is usually transmitted in a cycle between fleas and the host. A host may be a dog, cat, squirrel or other rodents, or other animal or human beings. The flea transmits the disease between the various mammalian hosts

"- People infected with _Y. pestis_ often develop symptoms after an incubation period of 1 to 7 days.
- There are 2 main clinical forms of plague infection [actually there are 3 forms -- [bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. - Mod.TG]. Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.
- Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.
- Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.
- Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives."

Cats
----
"The most common presentation of plague in cats is bubonic plague. Cats with bubonic plague usually have fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, and an enlarged lymph node that may be abscessed and draining. Ulcers in the mouth, skin abscesses (pockets of pus and infection), discharge from the eyes, diarrhea, vomiting, and diffuse spreading inflammation of tissues beneath the skin have also been documented. High fever may be present. Cats with primary septicemic plague have no obvious disease of the lymph nodes but have fever, lethargy, and poor appetite. Septic signs may also include diarrhea, vomiting, excessively rapid heart rate, weak pulse, and breathing distress. Primary pneumonic plague has not been documented in cats. Cats with secondary pneumonic plague may have all the signs of septicemic plague along with a cough and other abnormal lung sounds.

"To diagnose plague, your veterinarian will take samples (such as blood, fluid from the lymph nodes, or a swab from the mouth or throat) for testing and confirmation of the presence of plague-causing bacteria. Blood tests may also help.

"Treatment and prevention
Due to the rapid progression of this disease, treatment for suspected plague (and infection control practices) should be started before a definitive diagnosis is obtained. Your veterinarian will recommend an antibiotic as standard treatment.

"The duration of infectivity in treated cats is not known with certainty, but cats are thought to be noninfectious after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment if there are indications of improvement. During the infectious period, cats should remain hospitalized, especially if there are signs of pneumonia. Human cases have occurred in cat owners trying to give medications by mouth at home, exposing them to contact with the mouth and associated infectious secretions.

"Prevention of plague in cats
To decrease the risk of pets and humans being exposed to plague, pet owners in areas where the disease may be found should:
- keep their pets from roaming and hunting;
- limit their contact with rodent or rabbit carcasses; and
- use appropriate flea control

"Along with treatment and diagnostic considerations, protection of people and other animals and initiation of public health interventions are critical when an animal is suspected to have plague. Even before a diagnosis is complete, animals with signs that suggest plague should be placed in isolation at a veterinary hospital, and infection control measures should be implemented for the protection of you and your family, other household pets, and any other animals or individuals that have had contact with the infected animal. Examples of infection control measures include disinfection, protective clothing (such as gloves and face masks), and possibly preventive antibiotics for in-contact animals or people. Your veterinarian will contact local public health officials so they can help minimize spread of the disease.

"To decrease the risk of pets and humans being exposed to the plague, pet owners in areas where the disease may be found should keep their pets from roaming and hunting, limit their contact with rodent or rabbit carcasses, and use appropriate flea control. Your veterinarian can suggest the most appropriate flea control product for your cat."

"Septicemic plague results when the plague spreads through the blood and affects multiple internal organs (such as the spleen, liver, heart, and lungs).

Dogs
----
"Dogs are inherently resistant to the plague-causing bacteria. Dogs becoming infected with plague are less likely to show signs of illness than infected cats. Signs may include fever, lethargy, inflammation of the lymph nodes below the lower jaw, a pus-like lesion along the jaw, lesions in the mouth, and cough.

"Due to the rapid progression of this disease, treatment for suspected plague (and infection control practices) should be started before a definitive diagnosis is obtained with bacterial cultures. Your veterinarian will recommend an antibiotic as standard treatment.

Protecting your pets from fleas is critical for their well-being, and for yours. Fleas carry plague and potentially other diseases. But what do you use to treat your pet? There are a number of products on the market. However, some over-the-counter medications can be toxic to your pets, especially cats. A brand name does not mean safety and effectiveness. Please consult your veterinarian about safe and effective flea prevention. In some areas, fleas are resistant to some prevention products. The veterinarian is most familiar with what products are safe and effective in your area. - Mod.TG
