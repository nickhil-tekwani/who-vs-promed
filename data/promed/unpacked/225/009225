From: Jamunarani S Vadivelu <JAMUNA@medicine.med.um.edu.my>

I am quite interested to learn more about the problem which seems to
sound like melioidosis. It is endemic in the tropics especially in
Southeast Asia and Australia. But the organism, _Burkholderia
pseudomallei_ (formerly _Pseudomonas pseudomallei_) has been isolated from
soils in France. More information regarding the type of jobs these
patients were engaged in, and underlying conditions like diabetes that can
trigger a latent infection.
We are willing to help confirm in the way of serological tests as well
as immunohistochemichal analysis on biopsy material.
Please let us know if we can be of help.
