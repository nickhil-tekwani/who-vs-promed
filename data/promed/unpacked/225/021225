EMERGENCE OF A NOVEL GII.17 NOROVIRUS - END OF THE GII.4 ERA?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABSTRACT: In the winter of 2014/15 a novel GII.P17-GII.17 norovirus strain (GII.17 Kawasaki 2014) emerged, as a major cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in China and Japan. Since their emergence these novel GII.P17-GII.17 viruses have replaced the previously dominant GII.4 genotype Sydney 2012 variant in some areas in Asia but were only detected in a limited number of cases on other continents. This perspective provides an overview of the available information on GII.17 viruses in order to gain insight in the viral and host characteristics of this norovirus genotype. We further discuss the emergence of this novel GII.P17-GII.17 norovirus in context of current knowledge on the epidemiology of noroviruses. It remains to be seen if the currently dominant norovirus strain GII.4 Sydney 2012 will be replaced in other parts of the world. Nevertheless, the public health community and surveillance systems need to be prepared in case of a potential increase of norovirus activity in the next seasons caused by this novel GII.P17-GII.17 norovirus.

In this issue of Eurosurveillance, observations from Japan are reported on an unusual prevalence of a previously rare norovirus genotype, GII.17, in diarrheal disease outbreaks at the end of the 2014/15 winter season, similar to what was observed for China. Norovirus is a leading cause of gastroenteritis. Although the infection is self-limiting in healthy individuals, clinical symptoms are much more severe and can last longer in immunocompromised individuals, the elderly and young children.

{Interested readers are referred to the original texts for an account of the observations on which these conclusions were based.}

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS [Abbreviated]: The genus _Norovirus_ comprises 7 genogroups (G), which can be subdivided in more than 30 genotypes. Viruses belonging to the GI, GII and GIV genogroups can infect humans, but since the mid-1990s GII.4 viruses have caused the majority (caâ€‰70-80 percent) of all norovirus-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. GII.4 viruses can continue to cause widespread disease in the human population because they evolve through accumulations of mutations into so-called drift variants that escape immunity from previous exposures. Contemporary GII.4 noroviruses also demonstrate intra-genotype recombination near the junction of open reading frame 1 and ORF2, which is likely to foster the emergence of novel GII.4 variants.

Emergence and geographical spread of GII.17 genotype noroviruses
---------------------------
Viruses of the GII.17 genotype have been circulating in the human population for at least 37 years; the first GII.17 strain in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databank is from 1978. Since then viruses with a GII.17 capsid genotype have sporadically been detected in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America

More widespread circulation of GII.17 was initially reported for environmental samples in Korea from 2004 to 2006. 2013 a novel GII.17 virus accounted for 76 percent of all detected norovirus strains in rivers in rural and urban areas in Kenya. In the winter of 2014/15, genetically closely related GII.17 viruses were initially detected in outbreaks in the Guangdong province in China in schools, colleges, factories and kindergartens. Sequence analyses demonstrated that 24 of the 29 reported outbreaks during that winter were caused by GII.17. A large increase in the incidence of outbreaks was also reported; 29 outbreaks associated with 2340 cases compared with 9 outbreaks and 949 cases in the previous winter when GII.4 Sydney 2012 still was the dominant genotype.

During the same winter there was also an increase in outbreak activity in Jiangsu province, which could be attributed to the emergence of this novel GII.17. This triggered us to investigate the prevalence of GII.17 in other parts of the world by means of a literature study and by inviting researchers collaborating within Noronet to share their data on GII.17. Currently, in Asia, in addition to Guangdong and Jiangsu, the novel GII.17 is also the predominant genotype in Hong Kong (unpublished data) and Taiwan, while in Japan, a sharp increase in the number of cases caused by this novel virus has been observed during the 2014/15 winter season. Related viruses have been detected sporadically in the US, Australia, France, Italy, Netherlands, New-Zealand and Russia (unpublished data). In France the novel GII.17 virus appeared at the beginning of 2013, but since then, it has not resulted in an increase in outbreaks as observed in China, nor replaced the predominant GII.4 in the last seasons .

Public health implications
-------------
Based on the emergence and spread of new GII.4 variants, we know that noroviruses are able to rapidly spread around the globe. The novel GII.17 virus has been detected in sporadic cases throughout the world, but until now it has not resulted in an increase in outbreak activity or replacement of GII.4 Sydney 2012 viruses outside of Asia. Following the patterns observed in the past years for GII.4 noroviruses and based on the data from China and Japan, an increase in norovirus outbreak activity can be expected if the currently dominant GII.4 is replaced by GII.17.

Another possibility, however, would be some restriction to global expansion, as has been observed previously for the norovirus variant GII.4 Asia 2003 of differences between populations in the expression of norovirus receptors. Based on current literature on the novel GII.17 virus there is no indication that it will be more virulent compared with GII.4. Nevertheless, the public health community and surveillance systems need to be prepared in case of a potential increase of norovirus activity by this novel GII.17 virus.

Conclusions
-----
Current candidate vaccines have targeted the most common norovirus genotypes, and it remains to be seen if vaccine immunity is cross-reactive with GII.17 viruses. Contemporary norovirus diagnostic assays may not have been developed to detect genotype GII.17 viruses since this genotype was previously only rarely found during routine surveillance. These assays need to be evaluated and updated if necessary to correctly diagnose norovirus outbreaks caused by the emerging GII.17 virus. Norovirus strain typing ideally should include ORF1 sequences and the variable VP1 'D' region as well as metadata on the host, like clinical symptoms, immune status and blood group. This will allow us to better study and monitor the genetic disposition, pathogenesis, evolution and epidemiology of this newly emerged virus.

[This research clearly documents the appearance of a novel norovirus genotype and its potential future role in the epidemiology of infectious gastroenteritis. In the winter of 2014/15 the novel GII.P17-GII.17 norovirus strain emerged as a major cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in China and Japan. Since then, novel GII.P17-GII.17 viruses have replaced the previously dominant GII.4 genotype Sydney 2012 variant in some areas in Asia but not elsewhere. This publication provides an overview of the available information on GII.17 viruses and further characterises the viral and host characteristics of this norovirus genotype. It remains to be seen if the currently dominant norovirus strain GII.4 Sydney 2012 will be replaced in other parts of the world. - Mod.CP]
