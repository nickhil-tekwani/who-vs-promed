30 patients have been infected so far in a criminal outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
State [NH} health officials today announced they are expanding the number of patients they want to test in a hepatitis C outbreak at Exeter Hospital. Anyone who was treated as an inpatient in the main operating room or was treated in the intensive care unit from 01 Apr 2011 to 25 May 2012 should get tested for the disease, said Dr. Jose Montero, the state's Public Health Director, at a news conference today.

The new testing pool includes about 6000 patients. Originally, 1200 had been identified for testing. Clinics will be held over the next few days for patients to get tested, Montero said. "We understand this creates some anxiety," Montero said. He emphasized that the chances are low any of the 6000 patients contracted the disease.

Prosecutors say the outbreak was started by former hospital worker Dave Kwiatkowski. He was arrested last week, charged with knowingly spreading his hepatitis C [infection] to patients by stealing their drugs to get high. The 1200 patients originally identified for testing were treated in the hospital's cardiac catheterization lab where Kwiatkowski worked. Montero said he [the travelling technician] had access to other areas of the hospital, which prompted the expanded testing.

Montero released this statement today: "As part of our investigation we have uncovered additional information that has indicated the suspect, while working in the Hospital's Cardiac Catheterization Lab, may also have accessed these other areas of the hospital. As we have said this investigation is ongoing and additional testing may be necessary to help all patients who may have been infected. While the risk of exposure to this newly identified group of patients is very low, we want to be take every measure to protect the public and so we are recommending that they come in to be tested."

[Precise and prompt laboratory diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is becoming increasingly important because different strains of HCV respond differently to currently available therapies. Interferon and ribavirin-based therapy has been the mainstay of HCV treatment. Unfortunately interferon is not not always well tolerated, and some HCV genotypes respond to ribavirin better than others.
