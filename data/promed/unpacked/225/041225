At least eight people in northern Thailand have died and more than a
hundred are ill as a result of leptospirosis, a bacterial disease often
spread by rodents. Humans usually encounter the disease through consumption
of water that has been contaminated with urine from infected animals.
Health officials in the northern province of Phrae do not believe the
situation is serious. They are encouraging people to visit their
physicians. Symptoms include headaches, and fever, but fatal kidney and
liver complications could occur.

[Leptospirosis is caused by a spirochete bacterium and outbreaks often
follow heavy rains that drive rodents into nearby housing. Other animals
may harbor the bacteria, but rodents have been more frequently implicated
in outbreaks following heavy rains/flooding. Could someone in the area who
is familiar with the situation give us a more accurate account, including
the serovar(s) involved? - Mod.TG]
