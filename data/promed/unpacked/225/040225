[Since the last update on 9 Dec 2014 there have been a total of 2 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection (reported on 16 Dec 2014), 3 deaths in previously reported cases (reported on 14 Dec 2014) and 2 recoveries (reported on 12 Dec 2014 and 9 Dec 2014). The 2 new cases include a 29-year-old expat female healthcare worker in Taif with a history of exposure to case(s) in the healthcare environment and a 70-year-old expat male non-healthcare worker in Jubail with a history of animal exposure.

The 3 deaths that were reported on 14 Dec 2014 included a 22-year-old expat male from Taif who, according to the 2 Dec 2014 WHO Disease Outbreak News report, was a contact of a previously reported MERS-CoV case but did not have a history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. At the time of report, the individual was in critical condition in the ICU (MERS-CoV (63): Saudi Arabia, new cases, new deaths, WHO 20141203.3006876). The 2nd reported death was a 61-year-old Saudi male from Najran who most likely was the case reported on 8 Dec 2014, and had a history of animal exposure; possible exposure to known cases in the healthcare environment was noted to be under investigation at that time. At the time of report (8 Dec 2014), the patient was noted to be in critical condition. The 3rd newly reported death involved a 60-year-old Saudi male from Taif who most likely was the individual reported on 4 Oct 2014, at which time he was admitted to the ICU, and was noted to have a history of exposure to camels.

The 2 recoveries that have been reported in this period include a 40-year-old expat male from Taif, who may have been the same individual reported on 28 Nov 2014, except for a conflicting history of pre-existing co-morbidities (in the recovery report the individual did not have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, but the 28 Nov 2014 case confirmation report mentioned a history of pre-existing co-morbidities). The 2nd recovery involved a 69-year-old Saudi male for whom I have not been able to identify the date of initial report, reviewing reports since 1 Jul 2014.
