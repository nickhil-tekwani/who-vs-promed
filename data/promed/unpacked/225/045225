[1] Israel, turkeys, 3rd outbreak, H5

Veterinarians told Haaretz on Friday [17 Mar 2006] that the deadly
viral strain is also suspected of having spread to turkey coops in
Kibbutz Nachshon, 25 km away from Jerusalem. [Interactive map at

Israel on Friday ordered the slaughter of tens of thousands of birds
suspected of being infected by bird flu. The culling will begin
Sunday in Nachshon and the 2 Negev kibbutzim -- Ein Hashlosha and
Hulit.
The Kibbutz Nachshon sources said Friday they had noted suspicious
deaths among kibbutz turkeys over the last 2 days, and that initial
lab tests showed that the turkeys were infected by bird flu. However,
it was not clear whether the turkeys were infected by the H5N1 strain
of the virus.
A spokeswoman for the Agriculture Ministry said Friday morning she
was unaware of official lab test results performed on the Kibbutz
Nachshon turkeys.
Health Ministry sources said Thursday that the initial lab tests
carried out on some of the more than 1000 turkeys that died Thursday
in 2 communities in the south of the country show that the deadly
strain of avian flu has reached Israel.
The reported confirmation of the results marks the first time that
the deadly virus -- which has killed at least 97 people worldwide and
led to the slaughter of tens of millions of birds -- was detected in
Israeli birds.
After the deaths were reported, the veterinary authorities imposed a
quarantine on the 2 Negev kibbutzim where the birds were found dead
-- Ein Hashlosha and Holit -- and 2 neighboring kibbutzim, Nirim and
Kissufim.
"We have imposed a quarantine with a radius of 7 kilometers around
the area, and in case our suspicions are confirmed, we are prepared
for a wide-scale destruction of the flocks in a radius of 3 km," Boim
said.
The quarantine means that no birds can enter or leave the kibbutzim, and no
people will be allowed into the coops except those who must care for the birds
that are still alive. These essential personnel are required to don suitable
protective gear -- masks, goggles and protective clothing -- before entering.
If the dead birds are found to have H5N1, tens of thousands of birds
will be slaughtered, in both the affected farms and those within a
3-kilometer radius. In addition, a quarantine will be imposed with a
radius of 10 km around the kibbutzim. The government will consider
vaccinating all birds in Israel in an attempt to prevent the virus
from spreading.
Health and agriculture officials were to decide Friday whether to
begin culling the birds immediately or to wait for a final
confirmation that the fowl died of the deadly virus strain.
The H5N1 virus was detected in neighboring Egypt last month, and Boim
said that the death of the birds in southern Israel might indicate
that the disease entered the country from Egypt.
Another possibility is that the disease entered from Gaza. The Israel
Defense Forces therefore asked the Palestinian Authority to deliver
blood samples of poultry from Gaza Strip henhouses, in order to
determine whether they were the source of the virus.
The suspicion that the virus had reached Israel first emerged
Thursday morning, when veterinarians at Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha
discovered 400 dead birds in one of the coops. At about the same
time, nearby Kibbutz Holit reported suspicious deaths among its
turkeys. Initial laboratory tests determined that at least one of the
birds had died of avian flu, but further testing is needed to
determine whether it was the deadly H5N1 strain.
Further deaths were reported at both coops later in the day, and the
death toll eventually climbed to more than 1000. "They're dropping like
flies. I've never seen anything like it," said Dr. Yariv Agur, an expert on
avian diseases who visited the Holit coops on Thursday.
Agur said that anyone who was in contact with the affected birds
ought to be given immediate preventive treatment. At Ein Hashlosha,
he added, that could include more than just farmers and
veterinarians, since there, "the coops are inside the kibbutz, so the
virus surely exists in every nook and cranny." [See comment below].
However, the virus can only be caught via close contact with infected
birds. As a result, though the Health Ministry also advised anyone
who has been in contact with the birds on either kibbutz to contact
the local health authority, it does not plan to issue any advisories
to the general public or take any special steps that would affect the
general public.
Ministry officials also stressed that there is no reason for people
to stop eating poultry, since the virus cannot be transmitted via
cooked food. However, poultry farmers said that their main fear is
that the public will ignore this reassurance. A panic-driven consumer
boycott of poultry, they noted gloomily, could do their businesses
even more harm than the destruction of their flocks, should the
presence of the virus be confirmed.

[An official notification to the OIE, with precise numbers of
affected animals and the accurate results of the laboratory
investigations, will help in preventing confusion. From unofficial
sources it appears that culling, in several sites, has already been
undertaken.
Ein Hashlosha, in southwestern Israel, adjacent to the Gaza strip, is
in close proximity to Holit. The 3rd affected turkey farm, in
Nachshon, is about 80 km to the northeast. Reportedly, the 3 farms
share a common administration and feed supply.
On Friday afternoon, the veterinary services informed that a 4th suspected
outbreak was under investigation, namely in Sde Moshe (map at
<http://www.maplandia.com/israel/sede-moshe/>); that the total mortality, so
far, exceeded 11 000 turkeys; and that OIE had been duly notified.
A separate Reuters newswire
(<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L17272538.htm>)
included the following additional information:
The Palestinian Authority had been informed and asked to inspect
chicken coops in Gaza and the West Bank, officials said.
Israel is also testing dead fowl found in the West Bank and Gaza on
behalf of the Palestinian Authority in rare cooperation as
agriculture officials attempt to control the spread of the virus.
Turkey poults are usually reared commercially in open-meshed, wire net
barns/houses. A typical barn will house 2500-4000 birds; some enterprises
maintain 8-15 such barns, or even more. Significant quantities of faeces are
produced in those facilities. When located within inhabited areas, close to
human dwellings, dusty faecal material may be windborne to a certain distance.
This may reach other animals and/or man. For this reason, in most villages in
Israel most turkey barns have been moved to distant, uninhabited locations.
Unfortunately, there are exceptions. In "normal" times, the nuisance there
may be limited to allergic or breathing problems. However, if/when the turkeys
are HPAI infected, the possibility that their airborne exrements might expose
the local human population to infection may deserve consideration. - Mod.AS]

The following data, selected from the chapter "Description of
affected population(s)" in Sweden's official "immediate notification"
sent to the OIE on 16 Mar 2006, describe the surveillance carried out
in Sweden subsequent to the detection of the first cases in wild
birds on 24 Feb 2006.
Tufted duck (_Aythya fuligula_) - 23 positive out of 66 investigated
in Oskarshamn [in Kalmar county]. See photo:

<http://www.waarneming.nl/fotonew/2/1532.jpg>
See map at <http://www.world-gazetteer.com/maps/m_189.png>.
Total 243 dead birds analyzed in those areas between 10 Feb 2006 and
15 Mar 2006 - 36 positive for HPAI subtype H5.
No high mortality among wild birds noted. It is late in the season
and freezing, so some dead birds are to be expected this time of the
year.

[3] Netherlands: Surveillance in wild birds
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2006
From: S.N.Wiessenhaan <s.n.wiessenhaan@minlnv.nl>

In response to the moderator's remark in 'Avian influenza - worldwide
(53): Europe' regarding the intensity of surveillance activities,
indicating that 'the discovery of infection in wild birds in other
European countries seems to be related to the intensity of
surveillance activities', I would like to provide the following
information.
The Netherlands has, in line with an EU Commission Decision,
developed a monitoring programme for wild (water-) birds. The Dutch
monitoring programme for wild birds consists of the sampling of
cloacal swabs. Since September 2005 over 7000 birds have been sampled.
The samples have been taken mostly from birds in wetland areas.
Special attention is paid to sampling from the species of wild birds
presenting a higher risk in relation to avian influenza, such as
gulls, etc. The virus diagnosis is carried out in "real-time";
within one week after sampling, in order to test for the presence of
HPAI H5N1 with PCR methods.
Furthermore, we have been testing birds found dead, wounded or
diseased in recent weeks (about 1000 birds per week).
So far no positive cases (HPAI H5N1) in the Netherlands have been found.

[This is welcome, commendable information on the commendable active
and passive surveillance undertaken by the Dutch authorities.
The chance of detecting infected avians depends on the rate of
infection in the target population, the sampling rate and
sensitivity/accuracy of the testing procedures. It will be
interesting to obtain statistical assessment of the minimal number of
samples required to detect even a single infected bird if the
infection rate in a healthy H5N1 avian carrier is low, or even
extremely low. More information on this factor, in relation to the
current H5N1 panzootic, seems to be needed. - Mod.AS]
