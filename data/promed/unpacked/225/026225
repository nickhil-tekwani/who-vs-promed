The Maryland Department of Agriculture's Animal Health Program confirmed this week that a horse in Baltimore County had tested positive for equine herpesvirus (EHV-1). Samples from the symptomatic horse were sent to the Frederick Animal Health Laboratory, where the non-neurotropic strain of EHV-1 was confirmed. The horse was euthanized on [Thu 28 Nov 2019] due to complications.

The Baltimore County farm, which has not been identified, has been placed on a hold order by the department, prohibiting movement on or off the farm until any exposed horses have been cleared for release. The horse was previously housed in an isolated barn with 3 other horses. The farm stables a total of 25 horses, none of which are showing clinical signs of EHV-1 or fever at this time. The veterinary practitioner and stable are providing follow-up care to the asymptomatic horses on the farm. Possible links to the positive EHV-1 equine are actively being investigated.

Equine herpesviruses are viruses that are found in most horses all over the world. Almost all horses have been infected with the virus and have no serious side effects. It is currently unknown what causes some infected horses to develop the serious neurological forms that may be fatal.

To date, 9 EHVs have been identified, worldwide. Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is another name for the neurologic disease associated with equine herpesvirus (EHV) infections.

Owners are cautioned to monitor horses at their premises carefully, and should contact their private veterinarians to arrange for equine herpesvirus testing if a horse exhibits significant temperature elevations or neurologic signs. Veterinarians are required to report equine neurologic syndrome to the department by calling the Animal Health Program.

The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (ODAFF) confirmed on [14 Nov 2019] that a 3 year old thoroughbred filly had been euthanized due to the severity of her clinical signs of the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). She first experienced signs, including acute onset, ataxia (loss of control of body movements), fever, and recumbency (inability to rise) on [12 Nov 2019].

"ODAFF was informed last night of a positive EHV-1 test sample from a horse stabled at Remington Park," said Michael Herrin, DVM, ODAFF assistant state veterinarian. "The horse was euthanized [Tue 12 Nov 2019] evening and the barn it was housed in is currently under quarantine."

The barn housed 66 other horses, which are now sidelined from racing for at least 14 days, during which they will be monitored for clinical signs and temperature exceeding 101.5Â°F.

EHV background
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM.

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis, or EHM) usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

There were 8 new confirmed cases of equine herpesvirus at Remington Park in the latest round of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture tests returned [Wed 27 Nov 2019], but all of the cases were asymptomatic and the horses have been placed in a special isolation barn on the backstretch, according to Matt Vance, Remington's vice president of racing operations.

Vance said 2 of the horses who returned positive tests last week tested negative for EHV-1 on [Wed 27 Nov 2019]. He also said no horses in the 1st of 2 barns quarantined since the initial confirmed case on [14 Nov 2019] tested positive [Wed 27 Nov 2019].

"All horses continue to be asymptomatic, showing no clinical signs of illness," Vance said. "The biggest thing right now is we don't have any sick horses."

Remington hopes to see the quarantine for the 1st barn lift by [5 Dec 2019]. The 14-day clock has been reset on the 2nd barn. Remington races through [15 Dec 2019 ]closing the meet with its co-richest race, the $400 000 Springboard Mile for 2 year olds. Nominations for the race and 5 undercard stakes supporting it have been extended a week, to [7 Dec 2019]. The Springboard Mile awards points for the Kentucky Derby. Entries are [11 Dec 2019].

Vance said he has been told by state veterinarians that Remington's strict policy concerning equine herpesvirus vaccination has played a role in containing the virus. It's also been key he said, that the positives have been kept in a special isolation barn.

Delta Downs, Fair Grounds, Louisiana Downs, Oaklawn, Sam Houston, the Downs at Albuquerque, Retama Park, and Zia Park are among tracks in the region that have temporarily closed their stable areas to horses from Remington. The facilities have varying restrictions in place.

[These articles certainly show how this disease, for which there is no vaccine can cause tremendous problems in the horse-related industries. It does not tell us the anxiety of the owners or their heart ache when an animal, be it pet or investment, is euthanized. - Mod.TG
