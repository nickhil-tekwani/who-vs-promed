Last week [week ending 1 Jun 2014], around 1900 children were hospitalized with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) nationwide, up 4 percent from the week before, the Health Ministry's Administration of Preventive Medicine reported yesterday [2 Jun 2014].

Since the beginning of the year [2014], there have been more than 24 700 cases of HFMD identified nationwide; 2 of those patients died of the disease. The number of cases represented a 14 percent drop from the same period last year [2013]. However, there were areas that have seen an increase in affected cases in comparison to last year's [2013] issue, including Ho Chi Minh City and other southern provinces such as Ba Ria- Vung Tau, Ca Mau, Soc Trang, Binh Duong, and Bac Lieu.

HFMD is an illness that causes sores in or on the mouth and on the hands, feet, and sometimes the buttocks and legs. The sores may be painful, but the illness usually doesn't last more than a week or so. The disease is common among children, but can also occur in adults. Although it can occur at any time of year, it's most common during the summer and fall.

[As demonstrated in the abstract of an Australian report (McMinn P, Stratov I, Nagarajan L, Davis S: Neurological manifestations of enterovirus 71 infection in children during an outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease in Western Australia. Clin Infect Dis. 2001;32: 236-242), enterovirus 71, 1st described in 1974, can have a variety of potentially fatal neurological complications:

"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease associated with neurological complications in young children. We report an outbreak of EV71-associated neurological disease that occurred from February through September 1999 in Perth, Western Australia. 14 children with culture-proven, EV71-induced neurological disease were identified. 9 patients (64 percent) developed severe neurological disease; 4 of these patients developed long-term neurological sequelae. Neurological syndromes included aseptic meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute transverse myelitis, acute cerebellar ataxia, opso-myoclonus syndrome, benign intracranial hypertension, and a febrile convulsion. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data indicated that immunopathology was a major factor in the pathogenesis of neurological disease in this outbreak. This finding is in contrast to reports of previous EV71 epidemics in which virus-induced damage to gray matter was the most frequent cause of neurological disease."

Although no commercial EV71 vaccine is yet available, a recent publication suggests a vaccine may be in the offing (Li R, Liu L, Mo Z, et al: An inactivated enterovirus 71 vaccine in healthy children. N Engl J Med 2014; 370:829-837). The abstract is shown below:

"We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial involving healthy children 6 to 71 months of age in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. 2 doses of an inactivated EV71 vaccine or placebo were administered intramuscularly, with a 4-week interval between doses, and children were monitored for up to 11 months. The primary end point was protection against hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by EV71.

"A total of 12 000 children were randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo. Serum neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 549 children who received the vaccine. The seroconversion rate was 100 percent 4 weeks after the 2 vaccinations, with a geometric mean titer of 170.6. Over the course of 2 epidemic seasons, the vaccine efficacy was 97.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 92.9 to 99.0) according to the intention-to-treat analysis and 97.3 percent (95 percent CI, 92.6 to 99.0) according to the per-protocol analysis. Adverse events, such as fever (which occurred in 41.6 percent of the participants who received vaccine vs. 35.2 percent of those who received placebo), were significantly more common in the week after vaccination among children who received the vaccine than among those who received placebo." - Mod.LL
