Citrus is a rapidly expanding fruit crop in Panama with a planted area of
[about 14 000] ha, with the crop destined for both table and juice
industries for local and foreign markets. Chiriqui Province in extreme
western Panama borders Costa Rica and grows 4300 ha of citrus that consists
primarily of Valencia and navel oranges with the remainder grown throughout
other provinces.
[Plants] in commercial groves in Potrerillos and Boquete in Chiriqui
Province were found with leaf (chlorotic spots or rings), stem (necrosis),
and fruit (localized ringlike or depressed lesions) symptoms similar to
those caused by Citrus leprosis virus (CiLV) (3). In Potrerillos, wood
samples about 3 years old were identified in two of the citrus groves,
indicating that the infection was established on or before 1996.
The mite _Brevipalpus phoenicis_ (Geijskes) (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) was
collected in all leprosis infected or suspected groves in both Potrerillos
and Boquete. CiLV is known to be transmitted by _B. obovatus_ Donnadieu and
_B. phoenicis_ in Argentina and Brazil, respectively (3). To confirm the
presence of this virus, 20 samples (12 from Boquete [B] and 8 from
Potrerillos [P]) of leaf and fruit lesions were fixed in a modified
Karnovsky solution and sent to Brazil for electron [microscopy] of thin
sections.
Cytopathic effects were found in 8 samples (2 from B and 6 from P),
characterized by a dense viroplasm in the cytoplasm and short, bacilliform
particles (50 to 60 x 100 to 110 nm) in the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum, features similar to those reported by A Colariccio [and
colleagues] (1). In 6 samples (5 from B, and 1 from P), the cytopathic
effects were similar to those observed in Orchid fleck virus (OFV) infected
cells (2), with an intranuclear, electron lucent viroplasm and short,
rodlike particles (40 to 50 nm x 100 nm) either within the nucleus or in
the cytoplasm, as previously reported for a sample of CiLV in Brazil (4).
The symptomatology, presence of the mite vector, characteristic cytopathic
effects, and presence of virions are considered [as] evidence that CiLV is
present within a 100 sq km area of Potrerillos and 25 sq km of Boquete in
Chiriqui Province. This is the first report of the presence of CiLV in
Central America, suggesting that the virus has spread northward from South
America.

[According to information provided by Richard Lee (University of Florida,
Citrus Research & Education Center, Lake Alfred, FL,
<richardlee@poboxes.com>), CiLV was originally reported in Florida but it
has not reported in that state since 1963. However, the vector is present
in that state. The disease has also been reported to be in Argentina and it
is a significant factor in citrus production in Brazil. Lee says that
results of current diagnostic tests should be confirmed by electron
microscopy assay for presence of LiCV virions. CiLV is a member of the
family _Rhabdoviridae_, genus _Nucleorhabdovirus_ but orchid fleck virus
has yet to be assigned to a taxon. - Mod.DH]
