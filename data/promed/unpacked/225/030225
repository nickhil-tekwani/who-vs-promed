Bovine brucellosis (suspect) - Fiji Islands
-------------------------------------------
Fiji Ministry of Primary Industries has pre-emptively slaughtered 264
cattle from 6 herds in the Central Division of Viti Levu on suspicion
of infection with _Brucella abortus_. The action was taken on the
basis of

(i) a clinical syndrome of abortion, weak calves, and increased
retention of afterbirth in a number of herds and
(ii) positive serology findings for brucellosis (screening by Rose
Bengal test and confirmed by CFT [complement fixation test]).

The mention of 314 'infected cattle' in recent postings refers to
reactive sera on Rose Bengal testing, of which only 264 were confirmed
by CFT. Reference to possible detection in the Western Division of
Viti Levu is similarly based on Rose Bengal screen testing of sera,
not yet confirmed by CFT.

The Fiji Ministry is in correspondence with the Australian Animal
Health Lab (AAHL) to confirm the presumptive diagnosis of brucellosis.
A regulatory 'hurdle' is currently being 'negotiated' to enable
suspect isolates to be sent to AAHL as soon as possible. THE Fiji
Ministry is intending to adopt _Brucella_ milk ring testing as a
screening tool for dairy herds. There are approximately 10 000 dairy
cattle in the local vicinity of the affected herds in the Central
Division, with herd sizes ranging from 30-500. Quarantine and movement
controls have been implemented.

USDA APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] is providing
advice on the possible application of RB51 strain vaccination.

The Secretariat of the Pacific Community is a regional
inter-governmental organisation that provides assistance to Pacific
island nations across social resource, public health, land resource,
and marine resource sectors.

[Strong surveillance testing and a vaccination program coupled with
quarantines and slaughter are needed to arrest the problem and achieve
eradication of this disease.

Surveillance testing consists of conducting a series of serological
tests to detect the presence of _Brucella abortus_ antibodies in the
animal. On the initial official screening test, animals testing
negative are classified as "negative" and are considered NOT to be
infected with brucellosis. Animals testing positive are classified as
"positive," and further testing is required to assist in a more
definitive diagnosis of brucellosis. Serological screening tests for
_Brucella abortus_ antibodies include the buffered acidified plate
antigen (BAPA) test, which is used solely in the laboratory, while the
"card agglutination" test, an official test, can be conducted at the
livestock markets or in the laboratory to classify animals as either
positive or negative. Samples testing positive on the BAPA test are
subsequently subjected to the "card agglutination" test in the
laboratory. If the "card agglutination" test is used at the market,
then the BAPA may be used in the laboratory as the next level of
screening. Screen test positive samples could come from either an
animal infected with field _Brucella abortus_ organisms or from an
animal having persistent antibodies to a brucellosis vaccination,
provided vaccination is being used.

To determine if a screen-test positive animal is either infected with
the disease or if it still has antibodies caused by vaccination, the
blood samples are subjected to official supplemental serological
testing. The Rivanol, the complement fixation (CF), and the particle
concentration fluorescent immunoassay (PCFIA) tests are official
supplemental serological tests used in the laboratory. The results of
the official supplemental testing are subsequently interpreted by a
trained brucellosis epidemiologist who makes the final determination
on the screen-positive animal; it is either designated as "suspect"
and will require further testing, or it is classified as a "reactor"
and must be sent to slaughter under permit to prevent the animal from
being diverted back to a herd.

Suspects, if they have not been slaughtered, are required to be
re-tested in 30 to 60 days. Quarantining the suspect animal or the
herd from which the suspect originated will be determined by the
trained epidemiologist. - Mod.TG]
