In May 2010, due to air travel and the current epidemics of dengue in
French Departments of America and the Indian Ocean, and chikungunya in
Reunion, dozens of imported cases are reported in the departments of the
south of France where the tiger mosquito has become established

Chikungunya virus is an arbovirus. Transmission is from person to person
via _Aedes_ mosquitoes.

The Institut de Veille Sanitaire (1) states that the introduction of the
virus in Reunion and Mayotte in 2005 resulted in an epidemic of high
magnitude that lasted until April 2007, when the 2 islands entered an
inter-epidemic phase characterized by sporadic circulation of the virus.

Apart from the "imported cases" of travelers who acquired infection in an
area where the chikungunya virus was circulating, no indigenous cases of
chikungunya virus (which would develop on the spot) have been currently
observed in other overseas metropolitan departments and territories. Yet
the potential transmission of chikungunya [virus] in metropolitan France is
geographically limited due to the location of the the mosquito vector
(_Aedes albopictus_, the tiger mosquito) and the possible introduction of
the viruses by persons infected at the viremic phase.

Symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection] are: after incubation for 4 - 7
days on average (1-12 days), high fever is accompanied by brutal arthralgia
(joint pain) may be intense, primarily affecting the extremities (wrists,
ankles, knuckles). Myalgia (muscle pain) also occurs, headache, and a
maculopapular rash. Also possible is a benign type of gingival bleeding
(bleeding gums), especially in children. Treatment is symptomatic
(analgesic, antipyretic).

The evolution is usually favorable, without sequelae, but it may also
evolve into a chronic phase characterized by persistent arthralgia.

Many [dengue and chikungunya] cases are regularly reported from the
overseas territories of France (2).
* Martinique, Guadeloupe and Guyana: dengue fever
* La Reunion: end of chikungunya outbreak in Plateau Caillou, but active
and persistent movement in the town of Saint-Paul, 115 indigenous cases of
dengue (serotype 3 virus)
* Mayotte: Indigenous circulation of dengue virus (39 cases), serotype 3 virus
* Guyana: since the beginning of the epidemic (last week of December
[2009]) it is estimated that the a total number of 6000 clinical cases
occurred, suggestive of dengue fever in the entire department.

On 30 Aug 2007, the Italian health authorities reported an outbreak of
chikungunya raged since early July 2007 in the province of Ravenna, Emilia
Romagna. The outbreak in Italy demonstrates the reality of the risk of
vectorborne chikungunya virus in parts of southern Europe. The Italian
region where the epidemic raged has climatic characteristics very similar
to those of the French departments where _Aedes albopictus_ is currently
located: Alpes-Maritime, Haute-Corse, Corse du Sud, and Var.

The accelerated monitoring of dengue and chikungunya, which has been
implemented on 1 May 2010 has permitted detection in the 5 departments
affected by _Aedes albopictus_ by 10 June 2010, of 40 suspected cases
(reported to the Regional Health Agencies and Paca Corsica). Of these
cases, 26 were RT-PCR and/or IgM positive confirming a recent infection
caused by dengue or chikungunya viruses. These 26 positive cases were all
imported. [Of these,] 20 were viremic [including]: 19 confirmed cases of
dengue fever (including 5 of serotype DENV-1 and 3 of DENV-3) and one case
of chikungunya. In regard to visits abroad, most had traveled in the
Caribbean (19 cases) or in the Indian Ocean (7 cases).

The evaluation carried out by entomological background EID-Mediterranee
(entomology services and vector control) throughout the PACA (Province,
Alpes Cote d'Azur) region has confirmed that the activity of _Aedes
albopictus_ had resumed intensively in the Alpes-Maritimes, and debuted in
the Var and the Bouches du Rhone.

Prevention is based on individual means of protection against mosquito
bites (spray, cream, coils, electric diffusers, long clothing, mosquito
nets, use of air conditioning). The community prevention involves the
elimination of potential breeding sites (stagnant water) near the houses.

Notes:
1. Public institution under the supervision of the Ministry of Health,
Institute of Health Surveillance (VS) met the tasks of monitoring,
vigilance and alert in all areas of public health.
2. The overseas territories are: New Caledonia - French Polynesia - Wallis
and Futuna, French Departments of America - Reunion - Mayotte

[ProMED-mail does not usually report cases of individuals infected with
either dengue or chikungunya viruses imported into Europe. However, the
presence of _Aedes albopictus_ (a competent vector of these viruses) in
southern Europe presents a clear risk of ongoing virus transmission.

Interestingly, a 9 Jun 2010 report in Monde Actu.com
(<http://mondeactu.com/sante/denguechikungunya-le-moustique-aedes-albopictus-a-marseille-6249.html>)
indicated that _Aedes albopictus_ has been discovered in Marseille, and
health authorities were acting to control it before dengue or chikungunya
viruses were introduced into the city.
