Central African Republic: Hepatitis E Virus Infection Identified in Bangui
--------------------------------------------------
Medical technicians have identified the presence of hepatitis E virus in the
northern suburbs of Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic
(CAR), after 3 months of uncertainty. "When the medical doctor coordinating
Begoua Health Centre informed us on 22 Jul 2002, we sent an assessment
mission there that concluded that there was a serious problem," Dr Carlos
Recio, the medical coordinator of Medicos Sin Fronteras-Spain (MSF), told
IRIN on Wed 9 Oct 2002. He added that the first blood tests carried out by
Institut Pasteur from Tuesday to Wednesday showed that 48 of 98 cases tested
positive for the [virus].
An emergency committee comprising officials from the Ministry of Health,
MSF, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Institut Pasteur, and the
National Laboratory has been set up to tackle the problem. The WHO says the
hepatitis E virus causes acute sporadic and epidemic viral hepatitis.
Typical symptoms of the disease include jaundice, anorexia, inflammation of
the liver, abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and vomiting, and fever, it
says. The disease is spread via the oral-faecal route, and has been
implicated in several food and waterborne outbreaks, WHO says. "Consumption
of faecally contaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemic cases,
and the ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of
sporadic cases in endemic areas," the UN agency reports.
MSF, the CAR Red Cross, and a local NGO, Jeunesse centrafricaine conquerante
pour le developpement, have intensified the public information campaign in
the different neighbourhoods of Begoua. WHO says control measures against
the disease should include the provision of safe drinking water and proper
disposal of sanitary waste and other measures. In line with this, MSF has
proposed that wells be dug at least 30 metres away from latrines, & that the
government strictly enforce laws on domestic animals and provide the public
with clean water. "We hope that with the dry season the epidemic will
disappear," Recio said.

[Hepatitis E virus (HEV), previously considered to be a calicivirus-like
agent, is now ranked as a separate unassigned genus. Although similar in
structure and genome organisation to caliciviruses, HEV exhibits weak
phylogenetic links with rubella virus, alphaviruses, and plant furoviruses.
In humans, HEV is associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases of
enterically transmitted acute hepatitis. It has an incubation period of 2-7
weeks and appears to be spread mainly in water. Large water-borne epidemics
have occurred in India and morbidity and mortality are greatest in pregnant
women. HEV is considered to be endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions
of Asia, Africa, and Central America. However, antibody prevalence suggests
that the virus is distributed more widely in less pathogenic forms.
A virus closely related to HEV has been isolated from swine. It is unclear
whether the outbreak described above is due to poor sanitation or is
indicative of the appearance of a strain of enhanced virulence. - Mod.CP]
