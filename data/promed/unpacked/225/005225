STREP A: PERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION? - USA (NEW YORK)
========================================================
Date: Sun, 9 Mar 1997
From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>
Source: Newspaper report

The Washington Post (Sun, 9 March) published a report based on other media
sources that an outbreak of _Streptococcus_ Group A (necrotizing fasciitis)
in a Rochester, New York hospital has taken the life of one woman and
infected two others in the same maternity ward, indicating person-to-person
transmission of the bacteria. The woman died Friday. The hospital has
confirmed that "several patients with Group A streptococcus" are being
treated, but the officials there have not confirmed the death as a result of
the so called "flesh-eating" bacteria, saying only that the cause of death
is still under investigation. However, family members of the deceased woman
told a local Rochester newspaper that the diagnosis given to them was
necrotizing fasciitis.
