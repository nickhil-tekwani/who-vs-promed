[1] UK: no evidence omicron symptoms milder
Date: Sat 18 Dec 2021

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/18/no-evidence-omicron-milder-than-delta-british-researchers-say


British researchers say they have found "no evidence" that the omicron coronavirus variant is milder than delta, casting doubt on the cautious optimism of some experts that the new strain may not be as virulent and not overwhelm healthcare systems.

The study [see citation below] by Imperial College London (ICL) on Friday [17 Dec 2021] -- released just as British officials reported record COVID-19 cases for the 3rd consecutive day, with a rise to 93 045 new infections -- also found that the risk of reinfection with omicron is more than 5 times higher than delta.

The non-peer-reviewed research was based on UK Health Security Agency and National Health Service data on people who tested positive for COVID-19 in a PCR test in England between 29 Nov and 11 Dec [2021].

"We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of omicron having different severity from delta," the study said, although it added that data on hospitalisations remains very limited. "Controlling for vaccine status, age, sex, ethnicity, asymptomatic status, region, and specimen date, omicron was associated with a 5.4-fold higher risk of reinfection compared with delta," the study, which was dated 16 Dec [2021], added.

In South Africa, whose scientists were the 1st to identify omicron last month [November 2021], early anecdotal accounts have suggested that the new variant is causing less severe illness than previous ones, but scientists say it is too early to draw firm conclusions. The country reported a record number of daily infections earlier this week.

"We believe that it might not necessarily just be that omicron is less virulent, but ... coverage of vaccination [and] ... natural immunity of people who have already had contact with the virus is also adding to the protection," Health Minister Joe Phaahla told a news conference on Friday [17 Dec 2021]. "That's why we are seeing mild illness."

However, ICL said in a statement that protection afforded by past infection against reinfection with omicron may be as low as 19%, according to its research.

The study, which involved AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, also found a significantly increased risk of developing a symptomatic omicron case compared with delta for those who were 2 or more weeks past their 2nd jab dose, and 2 or more weeks past their booster dose.

Depending on the estimates used for vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection from the delta variant, this translates into vaccine effectiveness of between 0% and 20% after 2 doses, and between 55% and 80% after a booster dose.

"This study provides further evidence of the very substantial extent to which omicron can evade prior immunity given by both infection or vaccination," study lead Professor Neil Ferguson said in ICL's statement. "This level of immune evasion means that omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health."

But Dr Clive Dix, former chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, said it was important not to overinterpret the data.

"The conclusions made are based on making assumptions about omicron where we still don't have sufficient data," Dix said. "For example, we have no data on the cellular immune response that is now probably driving effectiveness of vaccines." He added: "This is a crucial missing assumption in the modelling."

Some of the conclusions are different from the data emerging from South Africa, where vaccines are holding up well against severe disease and death at present, he said.

"There is a huge amount of uncertainty in these modelled estimates, and we can only be confident about the impact of boosters against omicron when we have another month of real-world data on hospitalisation ICU numbers and deaths," he said.

An earlier study by Britain's SIREN looking at reinfection risk in health workers, which was carried out before omicron emerged, found that a 1st coronavirus infection offered 85% protection from a 2nd for the following 6 months.

The data analysed by ICL was based on 333 000 cases, including 122 062 of delta and 1846 that were confirmed as the omicron coronavirus variant through genome sequencing.

The new findings could accelerate the imposition of tighter restrictions across several European countries in a bid to stem the new variant's spread.

"Given the rapid spread of the omicron variant to date, it is now highly likely that this will replace the circulating delta variant globally in the coming weeks," ICL Professor Azra Ghani said. "One remaining uncertainty is how severe the disease caused by the omicron variant is compared to disease caused by previous variants. Whilst it may take several weeks to fully understand this, governments will need to put in place plans now to mitigate any potential impact. Our results demonstrate the importance of delivering booster doses as part of the wider public health response."

Meanwhile, the UK Health Security Agency said omicron cases were doubling in less than 2 days in all regions of England, apart from the southwest. The variant is already estimated to account for more than 80% of new cases in London.

The variant has not caused large-scale hospitalisations or deaths as yet, though there is always a lag between infection and severe disease.

[2] WHO: omicron cases

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/18/omicron-cases-doubling-at-least-every-3-days-who-says


The omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading significantly faster than the delta strain in countries with documented community transmission, with the number of cases doubling in 1.5 to 3 days, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. In an update on Saturday [18 Dec 2021], the United Nations' health agency said omicron has been reported in 89 countries.

The highly mutated variant is spreading rapidly in countries with high levels of population immunity, the WHO said, but it is unclear if this is due to the virus' ability to evade immunity, its inherent increased transmissibility, or a combination of both.

The agency designated omicron a variant of concern on 26 Nov [2021], soon after it was first detected by scientists in South Africa, and much is still not known about it. Scientists remain uncertain how dangerous it is, but early data suggests it can be more resistant to vaccines and more transmissible than the delta variant.

"There are still limited data on the clinical severity of omicron," the WHO said in its update. "More data are needed to understand the severity profile and how severity is impacted by vaccination and pre-existing immunity." It added, "There are still limited available data, and no peer-reviewed evidence, on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness to date for omicron."

On Friday [17 Dec 2021], a non-peer reviewed study by Imperial College London said the risk of reinfection with omicron is more than 5 times higher, and it has shown no sign of being milder than delta [see item [1] above].

The research cast doubt on the cautious optimism of some experts, based primarily on anecdotal accounts from South Africa, that the new strain may not be as virulent and not overwhelm healthcare systems.

The study was released as British officials reported record COVID-19 cases for the 3rd consecutive day, with a rise to 93 045 new infections, while French Prime Minister Jean Castex likened omicron's spread in Europe to "lightning."

On Thursday [16 Dec 2021], United States President Joe Biden warned of a "winter of severe illness and death" for those unvaccinated against COVID-19, while health ministers at the G7 bloc of advanced economies called omicron the biggest threat to global public health.

It came after WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said omicron "is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant" and lamented that some people were dismissing it as a mild variant.

"Surely we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril," he told a media briefing on Tuesday [14 Dec 2021]. "Even if omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems."

[3] Omicron spread
Date: Thu 16 Dec 2021
Source: GPB News [edited]
https://www.gpb.org/news/goats-and-soda/2021/12/16/tantalizing-clue-why-omicron-spreading-so-quickly


Omicron is spreading lightning fast.

In the US, the percentage of cases caused by this new coronavirus variant jumped 7 times in just a week, from 0.4% of the total cases sequenced to 2.9%, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. And it's already causing about 13% of cases in a region that includes New York and New Jersey.

In a household, the risk of spreading the omicron variant to another member is 3 times higher than it is with the delta variant, UK health officials estimated Friday [17 Dec 2021]. And delta, as you may know, is considered highly transmissible.

Why is omicron such a superspreading variant?

Preliminary data [https://www.med.hku.hk/en/news/press/20211215-omicron-sars-cov-2-infection?utm_medium= social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=press_rele], published online Wednesday [15 Dec 2021], gives us the 1st look at how omicron may behave inside the respiratory tract, and the data offers a tantalizing clue as to why this heavily mutated variant is spreading so fast and even outcompeting delta.

The omicron variant multiplies about 70 times faster inside human respiratory tract tissue than the delta variant does, scientists at the University of Hong Kong report. The variant also reaches higher levels in the tissue, compared with delta, 48 hours after infection.

"That's amazing," says immunologist Wilfredo Garcia-Beltran, who's a fellow at the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital and wasn't involved in the study. This finding indicates that mutations in omicron have sped up the process of entering or replicating (or both) inside the tissue. But how this finding, from tissue studied in the lab, relates to viral loads inside an actual person's respiratory tract is still unknown, he emphasizes.

These findings from the University of Hong Kong haven't been peer reviewed, and the experiments occurred entirely inside cell tissue. Nonetheless, the research supports another study, published online Tuesday [14 Dec 2021], from Garcia-Beltran and his colleagues that also suggests omicron is more infectious than delta.

Using "fake" or pseudoviruses, they found that omicron's spike protein -- the region that binds to human cells, triggering infection -- was much better at helping the virus enter human cells than the spike protein of delta or that of the original coronavirus.

"Strikingly, omicron was 4-fold more infectious than wild type [the original version of the virus] and 2-fold more infectious than delta," Garcia-Beltran and colleagues wrote in their study.

The data suggests omicron may be able to infect people at a lower dose than delta or the original variant, Garcia-Beltran says. "That's a very far-out interpretation," he cautions. "But we think it will probably pan out that way, given that we're looking at a variant with more efficient entry into human cells."

In the Hong Kong study, virologist Michael Chan Chi-wai and his colleagues took tissue from human bronchi, the 2 large tubes in your respiratory tract that bring air to your lungs. The researchers infected the tissue with live, replicating particles of SARS-CoV-2 virus. They used 3 versions of the virus: delta, omicron, and a variant that was circulating in 2020.

Then the researchers looked to see how fast each variant spread through the respiratory tissue. Within 24 hours, omicron had infected the tissue at 70 times the level observed with the delta variant.

Chan and his colleagues also ran the experiments with lung tissue. Interestingly, inside that tissue, omicron was less efficient at infecting cells than delta or the original version of the virus.

"The infection is more focused on the bronchia than the lungs and very fast," wrote Marc Veldhoen on Twitter. He's an immunologist at the University of Lisbon.

This focus on the respiratory tract, instead of the lungs, may suggest that omicron could cause less severe disease compared with delta or the original version of the virus. But many scientists, including Veldhoen, say it's too soon to draw that conclusion.

"More infectious than delta is not good, particularly if you do not have immunity!" Veldhoen adds. "Without fast immunity, the virus can quickly disseminate from the bronchia to the lungs and other organs and do some serious damage!"

Infectious disease doctor Sumon Chakrabarti at Trillium Health Partners in Ontario agrees. "Very interesting study showing proof of concept [for] why omicron is more transmissible than delta. Interesting about less replication in lung vs. airways," he wrote on Twitter. "Caution with overinterpretation. ... [The idea] needs more study."

Furthermore, respiratory tissue is a far cry from actual living bronchi inside a person, says Alejandro Balazs, who's a virologist at Harvard Medical School. The Hong Kong study "looks interesting, for sure. But you have to always be careful how you interpret studies outside of animals and human patients."

For starters, he says, the isolated tissue doesn't generate much immune response to fight the virus. And in the study, the researchers monitored the virus's infection only over a 48-hour period. "This experiment is happening in a very short period of time in a dish," he says. "We don't know for sure that omicron infects this bronchial tissue better than lung tissue. Or what happens 72 hours later."

Scientists need to measure the viral loads inside people's respiratory tracts, adds Garcia-Beltran. With delta, people have, on average, 1000 times more virus particles in their respiratory tracts than with the original variants.

"I want to see what the viral loads look like for omicron," he says. "Samples from people who are actually infected: that's the gold standard. That's where the action is."

https://www.france24.com/en/france/20211217-france-to-reduce-delay-between-second-and-third-covid-19-shots


France said on Friday [17 Dec 2021] it will reduce the time between 2nd and 3rd COVID-19 vaccination injections to 4 months and will require people to show proof of vaccination to enter some venues as the omicron variant is set to become dominant.

French Prime Minister Jean Castex said that starting in January [2022], the gap between 2nd and 3rd immunizations would shorten by a month from 5 months.

Castex also said that major public parties and fireworks will be banned on New Year's Eve and recommended that people -- even if vaccinated -- take a self-test before getting together for year-end parties.

To increase pressure on people to get vaccinated, the government will present a bill early next year [2022] to change the French health pass into a vaccination pass. That means people will have to be vaccinated in order to enter restaurants or use long-distance public transport. Under the current rules, a recent negative test can serve as a health pass even without vaccination.

"We cannot allow that the refusal of a few French people to get vaccinated affect the life of the entire country," Castex said in a televised speech.

Castex said that because of the rapid spread of the omicron variant in Britain, travel from Britain to France will not be allowed starting Saturday unless the travelers are French, have a French partner, or are a permanent resident in France.

https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/France-s-Omicron-case-numbers-probably-hugely-underestimated


The official number of French cases of the new omicron variant is "probably hugely underestimated" due to the fact that France sequences cases on a much smaller scale, a leading epidemiologist has said.

Professor Mahmoud Zureik of the Universite de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines told Franceinfo that the surge in omicron infections that is already happening across the Channel in the UK could arrive in France "in the next 2-3 weeks."

In the UK, a record 88 376 new COVID cases were recorded yesterday [16 Dec 2021] alone, almost 10 000 more than the previous record, which had been set just a day earlier [15 Dec 2021].

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/18/us/professional-sports-covid-case-increase-spt/index.html


When football season kicked off back in September [2021], it felt like normalcy was returning to a world upended by COVID-19.

Fans packed stadiums at both college and professional games, eager to watch their favorite teams play, despite the surging delta variant of the coronavirus.

Basketball and hockey's respective seasons soon began, too, with additional protocols, mandates, and testing requirements for players and staff.

But the omicron variant, which scientists believe to be more contagious, is increasing its grip on the US: another potential threat to pro sports leagues, their players, and their seasons.

"The sports world, until very recently -- like the last week or maybe 2 weeks -- had done a pretty good job of keeping a lid on things, and that was because they were actually doing better than most areas of the real world," said Zach Binney, a sports epidemiologist at Oxford College at Emory University.

What started out as a sports season of hope has turned into one of, yet again, panic and uncertainty as leagues attempt to adapt to the most recent wave of infections, a reflection of what is happening in localities across the country.

Former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told CNN's "New Day" Thursday [16 Dec 2021] others should pay attention to pro sports because "they're really a window into community spread."

"Kudos to the sports leagues because they are actually doing a fantastic job of surveillance testing," Adams said. "And the rest of the country, we're driving a car down a dark road with the headlights off while looking in the rearview mirror, and we hit a bump and we say what was that? That's our surveillance system right now for COVID."

All 3 major sports leagues in season right now -- NFL, NBA, and NHL -- implemented strict testing protocols early on and required at least Tier 1 personnel, like coaches or anyone with direct contact with athletes, to get vaccinated. No major professional sports league in the United States has required its players to be vaccinated.

Even without a mandate, large percentages of athletes in each league have received the vaccine, according to numbers from each league. The NFL said Wednesday [15 Dec 2021] that 94.6% of players are vaccinated. The NBA touted in November [2021] that 97% of players were vaccinated, a league source told CNN, and the NHL said in October [2021] that all but 4 players were vaccinated.

That has not prevented the most recent outbreaks, though, forcing the leagues to tweak their COVID-19 policies.

As of Tuesday [14 Dec 2021], 28 NFL players have tested positive for COVID-19, just one day after the league reported 37 positive tests Monday [13 Dec 2021].

The league announced a return to more stringent protocols Thursday [16 Dec 2021], which will be effective until Monday [20 Dec 2021], according to a league memo. Teams have to reimpose restrictions such as mandatory mask-wearing while indoors in team facilities, social distancing, grab-and-go meal service in team cafeterias, limits on the number of people allowed in weight rooms, restrictions on activities outside the facility including dining out to eat on the road, and all-virtual meetings.

The NFL will also require Tier 1 and Tier 2 staff to get a COVID-19 booster shot by 27 Dec [2021], according to a league memo. This mandate does not apply to NFL players. Tier 1 and Tier 2 staff are coaches and anyone that has direct contact with players.

The NBA and its players' union recommended all vaccinated players and other personnel in close contact with players receive a booster dose "as soon as possible," according to a November [2021] memo. The memo also noted that 26 of the 30 teams compete in areas with COVID-19 transmission that is labeled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as "high."

In a memo Saturday [18 Dec 2021], the NHL and its players' union outlined "enhanced measures" that will be in place through at least 7 Jan [2022], including a mask requirement at all times inside NHL club facilities and during travel. The league is also restricting dining at indoor restaurants while teams are on the road unless they're seated in private areas.

Daily COVID-19 testing will be required for anyone who travels with an NHL club and others who are in close proximity to players. There may also be additional pre-game testing "on a case-by-case basis."

Binney told CNN he thought waning immunity and an uptick in contact over the Thanksgiving holiday potentially contributed to the recent breakouts, but he thought the potential surge would have "hit earlier and slower" than the recent spike in professional sports leagues.

Alex Piquero, chair of the department of sociology and criminology at the University of Miami, told CNN that "what we're seeing in the general population is what we're starting to see in some of the athletic leagues."

Recent surges in positive cases have forced cities to reinstate mandates and protocols not seen since earlier in the year [2021]. As of Wednesday [15 Dec 2021], the US average of daily COVID-19 cases -- 119 888 -- is 50% higher than it was a month ago, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

As a result, cities like New York are reimplementing mask indoor mandates. And as of Wednesday [15 Dec 2021], California is requiring masks in indoor public settings for the next month.

Philadelphia announced Monday [13 Dec 2021] it will require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for admission to indoor restaurants, theaters, and entertainment venues where food or drinks are served.

Dr. Scott Miscovich similarly attributed the ongoing struggles in professional sports in part to "waning immunity" and a lack of boosters.

Even though vaccination compliance across pro leagues is high, "we have now 50% at best immunity if you've had 2 shots," said Miscovich, the CEO of Premier Medical Group and the COVID testing medical director for USA Olympic swimming, track and field, rugby, and gymnastics. "We are not seeing a lot of the leagues prior to this pushing boosters," he said, "which is what was needed to get them up to a point where they're not going to get infected. The 2nd thing is, hey, it's the holidays," Miscovich said. "I'm sure people are getting together, and that's going to lead to spread."

Piquero told CNN despite the mirage of potential normalcy, it's important to remember the pandemic isn't over.

[Sporting events and many other forms of performance are being affected by COVID. Hours before it was scheduled to begin, the Mark Morris Dance Company canceled its performances in Berkeley, California, when a number of COVID tests came back positive. And sadly, this was the beginning of their national tour, the 1st after the shut-down. It looks like sports and live performance in the new year are going to begin in fits and starts as omicron spreads through the population. Although everyone is tired of masking, people need to maintain a high level of personal protection through the winter at least. - Mod.LK]
