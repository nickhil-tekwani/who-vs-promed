Encephalitis Death in Negri Sembilan Causes Alarm
-------------------------------------------------
SEREMBAN: The Negri Sembilan Health Department has sent blood specimens
from a worker from Bukit Pelanduk who died of encephalitis to University
Hospital for testing. Its director, Datuk Dr. Ahmad Razin Ahmad Mahir, said
a post-mortem had been conducted on the deceased worker and it showed that
he had died of encephalitis. "But we do not know the cause of the
encephalitis, whether it is caused by Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus,
Nipah virus or some other virus," he said yesterday. The department was
waiting for the results which were expected to be ready in 2 weeks' time.
The patient was admitted to a hospital here on 26 Jan 2001 and died 3 days
later after he lapsed into a coma. "So far, there is no new reported case
of JE virus or Nipah virus from Bukit Pelanduk," he said.
Bukit Pelanduk residents were evacuated 2 years ago following the Japanese
encephalitis virus/Nipah virus outbreak that killed more than 100 people.
Dr. Razin explained that the victim had shown symptoms of encephalitis
during the height of that outbreak. He added that the victim had been
involved in the pig-culling exercise during that outbreak. MCA Assemblyman
Datuk Lee Yuen Fong, who was the Lukut Operations Centre Chief during the
outbreak, yesterday urged people to contact the health department
immediately if they knew of anyone who showed signs of the disease.

Encephalitis Death of Livestock Worker As Yet Undiagnosed
----------------------------------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian health authorities on Sun 25 Feb 2001 confirmed
that the death of a livestock worker in late January was due to an
encephalitis virus. Negri Sembilan health director Ahmad Razin Mahir,
however, said it could not be confirmed whether the 22-year-old victim had
died of Japanese encephalitis virus or Nipah virus infection. The victim's
boss, a cattle and goat trader, was quoted by The Sunday Star as saying
that the victim suffered fever and vomiting, and died after he went into a
coma.
Last year health authorities expressed fears that a pig-borne virus that
killed 105 people in 1998 and 1999 was making a comeback. A medical officer
had said workers were not practising good animal husbandry despite constant
surveillance by veterinary officials.
In October 1998 a viral epidemic broke out in Perak and spread south to
Negri Sembilan 2 months later. Selangor state was also hit. The outbreak
crippled the 1.5 billion ringgit ($395 million) industry. Authorities named
the [causative agent Nipah virus after a badly-hit village in Negri
Sembilan. Bernama said that the victim, who died on 29 Jan 2001, had
symptoms of the pig-borne disease when the outbreak hit Negri Sembilan.
Ahmad Razin advised members of the public, especially those once infected
by the Japanese encephalitis virus or Nipah virus, to undergo a check-up at
state hospitals.

[Japanese encephalitis virus infection is endemic in South-east Asia. Nipah
virus, on the other hand, is a newly discovered paramyxovirus responsible
for an outbreak of severe encephalitis in Malaysia during the period Oct
1998 to midsummer 1999. The mortality rate for hospitalized cases was
approximately 35 per cent. Nipah virus infection was initially confused
with Japanese encephalitis virus infection, until it became clear that
vaccination and mosquito control measures were having no effect. A
concurrent Nipah virus-associated respiratory disease in pigs resulted in
the culling of more than one million pigs. Fruit bats of the genus
_Pteropus_ are the likely principal reservoir host of Nipah virus.
These 2 reports betray a surprising lack of urgency in view of the
apprehension that Nipah virus may have re-emerged. It is almost 4 weeks
since the victim died and apparently the results of laboratory tests are
not expected for another 2 weeks. It is implied that the victim may have
been exposed to Nipah virus during the 1998 outbreak. If this is correct,
it suggests that immunity to Nipah virus may be short-lived. There is no
evidence that Nipah virus can initiate a persistent infection.
However, the situation is confused, as a different (online) AP report
located by Patricia Doyle differs in significant detail. This version
states that the victim had exhibited signs and symptoms of Japanese
encephalitis virus infection when he took part in the cull of Nipah
virus-infected pigs. It is also stated that the national news agency
Bernama reported that victim's employer was admitted to hospital in early
January with an unknown illness which caused him to fall into a coma for 3
days.
A laboratory-authenticated diagnosis is an urgent necessity. - Mod.CP
