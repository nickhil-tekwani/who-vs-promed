Territorians and visitors alike are being reminded to protect themselves against the potentially deadly soil-borne disease melioidosis, with heavy wet season rains causing an increase in cases. There have been 16 cases of melioidosis reported in the Northern Territory since October 2017, with some people hospitalised and requiring intensive care.

Northern Territory Centre for Disease Control director Dr Vicki Krause said there have been 9 cases of melioidosis reported over the past 2 weeks. "The heavy downpour and strong winds over the last 2 weeks have led to a marked rise in the number of melioidosis cases in the Northern Territory," she said.

Although melioidosis is much less common in children, parents are being urged to ensure their children are wearing appropriate protective footwear and cover abrasions and cuts with a waterproof dressing to reduce direct exposure to mud and standing water.

"The incubation period from when someone is exposed and infected to when they become acutely unwell can range from one to 21 days," Dr Krause said. "In some cases the onset of symptoms is more gradual and can take longer to present."

Caused by the tropical bacteria known as _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ melioidosis can cause a variety of symptoms and signs including pneumonia, skin ulcers or sores, abscesses, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and occasionally headaches and confusion.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
