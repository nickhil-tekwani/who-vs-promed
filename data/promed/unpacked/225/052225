About 500 children were admitted to hospital in Nongoma to be treated
for food poisoning on Friday [20 Feb 2009], the KwaZulu-Natal health
department said. They are believed to have eaten rotten mincemeat,
said Leon Mbangwa. They were taken to the Benedictine Hospital in the
area for treatment.

[The etiology of this episode cannot be elucidated without
information regarding incubation period, symptom complex, whether
fever was present and the results of any cultures.

Mincemeat is a mixture of chopped dried fruit, distilled spirits and
spices, and sometimes beef suet, beef, or venison. Originally,
mincemeat always contained meat. Although not stated as such in the
posting, it is possible that the vehicle was minced meat.
