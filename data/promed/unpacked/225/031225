I ran the following through Gideon www.GideonOnline.com :
India, epidemic, fatal infection, encephalitis.

Assuming a single infectious etiology, the following are suggested as
althernative diagnoses which might not be included in routine testing:
Nipah virus infection
Kyasanur Forest disease
Chandipura
West Nile fever

Gideon also lists two additional regional diseases which have not been
reported in India to date:
Tick-borne encephalitis (? milk-borne)
Banna virus infection

[It would be of interest to know if the Indian National Institute of Virology tested for any of the above pathogens when they processed cerebral spinal fluid and blood samples of the 73 patients from Muzaffarpur district. Interestingly, the Gideon search does not list enteroviruses. Many of the reports from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states associate the encephalitis cases with polluted water, suggesting enterovirus etiologies. ProMED thanks Steve Berger for providing the Gideon information.
