Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever has been diagnosed in cases occurring in a
village in the district of Rustaq, Province of Takar in mid-March 1998. A
total of 19 cases of which 12 were fatal were reported. Rustaq district, in
the north-eastern part of Afghanistan, was severely affected by the
earthquake in early February and access was further complicated by melting
snow. However, representatives from United Nations and non-governmental
organizations were on site to provide assistance and notified WHO about the
outbreak. The WHO country office organized with the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and Medecins Sans
Frontieres the investigation and management of the cases. Blood specimens
were shipped to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on
Special Pathogens at the Centre for Applied
Medical Research, Public Health Laboratory Service, Porton Down,United
Kingdom. Serological testing (IgG/IgM antibody) provided evidence for
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus infection. Other virological testing
is in progress at Porton Down.

[Is it a coincidence that these cases are being reported at the same time
as the cases from Pakistan or is there an epidemiological connection? -
