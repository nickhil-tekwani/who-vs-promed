On Tuesday, government officials urged ranchers in southern Brazil to
slaughter thousands of cattle after 11 cases of highly contagious
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were discovered over the weekend.
Officials were already planning to vaccinate millions of cattle in the
region, near the border with Uruguay and Argentina. Now they're asking
farms in a 2-mile radius of the ranch where the disease was discovered to
kill and incinerate their animals.
"We are trying to convince ranchers in and around the affected area to
slaughter their herds," an Agriculture Ministry official said on condition
of anonymity. He said thousands of cattle could be slaughtered, but did not
have an exact number.
If the farmers refuse the slaughter proposal, then their animals would be
included among those to be vaccinated, the official said.
The disease has infected 11 cows near the border with Uruguay, which is
battling an outbreak of the disease. The affected ranch is located about
740 miles southwest of Sao Paulo in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
Both the slaughter and the vaccine program are aimed at preventing the
spread of the disease to other areas of Brazil, which has one of the
largest commercial cattle herds in the world, with 160 million head.

Brazil's southern ranching circuit may have a second case of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) on its hands only days after the first outbreak was confirmed
in Rio Grande do Sul, the state Agriculture Secretariat said.
A small but as yet unknown number of cattle in the town of Alegrete in Rio
Grande do Sul's interior showed signs associated with the disease.
"Field examination could not confirm it was FMD. The cattle had sores
around their mouths, but it could be a vesicular disease with similar
symptoms to foot-and-mouth," said a spokesman at the Agriculture Secretariat.
"The Agriculture Ministry's laboratory will examine blood samples taken
from the cattle. So far, we have not taken a containment policy on the
area. It is likely to be a couple days before we know the results."
Brazil's southernmost prime ranching state suffered its first outbreak in
over 10 months on Sunday when 11 cattle in Santana do Livramento, 3 km from
the border with Uruguay, were confirmed to have FMD.
Brazil -- pasture to the world's largest herd of 167 million head -- has
been scrambling to vaccinate its Rio Grande do Sul border with Uruguay and
Argentina, both of which have been in the grips of their own recent
multiple outbreaks of the virus.

On Wednesday, the government announced its southern state's entire herd of
13 million head of cattle will be vaccinated to prevent the spread of
highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).
The announcement of the vaccinations in Rio Grande do Sul was made at a
news conference by Agriculture Minister Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes.
Originally, the government had planned to vaccinate some 4 million head of
cattle after 11 cases were detected over the weekend in Rio Grande do Sul,
near the border with Uruguay.
"The only animals so far infected are the 11 in Santana do Livramento,"
Paulo Pons, a spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry's livestock protection
division said referring to the region where the outbreak occurred.
In other affected South American countries, Argentina has confirmed 291
cases and Uruguay 190. Both are conducting massive vaccination campaigns,
with Uruguay vaccinating its entire herd of 10 million.
