As many as 4 more people have become ill with _Escherichia coli_ linked to contaminated soy nut butter, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on [Tue 7 Mar 2017], bringing the total number of reported cases to 16. A total of 8 of the ill individuals have been hospitalized. Of those hospitalized, 5 have suffered hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure that can be life-threatening, although most people recover within a few weeks. "Ill people range in age from 2 to 48 years, with a median age of 10. Fourteen (88 per cent) of the 16 ill people are younger than 18 years old," said CDC in a report on the outbreak investigation.

The most recently reported symptoms began on [Tue 21 Feb 2017] and took an average of 2 or 3 weeks to be reported. Symptoms of _E. coli_ illness usually begin 2 to 8 days after consuming the bacterium. They include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Most people recover in 5 to 7 days, although 5 to 10 per cent of individuals diagnosed with this type of _E. coli_ illness develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, according to CDC.

The newly reported illnesses were in Missouri, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, bringing the total number of states involved in the outbreak to 9. Previous cases were reported in Arizona, California, Maryland, New Jersey and Oregon.

I.M. Healthy expanded its recall [Tue 7 Mar 2017] to include all its soy nut butter varieties as well as all its granola products, regardless of "best by" dates marked on the packaging. The company initially recalled only its original creamy SoyNut Butter with specific "best by" dates. As part of the ongoing investigation, health officials have spoken with all but 1 of the ill individuals. All reported consuming these products within the week before their symptoms began. The products are sold nationwide online and at stores. Consumers are advised to discard any of the products and not to consume them.

The SoyNut Butter Co. of Glenview, IL is recalling all varieties of I.M. Healthy SoyNut Butters and all varieties of I.M.

[The number of cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with this enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ outbreak is now 5 out of a total of 16, an attack rate of 31 per cent. This is substantially higher than the most standard 5-10 per cent although the numbers are, at this point, small. We await more information regarding the outbreak strain and its toxin production. - Mod.LL
