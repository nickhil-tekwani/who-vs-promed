RABIES, FELINE - USA (ILLINOIS)(02): NOT
***************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Connie Austin <CAUSTIN@idph.state.il.us>
A correction is needed to the ProMED-mail report about a rabid cat in
Bloomington, Illinois.
This cat tested initially positive for rabies in Illinois. Our policy is
to send all terrestrial animal samples testing positive for rabies to CDC
for confirmation. The test at CDC was negative, leading to a final result
of negative for the cat. Since a lab did identify the specimen as positive
for rabies, we advised continuing rabies treatment for the exposed
individuals, but the cat will not be counted as a rabid cat in Illinois
statistics.
This of course does not negate the message about the importance of rabies
vaccination for pets.

[ProMED-mail appreciates Dr. Austin's clarifying why the animal would not
be counted in the statistics for Illinois. Her reminder of the importance
of having animals vaccinated is most appropriate.- Mod.TG]
