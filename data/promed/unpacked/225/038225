Eradication of citrus canker from Australia
-------------------------------------------
Citrus canker has been officially declared as successfully eradicated
from Australia. The National Management Group (NMG; made up of
representatives from the Australian Government, state and territory
governments, and industry) accepted a recommendation from the
Consultative Committee on Emergency Plant Pests on 23 Jan 2009.

Australia's declaration of freedom from citrus canker follows a
4.5-year long national program to eradicate the disease from around
the township of Emerald in Queensland where it was detected in 2004.
Citrus canker was found on 3 commercial citrus orchards in the
Emerald district of Queensland between June 2004 and May 2005.

The following key actions were taken to ensure eradication was successful:

- In accordance with the nationally agreed Response Plan, all
high-risk host plants within the Pest Quarantine Area (PQA),
including approximately 495000 commercial citrus trees and 4000
residential trees, were destroyed prior to 31 December 2005 in
preparation for an 18-month 'host-free' period. Any root growth was destroyed.
- Low risk native citrus (_Citrus glauca_) were also destroyed within
buffer zones around all previous commercial orchards and the Emerald
township. Remnant native citrus located outside these destruction
zones were surveyed at 90-day intervals for a period of 18 months and
demonstrated an absence of the disease in those areas.
- Replanting of commercial citrus orchards in the PQA commenced on 1
July 2007. All planting material was inspected prior to entry into the PQA.
- Surveillance was undertaken at 90-day intervals on all re-planted
citrus to confirm there was no evidence of the disease and to confirm
that it had been eradicated.
- Extensive surveillance of all other areas of Australia outside the
PQA since 2004 confirmed the absence of the disease outside the
quarantine area.

The National Citrus Canker Eradication Program was a cooperative
effort between the Australian Government, the state and territory
governments, and industry. The Department of Primary Industries and
Fisheries in Queensland implemented and managed the program.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_. Symptoms appear on fruit, leaves, and
branches of infected plants. Although the taste of the fruit is not
affected, it cannot be sold or processed. CC can be transmitted by
mechanical means, water, or insects within groves while long-distance
spread is mostly by infected plant material. It affects commercial
citrus varieties and other members of the family _Rutaceae_ posing a
serious economic threat to citrus industries. For more information on
the disease see ProMED-mail post no. 20080626.1970 and links below.

It is thought that CC was brought into Australia with budwood
illegally imported by a commercial grower from the Emerald area.
Attempts to eradicate plant pathogens once they have been introduced
into an open field situation are hardly ever successful. In the USA,
for example, CC eradication was recently declared not to be feasible.
The story above illustrates the extreme coordinated efforts required
to eventually achieve eradication. Nevertheless, success was not
certain, for example recent similar efforts to eradicate sugarcane
smut from Queensland have failed (see ProMED-mail post no. 20081112.3558).
