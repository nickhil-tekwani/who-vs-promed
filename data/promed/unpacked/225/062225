Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (infection with) (non-poultry and wild birds), United States of America
-------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 10 Jan 2017 from Dr John Clifford, official delegate, chief trade advisor, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, USA

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 27 Dec 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 9 Jan 2017
Date submitted to OIE: 10 Jan 2017
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 10 Nov 2016
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic influenza A virus
Serotype: H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Fergus County, Fergus, Montana
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 Dec 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Mallard: _Anas platyrhynchos_ (_Anatidae_) / - / - / - / - / -
Affected population: wild mallard duck

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: The sample, from a wild mallard duck, was collected on 27 Dec 2016 as part of the hunter-harvested wild bird avian influenza surveillance program. Genome sequencing results show that the Montana isolate is an Eurasian/American (EA/AM) H5N2 HPAI strain. The partial genome fragments that have been analyzed thus far are more than 99 percent similar to the virus isolated from a northern pintail duck in Washington State in December 2014. The H5N2 outbreak viruses from 2015 were all more than 99 percent similar to the northern pintail index case (A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 H5N2). Efforts to obtain sequence data for the full genome are underway. This detection of HPAI (EA/AM) H5N2 virus in a wild bird is NOT associated with any commercial poultry in the United States.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Mallard / gene sequencing / 9 Jan 2017 / Positive
Mallard / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 5 Jan 2017 / Positive
Mallard/ virus isolation/ Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The United States has a very strong surveillance program for avian influenza, and actively looks for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and in migratory wild bird populations.

The poultry industry is implementing strict biosecurity measures to ensure the disease stays out of commercial flocks. The USDA recently launched a campaign called "Defend the Flock", which provides the commercial poultry industry with resources to further help ensure that the best biosecurity practices are used to protect commercial flocks from infectious disease. This information can be found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/defendtheflock. - Mod.CRD
