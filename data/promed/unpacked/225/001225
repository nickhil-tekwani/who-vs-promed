A Perth mum has a place in medical history as [Western] Australia's
1st confirmed case of a deadly stomach bug responsible for thousands
of deaths in North America and Europe. She also came close to becoming
a more tragic statistic.

It was about 4 weeks into a trip of a lifetime in 2008 to the US and
Canada with her husband and son she knew something was terribly wrong.
Having planned to spend 2 weeks warmed by the Hawaiian sun -- after a
month in the frigid winter of New York and Whistler, Canada -- she
could not leave her hotel room. She could not even make it to the door.

"I was crawling from my bed to the toilet and passing out in between,"
she recalled from her Mindarie home north of Perth. "After about 4
days in Hawaii I just got sicker and sicker. I was vomiting,
diarrhoea. It got to the point where I couldn't even walk properly
without passing out. By then my body was so drained of everything
there was nothing left."

What she didn't know was that, for the previous month, most likely
after she came into contact with it in a New York cafe, a killer
strain of _Clostridium difficile_ had been releasing toxins into her
body, attacking the wall of her bowel. By the time an ambulance had
rushed her to the intensive care unit of a Honolulu hospital, she was
severely dehydrated, disoriented and heading into shock. Her kidneys
had stopped functioning, as had her liver. If her husband had not
called an ambulance when he did, she probably would have died, with
her then 10-year-old son looking on in wide-eyed horror.

Knowing what she does now, she understands she was incredibly lucky --
and foolish. She has a history of bowel disease and had undergone
surgery only a month before her trip. She started experiencing stomach
cramps and diarrhoea in New York, just a few days into her trip. Yet
despite growing discomfort she failed to see a doctor.

"I'd been ill, so I thought, this is OK, it is just a little bug --
I'll get over it," she explained. "I should have gone straight to a
doctor but I didn't want to ruin my husband's and my son's holiday. We
just kept thinking it would clear up."

Clayton Golledge, a microbiologist and infectious disease expert at
Perth's Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, who helped treat the patient,
says Australian health officials are naive about the potential threat
posed by the Quebec strain after 3 confirmed cases at Melbourne's
Epworth hospital.

Officially, _C difficile_ is not considered a public health issue in
Australia because it is nearly always acquired in hospital, either
from antibiotic use or cross infection, rather than passed between
people in the community.

Dr Golledge said an important aspect of the patient's case was that
she picked up the bug outside hospital. "This bug is not just in
hospitals; it is in communities as well," he said. "There is a double
reason to be afraid of it. It can establish itself anywhere and it is
very hardy and can survive, not just in a hospital environment but on
restaurant tabletops, floors, you name it."

Once home, the patient had several recurrences of the bug. She lost 10
percent of her body weight, about 6 months of her life and was left
with an insurance wrangle over a USD 286 000 (AUD 342 000) hospital
bill. "It just ruined my life," she said. "I couldn't do anything."

[_Clostridium difficile_ -associated disease (CDAD) is a spectrum of
potentially fatal illnesses that includes diarrhea, pseudomembranous
colitis, and toxic megacolon. Although most CDAD is acquired by
exposure to the organism within a health care facility (HCF),
community-acquired CDAD is well recognized
(<http://www.njmonline.nl/njm/getpdf.php?t=a&id=10000317>).
Predispositions reported for community-acquired CDAD include
antibiotic usage and use of medication that suppresses gastric acid
production (S Dial, et al. Use of Gastric Acid-Suppressive Agents and
the Risk of Community-Acquired Clostridium difficile-Associated
Disease. JAMA 2005; 294:2989-95).

The "Quebec strain" referred to in the news release above is
presumably the hypervirulent strain of _Clostridium difficile_ called
North American pulsed-field type 1 (NAP1) or polymerase chain reaction
[PCR] ribotype 027, which has caused outbreaks of colitis with
increased severity, high relapse rate, and significant mortality in
North America, Japan, and Europe (see TJ Louie. How should we respond
to the highly toxogenic NAP1/ribotype 027 strain of Clostridium
difficile? CMAJ 2005; 173 (9). Available at
<http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/173/9/1049>). For a detailed
discussion of _C. difficile_ infection, please see a prior ProMED post
Clostridium difficile, ribotype 027 - UK: (N. Ireland) 20080207.0498.

The news release above reports that the Australian patient from Perth
with CDAD "has a history of bowel disease and had undergone surgery
only a month before her trip." The incubation period for CDAD is not
known with certainty, but it is thought to be less than 4 weeks after
discharge from a HCF
(<http://www.cdc.gov/nciDOD/dhqp/pdf/surveillance/Surveillance_c_diff.pdf>).

A patient classified as having community-associated CDAD has been
defined as "a patient with CDAD symptom onset in the community or 48
hours or less after admission to an HCF, provided that symptom onset
was more than 12 weeks after the last discharge from an HCF," and
patient classified as having indeterminate disease has been defined as
"a patient who has CDAD symptom onset in the community but who was
discharged from the same or another HCF 4-12 weeks before symptom
onset"
(<http://www.cdc.gov/nciDOD/dhqp/pdf/surveillance/Surveillance_c_diff.pdf>).

Although _C. difficile_ ribotype 027 has caused community-associated
CDAD (M Warny, et al. Toxin production by an emerging strain of
Clostridium difficile associated with outbreaks of severe disease in
North America and Europe. Lancet 2005; 366: 1079-84), it is difficult
to say whether CDAD in this Australian patient was acquired in the
community in Australia prior to her trip or was acquired during her
very short stay in New York where she developed symptoms "just a few
days into her trip," or was actually acquired during her
hospitalization in Australia one month before her trip to New York.
