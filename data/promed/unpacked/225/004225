Heavy rain damaged crops being harvested in parts of Henan, the country's top wheat grower. Heavy rains in March and April [2016], coupled with higher-than-normal temperatures, also caused widespread disease in Jiangsu and Anhui, the country's soft-wheat growing region.

China's winter wheat harvest, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of total output, is set to finish. About 10 million metric tons could be downgraded to feed use and output in the 2016-17 season may fall to a five-year low.

[A large number of diseases due to fungi and other pathogens can affect wheat. The wet conditions described above would favour many of them and also increase the risk of simultaneous infections by multiple pathogens, which can lead to severe yield losses. In addition, the humidity would also increase the risk of wheat stored after harvest to be affected by pathogens and pests adding to yield losses and decreasing the grain quality. Reliable diagnosis is crucial for designing management strategies for the different areas.
