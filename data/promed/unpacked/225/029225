Lassa patient dead Â– 23-year old student succumbed to multi-organ failure
on Saturday
The 23-year old female student suffering from Lassa fever is dead.
According to the Mission Hospital in Wuerzburg she died on Saturday
morning at 9.37 a.m. local time. The Medical Head of the Dept. of Tropical
Medicine, Prof. Klaus Fleischer, said that during the night disturbances
of blood clotting had increased.
[The patient died on day 13 of her battle against the Lassa fever. "The
23-year old arts student had no chance against a possibly new and very
aggressive variant of the dangerous viral disease. twelfth day of
disease", reported Professor Klaus Fleischer, Head of the Dept. of
Tropical Medicine of the Mission Hospital in Wuerzburg, where the young
woman had been treated since the early hours of Tuesday.
The efforts of the team of about 20 doctors and nurses had possibly been in
vain from the start. "If she had been treated earlier that would not have
been of benefit to the patient", said Fleischer, and added "I am deeply
troubled about the [highly aggressive and destructive character of the
virus."
Bleeding during the night
The entire night from Friday to Saturday he and his colleagues had fought
for the young woman's life. After bleeding into organs had started late on
Friday night that intensified dramatically during the course of the night
and could not be stopped, it was clear only late Saturday morning,
according to his words, that "we are losing the crisis". Finally a
"collapse of all organ functions" developed, and on 9.37 a.m. on Saturday
she succumbed.
[The patient had been relatively calm upon arrival in Wuerzburg,
Fleischer reports. Her main concern had been that she had been unable to
visit her seriously ill father who then died on Wednesday from cancer.
Directly from Frankfurt airport her brothers had taken her to the Hospital
in Schwaebisch Hall where her father was being treated and where she saw
him for the last time. From there she had been brought transported to
Wuerzburg with presumed malaria.
Not foolhardy
She had been a very reasonable woman, says Fleischer, thereby indirectly
defending her from possible allegations that she had contracted the disease
due to being foolhardy. "It was not an unusual journey," he stresses.
"Relatively many young people travel like that."
At first the 23-year old had taken part, together with fellow students and
a lecturer, in a student exchange programme. Thereafter she had travelled
on with a female friend. This friend, who returned on a different flight,
is being monitored closely according to Fleischer and still lacks any
evidence of disease. Any possible transmission would become apparent very
soon. The incubation period is according to the Medical Head normally
between three and sixteen days, with most of those infected falling ill
during the first week.
No secondary infections
Fleischer does not believe there will be a so-called secondary infections
at all which had so far occurred neither in Europe nor the USA. "It is an
aggressive individual disease, not a disease outbreak (plague)". "There
is [no reason to fear a mass outbreak", he stresses. In Germany there had
been a total of three cases after Lassa fever had become known in Africa
[since 1969. There is therefore no reason for panic.
On the contrary, despite the tragic outcome the present case had
demonstrated: "Germany with its tropical medicine is capable of limiting
such a disease without a threat to the population." Further proceedings
with the deceased is according to Fleischer clearly determined by German
Burial Rules (Deutsche Bestattungsordnung). For days the Hospital had had a
stock of necessary materials, including specially secured plastic bags.
Also, cremation was recommended. The exact timing now had to be determined
by the authorities.

Situation on 15 January 2000 at 11.00 a.m. (GMT+1)
It is with great regret that we have to inform you that the patient
suffering from Lassa fever has died on 15 January 2000 at 9.37 a.m. During
the preceding night there had been a rapid and progressive deterioration of
blood clotting with massive bleeding in all organs. The patient died from
multi-organ failure thus caused. The employees of the Mission Hospital wish
to express their condolences to the relatives.
After consultation with Professor Schmitz from the virological department
of the Tropical Institute in Hamburg (Bernhard Nocht- Institut,
http://www.bni.uni-hamburg.de) we inform you that, contrary to press
reports from 14 Jan 2000, the high virus load was unchanged in a sample
from the morning of 14 Jan 2000. Against expectations no antibodies were
detectable in that sample. According to Prof. Schmitz this might possibly
be a novel and very aggressive variant of the Lassa virus.
There continues to be NO risk of transmission to patients, visitors and
employees of the Mission Hospital nor for the inhabitants of Wuerzburg and
environs.
