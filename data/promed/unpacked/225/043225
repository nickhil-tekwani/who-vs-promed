DOH [the Hawaiʻi Department of Health] is aware of 2 confirmed cases of non-Hawaiʻi residents diagnosed with legionnaires' disease following a stay at The Grand Islander, [a hotel located in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawai'i]. The 1st case was diagnosed in June 2021 and the 2nd case was diagnosed on [6 or 7Mar 2022].

"While the risk to the general public is low, cases of legionnaires' disease are on the rise nationwide," said State Epidemiologist Dr Sarah Kemble. "Individuals who stayed at the Hilton Grand Islander in the last 2 weeks who develop symptoms or individuals who were diagnosed with legionnaires' disease after a stay at the Grand Islander are encouraged to seek medical attention and contact DOH."

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by exposure to _Legionella_ bacteria. Symptoms of legionnaires' disease include cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches, and headache. Symptoms usually begin within 2 to 14 days of exposure. Most healthy people exposed to _Legionella_ bacteria do not develop legionnaires' disease. Those at increased risk include people 50 and older, current or former smokers, and people with chronic lung disease or weakened immune system.

Legionnaires' disease is treated with antibiotics and cannot spread from person to person. _Legionella_ bacteria are found in freshwater environments and can spread in water systems such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, hot tubs, and large plumbing systems.

The exact source of illness and extent of spread are still being investigated. DOH is working closely with the Grand Islander to protect public health and thanks the Grand Islander for working cooperatively. DOH distributed a request to public health agencies across the country to report cases of Legionnaires' disease with a travel history to Hawaiʻi.

[The following has been extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED post Legionellosis - USA (03): (NV) hotel 20110716.2159:

"About 20-25 percent of all legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated. Legionnaires' disease is important to diagnose and report because its identification implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to be exposed. Clusters of legionnaires' disease associated with travel to hotels or aboard cruise ships are rarely detected by individual clinicians or health departments; travelers typically disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms.

"Therefore, a travel history should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms.

"Because of the multi-state nature of travel in the US, national-level surveillance is necessary to detect outbreaks of travel-associated legionnaires' disease. CDC relies upon state and local health departments to conduct this surveillance. Surveillance through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) is still important for monitoring national trends; all cases should be reported through NNDSS."

"Because of the public health importance of timely reporting, inform CDC of travel-associated cases ..." See the CDC Legionellosis Case Report Form at https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/health-depts/surv-reporting/form-instructions.html.

"Environmental sampling/testing should only be conducted after careful consideration of the epidemiologic evidence linking a case(s) to a particular location." The following is extracted from Barbaree JM, et al. Protocol for Sampling Environmental Sites for Legionellae. Applied Environmental Microbiol 1987; 53: 1454-8 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC203891/pdf/aem00124-0068.pdf): "Since legionellae not related to disease may be found in many of the sites sampled, an epidemiologic association with the probable source should be established before intervention methods, such as disinfection, are undertaken. [.....] Random sampling without an epidemiologic evaluation and comparing isolates from the environment and from patients could lead to false conclusions about sources of epidemic strains."

Potential environmental sampling sites for _Legionella_ spp include internal surfaces of faucets, aerators, and shower heads; and water from incoming water main, holding tanks and cisterns, water heater tanks, decorative fountains, irrigation equipment, fire sprinkler system (if recently used), whirlpools, and spas. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates with that of clinical isolates to assure frequently costly corrective measures are carried out on the actual source (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

The Grand Islander is an all-suite hotel with each suite having 1-3 bedrooms, a full kitchen, washer/dryer, and bathroom. Waikiki is a neighborhood of Honolulu on the south shore of the island of Oʻahu in the US state of Hawaii (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikiki). A map showing the location of the Grand Islander hotel on Waikiki Beach can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hilton+Grand+Vacations+Club+The+Grand+Islander+Waikiki+Honolulu. - Mod.ML
