AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN - EAST ASIA (51): TREATMENT

I certainly concur with the WHO approach of isolation or home
quarantine and a search for evidence of avian influenza in contacts
of a person with asymptomatic infection.
I believe, however, that the recommendation to treat asymptomatic
cases with oseltamivir demands vigorous discussion in the scientific
community. 2 pertinent pieces of information may be:
1) lack of transmission from such individuals in Hong Kong and
2) relatively frequent asymptomatic infection in the Netherlands.
Rather than treating all such patients, I believe that WHO and
national governments should consider studying the duration during
which such individuals carry the virus in their respiratory tract and
the quantity of virus found, as well as whether any of them develop
symptoms after a period of asymptomatic carriage and the risk of
transmission to others, if any. This would enable a more well thought
out response in the future. Instead, treating all asymptomatic cases
means that such data cannot be obtained. In addition, one must
consider the risk of selecting for oseltamivir-resistant strains by
treating those who may not require treatment, as well as the impact
on the limited supply of this drug should many asymptomatic
individuals be treated based on this recommendation.
These are my personal opinions and are not necessarily the opinions
of the Veterans Administration or the USA government.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Frankel for his comments regarding the use of a
neuraminidase inhibitor in asymptomatic human carriers of avian
influenza. It is unclear whether such treatment decreases the length
of asymptomatic carriage and/or whether it would have an effect in
lessening person-to-person spread without the selection of resistant
strains.
Elder, et al (Elder AG, O'Donnell B, McCruden EAB, et al: Incidence
and recall of influenza in a cohort of Glasgow healthcare workers
during the 1993-4 epidemic: results of serum testing and
questionnaire. BMJ 1996: 313:1241-42) reported that 28-59 percent of
healthcare worker influenza was subclinical. This data, in a human
influenza outbreak, suggests that asymptomatic infection could be
common. How that relates to HPAI is unclear at this time.
We would encourage additional discussion on this important matter. - Mod.LL]
