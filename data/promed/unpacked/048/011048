The number of United States horses exposed to the venereal disease
contagious equine metritis (CEM) has topped 900. State and federal
authorities have been tracing potential cases of the disease since the 1st
cases were identified in central Kentucky in mid-December 2008.
Investigations have unearthed a total of 19 stallions confirmed as positive
for the disease by the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary
Services Laboratories (NVSL).

In addition to the positive stallions, 5 mares have been found positive for
_Taylorella equigenitalis_, the bacterium that causes the disease. None of
the positive horses has yet been identified as the source of the outbreak.
"The epidemiologic investigation continues to pursue all available
information relative to determining the origin of this outbreak, but no
conclusions can yet be drawn," the department said.

As well as the 19 stallions and 5 mares, locations have been confirmed for
904 additional horses exposed to the bacteria. The 928 horses are located
across 48 states. There are 270 exposed or positive stallions in 29 states
and 658 exposed or positive mares in 46 states. Only Hawaii and Rhode
Island do not have at least one horse that is known to be exposed or positive.

The 19 positive stallions are in 6 states: one in Georgia, 3 in Illinois, 3
in Indiana, 4 in Kentucky, one in Texas, and 7 in Wisconsin. The 5 positive
mares are in 3 states: 2 in California, 2 in Illinois, and one in
Wisconsin. All positive horses and all exposed horses that have been
located are currently under quarantine or hold order. Testing and treatment
protocols are being put into action for all located horses.

Of the 270 stallions, 76 have now completed their entire testing and
treatment protocols and been determined to be negative for _T.
equigenitalis_. Of the 76 that are now negative, 68 were exposed stallions
and 8 were stallions that had previously tested positive. Those 8
stallions, 4 from Kentucky, 3 from Indiana, and one from Texas, are now
free of the bacteria after being treated and re-tested. Another 98 exposed
stallions are negative on their initial sampling cultures but have
additional testing requirements to complete before being declared free of
the bacterium.

Of the 658 mares, a total of 434 have completed testing and treatment and
are negative for _T. equigenitalis_.

All 4 of the positive Kentucky stallions were on the central Kentucky
premises during the 2008 breeding season. The Texas and Indiana stallions
also spent time on the Kentucky premises during 2008.

The positive Wisconsin stallions were not in Kentucky, but 4 of them were
co-located during at least one breeding season in Wisconsin with a positive
stallion that was on the Kentucky premises in 2008. The 5th, 6th, and 7th
Wisconsin stallions all spent time at the same breeding facility used by
the 4th positive Wisconsin stallion and by the 3 positive Illinois
stallions. The positive Georgia stallion was co-located with 3 positive
Wisconsin stallions in 2008. The positive Wisconsin mare was bred by the
2nd positive stallion in Wisconsin. Each of the positive mares in Illinois
and in California were bred by artificial insemination (AI) in 2008 using
semen from a positive stallion.

Both California mares were exposed by AI to the 1st positive stallion in
Wisconsin, and the 1st Illinois mare was exposed to a positive stallion now
in Indiana. The 2nd positive mare in Illinois was exposed by AI in 2008 to
the 2nd positive Illinois stallion.

An exposed horse is one that was bred to a positive horse, either naturally
or via artificial insemination, or one that is otherwise epidemiologically
linked to a positive horse, as determined by state and federal animal
health officials.
