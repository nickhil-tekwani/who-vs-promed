Outbreak of Salmonella Thompson infections caused by contaminated ruccola
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 15 Nov 2004, 3 isolates of _Salmonella_ Thompson [_S. enterica_
serotype Thompson - Mod.LL] from patients who had not been abroad
were detected by the reference laboratory at the Norwegian Institute
of Public Health. Infections caused by _Salmonella_ Thompson are very
rare in Norway, with around 2-5 cases per year, usually acquired
abroad.
The Reference Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health
receives all salmonella isolates from humans, animals, food, and feed
for typing. The outbreak group at the institute was alerted, and an
investigation was begun.
By Wed 24 Nov 2004, 13 cases had been reported from throughout the
country. The 1st 7 patients were carefully interviewed about food
items they had consumed during the 3 days before disease onset. Based
on these interviews, a case control study was performed.
All 13 patients -- who had submitted a stool sample which was
confirmed by the Reference Laboratory, between 4 and 24 Nov 2004, as
containing _Salmonella_ Thompson -- were included in the study. The
patients all came from cities of at least 5000 inhabitants. The
source population was defined as all Norwegians living in such
communities. From the source population, 2 controls per case were
picked from the computerized population register, matched by date of
birth and gender.
Patients and controls were telephoned on 24-26 Nov 2004 and
interviewed according to a questionnaire that listed 18 food items.
Patients responded as to whether they had eaten these items during
the 3 days before disease onset, while controls responded for the
dates of 21-23 Nov 2004.
Preliminary results: The preliminary analysis involved 11 cases and
25 controls. 2 food items were associated with disease: ruccola
(rocket) salad and mixed salad. The ruccola salad had been consumed
by 6 cases (55 percent) and one control (4 percent), while one case
did not know. The matched odds ratio was infinity, while the
unmatched odds ratio was 36 (95 percent confidence interval 3.4 -
384).
The mixed salad had been consumed by 9 cases (82 percent) and 7
controls (28 percent), and one case did not know. The matched odds
ratio was infinity, while the unmatched odds ratio was 23 (95 percent
confidence interval 2.5 - 218). At least 7 of the cases stated that
they had eaten mixed salad in pre-packed plastic bags, possibly
containing ruccola.
Conclusion: The case control study strongly implicates ruccola
(rocket) salad as the cause of this outbreak of _Salmonella_ Thompson
infections in Norway. Most ruccola consumed in Norway is imported.
Thus, the outbreak may be international.
The Norwegian Food Control Authority and the European Early Warning
and Response system were informed on 26 Nov 2004 immediately
following the analysis.
The investigation is continuing. The Norwegian Food Control Authority
is attempting to sample and trace back products.

[Ruccola is the Italian word for arugula, a popular leafy lettuce in
the USA. In other parts of the world, it is referred to as raketsla,
roquette, notensla, or zwaardherik. As noted in the posting, the
outbreak may well be international. The source of the arugula is not
stated. - Mod.LL]
