Egypt: avian influenza situation
--------------------------------
As of 29 Mar 2006, the Ministry of Health in Egypt has confirmed the
country's 2nd fatal case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza
virus. The person who died was a 30 year old woman from the Qaliubiya
governorate near Cairo. She developed symptoms on 12 Mar 2006 following the
home slaughter of chickens. She was hospitalized on 16 Mar 2006 and died on
27 Mar 2006.
The country's 1st case occurred in another 30 year old woman, also from
Qaliubiya, who died on 17 Mar 2006.
Tests conducted by the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3
(NAMRU-3) have confirmed an additional 3 cases. A 32 year old man, who
worked on a farm where poultry were recently culled, developed symptoms on
16 Mar 2006 and was admitted to hospital the same day. He has since
recovered. A 17 year old boy, whose father runs a poultry farm in the
Gharbiya governorate in the Nile Delta, developed symptoms on 18 Mar 2006
and was admitted to hospital the next day. He has since recovered. The 5th
case is an 18 year old girl from the Kafr El-Sheikh governorate. She
developed symptoms following the slaughter of sick backyard poultry and was
admitted to hospital on 25 Mar 2006.
At present, the Ministry of Health has confirmed all 5 cases based on
results from the NAMRU-3 laboratory. Samples from these cases have been
sent to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom for diagnostic
verification. WHO will adjust the figures in its cumulative number of cases
following the results of this external verification. Test results are
expected later this week.
Health authorities have screened more than 350 people who were contacts of
these patients or had a recent history of exposure to diseased birds. All
test results have been negative for H5N1 infection.
Egypt has a large population of poultry, many of which are kept on roof
terraces in close proximity to humans. H5N1 outbreaks in poultry have now
been reported in 19 of the country's 26 governorates. Since the 1st
outbreak was confirmed on 17 Feb 2006, more than 25 million birds have died
or been destroyed.

[Egypt and these 5 suspected cases have not yet been added to the WHO
cumulative list of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza
virus infection, which was last updated on 24 Mar 2006. If confirmed by
independent testing, the global total of human cases of avian influenza
virus will become 191, with 107 deaths. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia: suspected avian influenza victim dies in East Java
-------------------------------------------------------------
A child under 5 years old who was admitted to the Dr Soedono General
Hospital in Madiun, East Java with symptoms compatible with bird flu died
on Tue 28 Mar 2006 after being treated for around 3 hours, a hospital
spokesman said.
"The patient was accepted at the hospital at around 10:55 pm on Mon 27 Mar
2006 and died at 1:55 am on Tue 28 Mar 2006. The patient was referred to us
by the Magetan General Hospital," the spokesman, Sugeng Haryanto, said. He
said the patient was weak, in a coma, convulsive, and having breathing
difficulty. The Magetan hospital suspected the child was suffering from
avian influenza, and therefore needed further treatment. "We contacted the
Dr Soetomo hospital in Surbaya, and a team from that hospital was expected
to arrive Tuesday [28 Mar 2006] morning to take blood samples from the
child, but the patient died before the team arrived. We tried hard to
improve the condition of the patient, but the reality was not as expected."
he said.
The Dr Soedono hospital has so far treated 3 suspected avian influenza
patients, and 2 of them were eventually declared H5N1 virus-negative and
recovered. The hospital has formed a special team to deal with avian
influenza cases. "The team was the one that treated the child last night.
The team is always ready any time it is needed," he said.
