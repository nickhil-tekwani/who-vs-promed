The Department of Agriculture and Food, WA is trying to identify a virus that has infected at least 18 horses in the south of the state. Officers have been called to a southwest property to conduct tests on horses showing small solid bumps on their mouths.

The department says they have ruled out the rabies virus and vesicular stomatitis but are awaiting further test results to pinpoint the cause. Pinjarra vet Michael Gibbs says he has treated some of the infected horses, and they do not appear to be distressed, but horse owners need to be vigilant with biosecurity, because the virus is still a mystery.

"There's probably heightened worry at the moment because we've had the lyssavirus, which is a rabies-type virus, and the hendra virus, which has only been in Queensland," he said.

"There's concern about viruses spreading from horses to people, but also with the equine influenza, just worry about spreading disease amongst horses."

[There is very little information in this article. What are the clinical signs? What should owners watch for? Have the horses been treated? What have they been treated with? ProMED-mail would be grateful if an authority in biosecurity could let us know more about this situation. - Mod.TG
