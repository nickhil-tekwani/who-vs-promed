Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, has claimed the life of a 3-week-old infant in San Joaquin County, health officials announced Thursday, 5 Mar 2015. Of the 23 cases of pertussis reported in county residents in 2015. this is the first death. The infant did not reside in the north county area. In 2014, the county had 212 reported pertussis cases, an increase from 2013, when there were 27 cases in the county. The incidence of pertussis has been higher in south county communities, particularly Manteca and Tracy,
according to county health officials.

The California Department of Public Health reports that the state is currently experiencing a pertussis epidemic. Pertussis is cyclical and peaks every 3 to 5 years. In 2014, the latest state pertussis report shows 11 114 cases.

Pertussis is a highly contagious illness that is spread from person to person, usually by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others. It can be serious at any age, but may be life-threatening for newborns and infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated. Since infants are at greatest risk for developing severe complications, health officials recommend pregnant women receive the pertussis vaccine during their 3rd trimester. Immunity is transferred from mother to fetus and can protect the baby until they are old enough for regular immunization.

[This is the 2nd infant death from pertussis reported from California in 2015. San Joaquin county is located in the Central Valley of the state, east of San Francisco and can be found on a map at http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Joaquin_County,_California#/media/File:California_county_map_(San_Joaquin_County_highlighted).svg.

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A recent publication confirms that safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes. JAMA. 2014; 312(18): 1897-904 (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1930817). - Mod. LL
