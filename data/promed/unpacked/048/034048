According to local media, there were *five* cases as of last weekend, with
two
fatalities. All injecting drug users. But one headline implied that the
heroin
*itself* may have been the vector for the infections. Is that a possibility?

Please note that the cases of "flesh eating bacteria" in San Francisco
are due to _Clostridium perfringens_ as opposed to Group A _Streptococcus_.
Unfortunately the media has not distinguished between the two [types of
bacteria].
Although the message to IV drug users is the same -- sharing needles is
not a good idea.
[Not to mention that taking drugs is not a good idea - Mod.JW]
