Control of eastern equine encephalitis vector
---------------------------------------------
[In response to the comment on preventative measures in PRO/AH> Eastern
equine encephalitis - USA (Southeast) (02) 20030716.1751, dated 16 July
2003, we have received the following reply and thank Dominick Ninivaggi
accordingly. - Mod.SH]

It is important for the public and news media to recognize that neither the
epizootic vector (_Culiseta melanura_) nor the bridge vector species for
EEE (_Ochlerotatus sollicitans_, _Coquillettidia perturbans_, and others)
are susceptible to control practices that are effective against _Culex_
species around the household. Emptying standing water in flowerpots and
rain gutters is helpful for West Nile virus, but will have no impact on the
salt marsh or maple swamp species involved in EEE. EEE must be controlled
with personal protection and community-scale mosquito control efforts
directed at breeding sites and infected adults.
