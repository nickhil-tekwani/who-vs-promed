An outbreak of hepatitis E virus infection confirmed on New Year's Eve [31 Dec 2013] in the Karamoja [sub-region] of Uganda has to date [6 Jan 2014] resulted in 344 people sickened and 13 fatalities, according to a report from the Ugandan news source, The Observer. The Health Ministry's director general of health services, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, explained that the outbreak is attributed to unsafe water sources like rivers and ponds, poor sanitation and hygiene and low latrine coverage in the district. "Karamoja sub-region is prone to this disease because of its low latrine coverage and lack of safe drinking water," Aceng said.

According to the WHO, hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks. The ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has also been identified as the source of sporadic cases in endemic areas. The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation in large areas of the world and shedding of the hepatitis E virus in feces. It is usually a self-limiting infection and resolves within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis E develops (acute liver failure), which can lead to death.

Fulminant hepatitis occurs more frequently during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at greater risk of obstetrical complications and mortality from hepatitis E, which can induce a mortality rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in their 3rd trimester.

Globally, there are approximately 20 million incidents of hepatitis E infections every year.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html).
