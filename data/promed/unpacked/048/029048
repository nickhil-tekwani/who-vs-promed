1st record of Tomato torrado virus in Panama
--------------------------------------------
In February 2008, unusual disease symptoms were observed in
field-grown tomatoes (_Solanum lycopersicum_) from the central
regions of Cocle, Herrera, Los Santos, and Veraguas of Panama. Tomato
production was seriously damaged. Symptoms were characterised by leaf
deformation, necrosis, discolouration (purple margins, interveinal
yellowing), necrotic lines in sepals and branches, fruit deformation,
and severe stunting.

To verify the identity of the disease, 5 symptomatic tomato plants
from 4 fields of the affected regions were selected and tested
(DAS-ELISA [double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay], PCR) for the presence of the following viruses: _Cucumber
mosaic virus_ (genus _Cucumovirus_, CMV), _Potato virus X_
(_Potexvirus_), _Potato virus Y_ (_Potyvirus_), _Tomato mosaic virus_
(_Tobamovirus_), _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (_Tospovirus_), _Pepino
mosaic virus_ (_Potexvirus_), Tomato torrado virus (ToTV). ToTV was
detected in all tested samples and CMV was found in 3 of these
samples. No difference in symptomatology could be observed between
samples infected by ToTV only or with both viruses.

This is the 1st time that ToTV is detected in Panama and also the 1st
report of mixed infections with CMV and ToTV.

1st record of Tomato torrado virus in Australia
-----------------------------------------------
In October 2008, the presence of Tomato torrado virus was reported
for the 1st time in Australia. The virus was detected in glasshouse
tomatoes in the Northern Adelaide Plains of South Australia. Affected
tomato plants showed leaf mottling, yellow spotting followed by
necrosis at the base of leaflets and in some cases, stem necrosis.
But unlike reports from other parts of the world, no fruit symptoms
were observed.

Although ToTV was first described in 2007 as a virus new to science
[see ProMED-mail post no. 20070324.1030], there is evidence that it
may have been present in Australia at least since 2005. Similar
symptoms had been noticed in 2005 and when preserved samples were
tested they were found positive for ToTV.

Observations made in South Australia indicated that many commonly
grown tomato varieties seemed to be resistant/tolerant to the virus.

Tomato torrado virus: addition to the EPPO Alert List
-----------------------------------------------------
Considering that Tomato torrado virus is an emerging disease of
tomato crops, the EPPO Panel on Phytosanitary Measures recommended
its addition to the Alert List.

[ToTV is a new virus, which appears to be spreading. Symptoms include
leaf necrosis, which can affect the photosynthetic potential of the
plant, as well as necrotic spots on fruit. The virus has the
potential to cause considerable yield losses. ToTV is suspected to be
transmitted by whiteflies, and _T. vaporariorum_ has recently been
confirmed as an efficient vector.

The finding in item 2 that commercial tomato cultivars with
resistance to ToTV may be available can be used for disease
management in the future. The absence of fruit symptoms in Australia
may point towards the presence of different strains compared to the
other regions where ToTV has been reported so far.

Phylogenetic analyses showed that ToTV is related to, but distinct
from, viruses belonging to other genera in the proposed order of the
Picornavirales. Another new virus related to ToTV, Tomato marchitez
virus (ToMarV), has recently been found in Mexico. ToMarV and ToTV
both share unique features and are likely to represent a new plant
virus genus for which the name Torradovirus was recently proposed by
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
