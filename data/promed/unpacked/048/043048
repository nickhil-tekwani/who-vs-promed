Poliomyelitis in Nigeria and West Africa - 6 Jan 2009
------------------------
From 2003 to 2007, type 1 polio originating in northern Nigeria
spread to cause outbreaks in 20 previously polio-free countries,
including across west Africa, the Horn of Africa, and as far away as
Indonesia and Yemen. The outbreaks in these 20 countries resulted in
1517 cases and cost upwards of USD 500 million in international
emergency outbreak response funds.

In 2008, northern Nigeria is experiencing an outbreak of wild
poliovirus type 1 [WPV1], which has spread internationally into
nearby countries in west Africa. Since April 2008, cases due to type
1 polio genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria have been
detected in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, Mali and Togo. In
2008, Nigeria accounts for 80 percent of type 1 polio cases in the
world. In addition to international spread of type 1 polio, wild
poliovirus type 3 [WPV3] originating from northern Nigeria has also
been reported in Chad and Niger.

The risk of additional importations into these west African countries
depends fully on the quality of outbreak response activities in
Nigeria and the re-infected countries themselves.

In the 2nd half of 2008, Nigeria has conducted large-scale rounds of
emergency polio immunization campaigns in the northern states in July
and August, as well as in November when oral polio vaccine (OPV) was
added to an integrated measles vaccination campaign. Additional
nationwide campaigns are planned for late January and again in February [2009].

To minimize the risk of onward spread of polio from Ghana, in
particular into Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana has conducted large-scale polio
immunization campaigns in October, November and December [2008]. The
feasibility of conducting preventive campaigns in Cote d'Ivoire is
currently being explored. Elsewhere in west Africa, large-scale polio
immunization campaigns have been carried out and/or are being planned
in Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo.

Given these risks, it is important that countries across west Africa
strengthen disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in
order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a
rapid response. Countries should also continue to boost routine
immunization coverage against polio to minimize the consequences of
any introduction.

[10 Dec 2008] Progress Report by the Secretariat of the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative to the Executive Board of the World Health
Assembly in preparation for the 124th Session of the Executive Board
to the World Health Assembly (to be held on 19-27 Jan 2009 in Geneva,
Switzerland)

Poliomyelitis: Mechanism for management of potential risks to eradication
-------------------------
1. At an urgent stakeholders consultation of the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative in February 2007, participants agreed on a
24-month intensified eradication effort with specific indicators to
monitor progress. In May 2008, the Health Assembly in resolution
WHA61.1 urged all remaining poliomyelitis-affected Member States to
engage all levels of political and civil society to ensure that every
child is consistently reached and vaccinated during every
supplementary immunization activity against poliomyelitis. It also
urged Nigeria to undertake intensified activities to stop rapidly the
outbreak of poliomyelitis in the north of the country, and
Afghanistan, India and Pakistan to implement large-scale mopping-up
activities to interrupt their final chains of poliovirus
transmission. The Health Assembly requested the Director-General to
assist in mobilizing the financial resources necessary for full
implementation of the intensified eradication effort and to undertake
the necessary research for managing the long-term risks of
reintroduction of poliovirus and re-emergence of poliomyelitis.

2. In June 2008, the Minister of Health in Nigeria established a
high-level task force in order to improve the quality of
supplementary immunization activities. Two such activities were
urgently undertaken across the northern states in July and August
2008. Monitoring indicates that significant gaps in coverage of these
immunization activities persist, with more than 60 percent of
children remaining not fully vaccinated (having received 3 or fewer
doses of oral poliovirus vaccine). Because of a continuing outbreak
caused by a type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus, northern Nigeria is
the only area in the world where all 3 poliovirus serotypes are
circulating. Since June 2008, polioviruses originating in northern
Nigeria have spread to Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Niger.

3. In October 2008, India confirmed that indigenous type 1 poliovirus
had not been detected in Uttar Pradesh state for 12 consecutive
months, affirming the technical feasibility of poliomyelitis
eradication. However, a new outbreak due to type 1 poliovirus in
western Uttar Pradesh, following importation of the virus from Bihar
state in mid-2008, has highlighted the fragility of progress because
of the suboptimal efficacy of oral poliovirus vaccine in this area.
Mopping-up activities with monovalent oral poliovirus vaccines
continue on average every 6 weeks in western Uttar Pradesh and
central Bihar. New approaches to enhancing vaccine efficacy are being
assessed in order to accelerate eradication in northern India.

4. In Pakistan, and to a lesser extent Afghanistan, poliomyelitis
cases have surged since mid-2008, as a deterioration in security
resulted in large-scale population movements and outbreaks in
poliomyelitis-free areas, particularly in Punjab. Consequently, in
late 2008 and 2009, Pakistan will increase the number of nationwide
supplementary immunization activities to supplement mopping-up
activities in known reservoir areas, such as Sindh province, where
coverage during supplementary immunization activities is still
suboptimal despite good accessibility to children. In Afghanistan,
poliomyelitis continues to be largely restricted to 3 of the
country's 34 provinces, where insecurity hampers activities, a
reality underscored by the recent deaths of 2 doctors and their
driver on WHO duty for poliomyelitis eradication.

5. Responses to outbreaks are continuing in the 10 countries with
cases associated with importation of poliovirus in 2008. In 5 of
these countries, however, the outbreak has continued for more than 12
months: Angola, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Sudan.

Although the risk of poliovirus importation remains high globally, 90
Member States have not maintained certification-standard surveillance
for acute flaccid paralysis, as requested for global certification,
and 39 have not maintained routine immunization coverage with oral
poliovirus vaccine at more than 80 percent, as recommended in
resolution WHA61.1.

6. Resource mobilization activities have been enhanced in order to
sustain the intensified eradication effort in 2009-2010. In 2008, in
countries where poliomyelitis was endemic, a range of new and
existing donors provided additional funding for eradication
activities, with important new multiyear commitments by Rotary
International, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and several G8
countries, the latter following a renewed commitment to poliomyelitis
eradication by G8 leaders at the 2008 Summit (Hokkaido, Toyako,
Japan, 7-9 Jul 2008). Rigorous resource mobilization activities will
continue in order to ensure full funding of the intensified eradication effort.

7. New research on the management of the long-term risks of
reintroduction of poliovirus and reemergence of poliomyelitis
includes: the development, field-testing and introduction of a
real-time polymerase chain reaction test for more rapid detection of
circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses; 8 studies to characterize
better the risks of chronic immunodeficiency-associated excretion of
vaccine-derived polioviruses in low- and middle-income countries;
investigation of the use of adjuvants, smaller doses and fewer-dose
schedules in order to reduce the cost associated with the use of
existing inactivated poliovirus vaccines; and, a clinical development
project for the production of an inactivated poliovirus vaccine using
Sabin-strain polioviruses.

8. In October 2008, the Director-General announced the commissioning
of an independent review of the operational challenges to reaching
all children with oral poliovirus vaccine in the remaining
poliomyelitis-affected areas. The outcomes of this review will be
applied as necessary to overcome these challenges.

[4] Monthly situation reports - December 2008
Date: 6 Jan 2009
Source: Polio eradication website [edited]
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/current_monthly_sitrep.asp>


[Case counts are as of 30 Dec 2008]

Nigeria
------
- In 2008, 783 cases have been reported (714 type 1 and 68 type 3).

- The ongoing type 1 polio outbreak in the north of the country
continues to spread, as new associated cases are reported from
neighbouring countries in west Africa (see "re-infected countries"
section below). The risk of additional importations into these
countries depends fully on the quality of supplementary immunization
activities (SIAs) in northern Nigeria.

- In late November/early December [2008], nationwide staggered
integrated measles campaigns with monovalent oral polio vaccine type
1 (mOPV1) were conducted.

- While monitoring data indicate overall good quality was achieved in
the southern states, the activity in highest-risk northern states was
again affected by suboptimal quality (e.g. inadequate vaccinator and
supervisor performance, poor microplanning, etc), in particular in
the highest-risk Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Bauchi, Kano,
Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara. Upwards of 60 percent of children in
these states remain under-immunized (i.e., less than or equal to 3
doses of OPV), and these areas account for more than 70 percent of
the country's type 1 cases.

- Kano State remains the global epicentre of type 1 polio, accounting
for nearly 30 percent of the worldwide type 1 burden.

- In Nigeria, the reinvigorated high-level political commitment at
the national level must be urgently translated into field-level
improvements in operational quality. Key to achieving this is
increased political engagement at state- and LGA-level.

- Nationwide Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) are planned for late
January and again in February [2009].

India
-----
- In 2008, 546 cases have been reported (66 type 1 and 480 type 3).

- Aggressive outbreak response is continuing in western Uttar Pradesh
to stop an ongoing type 1 polio outbreak. Virtually all type 1 polio
reported from India over the past 6 months is related to this ongoing
outbreak. Western Uttar Pradesh had been free of endemic type 1 polio
for nearly 18 months before being re-infected in mid-2008 from
neighbouring Bihar state.

- National Immunization Days (NIDs) were held on [21 Dec 2008] using
mOPV1 in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and key reinfected areas and trivalent
OPV in the rest of the country. The 2nd NID round will be held on [1 Feb 2008].

- A tragic accident has occurred in Supaul District, Bihar. Mr
Pranvendu tragically died in a road accident while conducting polio
eradication duties. Mr Pranvendu was a field volunteer for India's
polio eradication efforts for the past 4 years. This incident is
another stark reminder of the sacrifices made daily by public health
and humanitarian workers around the world, working under often
extremely dangerous and difficult conditions, in their courageous
efforts to protect every child from polio. We would like to extend
our sincere condolences to Mr Pranvendu's family, friends and colleagues.

Pakistan and Afghanistan
-----------------------
- In 2008, 116 cases have been reported in Pakistan (79 type 1 and 37
type 3); and 31 cases have been reported in Afghanistan (24 type 1
and 7 type 3).

- In Afghanistan, preparations are ongoing for the next NIDs, planned
for [11-13 Jan 2009]. Polio is largely restricted to
security-compromised areas in the country's Southern Region. To
increase access, windows of opportunity in key high-risk districts
are increasingly being used in between large-scale campaigns to
deliver an additional dose as and when areas become accessible.

- In Pakistan, despite overall good nationwide coverage during SIAs,
the quality of operations is inconsistent across some areas. Due to
very efficient poliovirus transmission in the country, these
remaining vaccination coverage gaps must be urgently filled.

- In the transmission zones of North West Frontier Province (NWFP)
and Sindh, ongoing coverage gaps are primarily due to hampered access
to populations in security-compromised areas of NWFP and suboptimal
campaign quality in Sindh (e.g. inadequate vaccinator performance,
suboptimal microplanning, etc). While some improvements have been
noted in Sindh during recent campaigns, key to overcoming the
operational challenges is increased political ownership at the
district-level. In NWFP, despite efforts to increase access to
populations during large-scale activities, upwards of 15 percent of
the target population in this area was again missed due to insecurity
during the most recent NIDs on [24 Nov 2008].

- Strong progress continues to be achieved in the reinfected areas,
notably Punjab, as evidenced by the steep decline in type 1 cases
over a relatively short period during the past few months, despite
the "high season" for polio transmission. Punjab had been polio-free
but became reinfected in mid-2008 by an importation from
security-compromised areas of NWFP.

Reinfected countries
West Africa
-----------
- In 2008, 35 cases have been reported from 6 countries (type 1: 3 in
Benin, 4 in Burkina Faso, 9 in Ghana, one in Mali, 13 in Niger and 3
in Togo.; type 3: 2 in Niger).

- The confirmation of new polio cases in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana
and Togo underscores the fact that west Africa continues to be at
risk of international spread of polio from northern Nigeria. The risk
of further circulation or additional importations into these western
African countries depends fully on the quality of SIAs in northern
Nigeria and of the outbreak response activities in the reinfected
countries themselves.

- Large-scale emergency outbreak response activities are continuing
in these 6 countries in west Africa, and the feasibility of
conducting preventive campaigns in other high-risk countries, notably
Cote d'Ivoire, is being explored.

- It is important that countries across west Africa strengthen
disease surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to
rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response.

Chad
-----
- In 2008, 33 cases have been reported (one type 1 and 32 type 3).

- Confirmation of new cases from the east, south and the west of the
country is further evidence that Chad is affected by widespread
geographic transmission of both type 1 and type 3 polio.

- With suboptimal outbreak response activities implemented in 2008
(in quality, scope and timeliness), and sub-national surveillance
gaps, the risk of further spread of polio within Chad and bordering
countries is high.

- The key remains to urgently improve the quality of operations, as
upwards of 40 percent of children were regularly missed during
activities this year [2008]. Full political engagement and
accountability, beginning with the President's office downward, is
urgently needed.

Horn of Africa
------------
- In 2008, 23 cases have been reported from 2 countries (22 type 1
from the southern Sudan/western Ethiopia cross-border area; one type
3 in West Darfur, Sudan).

Outbreak response campaigns are continuing across the Horn of Africa.

- The overriding priority is to stop the type 1 outbreak in southern
Sudan/western Ethiopia. The key challenge is to increase access to
populations in remote and/or conflict-affected areas.

Central Africa (Angola, DR Congo and CAR)
---------------
- In Angola, 26 cases have been reported, 3 type 1 and 23 type 3.

- In December 2008, accelerated routine immunization activities were
conducted. During such activities, a range of vaccines including
trivalent OPV are offered to communities using a fixed site approach.
Further campaigns are planned for January 2009.

- In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), 5 cases have been
reported (4 type 1 and one type 3).

- A type 3 case was reported in the south (Kasai Occidental), the 1st
in the country since September 2000, genetically-related to type 3
circulating in neighbouring Angola. An emergency outbreak response
mop-up was conducted in the affected area with monovalent OPV type 3
(mOPV3) targeting 300 000 children under the age of 5 years. Further
mOPV3 campaigns are planned for early February [2009].

- In the meantime, outbreak response to the type 1 outbreak in the
east of the country is continuing with mOPV1. Additionally,
preventive campaigns are being carried out in the west of Uganda,
Burundi and Rwanda, to prevent spread of type 1 polio from DR Congo.
There is large-scale movement of refugees from DR Congo in particular
into Uganda.

- In the Central African Republic (CAR), 2 cases have been reported
(both type 1). The risk of further importations from both Chad (to
the north) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (to the south) remains high.

Asia (Nepal)
----------
- In 2008, 6 cases have been reported (all type 3). Nepal remains at
risk of importations from India and continues to conduct preventive
immunization activities as well as outbreak response mop-ups.

[The above reports highlight the challenges facing the polio
eradication effort at this time. The persistent circulation of wild
poliovirus (WPV) types 1 and 3 in the 4 remaining endemic countries,
coupled with the dropping vaccination coverages in neighboring
countries following their achievement of interruption of wild
poliovirus circulation, lead to geographic areas at high risk of
circulation of WPV following its reintroduction from the remaining
endemic countries. This phenomenon is most notably seen in Africa,
where outbreaks have continued for more than 12 months in Angola,
Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Sudan.

Another area of concern is in India, where WPV1 (wild poliovirus type
1) was reintroduced to Uttar Pradesh after an 18 month interruption
of transmission. This followed a switch from use of mOPV1 (monovalent
oral poliovaccine type 1) to mOPV3 in an attempt to interrupt
circulation of WPV3, which apparently increased following the
interruption of transmission of WPV1, a situation that highlights the
challenges in the use of type-specific mOPV in a region with
persistent circulation of WPVs and observed challenges in both
vaccine coverages as well as vaccine efficacy.

virus documented to be circulating in the district, see
