BOCA RATON -- [_Bacillus anthracis_ has been detected in the nasal passage
of a co-worker of the man who died last week from the disease, health
officials said Monday. The building where both worked was closed after the
bacteria also were detected there.
The latest case, a man whose name was not immediately made public, was in
good condition Monday at an unidentified hospital, according to the Florida
health department. He has not been diagnosed with the disease. A nasal swab
from the patient tested positive for the anthrax bacterium [_Bacillus
anthracis_, said Tim O'Conner, regional spokesman for Florida's health
department.
It was not yet clear if anthrax had only infiltrated his nose or had gotten
into his lungs, officials said. Relatively large anthrax spores that lodge
in the upper respiratory tract are less dangerous than smaller spores that
get into the lungs. Doctors "describe his condition as good right now,"
O'Conner said. "He hasn't been diagnosed with the disease, there's just a
presence of (the disease [pathogen) in his nostrils." "He was given a
nasal swab because he happened to be in a hospital and he was ill," said
Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta.
O'Conner and Reynolds said they did not know what symptoms of illness the
man displayed or whether any of the symptoms were consistent with anthrax.
The disease in early stages may resemble the flu. A co-worker of the man
died Friday, the first person in 25 years in the United States to have died
from the rare inhaled form of anthrax.
[The deceased patient, 63, was a photo editor at the supermarket tabloid
The Sun. Environmental tests performed at the Sun's offices in Boca Raton
detected the anthrax bacteria, O'Conner said. The Sun's offices were
shuttered, and law enforcement, local and state health and CDC officials
were to take additional samples from the building Monday, O'Conner said.
Some of the other environmental samples taken at the newspaper office last
week are still being tested, said Reynolds. She would not say just where
the sample that tested positive for the bacteria was found.
About 300 people who work in the building were being contacted by the Sun
and instructed not to come to work Monday and to undergo antibiotic
treatment to prevent the disease. Nasal swabs will also be taken of all the
other workers, said Reynolds.
It was unclear when final tests would tell whether the second man has
full-blown anthrax. [Anthrax normally has an incubation period of up to 7
days, but can take up to 60 days to develop, O'Conner said.

[This co-infected person will be able to provide useful information on when
he & the first patient were together or not. At this time it would seem
that he just has spores in his nose. Let us hope that is all he has, other
than the reason he went to hospital in the first place, which itself is not
uninteresting. - Mod.MHJ
