[Given the events associated with bluetongue virus in that region, it was unusual that the disease had not yet been reported in Turkey.

The report of this outbreak in Turkey confirms recently published ProMED-mail requests for information from Turkey; see Mod.AS's comment in the following ProMED-mail reports:
- ProMED- mail 20140807.2668336: "The observed apparent absence of outbreaks in Turkey is misleading; most likely, BTV-4 is currently circulating in this country as well."
- ProMED-mail 20140716.2614894: "Information from other countries in the region, with special reference to the eastern neighbor of Bulgaria and Greece, namely Turkey, will be appreciated."

The location of the outbreak, exactly on Turkey's border with Bulgaria, is "interesting". This is probably just the most northern detection in Turkey; other outbreaks should be found within Thrace and further south and east in Turkey.

Bluetongue was initially recorded in Turkey as early as 1944 (Hatay province, south Anatolia); since then, several epizootics have been reported, mainly in Turkey's western, Mediterranean regions and in Thrace. BTV-serotype 4 was identified during a major epizootic in 1977 in the west. Serosurveys have demonstrated the circulation of bluetongue serotypes 9 and 16 in 9 provinces in south-east Anatolia in 2000/2001. Repeated epizootics on the Greek islands adjacent to Turkey's coast were indicative on the continuous circulation of the virus in Turkey's territories.

Since the introduction of OIE's WAHID reporting system (2004), one single bluetongue event has been reported by Turkey to the OIE, in May 2010 (Antalya, 2 clinical cases out of 150 susceptible sheep; no further details).
