A further 9 possible cases of the potentially deadly _E. coli_ O157
bug have been identified in children in Fife, NHS officials said
today, 11 May 2006. Following the suspected outbreak at a nursery in
Dunfermline, Fife, 4 children remained seriously ill in hospital.
Dr Jackie Hyland, consultant in public health medicine at NHS Fife,
said: "We currently have a further 9 possible cases and one of those
is being treated in hospital locally." Dr Hyland said the other 8
cases were under observation at home. It was not immediately clear
whether the 9 children attended the private Careshare Nursery, where
the suspected outbreak was first identified.
At Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital, 3 children, all aged 2, and a girl
aged 22 months are being treated for symptoms of the O157 strain. _E.
coli_ O157 killed 21 elderly people in Wishaw, Lanarkshire, in 1996.
The private nursery, based in the grounds of Lauder College's
Halbeath campus, remains closed while environmental health officials
examine what caused the spread of the bug.
Dr Hyland said: "We would remind all parents that if their children
attend the Careshare Nursery at Lauder they should not be attending
any other nursery or childcare facility until they have been given
the all-clear following submission of stool specimens. The nursery
staff have also been excluded from working at the nursery, associated
care facilities or within any food environment until they have been
given the all-clear. I would ask that employers of those affected
are as lenient as possible as parents will be required to organise
alternative childcare arrangements while their nursery is closed."

[Initial reports regarding this cluster of cases revolved around 3
cases of kidney disease (hemolytic uremic syndrome, HUS) caused by
_E. coli_ O157 infection. Not surprisingly, more cases are coming to
light, presumably enteric infection (abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea,
minimal fever) due to the organism. This is certainly likely, since
less than 10 percent of cases generally lead to HUS. The
relationship between these 9 cases and the initial ones linked to the
day care center will be helpful in delineating the source of the
organism, which can be food-borne (for example, undercooking ground
beef, unpasteurized milk, contaminated produce), water-borne (water
supply, lake, pool), spread from person-to-person and direct or
indirect animal contact (such as at a petting zoo).
