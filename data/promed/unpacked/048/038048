In recent years, the incidence of Ross River disease [RRV] in Australia has increased somewhat, with most cases reported from Queensland. Rates in Western Australia and Northern Territory have not changed substantially. [1,2]. See graph at: https://www.gideononline.com/2017/11/15/ross-river-disease-australia/.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Berger for his comments and references.

Ross River virus infections occur across Australia and can be serious. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

As noted earlier, Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to eliminate mosquito breeding sites and to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.
