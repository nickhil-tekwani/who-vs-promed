At least 22 people on the Fond du Lac Reservation experienced foodborne illness linked to _Escherichia coli_, a spokesperson with the Minnesota Department of Health said on Wednesday 23 Jul 2014.

The strain is believed to be _E. coli_ O157, commonly associated with ground beef, said the spokesperson. The strain that prompted Applebee's restaurants to adjust its Minnesota menus earlier this month [July 2014] was _E. coli_ O111, the spokesperson said as a way of comparison. The restaurant chain voluntarily changed a supplier as well as removed its Oriental chicken salad and other nuts and leafy vegetables from its Minnesota menus in that instance. Health department spokesman Doug Schultz said the 15 people reported ill in that case was "probably the tip of the iceberg."

Schultz explained that Minnesota is a "real-time investigation" state, placing it at the forefront of reactions to foodborne illness. The goal of a real-time investigation is to arrest the spread of illness by pulling potentially contaminated fare, rather than other states, which conduct follow-up investigations. A state epidemiologist is leading the Fond du Lac investigation with help from an environmental health supervisor, as well as University of Minnesota graduate epidemiology students, who are making calls to people who were sick. "We're still interviewing and the numbers could change," Schultz said.

Schultz said the Fond du Lac Reservation's assumption that its spate of outdoor gatherings, including powwows, an elder picnic and outdoor meetings, contributed to the outbreak was a fair one. Health department research shows that catered events, such as weddings, parties and potlucks "are notorious for being places where transmission occurs."

Fond du Lac officials urged residents to purge any leftovers after the start of the investigation. The 1st report of illness on the Fond du Lac Reservation was 17 Jul 2014, Schultz said. Hospitals are mandated to report cases of suspected foodborne illness, and that is what elicited the current investigation. Regarding the cause, Schultz said the health department is not giving up. "We're always optimistic," he said. "We've got some of the best investigators in the country working on it."

[Whether undercooked ground beef or another vehicle including salad components, unpasteurized dairy products, or drinking or recreational water source is responsible for this outbreak is yet to be determined in this EHEC outbreak involving Native Americans.

The seminal outbreak of EHEC O157:H7 was associated with undercooked ground beef, and this vehicle will remain prototypically associated with the infection. Commercial ground beef is not simply a piece of meat that is run through a grinder, but rather it is usually produced in bulk using the parts of the cow remaining after primal cuts of beef (to produce steaks and roasts) are removed, usually from multiple cows and even different slaughterhouses. This lower grade product, called beef trim, tends to be cut from the parts of the cow more likely to have had contact with bovine feces.
