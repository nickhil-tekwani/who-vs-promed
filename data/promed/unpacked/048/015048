Re: Ebolavirus, animal - Uganda (02): porcine, epidemiological assessment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red river hog has a distribution essentially sympatric with Ebola in Africa. I've always been a bit skeptical of wild hogs, and/or domestic/feral hogs being a natural reservoir for Ebola, but certainly the opportunity for human-animal contact is pronounced. And, the other mammal species in which there have been die-offs (some nonhuman primates, duikers, great apes) all share a common feeding adaptation of terrestrial foraging. Red river hogs are also among the most destructive pests for rural farmers and considered a good source of bushmeat -- the meat being considered "sweet" just as it is for feral hogs in the US and preferred as a hunted species not merely because of their damage to the farms but because of its preferred meat.

Despite my skepticism, if the hogs are not reservoir (maintenance) hosts but perhaps amplification hosts, there could be a role I am discounting based on the hunting and ethnographic data. It certainly deserves scrutiny and study!

[The red river hog (_Potamochoerus porcus_) is a wild member of the pig family living in Africa, with most of its distribution in the Guinean and Congolian forests. It is rarely seen away from rainforests, and generally prefers areas near rivers or swamps. - Mod.AS

Interesting overlap in distribution. Picture of these magnificent animals: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/0_Potamochoerus_porcus_-_Potamoch%C3%A8res_roux_(2).JPG. - Mod. PMB

But in 40 years of Ebola outbreaks investigated in Africa, not a single case of Ebola in a hunter or consumer of wild hogs has ever been reported. - Mod.JW
