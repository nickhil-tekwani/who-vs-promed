The British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) is advising food manufacturers
and caterers to stick to British eggs bearing the Lion mark, after a
new salmonellosis scare linked to Spanish eggs.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has linked outbreaks of salmonella
in northwest England and the West Midlands to contaminated Spanish
eggs. Almost 140 people have been affected.

The bug, _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis PT [phage type]
14b, involves eggs from a single supplier in Spain, the HPA believes,
which were mainly supplied to catering establishments.

The agency has been in touch with the Spanish authorities, which are
now said to be heat-treating eggs to kill any salmonella that could be
present. Investigations in the UK are continuing but all supplies
linked to the Spanish producer have been taken out of circulation.

The BEIC told FoodManufacture.co.uk that the risk to food
manufacturers is smaller, due to pasteurization of eggs during the
processing of products such as mayonnaise. However, the council warned
that eggs carrying salmonellae could cause cross-contamination
problems in food factories.

Highlighting previous issues with Spanish eggs, the council said in a
statement: "The outbreak follows a fatal outbreak of salmonella food
poisoning in 2002, which was also linked to Spanish eggs.

"In 2004, Spanish eggs were linked to a food poisoning outbreak at a
cafe in central London, with 1/3 of the Spanish eggs used by the cafe
testing positive for salmonellae.

"An outbreak in a restaurant in Kent in 2005 was also linked to
Spanish eggs after owners purchased a batch of Spanish eggs from an
unapproved supplier."

The BEIC also cited the 2009 salmonella outbreak in England, which
involved _S._ Enteritidis PT14b, which has not been found in
egg-laying flocks in the UK.

The British Lion code of practice includes vaccination of hens against
salmonella. BEIC chairman Andrew Parker said: "It is unbelievable that
British consumers are still being put at risk by imported eggs. There
are plenty of high quality British eggs available, yet UK caterers
think that it's OK to risk their customers' health by buying cheap,
infected, imported eggs."

[A classic vehicle for non-typhoid (and non-paratyphoid) salmonellae,
eggs continue to play a part in this zoonosis. The UK program,
however, demonstrates that risk of egg-related salmonellosis can be
lessened at the source. Adequately cooking egg products lowers risk at
the "finish" -- in the kitchen. - Mod.LL
