According to the Health Department in New York City, over 120 persons made trips to the emergency department over the past week as a result of adverse effects or reactions after using synthetic marijuana.

Synthetic marijuana -- an herbal product sprayed with powerful and sometimes unknown chemicals -- was officially banned and labeled a Schedule 1 drug in late 2010 by the DEA, and is illegally sold at head shops, bodegas, and small grocery stores.

A Schedule 1 classification for a drug means that there is no medically approved use for the substance, placing the user at high risk, not only for misuse, but abuse.

The majority of the adverse reactions, according to the Health Department in New York City, occurred in East Harlem, and happened from 8 to 15 Apr 2015.

It is unclear as to whether a new or more potent synthetic cannabinoid has been added to new batches of the banned product that have recently been sold. Commonly marketed and sold under such names as "K2" or "Spice", the powerful and unpredictable concoction has great potential for adverse effects, including agitation, anxiety, elevated heart rates and elevated blood pressure. Seizures may also occur, placing persons at risk for aspiration, and the need for mechanical ventilation.

Users may also experience paranoia, leading to hallucinations and aggressive and violent behavior. Emergency department staff must chemically restrain such patients in order to prevent them from harming others as well as themselves when they are brought to the emergency department.

Those who also use ilicit drugs such as cocaine, MDMA or molly, or amphetamines along with synthetic cannabinoids can place themselves at risk for extreme surges of blood pressure leading to dangerous arrhythmias, strokes and heart attacks which can be fatal.

The synthetic cannabinoids also place users at risk not only for psychological dependency, but physical dependency as well, making addiction to these substances part of the ongoing discussion. Using these designer drugs is essentially like playing a game of Russian Roulette -- the reactions are so unpredictable and variable, and it's unclear what adverse effects could potentially occur.

Persons with a history of high blood pressure, seizures, or heart disease are at high risk for adverse reactions and should be warned to stay away from these substances at all costs.

[Marijuana contains THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, the pyschoactive component of the cannabis plant. However, the variety of synthetic marijuanas contain other ingredients and go by a variety of names. Among the names are K2, Spice, Mexxy, Black Mamba, fake weed, Yucatan Fire, Skunk, Moon Rocks and others.

Some of these synthetic compounds are promoted as herbal products, with label claims that they contain "natural" psychoactive material taken from a variety of plants. Spice products (and the others as well) may contain some dried plant material (not necessarily natural cannabis), but chemical analyses show that their active ingredients are synthetic (or designer) cannabinoid compounds. However, tests have shown that it is not a single product. For example, Black Mamba contains synthetic cannabinoid AM-2001 and oleamide and oleic acid.

The synthetic cannabinoids are not THC, but the body reacts to the synthetic cannabinoids as if it were reacting to the cannabinoids in cannabis. However, the synthetic variety can cause long-term problems, including long-term psychotic disorders.

The variety of synthetic cannabinoids is large and apparently constantly shifting to avoid detection and regulation by law enforcement. Consequently, it also makes it much harder on the physicians to stabilize and treat an individual who has had an overdose, or even a reaction to a synthetic hallucinogen.

The UK and the US have regulated a number of these substances, including cannabicyclohexanol, JWH-018, JWH-073, or HU-210. These substances are illegal to possess or use and are considered banned substances with jail terms of varying lengths, depending upon which country's laws are examined.

These synthetic products produce a longer lasting response, potentially in some people unexpected psychotic episodes for the remainder of their life, and apparently can "hook" people within seconds, despite near-death experiences.

Some states in the US have legalized the use of natural cannabis products. Therefore, in an effort to extend the natural product, and produce a desirable and longer-lasting "high," the synthetic product may be added to the natural product and unsuspecting customers may suffer untoward effects and even death. - Mod.TG
