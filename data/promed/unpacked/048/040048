Papua New Guinea: new polio case reported in different province
---------------------------------------------------------------
The National Department of Health of Papua New Guinea (NDOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) today [Mon 6 Aug 2018] announced a case of polio in a 3 year old boy from Mulitaka, Laigam District in Enga Province. The case is the 3rd in the country, following confirmation of 2 cases from Lae, Morobe Province in June and July 2018.

The confirmation was made on [Fri 3 Aug 2018] by the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory -- a WHO Collaborating Centre in Australia. The boy had an onset of symptoms on [30 Jun 2018] and onset of paralysis on [2 Jul 2018]. His vaccination history is unknown due to unavailability of the baby clinic book, and his travel history is being established.

Results from the global polio laboratory at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the new case is genetically linked to the other 2 cases from Morobe Province.

"The detection of the case is a result of our enhanced surveillance system put in place in all provinces in response to the confirmed polio cases in Morobe province," according to Pascoe Kase, secretary of the National Department of Health. "A joint NDOH and WHO team is currently in the field to conduct an epidemiological investigation. Confirmation of this case in Enga highlights that the outbreak has spread geographically, and this is a concern. It is critical that all children are rapidly vaccinated as part of the ongoing outbreak response in the country, to stop the spread of this virus and prevent further children from being paralysed."

"The identification of this case underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage and effective surveillance systems for early detection", said Dr Luo Dapeng, WHO representative in Papua New Guinea. "The virus can emerge in populations which are inadequately immunized. In many provinces, including Enga, the vaccination coverage is far below the required level."

CDC [has] issued a travel alert for Papua New Guinea due to the polio outbreak [http://outbreaknewstoday.com/cdc-issues-travel-alert-papua-new-guinea-due-polio-outbreak-62575/].

Given substantial vaccination coverage gaps across the country, the risk of further spread of polio within the country continues to be classified as high, particularly with confirmation of spread of the virus to Enga. "Any province with low routine immunization coverage or gaps in vaccination coverage during the outbreak response is vulnerable for polio virus circulation. This is highlighted by the new confirmed case in Enga," said David Mcloughlin, UNICEF representative in Papua New Guinea.

The National Polio Response Emergency Operations Center is currently updating its risk assessment and planning the enhancement of response operations, including possible expansion of vaccination to the entire Highlands Region.

More than 600 000 doses of oral polio vaccine have already been distributed in Papua New Guinea for supplemental immunization activities. Additional supplies for the remainder of the response are expected to arrive in country in the coming days.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Viki Hansen-Landis for this submission. As mentioned in the media report, this is now the 3rd case of cVDPV1 identified in Papua New Guinea (while the media report does not specifically state the virus is a cVDPV1, it does mention that the isolate was genetically linked to the 2 previous isolates identified in Morobe province which were cVDPV1), although the 1st case identified outside of Morobe Province. The date of onset of paralysis of this case is 2 Jul 2018.

Looking at the Wikipedia map of provinces, one sees that Enga province is to the north west of Morobe province, but is not contiguous with the province, suggesting travel (of the virus) through other provinces en route to Enga province. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Papua_New_Guinea). A better map showing the administrative divisions of Papua New Guinea can be found at: http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/papua_map2.htm.

The date of onset of paralysis of the 1st confirmed case in Morabe province was 24 Apr 2018, and the date of onset of the 2nd case (reported last week) was on 22 Jun 2018. The identification of this 3rd case, now in a different province is indicative of continued circulation of the virus in the country. - Mod.MPP
