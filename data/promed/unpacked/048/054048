On 21 Apr 2011, a notification on suspected FMD in a beef cattle herd
in Yavneel was received. Yesterday, 26 Apr 2011, a notification on
suspected FMD cases in a cattle fattening unit in Kibbutz Senir/Snir
was received.

Samples received at the FMD national laboratory of the Kimron
Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan were tested by ELISA and PCR and
found positive, in both cases, to FMD virus serotype O.

The zones in radius of 10 km [6 mi] around each outbreak have been
declared infected; see maps:

[The maps include the 3 km (2 mi) and 10 km zone circles around the
foci].

All permits for transportation of cattle, sheep, and goats, issued
prior to the said declaration for farms within the 10-km zones, are
void [see comment].

In entrances to all farms within the 10 km zones, disinfection
drive-through pools for vehicle wheels should be activated.

[In Israel, all transportations of farm animals, for breeding or for
slaughter purposes, are liable to written permits issued by the
District Veterinary Offices. Cattle in Israel have official identity
certificates. In case of suspected or confirmed outbreaks of
infectious disease, permits are withdrawn/suspended.

Both outbreaks are situated within Hazafon (Hebrew for North)
province. The outbreak in Kibbutz Senir (Snir), is situated 3 km from
the Lebanese border; this can be seen at the map attached to the
circular above (see URL). The Senir farm has suffered FMD outbreaks
several times in the past, including December 2005 (ProMED-mail
archive no. 20051228.3691) and January 2008 (archive no. 20080203.0436).

There is a large wild boar population in northern Israel, as well as
in the adjacent Lebanese and Syrian territories. According to the data
of the Israeli Veterinary Services and the national FMD laboratory
(Department of Virology, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan),
between 1987-1999, sera were sampled from 740 shot wild boars (_Sus
scrofa_) in northern Israel. 108 (14.6 percent) of the sera were found
SNT [serum neutralization test] positive. During the same period, 73
oesophagi were collected from the shot boars; in 2 of them, shot in
June 1992 in the vicinity of Senir, FMD virus serotype O was isolated.
One of them had typical FMD lesions on its feet.

A remarkable feature of FMD in Israel is its seasonality (in large
and small ruminants). 1st (primary) cases during the season usually
appear in December-March, peaking in April-June (70-75 percent of all
annual totals). Since 1974, not a single case has been recorded in
November. The reasons for that enigmatic phenomenon have not been
elucidated so far.

About 70 percent of primary outbreaks of FMD in Israel are seen in
areas adjacent to the northern frontiers, bordering Lebanon and Syria.
The current outbreaks are, chronologically and geographically, not
exceptional. The 1st outbreak during 2011 was recorded in March,
similarly in Hazafon.

The Israeli FMD vaccination scheme includes annual vaccination of all
cattle over the age of 3 months during October to December, applying
an oil-emulsion vaccine. During 2009/10, the following strains have
been selected to be included in the vaccine: O1 Geshur 85; O1 Manisa;
O1 3039; A22 Iraq 87; A Iran 05; Asia 1 Shamir. Small ruminants are
compulsorily annually vaccinated as well; since 2009, their vaccine
includes the strains O1 Geshur 85, O1 Manisa, O1 3039, A22 Iraq 87,
and A Iran 05. The results of this policy are very satisfactory,
particularly in dairy cattle where FMD cases have been highly
exceptional or rather absent for decades.

It will be interesting to note when have the holdings in Senir and
Yavneel been last vaccinated and if the affected animals, particularly
young ones, were included.

Israel has notified the OIE of the 2 outbreaks; the report, including
an interactive map, is available at
