Tomatoes are the probable source of a _Salmonella_ outbreak in Sweden that affected 70 people, according to public health officials.

Folkhalsomyndigheten (Public Health Agency of Sweden) identified 71 infections from 11 counties that belonged to the outbreak. This is up from 36 illnesses in 10 counties that were linked by whole genome sequencing at the end of September 2019. Vastra Gotaland, Jonkoping, Halland, and Dalarna reported the most patients.

Illnesses were recorded in all age groups with 46 women and 25 men ill. Of the cases so far linked to the outbreak, the last known date of illness onset was 19 Sep 2019.

Local disease infection units, Livsmedelsverket (Swedish Food Agency) and Folkhalsomyndigheten investigated the monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium outbreak. Analysis of the _Salmonella_ bacterial genome showed disease cases were related and it is likely they were infected by the same source.

Folkhalsomyndigheten did a case-control study to compare what those sick ate the week before they became ill with what healthy control people had eaten. Results showed that those who were ill had eaten tomatoes to a greater extent than the healthy control people. An investigation found the tomatoes were in supermarkets at the end of August 2019, but since they are fresh, there is no longer any stock left in grocery stores. Product testing was done but no tomatoes were positive for _Salmonella_. Authorities said the risk of being infected with _Salmonella_ from fresh tomatoes was very small. The outbreak strain has multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) pattern 3-12-11-N-211.
