The bacterial pathogen _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs) has been identified for the first time in Switzerland. It was detected by laboratory analysis in early 2017 in several Cantons in a number of nurseries on ornamental rose plants imported from the Netherlands. It is, at the least, suspected in additional sites in other parts of the country.

The names of the businesses concerned are not being released by the authorities, due to economic considerations and because, so far, the pathogen has only been found in closed cultivation systems claimed to pose a low risk of spread.

Swiss authorities were alerted by the Netherlands phytosanitary service in November 2016 that a consignment of rose plants suspected to carry the bacteria had been delivered. Investigations were started immediately and phytosanitary measures were taken following the diagnostic confirmation.

Swiss authorities say that, as far as is known at present, none of the infected rose plants were sold on from the nurseries. They also state that the detection is a special strain of Rs which so far in the Netherlands has only been found in glasshouses and may not be viable outdoors in the regional environment.

However, national potato growers are extremely worried since spread of the pathogen to the field could have catastrophic consequences for their crops.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). Yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting. Brown rot has been reported in several European countries. The pathogen also causes bacterial wilt of tomato, a major disease of the crop, and it can also affect other solanaceous crops. Rs has been included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects), contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed potatoes), soil and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation) and limited genetic resistance may be used.

Members of the _R. solanacearum_ complex affect more than 200 plant species including many important crops (for example, causing brown rot of potato). The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts.

Recently, brown rot was detected on ware potatoes in Poland while Rs infected rose plants were found in nurseries elsewhere in the country (ProMED-mail post 20170213.4834454), but a possible connection of the outbreaks does not seem to have been investigated. It appears that more information is needed about Rs strains occurring in Europe both in the field and in glasshouses. Until then, a potential risk from spread between closed and open cultivation systems cannot be excluded.
