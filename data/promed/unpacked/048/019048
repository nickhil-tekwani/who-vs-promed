6 people have been confirmed dead following a suspected outbreak of plague
in Arua district.
Dr. Darlington Akusa, who is part of the American-funded Uganda Virus
Research Institute team studying the plague outbreak, said the deaths
occurred in Logiri sub-county, near the north-eastern Congolese border, a
hotbed for the disease.
He said 24 people had been infected with the plague and had been admitted
to isolation wards. Akusa said they had flu-like symptoms, vomiting and
diarrhea, which are associated with the plague.
He said preliminary results from the tests confirmed pneumonic plague, the
least common but most lethal form of the a typical disease. Akusa said the
disease was suspected to have originated from areas bordering the DR Congo,
where WHO reported an outbreak of the plague 3 months ago.
