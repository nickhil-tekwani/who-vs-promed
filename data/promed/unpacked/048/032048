Residents of Edo state are on alert following a fresh outbreak of Lassa fever in the area.

Nigeria News gathers that the new outbreak of the killer disease in the state occurred in Esan North-East, Esan Central, Etsako East, and other local government areas.

The information was confirmed by the state's Commissioner for Health, Dr David Osifo, on Wednesday [25 Jul 2018] in an interview with reporters in Benin, the state's capital.

Speaking to the reporters, Osifo said: "People should protect their foodstuffs and water from rats through storage in well-covered containers. Avoid bush burning that can drive rats into people's homes from the surrounding bush. The environment and homes where people live should be clean always." He further said: "Residents in the state should avoid eating raw food that is not properly stored in covered containers. If possible, people should suspend the drinking of garri."

The commissioner also appealed to residents in the state to quickly notify the appropriate authorities as soon as they experience any symptom which relates to the disease.

The Edo State Commissioner for Health, Dr. David Osifo, has called on residents in the state to redouble their efforts against the resurgence of Lassa fever disease, as experts have identified occurrence of suspected cases of the disease in the endemic areas.

The commissioner, who made the call while addressing journalists in Benin City, Edo State capital, explained: "We have observed that after the intervention by Governor Godwin Obaseki to halt the spread of Lassa fever, it appears that residents in the state are slowing down on preventive measures against the spread of the disease. Medical experts with the health ministry have identified the resurgence of the disease with records of new cases in endemic areas such as Esan North-East, Esan Central, Etsako East, and other areas. People should ensure that they wash their hands frequently in addition to avoiding contact with infected persons. Any person with fever should go the hospital promptly. Eliminate rats from your homes and communities. Cook your food thoroughly."

[The week 27 report of 8 Jul 2018 from the Nigeria CDC indicated that there were 2 new Lassa fever cases in Edo state that week. The above report indicates that there are new cases in at least 3 local government areas in Edo state but does not indicate case numbers or the dates that these cases occurred.

The Edo state Commissioner of Health's warning about preventing infection by avoiding contamination of food materials and water by rodents is prudent. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_ and _Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus, _Mastomys natalensis_ can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis, and _M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomycus pamfi_ at: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.
