The Fisheries Ministry said on Friday [21 Dec 2007] that a cow in
northern Japan's Hokkaido had been tested positive for mad cow disease.
It was the 34th case of mad cow disease confirmed so far in the country.
According to the ministry's press release, the 15-year-old cow was
born in western Japan's Shimane Prefecture and was raised in
Hokkaido. After it was killed on Wednesday [19 Dec 2007], the beef
was tested positive for mad cow disease during check-up by a local
meat inspection institution.
The result was confirmed shortly after further testing at Hokkaido
University and another farming college nearby.
The cow was the oldest one in all the mad cow disease cases in Japan.
All of the cow's meat and gut were incinerated before entering
market, the press release said.

[OIE's (World Organization for Animal Health) website includes the
following data concerning the previous 33 BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalitis) cases reported from Japan:
2001: 3(*); 2002: 2; 2003: 4(**); 2004: 5; 2005: 7; 2006: 10 ; 2007
(as of 2 July 2007): 2
* one clinical case, 2 detected as result of screening at the abattoir.
** the 9th case was a bullock aged 21 months.
The said website provides also the data on the annual incidence rate
of BSE ("Number of indigenous cases per million bovines aged over 24
months") in OIE Member Countries that have reported cases.
Japan's data from the table are the following:
2001: 1.44; 2002: 0.97; 2003: 1.96; 2004: 2.491; 2005: 3.575; 2006:
5.018. This gradual increase (which seems to have peaked in 2006) is
different from all other BSE-infected countries, where the incidence
had peaked earlier. The table is available at

Some of the animals in Japan infected with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy may have contracted the disease from alternative milk
containing Dutch-made fat, according to an investigation by Japan's
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Kyodo News Service reported.
The investigations examined 32 of the 33 animals in Japan confirmed
to be infected with BSE. The ministry said the disease found in 13 of
those animals was highly attributed to alternative milk made from
powdered animal fat produced by a feed plant in the Netherlands,
according to Kyodo. The 13 cows were born in the Hokkaido or Kanto
regions between 1995 and 1996.
Alternative milk, which uses mostly skim milk as its basic
ingredient, is fed to baby cows up to 7 weeks after they're born.
The ministry added that the results of the investigations are not
definite, as Dutch and other reports have denied animal fat as a
cause of BSE, Kyodo reported.

A Japanese research into the cause of the BSE-epidemic indicates
again that milk replacers of Dutch origin may have been the source of
infection.
The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture has published a new report,
which states that 13 out of the 32 investigated BSE cases could have
been caused by powdered milk of Dutch origin. The total number of BSE
cases, so far, is 33.
The Japanese blamed the Netherlands initially in 2002. This led to
intensive discussions between the Dutch and Japanese Veterinary
authorities. A Japanese delegation visited Dutch processing plants to
see how the production of milk replacers was carried out here.
Research in Germany's Bavaria, in 2004, was also indicative of the
possibility that ingredients in calves' milk replacers could have
been the infective vehicle of the lethal bovine disease.
The Dutch authorities are of the opinion that it is not likely that
powdered milk from the Netherlands was contaminated, while it is
likely that meat-and-bone meal was the source. Had the Dutch products
indeed been infective, this should have been manifested in the
Netherlands as well, since the Dutch calves received the same
product. No connection between the feeding with milk replacers and
incidence of BSE could be established. On the other hand, such
connection could indeed be demonstrated between the inclusion of
meat-meals in animal concentrates and BSE cases.
Japan does not exclude the possibility that meat-and-bone meals were
also source of the BSE outbreaks. In 1990, Great Britain indicated to
Japan the possible hazard of BSE spread via meat-and-bone meals.

The Japanese Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry reports
there may be a link between some of the BSE-infected cattle in their
country and milk replacer. Last March [2007], a Professor at
Hiroshima University argued that some of the Japanese cattle were
infected shortly after birth, before they were exposed to
contaminated meat and bone meal. He suggested the exposure may have
come from contaminated milk replacer ingredients from the
Netherlands. He pointed out the infections occurred in 1995 and 1996
at a time when there was a sudden increase in BSE cases in the
Netherlands and Germany.
The Japanese Ministry investigated 32 BSE-infected cows in the
country and says 13 of the cases could be linked to powdered animal
fat produced by the same feed plant in the Netherlands. However, the
Ministry stresses the results are not definite and the Netherlands
says the animal fat was not contaminated with BSE.

[The possible role milk-replacers may have played in the
dissemination of BSE has been subject to discussion in several
ProMED-mail postings during the years 2001-2004 (the earliest,
20011213.3016 and 20011224.3108 on Japan and Denmark, published in
December 2001); see the reference list at the bottom.
Two German Journal papers, published in 2001/2002, concluded that,
under the tissue sourcing and production processes present in Germany
until the end of 2000, milk replacer with tallow of cattle origin
(and the potential of CNS tissue being included in this tallow)
considered a non-negligible relative BSE risk (in comparison to other
products). It may be assumed that similar circumstances prevailed in
other European countries, including the Netherlands.
Larry G. Paisley and Julie Hostrup-Pedersen, Danish Institute for
Food and Veterinary Research, published in Preventive Veterinary
Medicine 63 (2004) 135-149 their paper, "A quantitative assessment of
the risk of transmission of BSE by tallow-based calf milk-replacer".
Its abstract follows:
"A Monte Carlo simulation model was constructed to assess the risk of
BSE transmission to calves by calf milk-replacer (CMR). We assumed
that any BSE infectivity in the CMR would be associated with the
allowable levels of impurities in tallow used to manufacture the milk-replacer.
Simulations used 3 different levels of impurities, 6 different
distributions of the BSE infectivity titers of CNS tissues and with
and without inclusion of specified risk material (SRM). Our results
suggest that tallow-based CMR could have been responsible for some
BSE infections in nearly all simulations.
The reduction in the allowable impurities in tallow and the exclusion
of SRM have greatly reduced -- but have not eliminated -- the risk of
BSE transmission by CMR. The results of the simulations are
associated with much uncertainty."
