[Kibbeh or kibbe (also kubbeh or kubbi) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh) is an Arab dish made of bulgur or rice and chopped meat. The best-known variety is a torpedo-shaped fried croquette stuffed with minced beef or lamb. Other types of kibbeh may be shaped into balls or patties, and baked or cooked in broth. It is a popular dish in Levantine cuisine. It is widespread in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Egypt (where it is called koubeiba), Cyprus (where they are called koupes), Israel, the Palestinian Territories,[3] the Arabian Peninsula, and several Latin American nations which received part of the Syrian and Lebanese diaspora during the early 20th century, such as Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras and Mexico. It can also be eaten raw. - Mod.LL]
