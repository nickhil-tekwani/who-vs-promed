This was a suspect case at the time the 1st positive horse for eastern
equine encephalitis was reported in Nova Scotia. This is the 2nd confirmed
case:

A 2nd case of EEE in Nova Scotia
--------------------------------
Received confirmation of EEE in a 2nd horse submission. The following
information was circulated to the CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)
veterinarians in PEI (Prince Edward's Island), and they passed this
information on to us at AVC (Atlantic Veterinary College):

- 25 year old mare
- date of onset (clinical signs): owner came home from work early afternoon
20 Sep 2009 and first noticed signs, which worsened severely over next few
hours
- date of death: euthanized evening of 20 Sep 2009
- date of sampling: head removed immediately after euthanasia
- date of sample submission to the lab: delivered late evening 23 Sep 2009
- postmortem completed: 24 Sep 2009
- date of results: preliminary postmortem results 24 Sep 2009 - Rabies FA
[fluorescent antibody] (negative) 25 Sep 2009 - still awaiting TC [tissue
culture] on rabies; EEV [equine encephalosis virus], WNV [West Nile virus],
EVR [equine viral rhinopneumonitis] (sent to University of Guelph 28-30 Sep
2009: EEV on brain and cerebellum is positive, WNV on brain and cerebellum
is negative (not detected)
- vaccination history: unknown
- site location: Caledonia, NS

It should be noted that many horses in this region have not been previously
vaccinated for EEE. At this late time in the season, it is unlikely that
vaccination will be effective at this point since cold temperatures should
stop the mosquito season before effective immunity from vaccination could
be achieved (circa 4-6 weeks). Vaccination next spring/summer is more
logical, and mosquito prevention would be a more effective measure for the
few weeks of vector risk that are left in Nova Scotia. For previously
vaccinated horses in southern Nova Scotia, a booster vaccination at this
time would be warranted.

A Nova Scotia lab has confirmed that a 2nd horse has died of eastern equine
encephalitis, a mosquitoborne viral disease. Provincial veterinarian Dr Rob
Kerr said a 25 year old horse from the Bridgewater area had the disease,
which is almost always fatal to horses. The confirmation was made on
Wednesday [30 Sep 2009] after a sample of the animal's brain was tested.

Veterinarian Brian Manuel, who had 120 doses of a vaccine delivered to his
clinic, said he suspects at least 4 other horses in the area may also have
died of the virus. Manuel said body tissues of those animals have not been
tested, and there is no rule that horse owners have to report the disease.

The virus cannot be spread directly from horse to horse. Mosquitoes pick up
the virus by feeding on infected birds, then pass it on when they feed on
the blood of horses.

[Dr McClure's assessment of a booster vs. beginning a vaccination series at
this time in the year for equine residents is spot on. Winter will be
coming shortly, and the insect vector will die off because of the cold.

What is interesting is that cbc.ca carries a story on it, but searching for
eastern equine encephalitis on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency page
turns up no official reports in Nova Scotia, yet information and
recommendations are clearly making their way to Atlantic Veterinary
College. - Mod.TG
