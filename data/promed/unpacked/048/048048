The Population Reference Bureau (PRB) has just published a Bulletin that will
be of interest to ProMED-mail readers:
Olshansky, S.J., Carnes, B.A., Rogers, R.G., Smith, L. 1997. Infectious
Diseases -- New and Ancient Threats to World Health. Population Bulletin
52(2):1-52 (July).
The Population Bulletins published by the PRB are easy-to-read publications
that are
sophisticated in content but written in a style intended for teaching
purposes. Additional information and a press release on this Bulletin may
be found at the following Internet address: http://www.prb.org
Abstract
--------
Infectious and parasitic diseases (IDPs) are a leading cause of death and
disability in low-income countries, and are re-emerging as a serious health
problem in developed countries. The recent rise in IPDs runs counter to the
long-term decline made possible by advances in medicine -- especially
antibiotics and immunization -- wide-scale improvements in sanitation and
other living conditions, and growing public awareness of health and
nutritional practices.
This Population Bulletin examines the phenomenon of "new" and re-emerging
IPDs from an international perspective. The authors discuss the factors that
have influenced the re-emergence of these diseases, including urbanization,
migration and travel, and agricultural practices that have increased exposure
to diseases once confined to other animals and geographic areas. They also
explore strategies for slowing the rise of IPDs, including efforts to stem
poverty, improve immunization programs, and conduct educational campaigns.
The authors of the report are biodemographer S. Jay Olshansky from the
University of Chicago; biologist Bruce A. Carnes from Argonne National
Laboratory; sociologist Richard G. Rogers from the University of Colorado at
Boulder; and epidemiologist Len Smith from Australian National University.
