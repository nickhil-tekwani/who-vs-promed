No more deaths from rinderpest: OIE's recognition pathway paved way
for global declaration of eradication by FAO member countries in June
[2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The national Delegates of Members of the World Organisation for
Animal Health (OIE) declared today [25 May 2011] that rinderpest, one
of the deadliest diseases of cattle and of several other animal
species, is now eradicated from the surface of the earth.

At the organisation's 79th annual General Session in Paris, the
national Delegates of OIE Members unanimously adopted Resolution
18/2011, which officially recognized, following thorough control by
the OIE with the support of FAO, that all 198 countries and
territories with rinderpest-susceptible animals in the world are free
of the disease.

A 3-stage "OIE Rinderpest Pathway" for countries to be officially
recognized as free from the disease by the OIE was initially launched
in 1989 and in 1994, implemented in parallel with the Global
Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) managed by the FAO in
collaboration with the United Nations International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA).

In February 2011, OIE experts in charge of recommending free status
recognition in the framework of the OIE Pathway gave the green light
for recognizing the free status of the last 8 countries not yet
recognized.

Using considerable support to eligible countries from donors such as
the European Union, these international cooperation and coordination
mechanisms have been key to move towards global eradication
particularly in poorest countries.

In June 2011, the 192 Member countries of the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) will equally adopt a Resolution on the Declaration
of Global Freedom from Rinderpest and on the Implementation of
Follow-up Measures to Maintain World Freedom at the 37th FAO
Conference to be held in Rome, Italy from 25 Jun to 2 Jul 2011
recognizing this outstanding global achievement and the successful
collaboration of a multitude of governments, international and
regional organisations, the veterinary profession, and the scientific
community.

"Today we witness a historical event as rinderpest is the 1st animal
disease ever to be eradicated by humankind," declared Dr Bernard
Vallat, director general of the OIE. "It's a major breakthrough, not
only for science, but also for the cooperation policies amongst
international organisations and with the international community as a
whole. Above all, it is a success for veterinary services and the
entire veterinary profession, since the scarcity of resources
available to veterinary services in many countries that were
previously infected constituted a major obstacle to the progressive
control of rinderpest" he added.

"Rinderpest has been one of the top priorities of FAO in its quest to
defeat hunger and improve lives through agriculture," said Ann
Tutwiler, FAO deputy director-general (Knowledge). "With the
eradication of the disease in live animals livestock production around
the globe has become safer and the livelihoods of millions of
livestock farmers are less at risk. There are important lessons to be
learnt when it comes to defeating other animal diseases."

"In this historical fight against one of the most dreaded disease by
farmers around the world, the joint action of the veterinary
scientific community, international, and regional organisations,
governments, and farmers has been absolutely crucial. I was very proud
to be a part of this endeavour and have been particularly honoured to
officially present the report sealing the end of rinderpest to the
national Delegates with the OIE today," commented Dr William Taylor
chairman of the joint OIE/FAO Committee for Global Rinderpest
Eradication.

Post-eradication phase starting just now constitutes a great
challenge too.

Although the rinderpest virus no longer circulates amongst live
animals it is still present in a number of laboratories, such as for
the production of vaccines, should the disease reappear as a result of
an accidental release or deliberate act.

FAO and OIE are working on the preparation and implementation of
recommendations on confining the virus for research or vaccine
production purposes, in full compliance with international biosecurity
measures.

More about the disease
----------------------
The term rinderpest means bovine plague and rightly reflects the
devastation the disease brings to hit domestic and wild animal
populations, people's livelihoods and consequently, on entire local or
national economies.

Rinderpest, also known as cattle plague, is a contagious viral
disease affecting several species of wild and domestic cloven-hoofed
animals (animals with a hoof split into 2 toes) notably cattle and
buffalo. Rinderpest is caused by a virus of the family
_Paramyxoviridae_, genus _Morbillivirus_. Many species of wild and
domestic cloven-hoofed animals including sheep and goats, can show
milder clinical signs of the disease when infected, but the mortality
rate can reach up to 100 per cent in highly susceptible cattle or
buffalo herds.

Rinderpest was known before the Roman era. Plagues of rinderpest
killed hundreds of millions of cattle in Europe, Asia, and Africa.

An outbreak of rinderpest in imported animals in Belgium in 1920 was
the impetus for international cooperation in controlling animal
diseases, and was one of the key factors leading to the establishment
of the OIE in 1924.

The announcement of the eradication of rinderpest coincides with the
250th anniversary of the creation of the veterinary profession in
Lyon, France, and this victory marks a historical day for the
profession.

[2] News report

World first: cattle plague is declared eradicated
-------------------------------------------------
World farm monitors on Wednesday [25 May 2011] declared a
cattle-killing virus that has been a curse through the ages had been
wiped out, the 1st time an animal disease has been eradicated in human
history.

To prolonged applause from delegates, the global watchdog for
farm-animal trade approved a report certifying that the last 14
countries of the world were free of rinderpest, also called cattle
plague.

Highly contagious and often fatal among bovine species but not
infectious for humans, the rinderpest virus has a destructive history
going back 2000 years.

The disease probably originated in the steppes of Central Asia before
cutting through Europe, Asia, and Africa, helped by trade.

It has ruined livestock farmers and unleashed famines that in turn
have fuelled turbulence and war.

Stamping it out, a quest that can be traced back to 1920, brought
together the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the UN's Food
and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and national veterinary agencies.

Their prime weapons have been vaccines as well as routine
surveillance, in which outbreaks are swiftly spotted by veterinarians
and then circumscribed.

"It's a historic moment," said Bernard Vallat, director-general of
the OIE, the Paris-based agency that oversees veterinary health among
international trade in farm animals.

"The world is free of rinderpest, its virus no longer circulates
among animals," he told a press conference. "(...) A sword of Damocles
that has been hanging over all our heads has now been lifted."

Ann Tutwiler, deputy director general of the FAO, said eradication
massively boosted the fight against hunger and malnutrition, a problem
expected to worsen through population growth and climate change.

"We have a tremendous success that we can count today. It's a success
that's born of cooperation, collaboration, and partnership and most
particularly knowledge," she said.

Rinderpest afflicts cattle, yaks, wildebeest, and buffaloes but can
also cause milder symptoms in cloven-footed animals, including sheep
and goats. Animals become feverish, develop lesions in the mouth,
diarrhoea, and dehydration.

The disease has been blamed for devastating losses, borne especially
by small farmers who may see their entire herd wiped out, although its
impacts have also gone far beyond agriculture.

"Rinderpest epidemics and resulting losses preceded the fall of the
Roman empire, the conquest of Christian Europe by Charlemagne and the
impoverishment of Russia," the FAO said.

"When rinderpest was introduced into sub-Saharan Africa, at the end
of the 19th century, it triggered extensive famines and opened the way
for the colonisation of Africa."

Asked to describe the achievement, veterinarians compared rinderpest
eradication with that of smallpox, which was declared in 1979 to have
been stamped out through a global vaccination campaign.

The OIE assembly agreed that remaining samples of the virus should be
collected and destroyed except for a small number that should be kept
in special labs under high security, to avoid accidental release or
use in bioterrorism.

Guidelines for determining how this should be done, and which labs
should be approved, will be hammered out in the coming months in
meetings between OIE and FAO experts, the OIE said.

The future of the last stocks of smallpox virus, officially held in
US and Russian labs, divided the World Health Organisation (WHO) at
its assembly on Tuesday [24 May 2011]. Negotiations on the issue have
been postponed for 3 years.

The last 14 countries to be declared free of the disease were
Azerbaijan, the Bahamas, the Comores [Comoros], Federated States of
Micronesia, Gambia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Sao Tome, Saudi
Arabia, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Turkmenistan, and the United Arab
Emirates [see comment].

The FAO will hold its own ceremonies in Rome next month [25 Jun to 2
Jul 2011], attended by agriculture ministers and some heads of state,
to celebrate the breakthrough, Tutwiler said.

[Since January 2004, OIE's ad-hoc Group on Evaluation of Rinderpest
(RP) Disease Status of Members held 13 meetings to evaluate the
reports submitted by member countries to be recognised as being
rinderpest free. The Group's recommendations, based upon thorough
studies of the received questionnaires* and/or reports, were submitted
to OIE's Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases, and finally
presented to OIE's general annual sessions, to be approved for the
inclusion in the official list of rinderpest-free members. The last
and final meeting of the ad-hoc group was held in Paris on 11-12 Jan
2011.
* See at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/word/Questionnaire_AN_RP_2010.doc.

According to OIE's terrestrial animal health code, the report, as
required in the questionnaire, should include (from countries not
known to be historically free) documented evidence that surveillance
for both RP and RP virus infection, in accordance with Articles
8.12.20. to 8.12.27, is in operation and that regulatory measures for
the prevention and control of RP have been implemented. For the said
articles, see
http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.12.htm#article_1.8.12.20.

In June 2009, FAO and OIE agreed to establish a Joint FAO/OIE
Committee for Global Rinderpest Eradication (Joint Committee); the
main function of the Joint Committee was to provide a report of its
findings to the Directors General of FAO and OIE, stating whether they
are confident that the world can be declared free of rinderpest and/or
recommend the actions to be taken for this achievement to be settled.

The Joint Committee was composed of a total of 7 members, 3 nominees
from each organization and an additional, independent chairman. It was
also decided that where necessary, additional experts would be invited
on an ad hoc basis to address a specific topic. The Joint Committee
held 4 meetings (in Rome, Paris, and Vienna). It was given access to
the OIE archive of sanitary reports, amongst others, on rinderpest
since 1924 as reported by OIE Members, as well as the reports of the
OIE ad-hoc group on Evaluation of Rinderpest Disease Status of Members
and the reports of the Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases. The
Joint Committee was also given access to FAO archives and was fully
informed of the GREP activities in regions and countries. Its final
report, agreed during the concluding meeting (13-14 Jan 2011, OIE
Headquarters, Paris) was submitted yesterday (25 May 2011) by its
chairman to the General Session on 25 May 2011. The recommendations
chapter IV included 20 articles. Recommendation 8 says:

"National authorities should ensure that:
a. Rinderpest remains a notifiable disease;
b. A surveillance system (including rumour tracking and early
detection) be maintained to detect disease events;
c. Suspect cases, including undiagnosed die-offs, be rapidly
investigated (using existing mechanisms or, where appropriate, the
FAO/OIE Crisis Management Centre -- Animal Health) and necessary
actions be promptly taken."

The eradication of rinderpest became feasible by combining disease
surveillance with the methodic application of the highly effective
Plowright vaccine. Participatory surveillance methods were developed
and successfully applied in several target countries.

Additional information on rinderpest -- the disease (clinical signs,
post-mortem findings, differential diagnosis, transmission), the
history of its control and eradication efforts, the dates and venues
of the events to take place in various countries towards the final
declaration of global freedom in Rome, are available at
