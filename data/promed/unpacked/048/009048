Antelope and whitetail deer in south eastern Montana dying of bluetongue
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bluetongue, a gnatborne disease that causes animals to bleed to death
internally, is hitting antelope and whitetails in south eastern Montana.
Fish, Wildlife & Parks says the disease cannot be passed to humans but
suggests that hunters contact landowners to see if the disease is there.
So far "hundreds" of antelope and deer carcasses have been reported. The
heaviest concentration of the disease appears to be in the Melstone area
east to Ingomar and Sumatra. A hard frost will kill the gnats and biting
midges that carry the disease.

Disease blamed for wildlife deaths, suspected in livestock deaths
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A virus is blamed for some Montana wildlife deaths, and a state agency
suspecting the disease in Montana sheep is awaiting test results.
The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks says bluetongue has been
confirmed in a white-tailed deer [a cervid] and an antelope [which is in
the family Bovidae, making it a bovine]. It's suspected in other recent
deer and antelope deaths in central and south eastern Montana. Another
state agency, the Department of Livestock, suspects bluetongue in sheep,
and is awaiting a laboratory report.
Early this week [17-21 Sep 2007], the department ordered that sheep
producers in Musselshell County not transport their animals for 30 days.
That restriction came after about 100 sheep in the county died during the
previous 2 weeks. The order against transportation is intended to reduce
the possible spread of bluetongue, which is transmitted by gnats.
The wildlife department says bluetongue is not a risk to human health.

Bluetongue disease hitting parts of Montana
-------------------------------------------
An insectborne viral disease is spreading through central and south east
Montana and could affect archery hunters who are planning to travel through
the area.
Cases of bluetongue have been confirmed in one white tailed deer and an
antelope between Roundup and Miles City and in addition several hundred
deer and antelope near Melstone have died from the disease. Officials say
the virus causes quick and fatal internal hemorrhaging and is transmitted
through biting gnats.
We spoke Ron Aasheim with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks who says that
archery hunters should check with local landowners for hunting
opportunities because deer and antelope harvest occurs on private land.
Bluetongue does not affect humans either through contact, or consumption of
infected animals.
