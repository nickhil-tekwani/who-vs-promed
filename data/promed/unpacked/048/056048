RABIES, DOGS - BELIZE
*********************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Peter Singfield <snkm@btl.net>

I have finally found something valid to contribute. Though we have plenty
of diseases sweeping through Belize at any one time -- we just are getting
over dengue and bracing for a serious bout with malaria as mosquito
populations are quite high -- it is seldom that I can get any proof of
sufficient quality of the nature of the disease.
Would we were all so blessed with modern laboratories to analyze every
sniffle, cough and death as in the more fortunate areas of this planet. So
this limits the "scientific" validity of disease monitoring from a person
such as in my present position.
Would be nice to have a "Third World" ProMED-mail where we could report in
such a manner as this:
"A disease resembling for all practical aspects malaria has just swept
through Orange Walk and 150 babies have died."
This actually did occur about 7 years ago!
But without antigen reaction tests, and serotype results, etc., one feels
rather intimidated reporting in this forum. I do believe that this leads to
a false negative -- or [a sense] that there are no serious diseases going
around. There are many at any one time, we are just not rich enough to
identify exactly what they may be.
Be that as it may, the following I have laboriously typed in (manually)
from my latest edition of the Amandala newspaper. It may well give you the
"flavor" of what life is all about here...

Rabies Epidemic Feared in Cayo District
Belize; Central America
(Extracted from the Sept 14, 1997 Amandala Belize newspaper)
Cayo, Thurs, Sept 11
Thirty persons are now being treated with the anti-rabies human vaccine in
the Cayo District, after having reportedly been bitten or scratched by
dogs. This represents a five-fold increase in the number of persons being
treated since last week Thursday. These persons are obtaining a five-dose,
five-treatment, costing the ministry of Health a total of five hundred
dollars per person.
Health Officials now say that the number of persons being treated with the
vaccines may soon rise to fifty, as soon as other complaints are confirmed.
"These people are highly susceptible to the rabies virus and they must take
precautions," says Luis Godoy, a Public Health Inspector for San Ignacio
and surrounding areas, who has observed several dogs succumb to rabies
since August 13 this year.
Eight members of the San Ignacio Public Health Department today conducted a
house-to-house anti-rabies vaccination of dogs in Moraton. The team has so
far vaccinated over five hundred dogs from Benque Viejo, Bullet Tree Falls
and some sections of San Ignacio. The Goal is to cover both San Ignacio and
Santa Elena, by the end of this weekend.
The dog vaccination campaign comes at the right time, with mounting
evidence that rabies is no longer localized. Dogs from Camalote and San
Ignacio were exterminated yesterday and their brain tissues are now being
transported to Panama for examination.
According to District Medical Officer Dr. Armando Betancourt, tests done of
dogs which had been taken from Bullet Tree and Moraton last week confirmed
the presence of the rabies virus.
Under the cover of darkness on Wednesday of last week, members of the
Police, Public Health and Town Board were able to exterminate over a
hundred dogs in the San Ignacio and Santa Elena Area. The extermination of
dogs will be continued.
If the rabies outbreak worsens, the Cayo District may soon have to be
quarantined and if Cayo Public Health resources become stretched even
further, the Public Health Bureau in Belize City will have to intervene
with added resources and volunteers.
