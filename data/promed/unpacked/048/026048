[The following message has been received from a reliable source.- Mod.AS]
Fifty-six outbreaks of Bluetongue have been detected in ovines in the
southern district of Sardinia, with at least 303 deaths. The likely
BTV serotype involved is BTV-1.

[Official confirmation or otherwise will be appreciated. In case
confirmed, details on the affected species, breed and age-group,
clinical observations and corresponding morbidity and mortality
figures, their vaccination status and particularly the serotype
involved, will be helpful.
BTV-1 has been recently reported as spreading in Algiers; later
notification on a BT epizootic in Morocco did not specify the
serotype (probably not yet subtyped), but it might be speculated to
be BTV-1 as well.
BTV-1 is regarded as new to North Africa. Its origin might become
clearer when genotyping is accomplished and published.
In previous years, BTV serotypes 2 (1999/2002) and 4 (2003/2004) were
identified in the region, spreading from Maghreb countries to several
southwest European territories. Sardinia was affected by BTV-2
(2000/1/2) and BTV-4 (2003/4). Other territories, infected by BTV-2
and/or BTV-4, were Sicily, Corsica, the Balearic Islands, Spain and
Portugal. The losses in Sardinia were heavy; reportedly, the
Sardinian dairy sheep breed seems to be particularly susceptible to bluetongue.
Detailed descriptions on the BTV-2 epizootic in Sardinia are included
in the following 2 papers, available on-line at
