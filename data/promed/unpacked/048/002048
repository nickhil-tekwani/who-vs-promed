Japan has confirmed that a bird flu outbreak at a poultry farm in a
southwestern prefecture was caused by the H5N1 virus, making it the 4th
such outbreak to hit the country in 2007.
The Agriculture Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that test results
had shown that the outbreak in Miyazaki prefecture, first detected earlier
this week, was due to the H5N1 virus.
The H5N1 bird flu has already been confirmed at 2 other poultry farms in
Miyazaki, Japan's largest poultry-producing region, and at one farm in the
western prefecture of Okayama.
There have been no reported cases of human infection from the virus in Japan.
The country suffered 4 outbreaks of the H5N1 bird flu in 2004, but has been
free of it until it emerged this year.

Over 100 chickens in Vietnam's northern Ninh Binh province died in the last
few days, Vietnam News Agency reported Friday.
Specimens from the dead fowls from some 40 households in Nho Quan district
are being tested for bird flu viruses, the agency quoted Chairman of the
People's Committee of the district, Nguyen Quang Van, as saying.
The local Veterinary Bureau has isolated and disinfected farms having dead
fowls, encouraged people to raise poultry in cages, not let them stroll,
and banned egg incubation, he said.
Four Vietnamese provinces have detected no new bird flu outbreaks for at
least 21 days, meeting the criteria for announcing an end to the outbreaks
in their territory, reducing the number of affected localities nationwide
to 4, according to the Department of Animal Health under the Vietnamese
Ministry Agriculture and Rural Development on Thursday.
Since late December 2006, a total of 7 provinces, namely Hau Giang, Kien
Giang, Soc Trang, Tra Vinh, Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, Vinh Long, and Can Tho City,
have been hit by bird flu, the department said, noting that the first 4
localities meet the criteria.
Bird flu outbreaks in Vietnam, starting in December 2003, have killed and
led to the forced culling of dozens of millions of fowls in the country.

Tests from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) have confirmed that the
sample from the poultry found dead on a farm near Lowestoft in Suffolk
contained the H5N1 avian flu virus, and that it is the highly pathogenic
Asian strain. It is similar to the virus that was found in Hungary in January.
