[1] Cholera - Iraq (Baghdad)

Doctors alert for a possible cholera outbreak in summer season
--------------------------------------------------------------
Health experts in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, warned of a possible
cholera outbreak this summer, saying they have seen an increase in
cases so far this year and called for urgent action to prevent it
from spreading.

Dr Duraid al-Khatoon, a pediatrician at the Children's Teaching Hospital in
the capital, told IRIN that as of Jan 2005 at least one case of cholera in
children has been reported every day and that 90 percent of the cases were
living in suburbs where sewage treatment is non-existent. He added that in
2004 less than 10 cases were reported by the hospital monthly, representing
a 3-fold increase in the disease [presumably meaning he is seeing 30 cases a
month now. - Mod.JW].

"We have entered the summer season and the water and sewage treatment
in Baghdad still requires urgent repair. Children are developing
cholera from these sources and all my patients are being told not to
drink water unless it has been boiled and to keep children from
playing in streets," al-Khatoon added.

Dr Abdul Jalil, director of the country's Infectious Diseases Control Center
(IDSC), told IRIN that ... there had been only 2 fatal cholera cases in Iraq
since 2003. Jalil highlighted the last cholera outbreak in Aug 2003, when
187 cases were reported in the southern city of Basra, because of poor
sewage and water treatment. "Many suburbs of the capital still have poor
sewage treatment, which can lead to contamination of food. Our water is not
treated properly ... The Ministry of Public Works is moving slowly to solve
this problem and it's affecting the health of Iraqis," Jalil added.

Local officials told IRIN that Baghdad still has old sewage and water
pipes which haven't been repaired. The pipes often run beside each
other and lack of electricity has caused water to be pumped at low
pressure, allowing sewage to seep into the fresh water delivery system.

120 hospitalized, 2 test cholera-positive
-----------------------------------------
Panic struck residents of Vadodara city on Tuesday morning, 24 May
2005, as reports of a cholera epidemic spread. Over 120 people from
different parts of the city were admitted to various hospitals since
the previous night. Latest reports said that 2 of the patients
admitted to Infectious Disease Hospital tested positive to cholera. A
15-year-old from Roshan Nagar and a 32-year-old from Madanzampa were
declared to be cholera-affected.

Authorities at SSG Hospital confirm that all the 16 children admitted
there were victims of gastroenteritis. "The disease has spread
through water.However, all the patients are stable," said S Binjoo,
Resident Medical Officer (RMO). People from Panigate, Hathikhana,
Fatehpura, Yakubpura and Wadi were rushed to hospitals after they
fell ill. Those admitted to SSG Hospital came from these areas.

The influx of patients began around 10 pm, 23 May 2005, when several
residents in Hathikhana, especially children, were rushed to
hospitals with vomiting and dysentery symptoms. Patients kept coming
in until 4 am the following day. "It was chaos throughout the night
here. People carrying children and patients were using private
vehicles to rush to nearest hospitals," said a resident of Mahavat
Phadia, Hathikhana. His 2 children were admitted to Jamnabhai
Hospital.

"A group of people reportedly attended a wedding in Hathikhana where
they may have been affected by food poisoning. However, several cases
were from individual pockets in different regions and hence it is too
early to say what caused the illness," said Dr Pragnya Joshi, Civil
Surgeon, Jamnabhai Hospital, which had got the maximum number of
cases - 107. The hospital has got 78 cases from Hathikhana, 11 from
Panigate, 7 from Fatehpura, 7 from Yakubpura and 4 from Wadi.

"2 cases admitted to ID Hospital were confirmed as cholera. We have
collected water samples from the affected areas and are trying to
know why the epidemic spread," said Deepikaben Janak Kumar Thakkar,
Chairman of the VMC Health Committee.

Cholera Outbreak in Quelimane
-----------------------------
The Mozambican health authorities in Quelimane, capital of the
central province of Zambezia, say that the city has been facing an
outbreak of cholera since 13 May 2005, reports the 26 May 2005 issue
of the Maputo daily "Noticias". So far 38 cases of the disease have
been reporteded, and none of the patients has died.

Meanwhile, in Beira, capital of Sofala province, the health
authorities report a new cholera upsurge, diagnosing 5 new cases
within 24 hours. Titos Guambe, the chief of the Community Health
Department in Quelimane, said that the health services had been on
alert against an increase in the number of cases of diarrhea, that
were later diagnosed as cholera. All patients are receiving treatment
at a special cholera ward.

Despite these figures, Guambe said that the situation has not yet
reached alarming proportions, and estimated that only about 2 or 3
cholera patients a day are admitted to the ward.

He said that, so far, only Quelimane has been reporting cholera
cases, but all districts in Zambezia have received sufficient drugs
and equipment to face any eventual outbreak.

Prime Minister Luisa Diogo has expressed serious concern at the
increase in the number of diarrhea and cholera cases in Quelimane and
has instructed the local health authorities to monitor the situation
permanently, ensure that chlorine is distributed to purify water, and
enhance prevention campaigns against this disease. She noted that
the poor management of the water supply system and poor sanitation
conditions are the main problems that lead to cholera outbreaks.

Quelimane and Mocuba, the 2 main cities in Zambezia, were seriously
hit by cholera in 2004, when they reported 1389 cases of the disease,
resulting in 13 deaths.

As for Sofala, where the local health authorities describe the
situation as under control, the chief of the epidemiology department,
Hussene Kamissa, said that not a single case has been reported during
the last month in the district of Marromeu, where earlier in 2005
there had been 152 cases with 2 deaths.

[6] Shigellosis, airline food, 2004 - USA (multistate, multicountry ex HI)

Airline food linked to illness
-------------------------------
Contaminated carrots served on several flights out of Honolulu likely
caused 45 people to suffer food poisoning across 22 states, Japan,
Australia and American Samoa, a state epidemiologist said Thu, 19 May
2005.

The outbreak has sparked one lawsuit, fil
ed Thu, 19 May 2005, against airline caterer Gate Gourmet Inc., which
included the carrots in meals served 22-24 Aug 2004. The company, based in
Virginia and Switzerland, was sent a warning letter by the FDA on 21 Apr
2005 citing violations found in a Feb 2005 inspection of its Honolulu
facility -- such as a "pink slimy substance" dripping onto the conveyor of
the pot washing machine, live cockroaches and flies, and mold growing on the
windows of a refrigerator. Gate Gourmet provides meals for Northwest,
Delta, United, Hawaiian and Aloha airlines.

The company, which has locations in 30 countries, says it responded
quickly to the Apr 2005 letter and contends the investigation of the
Aug 2004 illnesses has not been able to definitely identify the
source of the contamination.

Changes at the company's Honolulu facility included repairing
equipment, training employees, cleaning, painting, hiring additional
janitors, and changing local top management, Gate Gourmet spokesman
Jon Bronson said in an e-mail. "As a result of these efforts, our
Honolulu facility passed its most recent FDA inspection conducted
this week," Bronson said.

While an investigation by the state Health Department and the FDA
narrowed the likely source to carrots contained in salads served by
Gate Gourmet, investigators don't know when, where or how the carrots
were contaminated, state epidemiologist Paul Effler said.

The investigation "indicates that carrots by Gate Gourmet were the
likely source," Effler said. "It doesn't indicate that contamination
occurred at Gate Gourmet or in the field where carrots were harvested
or anywhere along the production chain. That's what we don't have."

According to the lawsuit, a man from Orlando, FL, became ill with
symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, cramps, fever and tremors 3 days
after a Northwest Airlines flight from Honolulu to Minneapolis. He
tested positive for _Shigella sonnei_ bacteria.
