STATE CLOSES QUILCENE BAY TO OYSTER HARVESTING, REMINDS CONSUMERS TO COOK
ALL SHELLFISH DURING THE SUMMER
OLYMPIA -- The state Department of Health today closed Quilcene Bay in Hood
Canal to oyster harvesting due to increased levels of a naturally-occurring
bacteria called _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. This is the third area in the
state to be closed recently due to high levels of the vibrio bacteria. The
other two areas are the Jackson Cove to Pleasant Harbor area of Hood Canal
and all of Totten and Skookum Inlets in south Puget Sound.
The closure area for Quilcene Bay includes all the growing area north of a
line drawn from Point Whitney to the most southern tip of Bolton Peninsula
on Hood Canal. "Nearby Dabob Bay is not included in this closure at this
time and is being closely monitored," said Jennifer Tebaldi, director of
the Office of Shellfish Programs. "Most growers and the tribes have ceased
harvesting in Hood Canal and south Puget Sound or are taking extra
precautions such as labeling the oysters for cooking only."
These additional preventative measures that the growers and tribes are
taking this summer stem from the Department of Health's earlier request
that they voluntarily label their shellfish with a message to "cook
thoroughly" and to voluntarily stop the sale of oysters intended for raw
consumption. The Pacific Coast Oyster Growers Association and tribes have
also been instrumental in working with industry growers to abide by the
department's request. In addition, the shellfish industry and tribes are
reminding distributors and retailers to warn the public of the importance
of thoroughly cooking shellfish during the warm summer months.
The closure for Quilcene Bay and the other two closed areas will remain in
effect until bacteria levels decrease and environmental conditions change
to those unfavorable for the growth of the vibrio bacteria.
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is a naturally-occurring bacterium (unrelated to
pollution) which can be present in high numbers during periods of warm
weather and increased water temperatures. The bacteria can cause nausea,
diarrhea, vomiting and in some individuals, abdominal cramps and fever. The
incubation period is usually 12 to 24 hours, and full recovery may take up
to a week. Cooking oysters and other shellfish to at least 140 degrees F
kills the bacteria.

[Their 31 July press release 98-69 of the initial Vp '98 report included
the following statement:
"As a result of illnesses caused by _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ in Washington
last year, the shellfish industry, tribes, and health regulators
cooperatively developed a plan for protecting public health. During warm
weather periods, when _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ thrives, monitoring and
sampling efforts increase, the industry and tribes take extra precautions
in harvesting methods and refrigeration, and wholesalers, retailers and the
public are advised to cook shellfish before eating." - Mod.MHJ
