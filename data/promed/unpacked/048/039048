Comment on Alligators and Viruses
---------------------------------
Steve Grenard, commenting in "West Nile virus, reptiles, alligators - USA
(FL) (04) 20021117.5836" suggested that: "Viruses that affect endothermic
mammals and birds are rarely found in ectothermic reptiles. The late Dr
Sherman A Minton discovered evidence for the presence of Western equine
encephalitis virus in garter snakes during the summer and early fall but,
after winter and hibernation, it had disappeared, indicating that the wide
variation in body temperature endured by ectotherms offers an unfavorable
environment for such agents."
I have never heard of the late Dr. Sherman Minton, so it comes as a
surprise to me that he is dead. However, I suspect that Dr. Minton was
citing the work of others, and mis-citing it as well. Leo Thomas and
coworkers and others (1-2) showed that garter snakes, _Thamnophis_ spp.,
responded to experimental infection with Western equine encephalitis virus
(WEEV) by developing viremias of long duration. The virus was dormant
during winter (the colder months in Montana) but was reactivated in the
spring. WEEV was transmitted from infected _Culex tarsalis_ mosquitoes to
garter snakes and uninfected _Culex tarsalis_ mosquitoes fed on
WEEV-infected garter snakes became infected (3). Gebhardt et al. isolated
37 strains of WEEV from 84 snakes of three genera in Utah (4). There were a
total of 3 species of garter snakes found infected: _Thamnophis elegans_,
Th. vagrans_, and _Th. sirtalis_, a gopher snake (_Pituophis cateniter_),
and a blue racer (_Coluber constrictor_). Young born to naturally infected
snakes were shown to be infected.
Karstad (5) detected neutralizing antibodies to Eastern equine encephalitis
virus in serum samples from 5 snakes, one turtle, and one alligator
collected in the Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia. In experimentally inoculated
reptiles, high-titer viremias of long duration were observed in snakes,
lizards, alligators, and turtles. In 1992 studies in south Texas following
the 1971 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus epizoodemic there, Steve
Bowen and others from CDC isolated WEEV from Texas tortoises (_Gopherus
berlandieri_), which we dug out of the sand where they were hibernating.
In the same posting, Alexis Shelokov commented: "If my memory serves me
right, some years ago Craighead and colleagues of the NIH/MARU lab in
Panama reported evidence of frequent Eastern equine encephalitis virus
infections in local alligators." The Moderator requested a reference, if
anyone had one. I do not know of such a paper, but there is a reference to
the occurrence of antibody to Eastern equine encephalitis virus in lizards
in Panama (6). Dick Hayes and coworkers found that only 1/190 serum samples
from reptiles had antibodies to Eastern equine encephalitis virus (7).
However, experimentally-infected reptiles were highly susceptible to
infection. They found that high-titer viremias in snakes and turtles lasted
2-3 weeks. Further, they observed that an inoculated garter snake held in
an outdoor cage during the winter and 3 infected spotted turtles kept in a
refrigerator still had viremia when warmed up and bled 6 months
later. There are many more papers in the literature recording the
isolation of various arboviruses from reptiles.
All this brings up a question: If Kunjin virus is simply another name for
(actually a genotype of) West Nile virus, why have the Australians not
observed die-offs in farmed crocs? Do the slight genetic differences
between Kunjin virus and West Nile virus code for genes specifying
significant (for crocodilians) biological differences? Or have the crocs of
Australia come into some sort of equilibrium with Kunjin virus? If so,
perhaps there is hope for the wildlife of North America after all.
