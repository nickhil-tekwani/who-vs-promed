About 8000 Cape cormorants on Dyers Island, a 20-hectare breeding
area for seabirds east of Gansbaai on the southern Cape coast, have
died from avian cholera since 4 Oct 2004. This is about 6 percent of
the total Cape cormorant population on the island.
One of the complicating factors of avian cholera is that it is
unclear how the disease spreads, said Deon Geldenhuys of CapeNature,
the conservation authority that manages Dyer Island, though there are
signs that mucus and faeces might play an important role.
"We have no idea what causes avian cholera, why Cape cormorants are
the prime victims, and how it came to Dyers Island, as there hadn't
been outbreaks before the first one in 2002 that killed 17 000
birds," Van Geldenhuys said.
What CapeNature is sure about is that the disease spreads rapidly and
cannot be cured. This means that once a bird is infected, it will die
within 12 to 24 hours. The only way to limit the damage and protect
other birds is to kill the sick portion of the population, collect
the carcasses, and burn them.
"The cholera bacteria can survive up to 3 months after a bird has
died. Burning carcasses is the only way to kill the bacteria and to
stop dead birds from spreading the disease," Van Geldenhuys said.
At the moment, Van Geldenhuys says the disease is more or less under
control, as less birds are being found every day.
"This is a good sign for the near future of the cormorant population.
The timing of the outbreak is bad because it is breeding season, so
the more cormorants are dying, the fewer nests we will have, and the
fewer birds will hatch in November."
About the disease spreading to the mainland, Van Geldenhuys said: "It
could happen, but so far we haven't found sick birds elsewhere."
Dyer Island is the breeding place of many seabirds, 66 000 of which
are Cape cormorants.
In the last 3 years the island has been hit by 3 outbreaks of avian
cholera which killed thousands of birds, mostly cormorants. More than
5000 birds died at the end of 2003 and beginning of 2004.

Dyer Island avian cholera under control
---------------------------------------
The outbreak of avian cholera on Dyer Island, which has killed 8000
Cape cormorants in the past week, is under control as fewer dead and
infected birds are being found. That's the word from Deon van
Geldenhuys of CapeNature, the conservation authority that manages
Dyer Island.
At the moment 10 CapeNature staff are patrolling the island 3 times a
day in search of sick and dead Cape cormorants, the prime victims of
the fatal bacterial disease.
"We are working many hours a day removing dead and sick birds from
the colonies," said Van Geldenhuys. "Sick birds that are alive are
being killed on the spot and burnt with the carcasses of the dead
birds. Unfortunately this is the only way to contain this disease,
which is highly contagious and always fatal. The cholera bacteria
can survive for up to 3 months after a bird has died."
He said CapeNature staff were well aware of how contagious the
disease was and were taking care not to fuel the outbreak. "We want
to make sure people are not carrying the disease to other parts of
the island or to the mainland. While working here, faeces might
stick to boots and clothes. Although it is not sure that faeces plays
a role in the spreading of avian cholera, everyone has to have
clothes and boots disinfected before leaving the island. To further
diminish the chance of spreading, masks and gloves are required, as
it is not clear if avian cholera is spread through inhaling," Van
Geldenhuys said.
Because of these strict precautions combined with the nature of the
disease, Van Geldenhuys is not worried about the cholera spreading to
the mainland.
"The disease tends to hit colonies of cormorants. As there are no
cormorant colonies on the mainland, we don't have to be afraid of
this disease spreading. Besides, we have not found any dead or sick
birds on the mainland so far," he said.
