Upon detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in environmental samples from Brazil, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) / World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that Member States of the Region of the Americas continue to strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis in order to rapidly detect any new instances of imported poliovirus and maintain high immunization coverage against polio.

On [18 Jun 2014], the Brazil International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in sewage samples collected in March 2014 at the International Airport of Viracopos located in Campinas, Sao Paulo. The WPV1 was detected in sewage only. The isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance in Brazil that includes regular testing of sewage water from multiple sites. Brazil has been carrying out this routine surveillance for over 20 years. To date, there has been no reported suspected or confirmed case of paralytic polio in the country.

Genetic analysis of the WPV1 indicated a close match with a strain of polio recently isolated from a case of polio in Equatorial Guinea. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Following detection of this isolate, the public health authorities in Brazil are strengthening surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), engaging in an active search for AFP cases across the state of Sao Paulo. Brazil has conducted 2 national immunization campaigns per year, with oral polio vaccine from the 1980s until 2011. In 2012 and 2013, single vaccination campaigns were carried out. These campaigns have achieved vaccination coverage levels of over 95 percent in the last 8 years. Routine vaccination coverage has been above 95 percent in the municipality of Campinas as well as the State of Sao Paulo.

PAHO/WHO assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus from Brazil as very low given that there is a high level of immunity in the population as evidenced by the high levels of routine immunization coverage and periodic vaccination campaigns in the area, no evidence of WPV1 transmission thus far, and the response actions being implemented.

The Americas Region has been free of wild poliovirus transmission since 1991, and the last case of polio in Brazil occurred in 1989.

PAHO / WHO reminds Member States of the need to achieve and maintain high quality surveillance for timely detection and response to imported wild poliovirus. Member States are also reminded to achieve and maintain high vaccination coverage against polio in all municipalities. In this regard, Member States should analyze their coverage data systematically to be able to identify any areas with low vaccination coverage and intensify surveillance and vaccination in those areas accordingly.

PAHO / WHO reiterates that the recommendations made by the Technical Advisory Group meeting in Quito, Ecuador, held from [3 to 5 Jul 2013], remain valid; they include:
- All countries must reinforce activities aimed to achieve or maintain vaccination coverage greater than 95 percent in every district or municipality. If countries do not achieve that coverage, they must evaluate the accumulation of non-immunized people and conduct vaccination campaigns.
- All countries must continue to maintain adequate AFP surveillance in order for timely detection of imported, or the emergence of vaccine-derived, polioviruses (VDPVs), and must report such to PAHO / WHO in a timely manner to allow proper monitoring of the regional situation.

[ProMED-PORT moderator RNA, based in Sao Paolo, Brazil, had the following comments [trans. from Port. and edited]:
"The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 in environmental samples, reported here, leads to some thoughts:

- The potential poliovirus circulation (and many others, such as, more recently, chikungunya) due to the intense and fluid movement of people between countries and continents with distinct epidemiologic realities; the International airport at Viracopos -- although not (yet) a transit point and entry point of passengers coming from international flights -- is a major, if not the main, cargo airport in Brazil, with aircraft coming from different countries from all continents. Coming with the cargo include the crews and other workers who work in the transport of products and goods between countries.

- Environmental monitoring, while not permitting an identification of the specific flight/plane where the identified poliovirus came from, namely from which aircraft and which individual, it does demonstrate the importance of this strategy as a potentially useful element for surveillance of poliovirus circulation, especially with the ongoing scenario of the WHO global alert (See Polio - World alert, WHO, Archive Number: 20140505.2452107 http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=2452107), even in countries which have received certification of poliomyelitis eradication and have demonstrated adequate vaccination coverages and a well structured surveillance system for polio detection. The environmental monitoring, surely, must be understood as a strategy, a tool with the potential to qualify and guide further health surveillance, including monitoring vaccination coverage."

- As pointed out in the PAHO / WHO document, the identification of the virus only in a single environmental sample and having checked the origin of the virus (the virus is genetically related to a strain recently circulating in Equatorial Guinea), showing it was imported, the detection of the virus in environmental samples alone does not alter the status of Brazil with respect to poliomyelitis (certification of eradication) and does lead to emergency actions and specific recommendations. In contrast, the detection of the virus through environmental monitoring should be praised for being conducted, even though the country has been certified as having eradicated polio since 1994, as a means of keeping the polio eradication status and high vaccine coverages (obtained by routine immunization and the numerous National Vaccination Campaigns Against Polio).

- Above all, the present event reinforces both the maintenance of already existing and ongoing surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis and vaccination strategies (routine and in national campaigns) and points to the importance of discussion and potential adoption of specific strategies of vaccination for Brazilian travelers who go to countries where there is circulating poliovirus as well as those individuals coming to Brazil from foreign countries as tourists, migrants or refugees. - Mod.RNA"

Historically, the "birth" of the polio eradication initiative was in Brazil in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the MOH adopted the strategy of national vaccination campaigns as part of its polio control efforts (very much encouraged and assisted by Dr. Ciro de Quadros of PAHO; see Obituary: Ciro de Quadros 20140618.2515703). This moderator was fortunate to have worked with the Brazilian MOH as a consultant during that period and observed firsthand the dedication and determination of the MOH to addressing a serious problem with polio in the country. In 1980, there were 1342 confirmed cases of polio in Brazil; by 1989, there were 25, and by 1990 there were 0 (see http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencepolio.html for the global polio trends). Brazil demonstrated that the use of the national vaccination campaigns could markedly reduce circulation of the WPV, and the use of local campaigns for "mop up" activities could eliminate inadequately vaccinated pockets leading to interruption of WPV circulation in a country.

The identification of the WPV1 in the sewage sample served as a reminder of the importance to maintain the high levels of vaccination coverages so that the herd immunity created by the high vaccination coverages would prevent local circulation of the WPV1, and prevent actual cases of paralytic polio in the country. In 2014 to date, there have been 4 confirmed cases of WPV1 in Equatorial Guinea, with the date of onset of the most recent case 3 Apr 2014, after the date of isolation of the WPV in the Brazilian environmental sampling (see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx and section [2] below).

Equatorial Guinea was formerly known as the Spanish Guinea, on the west coast of Africa. Official languages of the country include Spanish, French and Portuguese.

Data in WHO as of 18 Jun 2013 for 2013 data and 17 Jun 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- At an International Ulema Conference on Polio Eradication organized by the Islamic Development Bank, leading Islamic scholars called for the entire Muslim world to unite in eradicating polio and declared the polio vaccination as a parental and community responsibility. The scholars were convened from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Afghanistan and Nigeria.

- The Global Polio Partners Group (PPG) met on Monday [16 Jun 2014] in Geneva to review the development and implementation of short-term and long-term polio eradication strategic plans and emergency action plans. Speakers' presentations from the PPG meeting are available at: http://www.polioeradication.org/Aboutus/Governance/GlobalPolioPartnersGroup.aspx.

Afghanistan
- Two new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week from previously uninfected areas including a case from Achin district, Nangarhar province, with onset of paralysis on [15 May 2014], and a case from Dehrawud, Uruzgan province, with onset of paralysis on [20 May 2014], bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 to 6. Targeted mop-up campaigns are starting this Sunday [22 Jun 2014] in the areas where the 2 cases were found, followed by sub-national campaigns in Uruzgan as well as in targeted districts in Kandahar province and in Northern Helmand province.

- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in 2014. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3, with the most recent cVDPV2 case in March 2013 from Kandahar province, Southern Region.

- The most recent nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) were held on [4-6 May 2014] targeting 8.9 million children. The SIA could not be conducted in Helmand province, Southern Region, due to access problems related to insecurity but will be conducted as soon as access for vaccinators becomes possible. The next round of nationwide SIAs is planned for August [2014].

- According to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio Eradication in Afghanistan convened from [5-6 Jun 2014] in Islamabad, the country is in a strong position to interrupt endemic transmission of the virus in 2014, provided it addresses the remaining challenges and risks. These include ensuring the programme is a priority with the new government, reaching children in inaccessible areas, focusing on missed children, strengthening cross-border and transit vaccination, and preparing for the displacement of people from infected areas of Pakistan.

Nigeria
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case in Nigeria was reported from Yobe state with onset of paralysis on [19 Apr 2014]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 is 3.

- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [3 May 2014] from Damboa LGA, Borno state. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is 7.

- The most recent nationwide Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) took place on [12-14 Apr 2014]. Subnational IPDs in northern Nigeria took place on [24-26 May 2014] and next rounds are planned for June and August [2014].

Pakistan
- Seven new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA including 5 cases from North Waziristan and 2 cases from Khyber agency. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [4 Jun 2014] from Khyber agency. The total number of WPV1 cases reported from Pakistan for 2014 is 82.

- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [2 Apr 2014] (from North Waziristan). The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is 10.

- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus (both wild and cVDPV2) in the world. Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. Immunizations in neighboring high-risk areas are being intensified to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak. With thousands of people moving out of North Waziristan following the recent military operation against insurgents, the polio programme has been working with local government to identify displaced populations and reach them with the polio vaccine at either permanent transit points, or camps, or once they reach host communities.

- The densely populated Peshawar valley is considered to be the main engine of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, alongside North Waziristan, due to large-scale population movements through Peshawar from across this region and into other areas of Pakistan. The quality of SIA operations must be urgently improved in Peshawar and immunization activities urgently resumed in North Waziristan.

- According to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio Eradication in Pakistan, convened in Islamabad from [2-3 Jun 2014], the country is not in a position to interrupt transmission without radical change in reservoir areas including Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA, Peshawar, and Karachi. To put the program back on the path to polio eradication, the TAG recommended full political commitment and ownership, mobilization of national assets to facilitate access of vaccination teams, restoration of vaccination in FATA and addressing insecurity and chronic gaps in reservoirs and high risk areas. The TAG also recommended that all provinces integrate communications and social mobilization activities in their planning and operations.

Central Africa
- No WPV1 cases were reported in the past week from Central Africa. The most recent WPV1 case in the region was reported from Ebebiyin district, Kie Ntem province, Equatorial Guinea, with onset of paralysis on [3 Apr 2014].

- The total number of WPV1 cases in Equatorial Guinea in 2014 is 4. The cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak in neighboring Cameroon, which has reported 4 cases in 2013 and 3 cases in 2014. The most recent NIDs in Equatorial Guinea took place on [28 May 2014], and the next rounds of activities are planned for mid-July and August [2014]. During the May 2014 campaigns, approximately 95 percent of children were reported to have been reached, though coverage has varied by area.

- In Cameroon, the most recent WPV1 case was reported from Djoungolo, Centre State, with onset of paralysis on [31 Jan 2014]. An analysis of outbreak response conducted so far indicates overall quality has been insufficient to interrupt poliovirus transmission. Due to subnational surveillance gaps, further undetected transmission cannot be ruled out. Given the continuation and expansion of virus transmission, additional emergency outbreak response activities are being planned and implemented. The most recent nationwide SIAs took place in late May [2014], with next rounds being planned for late June [2014].

- As part of the regional outbreak response, emergency campaigns have also been conducted in Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo and Gabon.

Horn of Africa
- No new polio cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case was reported from Jariban district in Mudug province, Somalia, with onset of paralysis on [11 May 2014]. The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa this year [2014] is 2.

- The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is 219 since the beginning of the outbreak in April 2013 (195 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 10 from Ethiopia).

- While the outbreak appears to have slowed down, the most recent polio case from Somalia indicates continued transmission of the virus. Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is, therefore, continuing, with campaigns taking place this month [June 2104] in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- WPV1-positive samples were detected by environmental surveillance in Israel from February 2013 to end-March, 2014. Since then, no WPV1-positive sample has been collected, although several samples are pending lab results.

- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October 2013.

- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national routine immunization schedule.

- Several WPV1-positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip last year [2013], with the most recent positive sample collected in the Gaza Strip during the week of [5 Jan 2014].

- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, Iraq, with onset of paralysis on [7 Apr 2014]. The total number of cases in Iraq is 2.

- The total number of WPV1 cases reported from the Middle East is 38. In Syria, 36 cases are reported (35 in 2013 and one in 2014) with the most recent date of onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2014].

- WHO and UNICEF are committed to work with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.

- In the Middle East, the 2nd phase of the comprehensive outbreak response is being implemented across the region. The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation.

West Africa
- In West Africa, no WPV cases have been reported since November 2012. The single most recent case of cVDPV2 was confirmed in July 2013. However, to minimize the risk of re-infection and further spread of poliovirus, multi-country, synchronized immunization campaigns continue to be implemented across the region with activities planned for Guinea and Niger in July [2014], and across the region in September [2014].

[Since the last ProMED-mail update on poliomyelitis on 6 May 2014 (for which this moderator apologizes for the large interval since the last update), there have been a total of 35 newly confirmed cases of WPV paralytic polio reported of, which 32 were reported from endemic countries (Pakistan - 28, Nigeria -1 and Afghanistan - 3), and 3 were reported from non-endemic countries (Equatorial Guinea - 1, Iraq - 1, and Somalia - 1). The date of most recent onset of reported cases was 4 Jun 2014 for the case in Pakistan, 19 Apr 2014 in Nigeria, 20 Mar 2014 in Afghanistan for the endemic countries, and 3 Apr 2014 in Equatorial Guinea, 7 Apr 2014 in Iraq and 11 Mar 2014 in Somalia for the non-endemic countries. Given the delayed reporting and confirmation of cases, it is too early to say with confidence that transmission has been interrupted in the countries that have reported WPV associated polio this year [2014], even though dates of onset of most recent cases were 5 months ago (Cameroon, Syria, Ethiopia).

The continued difficulties with civil unrest in many of these countries remains a significant challenge for the polio eradication effort, and for the world, as the continued threat of importation of WPV into countries with suboptimal vaccination coverages and significant pockets of susceptibles leaves an opening for re-introduction of WPV circulation in countries that had been able to interrupt WPV circulation in the past.
