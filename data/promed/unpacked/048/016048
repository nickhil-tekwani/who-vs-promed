Nigeria Records 1st Vaccine-Derived Polio Case Since 2014
-----------------------------------------------------------
Despite recording the 1st case of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) in Maiduguri district of Borno province, Nigeria is on course towards being certified polio- free by the World Health Organisation (WHO) after July 2017.

And in response to this outbreak, Nigeria is planning to conduct the 1st ever campaign using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 even as the Director General of the WHO has authorized the vaccine release from the global stockpile. Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) are planned in the north of the country from [14-17 May 2016] using bOPV.

Nigeria alongside 154 other countries have completed the switch from trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) to bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV), withdrawing the type 2 component of the vaccine to protect future generations against circulating vaccine derived polioviruses, which held from [17 Apr 2016 to 1 May 2016].

According to the latest edition of Weekly Polio Update published yesterday [11 May 2016] by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), "No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in 2016. No cases were reported in 2015. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Jul 2014] in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano State.

"One environmental sample positive for cVDPV2 was reported this week, collected in Maiduguri district of Borno province on [23 Mar 2016].

"Genetic sequencing of the isolated strain indicates it is most closely linked genetically to a cVDPV2 strain from Borno in November 2013 and last detected in May 2014, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection for almost 2 years."

[Highlights of the week, 11 May 2016]
----------------------
- From [17 Apr 2016 to 1 May 2016], 155 countries and territories participated in the historic trivalent to bivalent oral polio vaccine switch, withdrawing the type 2 component of the vaccine [OPV2] to protect future generations against circulating vaccine derived polioviruses.

- Liechtenstein has contributed 15 000 Swiss francs to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative through Rotary International. With the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's pledge to triple commitments made to polio eradication, this brings Liechtenstein's contribution for 2016 to a per-capita contribution of more than 2 Swiss francs for every inhabitant of the country.

The Trivalent to Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine Switch
---------------------------------------------------
Between [17 Apr 2016 and 1 May 2016], the type 2 component of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) is being removed from use through a globally synchronized switch from the trivalent to bivalent oral polio vaccine. This is the 1st stage of objective 2 of the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 to withdraw OPV in a phased manner starting with the type 2 component following the eradication of wild poliovirus type 2 in September 2015.

Thanks to the efforts of a wide range of stakeholders from Ministries of Health, health workers, volunteers, switch monitors, WHO, UNICEF and partners of the World Health Organization, confirmation has been received that 152 countries have completed the switch.

The following indicators are being carefully tracked to ensure the switch goes smoothly. As of [10 May 2016]:
- 154 of 155 (99%) countries and territories have stopped using the trivalent oral polio vaccine.
- Independent monitoring to ensure the switch goes smoothly has begun in 149 of 153 countries (98%).
- The National Validation Committee has received switch monitoring data from 45 of 153 countries.
- The WHO Regional Office has received the National Validation Report from 43 countries.

Afghanistan
- One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in the past week in Shahwalikot district of Kandahar, with onset of paralysis on [4 Apr 2016]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 is now 5, compared to 1 reported by this date in 2015.
- No new WPV1 environmental positive samples have been reported in 2016. The most recent environmental positive samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015] - one in Jalalabad in Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.
- National Immunization Days will be held on [17 to 20 May 2016].

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the last week. The most recent case was in Shikarpur district of Sindh province, with onset of paralysis on [12 Apr 2016]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 9, compared to 22 reported at the same date last year [2015].
- No new WPV1 environmental positive sample was reported in the past week. The most recent case was collected in Sukkur district of Sindh province on [19 Mar 2016].
- Efforts continue to further strengthen surveillance activities in all provinces of the country to ensure that no child is missed with the vaccine.

Lao People's Democratic Republic
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2016]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases in 2016 remains 3 and 8 in 2015.
- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.

Madagascar
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015] from Sud-West region. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 remains 10.
- The 3rd Outbreak Response Assessment in Madagascar found that the surveillance system is not yet strong enough to conclude that polio transmission has been interrupted. A total of 39 high-risk districts have been identified to receive focused attention.
- The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset of paralysis in September 2014, indicating prolonged and widespread circulation of the virus.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for October [2016] with dates to be confirmed using bivalent oral polio vaccine.

Myanmar
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case was isolated from a 16-month old child in Maungdaw, Rakhine, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2015 remains 2.

Nigeria
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in 2016. No cases were reported in 2015. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Jul 2014] in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano state.
- No new environmental samples of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported this week. The most recent positive sample was collected in Maidaguri district of Borno province on [23 Mar 2016].
- Genetic sequencing of that isolated strain indicates it is most closely linked genetically to a cVDPV2 strain from Borno in November 2013 and last detected in May 2014, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection for almost 2 years. A detailed field investigation is underway to strengthen active case searching for actual cases of acute flaccid paralysis and to increase the frequency of collection of environmental samples to ascertain the extent of circulation of this strain.
- Nigeria is planning to conduct the 1st ever campaign using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 in response to this outbreak. The Director General of the World Health Organization has authorized the vaccine release from the global stock pile.
- Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) are planned in the north of the country from [14 - 17 May 2016] using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV).

Ukraine
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases have been reported in 2016. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2015] in the Zakarpatskaya oblast, in south-western Ukraine, bordering Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The number of cVDPV1 cases reported in 2015 remains 2.
- A group of independent experts in Ukraine met to assess the country's response to the polio outbreak and concluded that transmission of the poliovirus has likely stopped in the country. However, they emphasized the need to continue to strengthen immunization and surveillance to protect children in Ukraine against further outbreaks.
- Ukraine had been at particular risk of emergence of a cVDPV, due to very low vaccination coverage.

West Africa
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016. The most recent case was reported from Kankan district, with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2016]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 remains seven. The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset in August 2014.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in August in Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea and Sierra Leone and in Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) in Niger in September with dates to be confirmed. In October, NIDs are planned in Benin, Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone, and SNIDs in Mauritania.

[Reported cases of polio continue to occur in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. At present it appears as though the reporting of cases may have improved in Afghanistan with more cases reported in 2016 than in 2015 (a contradictory observation, but hopefully valid). Overall, at this time last year (2015) there had been 23 cases of wild poliovirus associated disease reported whereas this year (2016) there have been only 14 cases. It appears as though Pakistan and Afghanistan are the sole remaining locations of wild poliovirus transmission in the world.

The somewhat disconcerting information is the identification of an environmental sample of cVDPV2 in Maidiguri district of Borno. The Maidiguri district is located in the Northeast of the country bordering with Chad and not far from N'Djamena. (see https://www.google.com/maps/@11.8664433,10.9088387,6z for a map of the area). Given the switchover to the bivalent oral poliovaccine (bOPV), the results of the use of a monovalent vaccine (OPV2) to interrupt transmission of the cVDPV2 are awaited, given it is a novel approach. Of note, there is mention that there will be Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) planned in the north of the country from 14-17 May using the bOPV, but there is no mention as to when the monovalent OPV2 campaign will be, and if Borno will be included in the planned SNID or will be separate.

Detailed information on the planned vaccination response in Northern Nigeria would be greatly appreciated.

A map showing the locations of poliovirus cases worldwide (including wild poliovirus and cVDPVs) can be found at http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx. Note that the cVDPV identified in Nigeria is not on this map as the specimen did not come from an individual with reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) but rather from an environmental sample. - Mod.MPP
