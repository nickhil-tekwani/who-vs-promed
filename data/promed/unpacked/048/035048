Highly pathogenic avian influenza, United Kingdom
-------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 18 Dec 2020 from Dr Christine Middlemiss, Chief Veterinary Officer, DEFRA, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London, United Kingdom

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 13 Dec 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 18 Dec 2020
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza [AI] virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Nr Hawes, Richmond, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Dec 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 20 / 17 / 17 / 3 / 0
Affected population: backyard flock

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 85 / 85 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Ongoing Epidemiological investigation. Initial presumption indicates that this HPAI H5N1 virus belongs to the 2.3.4.4 B clade. This clade has acquired gene segments from low pathogenic viruses and is not related to A(H5N1) viruses of e.g. clade 2.3.2.1c causing human infections outside of Europe. Further tests are being carried out to confirm.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; stamping out; zoning; vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: traceability; disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Weybridge (OIE reference laboratory) / Birds / gene sequencing / 18 Dec 2020 / Positive
Weybridge (OIE reference laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 17 Dec 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

The last outbreak assessment report no. 10 for the cases of HPAI in the UK and Europe, published on 21 Dec 2020 by DEFRA-APHA, mentions that "Since [15 Dec 2020] in the United Kingdom there have been 3 further outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 in poultry, including the first in Scotland, and an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in poultry. There have also been many cases of HPAI H5N8 in wild birds, and smaller numbers of cases of HPAI H5N1 (2 reports) and HPAI H5N5 (6 reports) also in wild birds. Elsewhere in Europe, HPAI H5N8 has been reported in poultry in France and Poland. HPAI H5N8 in wild birds has been reported in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, and Slovenia with HPAI H5N1 also in wild birds in Italy. HPAI H5Nx (N untyped) has been reported in poultry in the Netherlands, and in wild birds in the Netherlands and in France." The full report is available at https://tinyurl.com/ybmtxrn8.
