Diseased sugarcane in Sri Lanka is infected with
sugarcane grassy shoot and/or sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma
--------------------------------------------------------
Sugarcane (_Saccharum officinarum_ L.) is a high
potential cash crop in Sri Lanka, (0.6 percent of
land is used for sugarcane cultivation) and the
local sugar industry supplies 10 percent of the
domestic requirement. The industry is threatened
due to a devastating disease, locally known as
'white leaf disease,' that is spreading fast in
all agro-ecological zones. High variability and
strong environment-dependent expression of the
disease symptoms limit the use of conventional
techniques in the disease diagnosis.

Polymerase chain reaction [PCR], restriction
fragment length polymorphism [RFLP] and sequence
analysis confirmed the association of at least
one phytoplasma with the widespread yellowing and
tillering disease in sugarcane in Sri Lanka.
Despite the wide range of symptoms that were
observed, PCR-RFLP profiles from 40 diseased
samples provided support that all the samples
were infected with the same phytoplasma, whereas
no phytoplasma was detected from the 5 non-symptomatic samples.

The associated phytoplasma is 98 percent
identical to both sugarcane white leaf
phytoplasma [SCWL] and sugarcane grassy shoot
phytoplasma [SCGS]. Results were not sufficient
to distinguish SCWL from SCGS as the causative
organism of the disease or to rule out
possibilities of mixed infection of the 2
strains. In previous reports multiple infections
along with SCGS have been suspected.

The present study verifies association of SCGS
and/or SCWL phytoplasma with the sugarcane
disease locally known as 'white leaf disease.'
SCGS and SCWL are phylogenetically closely
related (99 percent), and are in the SCWL
phylogenetic group. These two phytoplasmas are
known to cause symptoms in infected sugarcane
that are often indistinguishable. SCGS and SCWL,
along with Ramu stunt and green grassy shoot
phytoplasmas, are the most economically harmful
sugarcane phytoplasmas reported in Asia.

This is the first report on sequence information
of sugarcane phytoplasma in Sri Lanka. The
information reported is extremely valuable for
further investigations on local vectors and the
vector reservoirs. In the absence of proper
control methods, the information is useful in the
early detection of infected material and for
quarantine purposes to prevent spread of the disease.

[Sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma (16SrXI Rice
yellow dwarf taxonomic group, type member
_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma oryzae) has been
reported from Africa, South and South-East Asia.
It causes very destructive diseases of sugarcane;
for example, crop losses are estimated to be over
USD 20 million each year to the Thai sugar
industry. Symptoms consist of chlorotic leaves
especially in the spindle portion and the
tillers. Single, white or cream stripes parallel
to the midrib are present in the early stage,
later extending to the entire length of the leaf.
In the late stages, plant vigour decreases and
stunted stalks, absence of side shoots on the
upper part of infected stalks and abnormal
tillering may occur. Symptoms may be masked at
low temperature but reappear as the temperature rises.

Sugar cane grassy shoot is an as yet unclassified
phytoplasma. It is reported from several
countries in South East Asia where it can cause
considerable crop losses. Symptoms include
stunting, excessive tillering and side shoots
from the bottom to the top of stalks giving a
grass like appearance. Leaves may be reduced in
size with a soft texture. Cream or white stripes
parallel to the vascular bundles occur and may
coalesce, resulting in total leaf chlorosis.
Symptoms are usually more severe on the ratoon
crops than on the first planted ones and are more
conspicuous during the rainy season.

SCWL is transmitted by the leafhoppers
_Matsumuratettix hiroglyphicus_ and _Yamatotettix
flavovittatus_. Unconfirmed reports suggest that
SCGS may also be transmitted by leafhoppers. Both
phytoplasmas are readily spread by infected
setts. Disease management primarily relies on the
removal of infected plants and use of clean
planting material. Both phytoplasmas may be
eliminated from contaminated setts using heat
therapy methods prior to planting. Vector control
can be attempted. Sugarcane lines resistant to
SCGS are available. SCWL-resistant lines are
being developed using host resistance found in wild _Saccharum_ species.

Besides _Saccharum_ spp., SCGS phytoplasma is
also found in millets (_Sorghum bicolor_,
_Pennisetum purpureum_). No alternative host
plants are known for the SCWL phytoplasma. In
grassy weeds showing symptoms of white leaf
disease, molecular methods failed to detect any
organisms identical to those infecting sugarcane.
SCDS and SCWL phytoplasmas are more closely
related to each other than to phytoplasmas
causing white leaf symptoms in some grasses. For
general information on phytoplasmas please see links below.
