Rinderpest outbreak in Amur Region of the Russian Federation
The Main Veterinary department of the Russian Federation has reported to
OIE the detection on 18th August 1998 of an outbreak of rinderpest in
Shimanovsk District (127 deg. E, 55 deg. N approx.) of Amur Region which is
close to the border with China. The disease was reported in a single
village (Simanovo) with an estimated date of first infection of 5th August.
This event is of great concern to the Global Rinderpest Eradication
Programme (GREP) for which FAO provides technical co-ordination through its
Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) programme for transboundary animal
pests and diseases.
The last outbreaks of rinderpest reported in the Russian Federation
occurred in the Tuva Autonomous Region (97 deg. E, 50 deg. N approx.) on
the border with Mongolia in the period December 1991 to January 1992, after
some 24 years of apparent freedom from the disease. Genetic
characterisation (at the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright Laboratory,
UK) of virus isolated from the Tuva outbreak showed the presence of both a
vaccine strain (almost certainly isolated from recently vaccinated cattle)
and a rinderpest virus strain that appeared closely related to one isolated
in Afghanistan in 1962. The 1991-2 outbreaks were over 3,500 km from the
nearest known endemic foci of the disease in Pakistan and the source of
infection remains a mystery.
Recent investigations have provided no evidence for the presence of
rinderpest in the central Asian states, Mongolia and China. Evidence for
rinderpest absence in most of Asia is still being gathered but confidence
has been growing that rinderpest outside Africa is present now only in
Pakistan/Afghanistan and the Arabian Peninsula with an area of uncertainty
in the "Kurdish triangle" of Turkey/Iraq/Iran. However, the present
outbreak of rinderpest in Amur Region raises a suspicion that there could
exist a hidden focus of rinderpest somewhere in Asiatic Russia, Mongolia or
China, despite our belief that Mongolia has been free since at least 1993
and China since 1955. Although Amur Region is some 1,500 km from the
1991/92 disease outbreak, it is still far closer to it than the nearest
known focus of rinderpest in Pakistan.
Therefore, the possibility of the two events (1991/92 and 1998) being
related and sharing a common source (i.e. re-appearance of rinderpest from
an undescribed hidden focus) cannot be ruled out on the information
available so far. It is gratifying that the Russian Federation authorities
have assigned experts to investigate and eliminate the outbreak.
EMPRES, in collaboration with the FAO World Reference Laboratory for
Rinderpest (Pirbright Laboratory, UK), maintains intense epidemiological
surveillance on the evolving global situation of rinderpest in support of
GREP and is working with the OIE, Russian colleagues and countries in the
region to clarify the origin of the outbreak.
