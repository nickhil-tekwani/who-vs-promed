Yellow fever, United States of America
-------------------------------
A 48-year-old unvaccinated man travelling in Bolivar state (Venezuela)
became ill on 23 September and returned to California on 25 September. He
was hospitalized on 27 September with fulminant hepatitis and renal
failure, and died on 4 October. Yellow fever was confirmed by
immunohistochemistry and PCR.
The Venezuelan authorities were informed and a field investigation is under
way. This event serves once more to illustrate the vital importance for
travellers to have yellow fever vaccination before visiting endemic areas.
