Wildlife officers started asking hunters for samples of deer or elk
brain from the animals killed during the October 1999 hunts. The
samples will tell if Utah has its first registered case of chronic
wasting disease (CWD). There has never been a recorded case
of CWD in Utah.
Testing is because herds of deer and elk on the Wyoming/
Colorado border have the disease. The disease has been
detected in private elk herds around the country, and 3 years ago
Utah opened its door to private elk ranching. CWD attacks deer,
and some elk, but at this point, has not been linked to humans.
CWD is in the family of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies, which are transmitted diseases including
scrapie, which is found in sheep; bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, which devastated the
British cattle markets; and a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (vCJD), which is the human version of mad cow disease.
There are no tests capable of detecting the disease in live animals.
The disease is currently determined from histological (microscopic)
examination of the brain tissue, after the animal has died or been
killed.
The death of a hunter in March 1999 from what is believed to have
been CJD has officials from the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with
state agencies, looking more closely at tests from this year's hunt.
Officials are trying to establish some link between the disease, the
hunter and a similar case recently diagnosed in Nebraska. The
longtime hunter frequently consumed wild game, but never hunted in
the Wyoming/Colorado area. Officials hope to take at least half of
the target samples from areas where McEwen hunted.
CWD was first identified in the 1960s as a disease syndrome of
captive deer. It was detected in herds on the Wyoming/Colorado
border in 1981, "but it could have been in the herds before that,"
said Mike Miller, wildlife veterinarian for the Colorado Division of
Wildlife.
Recently, CWD has been diagnosed in privately-owned elk on
game farms in Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Canada.
Since Utah approved private elk ranching and legislative action
earlier this year approved hunting on privately owned elk farms,
some wildlife officials are concerned over possible transmission
into the wild elk population.
Mike Marshall, state veterinarian for the Department of Agriculture,
said there are checks in place to prevent CWD from entering Utah.
Elk ranchers are required to report sick animals or those that die of
mysterious causes. "We will not permit transportation of animals
into Utah from sites under quarantine for diseases."
It is uncertain how CWD is transmitted between animals. Possibly,
infected deer and elk transmit the disease through animal-to-animal
contact and/or contamination of feed or water sources with saliva,
urine and/or feces.
Marshall said, "We don't know the animals have the disease until it
begins to show clinical signs, like twitching, staggering, circling, not
eating or rubbing off hair." Other symptoms include excessive
salivation, increased thirst and urination, stumbling, trembling and
depression, always followed by death.
Hunters should be wary of animals acting strangely, realizing, there
are other diseases that can cause these symptoms. It is
recommended certain parts of a deer or elk, such as the brain,
eyes and spinal cord not be eaten.
