On Thursday [17 Mar 2022], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice for Afghanistan due to an ongoing measles outbreak. Federal health officials report cases have been reported in all provinces, with the highest rates occurring in Paktya, Balkh, Kunduz, Zabul, Kandahar, and Logar. The latest numbers according to local media are 18 000 children infected, including 142 deaths since the beginning of the year.

CDC says all travelers to Afghanistan, including infants and preschool children, should be fully vaccinated against measles according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) immunization schedules.

Travelers should seek medical care if they develop a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, or red, watery eyes. Measles is highly contagious. Travelers with suspected measles should notify the healthcare facility before visiting so staff can implement precautions to prevent spread within the facility.

[2] Crisis

Afghanistan hopes to vaccinate 1.2 million children against measles in a week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday [14 Mar 2022], amid an outbreak of this endemic disease in the country. Asian country that has left almost 150 deaths and more than 18 000 cases so far this year [2022].

"This measles immunization campaign is part of the national response to stop the spread of the outbreak, save the lives of young children and reduce the burden on health systems," WHO representative in Afghanistan Luo Dapeng said in a statement. The health authorities of the interim government of the Taliban, with the support of the UN agency, hope to cover 49 districts in 24 Afghan provinces, in a campaign that began last Saturday [12 Mar 2022] and will end this Thursday [17 Mar 2022]. WHO warned of an alarming increase in measles cases in Afghanistan, an outbreak that began in early 2021 due to the "accumulation of a high number of children under the age of 5 who are not immunized.

Between January 2021 and last Sunday [13 Mar 2022], the country has registered 48 366 cases and 250 deaths, while 142 children have died so far this year. The rising number of measles cases is "particularly worrying" when added to the "extremely high levels of malnutrition" in Afghanistan, WHO said.

Measles is particularly dangerous among children suffering from malnutrition, who after contracting measles without having been vaccinated can present symptoms such as blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, dehydration, and respiratory diseases such as pneumonia.

Afghanistan is facing a humanitarian and economic crisis aggravated by the Taliban's seizure of power in August 2021, the consequent international isolation, as well as the freezing of Afghan funds abroad, and the cutting of direct aid.

[The situation in Afghanistan is further exacerbated by COVID-19, which has interfered with the vaccination campaign. There needs to be 95% vaccine coverage with 2 doses of vaccine to reach herd immunity, yet the immunization rate in Afghanistan is 66%. Measles can be eliminated if children are vaccinated. - Mod.LK
