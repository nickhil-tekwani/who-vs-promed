Anthrax scare has hit Similipal Sanctuary [Odisha] after an elephant, which had died a few days back, was found to be carrying the dreaded bacteria. The viscera test conducted by Animal Diseases Research Institute (ADRI), Cuttack confirmed the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_, the anthrax organism, in the jumbo prompting the Veterinary and Wildlife wings to go in for an elaborate vaccination drive in the foothills of Similipal.

The elephant had died in Subarnamanjuri forest under Dukuri Forest Range of Baripada Forest Division last week [week of 8 Dec 2014]. Once the forest officials spotted the carcass and post-mortem was conducted, the decision to carry out an anthrax test was taken on the basis of physical appearance of the dead pachyderm. "We carried out slide tests for 2 strains, one of which reported positive for anthrax. The report has been sent to Eastern Region Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory, Kolkata for further tests," Director of ADRI Dr Loknath Behera told this paper.

The presence of anthrax organism in the elephant has put wildlife officials as well as the veterinary wing of the State Government on their toes. Although animal-to-animal transmission is not possible, the anthrax bacteria can be contracted if an affected animal's meat is consumed either by human beings or animals, both domestic and wild. Herbivores can also come in contact with the spores while grazing.

Field Director of Similipal Tiger Reserve HS Bisht said necessary preventive measures are being taken and all forest divisions have been alerted.

While the Directorate of Veterinary Services has launched an awareness campaign, a vaccination drive has been started simultaneously in villages surrounding the wildlife sanctuary in collaboration with the Wildlife Wing in a bid to prevent an outbreak. Behera said villages located in a radius of 5 km [3 mi] from Similipal are being covered under the vaccination drive.

The Forest Department, on its part, has been vigilant. DFO [Divisional Forest Officer] of Baripada Sanjay Kumar Swain said a 5 km [3 mi] radius in the foothills will be sanitised in the entire Mayurbhanj district. Till [Tue 16 Dec 2014], at least 1600 livestock have been vaccinated. "Since wildlife are also vulnerable to the disease, we are not leaving anything to chance," he added. Villagers in the periphery have been cautioned against venturing into the forest with their livestock.

Similipal, also a designated national park, is a biodiversity hotspot. It is home to Royal Bengal tigers, leopards, elephants, sambhars, chitals, a wide variety of plant resources and over 300 bird species.

[Similipal Sanctuary is in northern Odisha and a national park and a tiger reserve situated in the Mayurbhanj district, in the Indian state of Odisha. It is part of the Similipal-Kuldiha-Hadgarh Elephant Reserve popularly known as Mayurbhanj Elephant Reserve, which includes 3 protected areas, that is, Similipal Tiger Reserve (2750 sq km/1062 sq mi), Hadgarh Wildlife sanctuary (191.06 sq km/73.77 sq mi), and Kuldiha wildlife sanctuary (272.75 sq km/105.31 sq mi). Similipal National Park derives its name from the abundance of Semul or red silk cotton trees that bloom abundantly in the locality.

The park has a protected area of 845.70 sq km (326.53 sq mi) and has some beautiful waterfalls like Joranda and Barehipani. Similipal is home to 99 Royal Bengal Tigers, and 432 wild elephants. Similipal is also famous for gaurs (Indian Bisons), chausingha (4-horned antelope), as well as an orchidarium (orchid garden). (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simlipal_National_Park. This includes a map.)

I do hope that the postmortem was terminated as soon as their stained blood smear came up positive. The ground contamination would have been extensive otherwise. Handling elephant carcasses with anthrax is always a severe problem. Usually the advice is to stack it with thorn scrub to keep off scavengers until the carcass has had a chance to decompose and allow the acid-shift to kill the vegetative cells.

Vaccinating the livestock in the neighbouring villages is ideal as the villages will graze their stock in the park. Plus this dead elephant is almost certainly a red flag for other wildlife deaths from anthrax. The Directorate of Veterinary Services is to be congratulated for his wise decision.

We have had 8 postings for anthrax in Odisha already this year (2014). - Mod.MHJ
