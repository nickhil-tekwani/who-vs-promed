There has been an outbreak of legionellosis in the Diez penal institution
in Germany, and officials consider this to be a rare event. After a
detailed investigation of two
showering units within the facility, experts of an institute for hygiene
from Marburg
detected large numbers of _Legionella_ bacteria. The shower facilities
involved had been installed only 3 months earlier.
Four prisoners of the JVA Diez had reported ill with various disease
symptoms, but in the course of the investigations all four patients were
found to have atypical pneumonias. Physicians began to suspect
legionellosis quite early in the investigation. Two of the patients have
been treated and returned to the penal institution, while the other two
remain in local hospitals.
In the meantime all showers in JVA Diez have been closed, since the
investigations of
the two showering facilities used by the patients indicated "extremely high
_Legionella_ numbers", according to the deputy institute director Rainer
Dittmann. The remaining showering facilities were examined in the
meantime, but the results are not expected until Friday (24 Sep 1999).
