At least 40 persons took ill after having dinner at a function in Peddapur of Metpally mandal late on Friday night, 5 Feb 2021. A resident threw a small party to celebrate construction of his house. The guests were served mutton curry and makka gudalu (deep fried maize/corn kernels seasoned with garlic, coriander seeds, and spices). At least 40 of the 60 villagers who participated in the function developed symptoms of food poisoning, like diarrhea and vomiting later in the night.

They were admitted to various hospitals on Sat 6 Feb 2021. While 25 persons were admitted in different hospitals in Metpally and Korutla, 15 were given treatment in their houses by medical staff. According to villagers and medical staff, makka gudalu was the main reason for food poisoning. M soaked the maize on Wednesday night, 3 Feb 2021, since he had decided to hold the function the following day, but later postponed it to Fri 5 Feb 2021. He served the same maize to the people after boiling it.
