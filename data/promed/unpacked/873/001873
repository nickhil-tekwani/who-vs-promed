Balochistan reported a new case of polio on Wednesday [30 Dec 2020], taking the total number of cases in the province to 26 amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Citing Pakistan's health officials, SAMAA TV reported that the victim was a 14 month old girl, originally from Union Council Karez Noth in Mastung, and her samples were sent to Islamabad for testing on 5 Dec [2020]. The girl had not received the polio vaccine, as her family refused polio drops during campaigns.

Balochistan has the highest number of polio cases in Pakistan. There are 22 polio cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, and 14 in Punjab. However, Islamabad, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), and occupied Gilgit-Baltistan have not reported any cases so far. This year [2020], a total of 84 cases of the wild poliovirus have been recorded in Pakistan. There are also 83 cases of vaccine-derived polio, also known as cVDPV2 polio, SAMAA TV reported. [See section [2] below for update.]

The case comes at a time when the country is reeling under the 2nd wave of coronavirus.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in the world where [wild poliovirus-associated] polio cases are being reported. Pakistan remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed by the World Health Organization due to which, since 2014, every person travelling abroad has to carry a polio vaccination certificate.

[This case has not been entered on the Stop Polio Pakistan website as yet (https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces, but based on previous experience with these types of reports, one expects this to be a confirmed case over the coming days, especially given information on vaccination history (or lack thereof) and age and geographic location of the case. Confirmation from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

Mastung district is just south of Quetta, not far from the border with Afghanistan: https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf. - Mod.MPP]

[The weekly global reports are disheartening. Two new countries have joined the cVDPV2 (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2) group of countries: Sierra Leone, reporting 3 AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases related to infection with cVDPV2, and Liberia, having a positive environmental sample for cVDPV2. Positive environmental samples are a signal of transmission of the virus in the area.

The absence of WPV1- (wild poliovirus type 1) associated AFP cases but presence of positive environmental samples means the WPV1 is circulating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Unfortunately, 2020 has been a banner year for poliovirus transmission, both WPV1 and cVDPVs. So far, 139 cases of WPV1 (compared with 137 reported in the same timeframe in 2019) and 910 cVDPV cases (compared with 253 cases in the same period in 2019) have been reported. The risk of vaccine-related polio seems greater than the risk of the WPV1 now.
