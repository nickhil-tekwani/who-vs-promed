Kampala: anthrax suspected in Kidepo Valley National Park in Northeastern
Uganda
-----------------------------------------------
Dr Arthur Mugisha, who heads the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said
yesterday [Tue 7 Dec 2004] that park officials reported last week that an
unknown disease was killing buffalo. He said anthrax was a possible cause
of the deaths, but that a thorough diagnosis would be done. Sources within
Makerere University said that 2 buffalo carcasses were found at a wallowing
ground in Kidepo.
Mugisha said that an anthrax outbreak that hit Queen Elizabeth National
Park 4 months ago had killed more than 220 hippos but that the situation
was contained. Sources at Makerere University, however, who visited Kasenyi
fishing village in the park, said that anthrax recently hit buffalo more
than hippos. "A team is investigating the reports," Mugisha said, adding
that continuous monitoring of the protected areas would be undertaken to
check anthrax.
Sources within UWA said the team was limited by a lack funds and that
samples were not being collected to verify the cause of death. "We have
about 2 buffalo dying every week," Bosco Nuwe, the chief warden of Queen
Elizabeth National Park, said yesterday [Tue 7 Dec 2004].

[One can hope that the UWA team investigating the KVNP situation comes up
with a confirmed diagnosis quicker than what happened earlier this year in
the QENP. Their financial situation sounds uncertain, and the northern
parts of the country are afflicted with fighting and armies of brigands,
not the easiest of situations, even on a good day. - Mod.MHJ]
