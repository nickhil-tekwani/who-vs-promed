[The European Union's Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal
Health (SCFCAH), Animal Health and Animal Welfare section, held its
last monthly meeting in Brussels on Tue 5 Feb and Wed 6 Feb 2008.
During the meeting, 14 presentations of member countries were
discussed. One of the presentations dealt with the recent FMD
(foot-and-mouth disease) event in Cyprus; it was titled "Final Report
of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Commission for Foot and
Mouth Disease; Lefkosia, 31 Jan 2008." From the document (55 pages),
which can be downloaded from the URL above, we hereby present
articles 8.7, 8.8, and 9, which address Cyprus' explanations of the
etiology of the "outbreak." - Mod.AS]

8.7. Overall evaluation of tests
--------------------------------
During the FMD crisis in Cyprus, 770 farms were tested (see table 22
and fig. 22 at the URL above). All the procedures followed were in
full compliance with the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of OIE [World
Organisation for Animal Health], the Directive 2003/85/EC and the
Decision 2007/718/EC.

The selection of the farms located outside the zones was done randomly.

In addition, within a 3 km (2 mi) distance from the dividing line, 95
sheep and goat holdings and 2 piggeries were tested (see fig 23).
These farms did not show any evidence of FMD.

8.8. Lifting of restriction measures
------------------------------------
The measures from the PZ (Protection zones) were lifted on 10 Dec
2007 and from the SZ (Surveillance zones) on 24 Dec 2007.

The Decision 2007/718/EC (concerning protection measures for FMD in
Cyprus), which has been amended 3 times, applies until 31 Jan 2008.
The 1st amendment, Decision 2007/832/EC, which was published on 13
Dec 2007, allowed the export of pork meat and meat products from
Cyprus, except from the zones. The 2nd amendment, Decision
2008/65/EC, published on 17 Jan 2008, allowed the export of bovine
meat and meat products from Cyprus, except from the zones.

Finally, the 3rd amendment, Decision 2008/71/EC (published on 22 Jan
2008) allowed the export of meat and meat products from all species
out of Cyprus.

9. Cause of seropositivity (pages 53-5)
---------------------------------------
The cause of seropositivity could not be elucidated because the virus
was never isolated or detected by RT-PCR, (reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction) despite the large number of samples
collected, dispatched, and tested by the CRL (Central Research
Laboratory). Therefore, linkage with any other FMD viruses in
neighbouring or other countries is not possible. [The total number of
samples tested was, according to the data included in table 24, 1336,
of which 553 by virus neutralisation test (VNT) and 783 by 3
different ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test methods. Of
the 553 VNT tests, 70 were found positive, 50 "inconclusive," and 433
negative. - Mod.AS]

The seropositive animals found were pure bred and cross bred of the
Awassi, the Chios, the fat tailed sheep, the Damascus Shami goat, and
the local goat breed. Most of these breeds are fairly common in the
countries of the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East (including
the occupied areas) [Cyprus' definition of the Turkish-administered territory].

All the seropositive animals confirmed by VNT came only from farms
located in the zones, a point indicating that the problem was limited
there. Furthermore, these animals were more than 3 years old and
during the last 3 years were, according to the IRSC [Identification
and Registration Scheme] Database, not moved from another farm.

The disease was not reported clinically, with the exception of the
suspected clinical findings consistent with FMD infection in Farm PZ
3. From the clinical inspections undertaken by the personnel of the
VS [Veterinary Services] and conducted all over Cyprus, [there were
no reports of] any clinical sign suspected of FMD. In addition,
according to the farmers, our own data, and the private practitioners
neither the mortality -- particularly in young animals -- was
increased nor the production of the animals was decreased.

The positive serological findings could be attributed to the following reasons:

1. Past infection, only limited to a small number of animals in a few
flocks of Dromolaxia area, which happened at least 3 years ago. If
this might have happened the symptomatology of the disease should
have been very mild and only limited in sheep and goats. This is the
most probable scenario according to the Experts meeting held in
Brussels on 19 Nov 2007 [see commentary].

Cattle and pigs were not affected as the strain might have had
predilection for sheep and goats. Similar cases happened in other
countries as the 1996 Bulgarian type O outbreak strain was not
reported to cause disease in pigs, although pigs were known to have
had contact with infected animals/food. Furthermore, the 1997 Taiwan
type O outbreak strain grew poorly in non-pig tissue culture, and
experimentally was difficult to transmit to cattle.

The entry point of the virus could have been through:
- Movement of humans. In Dromolaxia area, just near the national
airport, there is a very prominent Muslim mosque Hala Sultan Tekke or
the Mosque of Umm Haram. The mosque was described by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Cyprus as Islam's 3rd holiest
site, after the Kaaba in Mecca and the Mosque of the Prophet in
Medina, consequently is visited by many people from all over the
world. Among the visitors are people from Turkey, the Middle East,
India, and Pakistan, countries where FMD is endemic. So another
likely explanation is the mechanical transmission of the virus by
visitors (both Turkish and Greek Cypriots), as the mosque is a very
popular visiting site.
- The airport, which is about 3 km (2 mi) away from the declared outbreaks.

2. Illegal movements from the occupied areas of animals infected in
the past, most probably outside Cyprus. There are no official reports
concerning the situation in these areas regarding FMD status. In
order to prevent illegal movements from the occupied areas, which
were reported in the past, the VS established since late 2002 the
individual identification of sheep and goats. The identification of
the adult population was completed at the beginning of 2004.
Therefore, any possible illegal movement before that time cannot be
traced and excluded.

[This unusual event, currently reaching its final stages, leaves some
unanswered questions. Most of them have been raised in the
commentaries accompanying previous postings on the issue since its
start at the end of October 2007. In particular, it was suggested
that the initial positive results of the NSP [non-structural protein]
ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] tests, performed in sheep
could have been the result of past application of (partly or poorly
purified) inactivated FMD vaccines. It seemed plausible that this was
not "introduced virus" but rather "introduced (or locally produced)
antibodies," most probably by vaccination of (imported or local)
sheep (see also commentary in ProMED-mail 20071114.3698, dated 14 Nov
2007). This view was further substantiated by the fact that no
seropositive cattle or pigs were found in the Protection and the
Surveillance Zones.

The described suspected clinical cases in sheep were not indicative
of FMD; in fact, the index case (23 Oct 2007) showed "lesions on the
lips and on the skin around the lips, redness on the tongue, and
lameness at the right front leg and difficulty to walk" -- clinical
signs more reminiscent of bluetongue than FMD. Indeed the 1st
inspection on-site -- 24 Oct 2007 -- mentioned, "mild clinical signs
suspected of bluetongue or contagious ecthyma"; there is no reason to
question the validity of these observations.

The authors of the final report share the view that seropositivity
(and not clinical observations) was the main issue. They indicate
that "past infection, only limited to a small number of animals in a
few flocks of Dromolaxia area, which happened at least 3 years ago,"
is the "most probable scenario according to the Experts meeting held
in Brussels on 19 Nov 2007." They recognised the difficulty raised by
the absence of clinical signs or antibodies in cattle and pigs,
cohabiting the premises of seropositive sheep. To address this
enigma, they raise the hypothesis that cattle and pigs were not
affected as the strain might have had predilection for sheep and
goats, and add that similar cases happened in other countries as the
1996 Bulgarian type O and the 1997 Taiwan type O.

While it is well known that certain FMDV strains from cattle or sheep
will indeed demonstrate selective pathogenicity vis-a-vis pigs and
vice versa, this moderator will appreciate data on recorded cases of
susceptible, unvaccinated cattle remaining uninfected when exposed to
FMD-infected small ruminants, in particular relating to FMDV serotype O.

Another issue deserving clarification is the bluetongue suspicion
and, subsequently, exclusion. Data on the type of tests, carried out
on the index case as well as on other suspected cases, will be helpful.

The notification of the suspected outbreak to the OIE was incomplete.
No immediate notification is available on the OIE website; in fact,
only one relevant report is there, namely follow-up report No 1,
dated 13 Nov 2007 (see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6470>.)

The event described led to culling of a considerable number of
animals, severe EU restrictions on export from Cyprus, and economic
constraints; the restrictions on export of live animals are still
maintained. Concluding, such decisions and measures in future deserve
to be based upon more solid scientific evidence. - Mod.AS]
