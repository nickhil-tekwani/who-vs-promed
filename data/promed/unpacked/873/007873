Officials say that 2 horses in the Penn Valley area of Nevada County [California] have tested positive for the highly contagious equine coronavirus. The virus is not contagious to people, but it is easily transmitted to other horses through equine fecal matter and saliva, said Daniel Chatigny, interim agricultural commissioner for Nevada County.

"If the horse is eating fecal matter of another horse (who has the virus), it can be transmitted that way," Chatigny said. If a horse licks a person's hand, and that person touches another horse, it can get transmitted that way, Chatigny added.

Clinical signs include lethargy, dehydration, loss of appetite, and frequently lying down. Chatigny said that no other horses in Nevada County have tested positive for the virus and the mortality rate is low, but he urges anyone with concerns to contact their local equine veterinarian.

Chatigny says horse owners should take the following protection measures:
- wash hands regularly and avoid contact with a contagious horse;
- change clothes and shoes before and after entering the barn;
- clean hoof picks, feed buckets, and farm tools daily with bleach;
- place stall waste and horse manure in a separate area;
- limit interaction between ill horses and other horses until the virus has subsided (roughly 3 to 4 weeks).

Equine enteric coronavirus should be on your differential list for a horse whenever you see a fever (usually less than or equal to 104 deg F/40 deg C) accompanied by anorexia and lethargy. It is transmitted by the fecal oral route, and signs usually tend to resolve in 1-4 days, although animals can continue shedding for several weeks.

Equine enteric coronavirus
--------------------------
Overview: coronaviruses comprise a large group of RNA viruses that can cause both respiratory and enteric signs of disease in various species. They are further grouped based on genetic and serologic differences into alpha, beta and gamma coronaviruses. The equine coronavirus, a beta coronavirus, has been recently isolated from a number of outbreaks across the country. This is an enteric disease of the equine. At this time, there has been no association with a respiratory component, although in cattle enteric and respiratory disease is common.

Transmission: fecal-oral route

Survival in environment: unknown

Age distribution: most often diagnosed in adults, usually older than 2 years of age

Seasonality: seen during the cold weather months (in the northeast areas), December through May

Common clinical signs/blood test changes: anorexia; lethargy; fever (usually 104 deg F/40 deg C or under); changes in fecal character; diarrhea not routinely seen; mild colic-like signs (laying down; looking at sides); neurologic abnormalities (ataxia, depression, recumbency) secondary to hyperammonemia; leukopenia (neutropenia, lymphopenia); hypoalbuminemia

Morbidity ranges from about 20-57 per cent (Pusterla et al, 2013), and mortality is typically rare, but secondary complications including dehydration, diminished perfusion, and gastrointestinal translocation, can occur (Pusterla et al, 2013). Hyperammonemia and associated neurological signs may be cause for mortality.

Duration: Signs generally resolve in 1-4 days with supportive care, and outbreaks typically last for about 3 weeks (Pusterla et al, 2013).

AHDC [Animal Health Diagnostic Center] sample submission/requirements: the sample is fresh feces submitted in an unbreakable leak-proof container to the laboratory by overnight courier on ice packs. Samples must be kept chilled to prevent overgrowth of bacteria that may cause inhibition in the PCR testing. Feces are tested by: Equine Enteric Corona PCR. Lag time: 3-days. For any questions, contact the lab and speak to the VSS [Veterinary Support Services], Drs Mittel, Goodrich, and Thompson at 607.253.3900.

Biosecurity/control measures:
- if beta coronavirus is on your differential list, encourage the barn to practice appropriate biosecurity measures to control the spread of the virus;
- see the AAEP (American Association of Equine Practitioners) guidelines: http://www.aaep.org/custdocs/BiosecurityGuidelinesFinal030113.pdf for biosecurity guidelines;
- horses can continue shedding the virus in their feces for a few weeks (anecdotal reports have shown up to 21 days) from the onset of clinical signs. The virus is shed in the manure. Encourage the farm to take precautions by using footbaths, individual thermometers, and disposable gloves between horses. Attempt to isolate affected animals and handle them last and use separate manure handling equipment from the rest of the barn. Minimize traffic into/out of barn.
