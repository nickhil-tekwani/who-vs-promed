[in Spanish, translated & summarized by Mod.JW

According to health authorities, as of 5 Dec 2000, 588 cases of
salmonellosis [compared with 400 reported as of 2 Dec 2000 -- see ref.
above had been reported linked to consumption of sandwiches at a
Montevideo cafe. The probable source is thought to be egg white that was
added to the butter used in the sandwiches to make it more spreadable.
_Salmonella_ [type not stated was found by the Food Regulation Service in
fecal cultures from many of the cases, and from 39 samples of leftovers
from food consumed by the patients and from the restaurant, which remains
closed.
Ernesto Santomauro, director of Sanitary Programs of the Ministry of
Livestock, Agriculture & Fisheries, reportedly said on Radio Universal on 5
Dec 2000 that the butter was also contaminated with _E. coli_.
The director of the Division of Health & Social Programs of the
Municipality of Montevideo, Miguel Fernandez Galeano, discounted the
possibility that an infected food service employee could have been the
source of the contamination, reportedly saying that a carrier could not
have produced such a large outbreak.

[Now we have more information, and a bit more confusion. The mention of
contamination of butter with _E. coli_ could simply be a reflection of
contamination with coliform bacilli, or could be referring to the potential
for mixed infections with _Salmonella_ and enteropathogenic _E. coli_.
Perhaps more definitive information will be forthcoming. I agree that the
outbreak is too large to suggest contamination of food by a single food
service employee unless the contamination were followed by a significant
period of inadequate refrigeration. - Mod.ES
[Reports of food poisoning due to butter are not common, and most of these
have been due to _S. aureus_. Nevertheless, _Salmonella_ species are able
to grow in butter at room temperature. The interested reader is directed to
