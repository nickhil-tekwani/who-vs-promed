[1] Maine [Scarborough]: Abbott Labs outbreak

The Scarborough location of a company that manufactures tests that quickly identify whether someone has the coronavirus is now the site of a virus outbreak, according to Maine's public health agency. Abbott Laboratories in Scarborough has seen 23 coronavirus cases among 679 employees since mid-April [2020], with 5 detected since 31 May [2020], Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Nirav Shah said Tuesday [9 Jun 2020].

The 5 most recent cases prompted the state to open an outbreak investigation, Shah said. Disease investigators will look into whether the virus has spread at the Abbott location, or whether employees have potentially brought the virus in from outside. While the company has seen
cases since mid-April [2020], there had not been enough concurrent cases until recently to warrant an outbreak investigation.

Abbott spokesperson Scott Stoffel said in an email that nearly every employee who tested positive was asymptomatic when tested. Those individuals self-quarantined upon testing positive, he said.

Stoffel said there is no evidence that the employees got sick from their workplace.

But tracking workplace outbreaks can be challenging because there are many potential sources of infection in a single day, Shah said, such as when workers get in an elevator with others or pop into a colleague's cubicle. He said the state is focusing on the shifts people work in order to get a sense of when sick individuals might have overlapped.

The company attracted national attention earlier this spring for developing a coronavirus test that could produce results in minutes. Experts have questioned the accuracy of the tests, but the company has chalked those discrepancies up to problems with transporting test samples. Maine has said it double-checks results from some negative tests conducted with Abbott materials. Shah has said the state has confidence in positive results the Abbott test produces.

The state had touted the test's usefulness in conserving protective gear for hospitals and places where employees were more likely to come in contact with a sick person. In April [2020], Maine received 15 testing machines it ordered but only a fraction of the materials needed to run the tests that it had ordered.

The company has been testing its employees weekly since mid-April [2020] and is now testing construction workers that have been at the facility, Shah said. He said the company is following best practices recommended by the CDC, including distributing protective gear to employees and employing social-distancing practices.

He said the company has taken precautions to ensure the testing materials are not compromised but deferred to the company to explain those procedures. Abbott did not immediately have a response to questions about precautions it takes to keep testing materials from becoming compromised.

Shah praised the company for "taking this early, proactive step toward testing" all employees.

"When you go out and look for things in public health, you find them," he said.

Maine had over 40 active outbreaks last week, with nursing homes seeing some of the largest numbers of cases but workplaces outside of healthcare also reporting large case numbers.

Shah on Tuesday [9 Jun 2020] announced 4 other new outbreaks in addition to Abbott's. Two were at long-term care facilities -- 3 cases at Montello Manor in Lewiston and 5 at Serenity Residential Care in Gorham -- while another was at Support Solutions in Auburn, an organization that provides support services to adults with development disabilities and reported 4 cases. An additional outbreak of 7 cases has been reported at the Nichols Portland manufacturing plant in Portland.

[The irony that a COVID-19 test manufacturing facility should itself experience a COVID-19 outbreak among its employees probably requires little comment. Although investigation is ongoing, the number of employees testing positive compared to the surrounding Scarborough community suggests that at least some of these infections may have been acquired on site. Notably, however, almost all of the subjects were asymptomatic when tested - perhaps an indicator of the ready availability of employee testing, compared to most workplaces. - Mod.LXL]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 10 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The WHO Regional Office for the Americas will support the Ministry of Health and the advisory team of the Venezuelan National Assembly to seek funds for COVID-19 response. "COVID-19 has been a problem for most countries, but this pandemic also provides a good opportunity to pursue health as a bridge to peace," said Dr Carissa F. Etienne, the regional director for the Americas.
- Dr Carissa F. Etienne has also noted, "In South America, our response to the pandemic will be impacted by the arrival of winter, while hurricane season will complicate our efforts in North and Central America, and especially in the Caribbean." The region needs to prepare to combat the effects of winter and hurricanes on COVID-19 response.
- The WHO Regional Office for Europe is coordinating a large-scale COVID-19 response operation in Tajikistan, involving emergency medical teams (EMTs) and mobile laboratories. As part of the operation, WHO will mobilize medical and laboratory specialists from Germany, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom, who will be deployed to Tajikistan during the coming weeks, upon request from the government.

Subject in Focus: WHO operations support and logistics update on supplies for COVID-19 support

Personal protective equipment supplies
- To date, WHO has shipped more than 5 million items of personal protective equipment (PPE) to 112 countries. Through the PPE purchasing consortium, WHO has secured large volumes of PPE and is currently in the process of shipping more than 149 million additional items to 138 countries, including a donation of 100 million medical masks and 1 million N95 respirators from the Jack Ma Foundation.
- With South America and the Caribbean emerging as new centres of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO is prioritizing shipping a massive volume of PPE (6000 cubic meters) to its Regional Office for the Americas for distribution to countries in the region. About 24.7 million PPE items procured by WHO are being allocated for shipment to the region, along with 26 million medical masks and over 420 000 N95 respirators donated by the Jack Ma Foundation.
- For the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 16.7 million PPE items are being prepared for shipping to countries in the region.
- In the European Region, 6.8 million PPE items are being shipped urgently to the priority countries of Ukraine and Belarus.

Diagnostics
- Through the diagnostics purchasing consortium, WHO has received commitments from suppliers for 16 million manual PCR tests. To date, WHO has placed orders for 4 million manual PCR tests and 5.3 million sample collection kits. These are currently being produced and prepared for shipment. Shipments have begun last week, with the remaining quantities to be dispatched over the coming weeks. Through the same consortium, suppliers have made available 3.8 million automated tests for UNICEF to procure. To date, UNICEF has placed orders for more than 1 million tests and delivered 216 000 tests to 34 countries. Another 226 000 tests are en route to 30 countries.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 46.3% of the global newly reported cases and 52.7 % of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 35.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Brazil reported 32.0 %, Chile 8.0%, Peru 6.5%, and Mexico 6.1%.

The European region reported 16.8% of the global newly reported cases and 23.9% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 47.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 9.8%, Turkey 5.6%, Belarus 4.6%, and Sweden 4.4%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 17.7% of the global newly reported cases and 9.2% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 28.8% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 17.6%, Iran 11.2%, Qatar 9.2%, Egypt 7.4%, and Afghanistan 4.9%. Note that for the 2nd consecutive day, the Eastern Mediterranean region has reported a greater proportion of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours than the European region.

The African region reported 4.5% of the global newly reported cases and 3.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 44.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 13.8%, Ghana at 6.1%, Cameroon at 5.3%, Gabon at 4.0%, and Ethiopia at 3.8%.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.80% of the global newly reported cases and 0.30% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 61.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 25.9%, South Korea 5.9%, and Japan 4.9%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 10 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase as does South-East Asia, which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has surpassed the European region; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]
