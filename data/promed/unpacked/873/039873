Outbreak update - Cholera in Somalia, 30 May 2019
-------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Somalia has announced 55 new suspected cases of cholera, with no deaths, for epidemiological week 20 (13-19 May) in 2019. No suspected cholera cases were reported between epidemiological weeks 1 and 7 due to closure of main cholera treatment center, from which the data are collected. The cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases since the beginning of this outbreak in December 2017 is 7290, including 46 associated deaths. During this reporting period, all of the cases were reported from 16 districts in Banadir region. Of the 55 cases reported during week 20, 65% of the cases (24) are children under 5 years of age.

The cholera outbreak has been contained in the districts of Jubaland, Hirshabelle and South West States following implementation of oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaigns and other health interventions in these areas. However, active transmission is still being reported in Banadir region (Darkenly, Daynile, Hodan, Madina, Hamarjabjab, HamarWeine, Howlwadag, Bondere, Kahda, Waberi, and Warta nabada).

Since the beginning of 2019, 153 stool samples have been collected and tested in the National Public Health Laboratory in Mogadishu. During this reporting period, 11 cases were confirmed for _Vibrio cholera_, serotype O1 Ogawa by culture.

WHO continues to provide leadership and support the health authorities and partners in activities to mitigate the outbreak. The disease surveillance system is managed by the electronic Early Warning Alert and Response Network (eEWARN) system with the support of WHO and is currently being expanded to all health facilities across the country. WHO and the Ministry of Health continue to monitor outbreak trends through the EWARN system and promptly investigate and respond to all alerts.

[2] Cholera - Ethiopia (Amhara State)

An acute watery diarrhea (AWD) outbreak in Ethiopia's northern Amhara regional state has left 12 people dead, an official said on Thu 23 May 2019. Asaye Gebreselassie, deputy director of Wag Himera zone in Amhara regional state, said the outbreak killed 4 people and sickened 67 others in recent days, according to state media outlet Ethiopia News Agency.

A medical taskforce comprising federal, regional and zonal personnel has been deployed to the affected areas, Gebreselassie said. With the rainy season expected to start in June and continue until mid-September, the government is trying to prevent the spread of the AWD.

Federal and regional health institutions have been combating the diarrhea outbreak by treating unhygienic conditions in factories, health facilities, agricultural areas and eateries.

Cholera has killed one and left 32 others hospitalized in Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzanian health minister Ummy Mwalimu said on Wed 28 May 2019. "The outbreak of the disease has been caused by failure to abide by hygienic regulations," the minister said.

She directed all municipal councils in the commercial capital to enact by-laws that impose stern punishment to people who empty cesspool tanks in the open when it rains. Instructions have been given to municipal council authorities to mete out stern punishment to anybody disposing sewage in their compounds, Mwalimu said.

Dar es Salaam chief medical officer Yudas Ndungile said most cholera patients came from Mchikichini, in Kariakoo, and places hardly reached by sewage vehicles, and that efforts should be put in place to reach those areas.

[With the start of the rainy season in this area of East Africa, the number of cases of cholera will rise. The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated by Lutwick and colleagues (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, editors. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2018:113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 L [4.2 qt] in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
