This week, Ghana reported to WHO one fatal case of yellow fever, with onset
during the week 11-17 Feb 2001. It occurred in the Upper East Region,
Bawku East District, which becomes a newly-infected area.

[It appears that at least one of the suspect cases reported on ProMED-mail
on 2 Mar 2001 and subsequently not confirmed -- see references above -- has
now been confirmed. One wonders what the problems were with confirmation.
Although, as I have said before, a report like this is better late than
never, it is not particularly helpful to travelers to that region to know
only 3 months later that yellow fever was active there. One confirmed case
is usually the tip of the iceberg, and for all we know there may be more
cases occurring right now.
Countries have an obligation under the International Health Regulations to
report every suspect case of yellow fever, cholera, or plague to WHO within
24 hours, followed by confirmation (or the opposite) as soon as lab results
are available. - Mod.JW
