[From 21 Aug to 28 Dec 2021, 59 outbreaks of lumpy skin disease were detected in Mongolia.

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 74 900 / 2570 / 67 / 2509 / 0 / 72 519
See WOAH's final report and interactive map with outbreak locations at https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/3923.

"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is caused by lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a virus from the family Poxviridae, genus _Capripoxvirus_. Sheeppox virus and goatpox virus are the 2 other virus species in this genus.

"LSDV is highly host-specific and causes disease only in cattle (_Bos indicus_ and _B. taurus_) and water buffalo (_Bubalus bubalis_). There is evidence from a study in Ethiopia of differential breed susceptibility to LSD, with Holstein Friesian or crossbred cattle exhibiting higher morbidity and mortality due to LSD when compared with local zebu cattle. LSDV is not zoonotic, so humans cannot get affected by the disease."

"Vaccination is the most effective tool for LSD control and potential eradication, is easier to implement and more effective than other measures (that is, stamping out) and, in most cases, is less costly, reduces the total number of susceptible animals within the population, thus preventing entry (in the case of preventive vaccination) and spread of the disease and protects the animals from getting infected with LSD thus preventing direct and indirect economic losses."
