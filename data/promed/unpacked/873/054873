Investigations of West Nile Virus Infections in Recipients of Organ
Transplantation and Blood Transfusion; Update
-------------------------------------------------------------------
An investigation involving the Centers for Disease control and
Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Health
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Georgia Division of
Public Health, and the Florida Department of Health identified West
Nile virus (WNV)-associated illnesses in four recipients of organs
from the same donor (1,2). Although the transplanted organs were the
source of infection for the 4 organ recipients, the source of the
organ donor's infection remains unknown; an investigation of the
numerous transfusions received by the organ donor is ongoing.
Since the report of these cases, CDC has been informed of other
patients with suspected WNV-associated meningoencephalitis (WNME)
after receiving blood products within 4 weeks of illness onset. One
of these patients also received an organ transplant. All of these
patients resided in areas with epidemic and epizootic WNV activity;
investigations are ongoing to determine whether transfusion or
transplantation was the source of WNV transmission. This report
summarizes 2 investigations of recipients of organs and blood
products, 4 investigations of transfusion recipients, and one
investigation of a WNV-seronegative person with fever and
encephalopathy who received a potentially contaminated unit of blood.
Investigation 1. On 1 Aug 2002, 4 organs were recovered from an organ
donor and were transplanted into 4 persons (1,2). WNME was confirmed
in 3 recipients and WNV fever in one recipient. Illness began 7 to 17
days after transplantation. Although a sample of the donor's plasma
collected at the time of the organ recovery was positive for WNV by
kinetic quantitative PCR assay (TaqMan), the source of the organ
donor's infection is unknown.
During treatment for injuries, which eventually were fatal, the organ
donor received blood products from 63 unique donors. Donor follow-up
has been initiated by the blood collection agency. Of 41 donors for
whom retention segments [i.e. blood samples from tubing that had been
attached to the original donor collection bag] were available, 22
tested negative for WNV by TaqMan and serology, and 19 tested
negative for WNV by TaqMan; serology testing on these 19 segments is
in progress. In addition to the organ donor, 35 other persons
received components derived from these 63 donors; follow-up of these
recipients is pending. Untransfused components are being returned to
the blood collection agency. One has tested negative for WNV by
TaqMan; testing on the others is under way.
Investigation 2. A man aged 47 years received a liver transplant on
14 Aug 2002 and during the next 7 days received 39 units of blood
products. After discharge on 24 Aug 2002, he was readmitted to the
hospital on 3 Sep 2002 with fever and subsequently developed
encephalopathy. A lumbar puncture revealed elevated protein, a
lymphocytic pleocytosis, and WNV IgM antibody; the patient recovered
and was discharged. Before organ recovery, the donor received 2 units
of albumin and one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). In addition to
the liver, 2 kidneys were recovered and were transplanted into one
recipient, whose clinical status is being investigated.
Investigation 3. During the period 27 to 28 Jul 2002, a woman aged 24
years received 18 units of blood products (12 units of packed red
blood cells [PRBC] and 6 units of FFP) because of postpartum
hemorrhage. On 1 Aug 2002 she was discharged. The patient developed
worsening headache and fever and 22 days later was readmitted to the
hospital with meningitis. A lumbar puncture revealed a lymphocytic
pleocytosis; serum and CSF samples were positive for WNV by IgM.
Retention segments were available from 15 of the 18 donations
administered in July; 3 (20 percent) were positive for WNV by TaqMan.
Of 3 components derived from a donation associated with these
positive segments, one unit of FFP was retrieved, tested, and found
to be positive for WNV by TaqMan; viable WNV also was isolated from
this plasma. The donor of this blood component sought medical care 4
days after donation because of fever, chills, and headache; follow-up
WNV-antibody testing of this donor is in progress.
Investigation 4. A man aged 72 years with a history of myelodysplasia
and frequent blood transfusions received 4 units of PRBC during the
period 18 Jul to 7 Aug 2002. The patient was admitted on 8 Aug 2002
with generalized weakness and fever. A serum sample obtained 2 days
later was positive for WNV by IgM. No retention segments were
available. Of 5 components derived from these 4 donations, 4 units of
FFP were retrieved, and testing is in progress. One unit of platelets
was transfused into another recipient, and follow-up is pending.
Investigation 5. On 17 Jul 2002, a woman aged 78 years received 2
units of PRBC 1 day after a surgical amputation, 3 days after which,
she developed fever, altered mental status, and seizures. Acute- and
convalescent-phase serum samples and CSF were positive for WNV by
IgM. Retention segments associated with both units of PRBC were
negative for WNV by TaqMan and by IgM. Follow-up of the 2 donors and
a patient who received platelets from one of these donors is in
progress.
Investigation 6. During the period 26 Jul to 23 Aug 2002, a man aged
77 years who required frequent blood transfusions for myelodysplasia
received 8 units of blood products (4 units of PRBC and 4 units of
single-donor platelets). On 23 Aug 2002, the patient developed fever
and headache. Serum and CSF samples were positive for WNV-specific
IgM. The patient had progressive encephalopathy and died. For 4 of
the 8 donations, 4 retention segments were available; all were
negative for WNV by TaqMan. Follow-up is ongoing for 3 patients who
received platelets from 3 of the 8 donors. In addition, 4 units of
plasma have been withdrawn and are being tested.
Investigation 7. On 26 Jul 2002, a woman aged 55 years received 3
units of PRBC after an orthopedic procedure. The following day, she
developed fever and encephalopathy. Serum samples collected on the
fourth and 40th days after illness onset were negative for WNV by
IgM. Retention segments were available from all donations; 2 were
negative for WNV by TaqMan. One was positive for WNV by TaqMan but
negative for WNV-specific IgM; serum collected from the donor 69 days
after donation was positive for WNV-specific IgM, reflecting WNV
seroconversion. The donor denied fever, headache, or other symptoms
during the 3 weeks before or after the donation. A patient undergoing
cardiac surgery received a unit of FFP from this donation. A serum
sample collected from this patient was negative for WNV by IgM.
Follow-up serum samples are being collected for the index case and
for the recipient of the FFP.
MMWR Editorial Note:
CDC, FDA, HRSA, blood collection agencies, and state and local health
departments continue to investigate possible transmission of WNV
through blood transfusion or organ transplantation. The initial
investigation demonstrated transmission from a WNV-viremic organ
donor to four recipients of those organs. In another investigation
(Investigation 3), the isolation of live WNV from a unit of FFP
indicates that the virus can survive in some blood components and
probably can be transmitted by transfusion. Although this case is
highly suspicious for transfusion-associated transmission, this
patient lived in an area where WNV was active, and the exact means of
WNV acquisition cannot be determined. In contrast, the preliminary
results of another case investigation (Investigation 7) indicate that
not all recipients of potentially WNV-contaminated units (i.e., those
that are positive for WNV by TaqMan) will become infected with WNV.
The Public Health Service (PHS) recommends several precautionary
measures to reduce the possible risk for WNV transmission by organ
transplantation or blood transfusion. Patients with WNV infection who
have received blood transfusions or organs within 4 weeks preceding
symptom onset should be reported to CDC through local public health
authorities to initiate an investigation. Serum or tissue samples
should be retained for later studies. In addition, patients with WNV
infection who have onset of symptoms within 1 week of blood or organ
donation should be reported. Prompt reporting of these persons will
facilitate withdrawal of potentially infected blood components. HRSA
has alerted organ transplant organizations about the potential for
transplantation-associated WNV infection. Tests for WNV suitable for
routine blood donor screening are not available. However, FDA is
working with public and private partners to facilitate development of
such tests to ensure their availability if screening is necessary.
FDA is developing additional guidance for blood centers to enhance
reporting of post-donation illnesses suggestive of WNV infection and
to determine when retrieval of recent blood collections from these
donors is warranted.
Approximately 4.5 million persons receive blood or blood products
annually. Although persons needing blood transfusions or organ
transplants should be aware of the risk for WNV infection, the
benefits of receiving needed transfusions or transplants outweigh the
potential risk for WNV infection. In addition, blood donation poses
no risk to the donor for acquiring WNV, and PHS encourages blood
donation.
