The Toronto [Ontario] Wildlife Centre is urging residents to be on the lookout for raccoons behaving oddly, following an uptick in distemper cases.

"The disease has been raging through the population for a while, but we've seen a dramatic increase this fall [2015]," said TWC director Nathalie Karvonen, noting the animal shelter has been receiving as many as 20 raccoon-related calls a day.

Canine distemper originates in dogs, but can be spread to other animals, including raccoons and skunks. The virus attacks the central nervous system, often resulting in unusual behaviour.

Karvonen said if a raccoon is out during the day and appears lethargic or unafraid of humans it could be a sign of distemper.

"One of the things we ask people to do is find a stick or a broom handle and gently touch the animal. Any self-respecting raccoon, you wouldn't even be able to get close enough, but a raccoon with distemper will just go 'huh' and lay there," she said.

Raccoons with distemper can also exhibit signs of shaking or seizure.

Unfortunately, the disease is almost always fatal, meaning most afflicted raccoons will need to be euthanized.

"Unfortunately, once they have the disease, there's not much we can do for them," Karvonen said. "And we'd rather save our donation dollars for animals we can hopefully rehabilitate and release."

If you suspect a raccoon in your area is suffering from distemper, Karvonen said the best thing to do is call Toronto Animal Services or the wildlife centre.

"We definitely want to rule out that they don't have head trauma or there's some other reason they're acting that way," she said.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders.

In raccoons, distemper usually results in neurological signs such as stumbling and lack of 'shyness'; they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly.' Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting and odd vocalization.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all domestic carnivores in the area up to date, including both rabies and distemper. A map of the affected area can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3753811,274. - Mod.PMB
