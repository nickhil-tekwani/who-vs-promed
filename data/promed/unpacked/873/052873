With the head of Europe's largest wheat mill under arrest, pasta
makers are checking their supplies to see whether any came from a
stock found to be contaminated with a cancer-causing toxin.
The head of Molino Casillo, was arrested for allegedly adulterating
stocks with contaminated wheat after a joint investigation by Italy's
agricultural ministry and the fraud police.
The arrest follows the discovery that wheat imported from Canada was
contaminated with ochratoxin, a carcinogenic substance. About 58 000
tonnes of durum wheat was confiscated at the port of Bari.
A statement by the minister of agriculture, Gianni Alemanno, says the
case shows the need for stricter controls on tracing and tracking
food imports. It also proved that Italy's system of safety
inspections and tests was helping to keep contaminated food off the shelves.
"Once more, foreign products have presented the greatest risk of
counterfeiting and fraud, an episode that confirms the necessity of
reinforcing label-of-origin guarantees on food products, to increase
the protection both of consumers and producers who invest in
quality," according to a press release today.
The ministry said Casillo had been arrested by the customs police,
which carried out an arrest warrant for a charge of tampering and
counterfeiting of foodstuffs, as well as poisoning of foodstuffs. The
judge is investigating the import from Canada of grain contaminated
with cancer-causing toxins, which was shown to be over legal limits
on a load seized last September [2005] on board a ship in the port of
Bari, according to a statement translated by AGI Online on behalf of
the Italian government.
Italy's family-owned Molino Casillo is a group of 4 mills situated in
southern Italy. The company says it is the European leader in the
production of semolina for pasta and is the world's largest private
buyer of durum wheat. Molino Casillo buys about 1 million tonnes of
durum wheat a year and is one of the principal market makers in durum
wheat and semolina.
Canada, one of the world's largest producers of durum wheat, sells
about 40 per cent of its supply to Italy, according to AWB Consultancy.
Ochratoxin is produced by several fungi and occurs naturally in a
variety of plant products such as cereals, coffee beans, beans,
pulses and dried fruit, and has been detected also in coffee, wine,
beer and grape juice.
Its presence depends on climatic conditions, abnormally long storage,
transportation, wet or dry milling, roasting procedures and
fermentation. High concentrations in foods have been linked with
damage to kidney function.

[Ochratoxin A is the most important and most commonly occurring of a
structurally related group of compounds, and is often abbreviated to
OTA or OA. It is produced by some species of _Aspergillus_, such as
_A. ochraceus_, mainly in tropical regions and by _Penicillium
verrucosum_, a common storage fungus in temperate areas such as
Canada, eastern and northwestern Europe, and parts of South America.
Ochratoxin B differs in structure only by the absence of the chlorine
atom. It can occur naturally but is much less toxic. Other related
molecules include ochratoxin C, ochratoxin a, and ochratoxin beta.
Ochratoxin A is a potent toxin affecting mainly the kidneys, in which
it can cause both acute and chronic lesions, whereas its dechloro
derivative, ochratoxin B, is non-toxic. A nephrotoxic effect has been
demonstrated in all mammalian species. In acute toxicity studies,
LD50 values vary greatly in different species, the dog being
especially susceptible. Many feeding trials lasting up to 90 days or
more have examined the progressive effects on kidney function and
damage through prolonged exposure and led to both sub-acute and
sub-chronic effects.
Ochratoxin A is a potent teratogen in mice, rats, hamsters and
chickens, but not apparently pigs, when fed to sows during early
pregnancy. Both teratogenic and reproductive effects have been
demonstrated. It is known to affect the immune system in a number of
mammalian species.
Ochratoxin A is genotoxic both in vitro and in vivo, but the
mechanism of genotoxicity is still unclear. Because human exposure to
ochratoxin A has been clearly demonstrated by its detection in blood
and breast milk, the presence of ochratoxin A in foodstuffs is
clearly undesirable.
Ochratoxin A was first reported as a natural contaminant of cereals
in a sample of corn. Concentrations found are usually below 50
microgram/kg, but when products are stored badly much higher
concentrations can develop. In temperate regions a significant
proportion of cereal samples may be contaminated with very small
amounts below 1 microgram/kg, although a few may contain much higher
levels. Many surveys for ochratoxin A in cereals have been carried
out, but in recent years it has been found in a wide range of other
stored products and processed foods including coffee, beer, dried
fruit, wine, cocoa and nuts. Information on the worldwide occurrence
of ochratoxin has been reviewed and reported in several publications.
Many experiments have been carried out in laboratory culture to
identify the optimum conditions for the formation of ochratoxin A by
_Aspergillus ochraceus_ and _Penicillium verrucosum_. However, under
field conditions it is often formed in cereals under conditions
marginal for the formation of the fungi, and this aspect has only
recently been addressed but is vital for understanding how its
formation can be avoided.
