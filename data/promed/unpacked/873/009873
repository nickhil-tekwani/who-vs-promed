Mr. McKenzie, who met with Opposition Leader Bruce Golding Monday
morning to discuss the situation, says while the community has
responded positively to the malaria alert, there is a need for closer
collaboration with the Health Ministry. And despite the reported
increase in the number of Malaria cases that has been brought to the
attention of medical authorities, the Health Ministry is insisting
that it has the matter under control.
According to the Ministry, there are now 13 confirmed malaria cases
which are all confined to the Kingston 12, 13 and 14 areas. Thirteen
cases have been discovered in Delacree Park, Denham Town, Trench Town
and Tivoli Gardens. Five children are among the 13 persons diagnosed
with the insect-borne disease.
The Ministry says the children have been hospitalised, but none is
considered to be critical. Several persons suspected to have
contracted the disease are also in health facilities. Despite this,
Team Leader Dr. Marion Bullock-Ducasse says there is no need for alarm.

Despite the reported increase in the number of malaria cases that has
been brought to the attention of medical authorities, the Health
Ministry is insisting that it has the matter under control. The
Ministry says there are now 13 confirmed malaria cases which are all
confined to the Kingston 12, 13 and 14 areas.
Five children are among the 13 persons diagnosed with the
insect-borne disease. The Ministry says the children have been
hospitalised, but none is considered to be critical. All 13 cases
have been discovered in Delacree Park, Denham Town, Trench Town and
Tivoli Gardens. But Team Leader Dr. Marion Ducasse stressed that
there is no need for alarm.
The Health Ministry's surveillance team appears to be working
feverishly. Dr. Ducasse says all health centres will be on the alert
Monday [?4 Dec 2006]. But the surveillance team is not limited to
these areas as breeding sites of the anopheles mosquito which
transmits malaria, have been identified in Sydenham Villas and
Featherbed Lane in St. Catherine. These communities along with
another which has been found in Trench Town have been destroyed.
The Health Ministry says the findings have been reported to the
Health Emergency Operations Centre. The Ministry is also recommending
that all mass gatherings in these areas be suspended.
This includes "Passa Passa" the popular weekly entertainment activity
in Western Kingston. Meanwhile, Ministry officials are to meet with
representatives of the affected communities including the Member of
Parliament for Western Kingston, Bruce Golding and Councillor for the
Tivoli Gardens Division Mayor Desmond McKenzie.

[Jamaica is considered historically free of malaria. To evaluate the
cases we need to know which strain of malaria the patients have been
infected with, and we need to know their history, i.e. recent travel
or migration. The recent outbreak in the Bahamas consisted of cases
by asymptomatic immigrants from a malaria-endemic country, and this
could also be the situation here. - Mod.EP]
