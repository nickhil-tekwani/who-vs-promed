Besides cattle, the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has started to affect buffaloes and goats, too, in Central Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara [Nusa Tenggara Barat (NB)] ahead of Eid al-Adha, according to the local government [see map at https://tinyurl.com/85wksmk2].

"Currently, farm animals that have been infected with FMD are cattle, buffaloes, and goats," head of the Central Lombok Agriculture Office Lalu Taufikurahman said here on Friday [17 Jun 2022]. Based on the latest data from the FMD Task Force, the number of cattle infected with FMD has reached 10 995, he informed. However, around 50%, or 5442 heads of cattle, have recovered.

Meanwhile, the number of infected buffaloes has reached 112, of which 61 have recovered. As for goats, the number of infected animals has reached 60, and 16 have recovered. Thus, the total number of farm animals infected with FMD [in Central Lombok] has reached 11 167, of which 5519 have recovered.

The disease has now spread to 102 out of 139 villages in Central Lombok, he noted. As part of anticipatory measures against the disease, the local government has shuttered all animal markets until 20 Jun 2022, according to a letter issued recently. "The animal market is still closed for the time being," Taufikurahman said.

Although the FMD outbreak has continued to spread, the availability of animals for the Islamic ritual of Qurbani (animal sacrifice) in Central Lombok is still safe, he affirmed. "We have encouraged entrepreneurs of Qurbani animals to open kiosks to sell the animals by implementing the FMD health protocols so that the farm animals that will be used for Qurbani remain healthy," he informed.

Earlier, on Tuesday [14 Jun 2022], the government commenced the nationwide FMD vaccination for livestock from Sidoarjo District, East Java. The vaccines are being prioritized for healthy animals that are at high risk of infection, that is, animals at livestock breeding centers, community-owned dairy farms, dairy cooperatives, and beef cattle farms.

The Ministry of Agriculture has forecast that 17 million livestock will receive the vaccine, or around 80% of the livestock population in provinces affected by the disease. The livestock will be inoculated thrice: twice in 2022 and once in 2023.

[Central Lombok is a regency (Indonesian: Kabupaten) of the province West Nusa Tenggara (NB). It is one of the 4 regencies on the island of Lombok, the western of the 2 main islands comprising the province; the island on its east is Sumbawa. Previously, FMD was reported from Indonesia's large western islands Sumatra and Java. The province/island Bali is situated between East Java and Lombok, now both reportedly extensively infected. For the preventive measures undertaken there, see item [2] below.

[2] Bali: FMD preventive measures

Bali is very at risk of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) which attacks split-toed animals. The reason is that Bali is surrounded by cases of FMD such as in a number of districts in East Java, and all districts in Lombok. This was revealed by the Head of the Denpasar Class 1 Agricultural Quarantine Center, drh. Putu Terunanegara MM, while coordinating public relations with the media, Thursday [16 Jun 2022].

Because it is very risky, it is 24 hours a day to mitigate risk. In addition to supervision, his party also strictly installs spraying at the entrance and exit of livestock, such as at Gilimanuk Harbor and Padangbai.

Livestock transport vehicles must be sprayed so that they will automatically be sprayed with disinfectant. This was done because the vehicle could have passed through outbreak areas. "With strict efforts like this, Bali still has zero FMD cases," he said.

Regarding the upcoming Eid al-Adha, the absence of FMD in Bali is an opportunity to increase the number of inter-island livestock outside Bali. Kalimantan, which previously imported animals from the East Java region, has finally shifted the demand to Bali. "We have made 2 shipments of livestock, especially cattle, to Kalimantan and Jakarta, totaling around 500 heads," he said.

[Indonesia reported officially its FMD event, the 1st one since 1983, which had reportedly started on 13 Apr 2022, on 9 May 2022. Weekly follow-up reports are prescribed by WOAH's Code. The multiple outbreaks since 9 May 2022 within Sumatra and Java, and the eastward spread of FMD to West Nusa Tenggara, are yet to be officially reported with the relevant epidemiological data.

Eid al-Adha 2022 is expected to be celebrated on Sunday 10 Jul 2022, a tentative date, as the actual date is contingent on the sighting of the moon of Dhul Hijjah, 1443, the 12th and last month of the Islamic calendar. The Eid is preceded by massive trade in livestock for the ritual sacrifice, expecting Muslims to sacrifice their best halal domestic animals (usually a camel, goat, sheep, or ram depending on the region) as a symbol of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his only son, Ismael. Preventing the spread of FMD, an extremely infectious viral disease of these species, in such circumstances is regarded a challenging, complex burden. Swift mass vaccination is essential.

Maintaining Bali's freedom of FMD is of particular importance for the island's tourism industry. In 2020, Australia was the largest feeder market for direct foreign tourist arrivals to Bali -- around 222 000 visits. Though not zoonotic, the FMD virus may be mechanically carried by fomites, including footwear, dresses and food products. - Mod.AS
