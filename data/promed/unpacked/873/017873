Three people, living in the Mangistauskaya Region, Western Kazakhstan,
contracted bubonic plague: a 13-year teenager, his mother and grandmother.
The patients are now at the hospital in the village of Beineu, situated 250
kilometers from the regional administrative center Aktau.
The patients are now stable, although the teenager was in a critical
condition for several hours. Specialists of the local anti-plague center
established the herdsman's family contracted the disease while cutting up
the carcass of a camel: only these animals can fall ill with this disease.
A quarantine was put in placed at that locality. As many as 89 people
contacted the patients. Seven of them were hospitalized and are under
medical observation. They are mostly medics who inspected the patients for
the first time.
Epidemiologists from the republican epidemiological center now work in the
locality. The regional administration appropriated 200,000 tenges (about
1,500 U.S. dollars) for medicines. Measures were taken to localize the
plague seat.
The Mangistauskaya Region is regarded as a higher risk zone for contracting
plague, although the last case of plague was registered in the region 24
years ago. This is the third case of contracting plague in Kazakhstan this
year.
The Aktyubinsk and Kyzylorda regions registered one man each who fell ill
with plague in June.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia (formerly _Pasteurella_) pestis_ and affects
primarily the lymphatics and lungs. Plague is a historic scourge of man,
wild rodents, and rabbits and cases associated with cats, dogs and camels
are now recognized as hazards to man.
The primary means of spreading _Yersinia pestis_ is the flea. Contact with
infected carcasses has been a significant source of infection for man.
Endemic foci of sylvatic plague exists in the western USA and in many areas
worldwide. Throughout history, outbreaks of human plague involving rats in
densely populated agricultural or urban areas have occurred when rats
commingled with infected sylvatic rodents. - Mod.TG
