Dodome is a cluster of 6 rural farming communities in the Volta region of Ghana, situated northwest of Ho, the regional capital, about 180 kilometers northeast of Ghanaian capital Accra.

The communities are part of the major food baskets of the Volta region, with the cultivation of corn, plantain, and cocoa, besides vegetables.

However, the presence of phlebotomine sand flies makes life unbearable for the people in these communities. These tiny insects prey on them, causing severe skin lesions and parasitic leishmaniasis infections.

Bernett Dogoe, a traditional chief of Dodome Awuiaso, one of the 6 communities, told Xinhua that the flies, known locally as Ehle with their associated health hazards, had been a source of great worry to the locals. "The flies have been here for several generations, making life unpleasant for us," Dogoe said, adding that the bites have caused chronic aliments to locals.

According to the World Health Organization, bites from sand flies leave bumps and blisters on the skin of their victims, resulting in severe skin lesions.

Mizpah Tsevi, a young female farmer, has a 3-year-old son Raymond Kwaw who has blisters all over his body. The child continued scratching his body as Xinhua interviewed his mother. "The blisters on his skin are due to the bites from the sand flies. Once they bite him, he begins to itch, and when he scratches the spots, the blisters appear and leave scars on his skin," Tsevi told Xinhua.

She has tried using various skin care products to treat the blisters on her child's skin, but with limited success as the blisters reappear after each bite. "My skin used to be smooth, but due to the effect of the insect bites, it has become rough. It makes me itch, but when I scratch the body to get relief, it becomes sore. It makes farming difficult for us," said Agnes Dornyo, a 60-year-old female farmer.

Some locals said they live in perpetual uncertainty due to the new knowledge about the health hazards associated with sand fly bites. In recent years, SylDem Limited and EXA Ventures, 2 local companies, have teamed up in outreach programs in these communities to bring relief to the people.

"Through research, we established that the presence of the sand flies has led to the prevalence of skin lesions and leishmaniasis infections in the communities. We, therefore, embarked on this project in 2017 to eliminate leishmaniasis infections in the communities," Sylvia Demanya, Managing Director of SylDem, told Xinhua during one of their outreach programs.

"Since they are mostly peasant farmers, seeking medical treatment seems expensive for the locals," added Demanya.

The 2 companies carry out public education during their outreaches and donate free organic insect repellents to the locals, some for smearing on the body and others for burning in their rooms to fend off attacks from the predatory flies.

They also donate certified food supplements produced from the noni plant to the locals as immune boosters against infections from insect bites. "We appeal to philanthropic organizations to support us in our outreach programs and in our quest to eradicate leishmaniasis in these communities," she urged.

[In the Ho Municipality in the Volta Region of Ghana, a localised outbreak of skin ulcers, possibly CL [cutaneous leishmaniasis], was noted in 2003 without any such documented activity (Margaret A. Kweku et al. An outbreak of suspected cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ghana: lessons learnt and preparation for future outbreaks. Glob Hlth Action 2011;4:1, 5527, DOI: https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v4i0.5527). Later, a new subgenus of Leishmania was isolated from cutaneous lesions in the same area (Godwin Kwakye-Nuako et al. First isolation of a new species of Leishmania responsible for human cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ghana and classification in the Leishmania enriettii complex. Intl J Parasitol 2015;45(11):679-84. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2015.05.001). A recent study from the same region found that 41% of people investigated showed a positive reaction to the leishmanin skin test (Richard Akuffo et al. Prevalence of Leishmania infection in three communities of Oti Region, Ghana. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2021 May 27;15(5):e0009413. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009413). A recent review of leishmaniasis in West Africa state that the incidence has increased over the past decade and rodents are reported as the main reservoir hosts (M Ciss√© et al. Epidemiology of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in West Africa: a Systematic Review. Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2020;113(1):24-34. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3166/bspe-2020-0115). - Mod. EP]
