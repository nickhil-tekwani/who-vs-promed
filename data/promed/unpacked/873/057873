Five districts have reported an outbreak of malaria recently in
Karnataka. Although the state is doing quite well in terms of
implementing the Central Government's National Vector Borne Disease
Control Programme (NVBDCP), malaria cases have been reported every
year from endemic pockets.

Of late, Bijapur has reported 436 cases, Bagalkot 74, Koppal 275,
Chitradurga 15 and Tumkur 214. Sources in the Department of Health
said the health officials needed to be proactive. "Many health
officials do not understand the severity of a malaria outbreak. If
necessary action is not taken on time, malaria can spread to the
cities," sources said.

Apparently, Karnataka had received a letter of appreciation from
NVBDCP for controlling malaria in a very short time span recently. In
2008, there were reportedly 8 deaths due to malaria, with 47 160
confirmed cases and 9957 _Plasmodium falciparum_ (PF) (severe) cases.
In 2009, there were 36 830 confirmed malaria cases and 5685 PF cases
with no reported deaths.

State health secretary Dr E V Ramana Reddy said the government is
doing well in controlling malaria. "Every time there is an outbreak
of malaria cases, we do take immediate action and do the needful. But
certain areas are endemic, and we can only make efforts to reduce the
number of cases," he said.

The secretary said lack of junior health assistants was a major
hurdle faced by the malaria programme. The junior health assistants
go door to door in affected areas and distribute medicines for
malaria. "We are in the process of recruiting 5000 health workers.
Shortly, we will have more staff to overcome the staff crunch," the
secretary added.

[Southern India, including Karnataka state, is usually regarded as a
low risk area. However, the reports of malaria in visitors to Goa
have highlighted that there is little information about malaria in
other states of southern India. - Mod.EP]
