Malaria resurgence in the state of Rio de Janeiro
------------------------------------------
An April drought appears to be slowing the progress of Rio de
Janeiro's worst dengue epidemic on record, which has killed 56 people
this year, but the Brazilian state now faces an increase in malaria
cases in the city of Rio.
As the number of dengue cases fell, the number of malaria cases in
the state rose to 32 so far this year, with 28 imported from outside
the state and 4 cases originating in a seaside colonial town of Parat
that is popular with tourists. There was [a total of only 68
registered cases in Rio state in both 2001 and 2000, and all were
imported. Malaria is rare in Rio, with most cases being imported from
abroad or from jungle areas in the north.

[Though 4 malaria cases may not seem a lot, with a suitable climate
and mosquitoes malaria may resurge in areas with poor environmental
control of breeding places. The few cases are not sufficient reason
to recommend malaria prophylaxis to travellers. - Mod.EP
