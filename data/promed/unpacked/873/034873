From mid-June 2018, all of the pigs fed table scraps in a farm near Shenyang city in Liaoning province suffered from acute clinical and pathological signs, including high fever, dullness, generalized reddening of the skin, obvious enlargement of the spleen, and congestion and generalized hemorrhage of the lymph nodes, heart, spleen, and kidney. All of the 400 pigs died within one month after the 1st clinical signs appeared and the farm was abandoned. Sporadic cases with similar signs were observed in different pig farms in northern Shenyang city.

We collected different organ samples, including spleen, liver, and kidney, from 2 dead pigs in one farm in the area with an outbreak and extracted viral DNA. In accordance with the method for conventional PCR assays recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2012, Chapter 2.8.1), we identified ASFV infection by nucleotide sequencing. All of the samples were ASFV PCR positive, and the entire viral B646L (p72), E183L (p54), and B602L genes were obtained as described previously. The gene sequences from the 3 farms were same, and the p72 gene of one isolate (ASFV-SY18) was deposited in GenBank (accession no. MH713612). A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 6.0 (Figure 1) in which the reliability of the phylogeny groupings was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. The percentage identities and similarity scores of the viral gene sequences were calculated using DNASTAR Lasergene (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, USA).

As shown in Figure 1, the outbreak strain ASFV-SY18 belongs to genotype II group and shares 100 percent nucleotide identity with the following strains: Georgia 2007/1, Krasnodar 2012, Irkutsk 2017, and Estonia 2014 isolated in Georgia, Russia, and Estonia based on p72 gene.

Similar to Estonia 2014 in Estonia, Ukr12/Zapo in Ukraine, Bel13/Grodno in Belarus, and isolates (Volgograd2015, Bryansk2015, Lipetsk2016, Voronezh2016) in Russia, ASFV-SY18 has an intergenic region (IGR) I variant with additional tandem-repeat sequences (TATATAGGAA) in the IGR between I73R and I329L. The results above indicated the close relationship among these viruses, which suggests that the ASF outbreak in China was caused by the pan-Russian strain of ASFV.

China has been Russia's and the EU's important trading partner. In accordance with a liberal trade policy in China, the increasing demand for pork has resulted in a great increase in the volume of live pigs and pork products imported to China. Illegal products imported and waste improperly disposed from international ports and airports to fed pigs are difficult to mitigate. With this outbreak in China, to avoid economic losses, farmers illegally send moribund pigs to local markets, possibly resulting in the rapid spread of ASF to other local farms. Until an effective vaccine is developed, international and regional collaboration and animal health organizations must control and prevent the epidemic of ASF.

[On 10 Aug 2018, China submitted to the OIE its 2nd ASF follow-up report, informing absence of new outbreaks since the initial report, submitted on 3 Aug 2018. In the 1st report, the start of the event was given as 1 Aug 2018.

The 2nd follow-up report included the following commentary:
"After all susceptible animals at the infected point and infected zone were culled and disposed of in an appropriate bio-safety way, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has organized and guided veterinary services of the whole country to conduct an epidemiological survey and emergency surveillance for African swine fever (ASF). Up to 9 Aug 2018, a total of 261 900 screening sites were investigated and a total of 18 094 300 pigs were screened in our country. Sites included pig farms, markets, slaughterhouses, factories, or sites for disposal of animals and animal products. Epidemiological survey and emergency surveillance plan has been issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. In the key provinces including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Gansu, Xinjiang, Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, an epidemiological survey and emergency surveillance for ASF have been conducted according to the plan. Up to now, no new cases have been found."

From the current paper it appears that the event had started, in fact, the latest in mid-June 2018; the virus might have been spreading undetected since. The efforts invested in the investigation and the transparency reflected by the current publication, are impressive. The Chinese authorities have a huge, globally unprecedented undertaking on their hands to try prevent the spread of the disease throughout a subcontinent which harbours about half of the world's domestic pig population. This becomes even more complex in view of the need to address also ASF vectors -- wild boar and ticks.

As the authors rightly indicate, the need for an effective ASF vaccine has become vividly crucial. - Mod.AS
