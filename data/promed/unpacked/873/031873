Taney County issues warning on outbreak of 5th disease
------------------------------------------------
The Taney County Health Department warns people to be aware of area cases of 5th disease, a contagious viral illness. Kim Foster, the Taney County Health Department epidemiologist, said there have been 32 cases. The disease has symptoms of the common cold: fever, runny nose and headache.

"5th disease is usually mild and will go away on its own," Foster said. "However, it is very contagious."

Mike Brothers, a spokesman for the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, said he didn't know of any cases of 5th disease in Greene County.

[The disease, caused by parvovirus B19, gets its name because before the introduction of childhood vaccines, it was usually the "5th disease" that a child might commonly develop. Measles was the 1st, scarlet fever the 2nd, rubella the 3rd, Dukes disease (exanthema subitum) the 4th, and parvovirus B19 (sometime named 'slapped cheek' disease] the 5th. People with 5th disease may have a red rash on their faces and arms. About 20 percent of children and adults infected do not show any symptoms. However, those who are immuno-compromised (HIV/AIDS), chemotherapy) may be at risk for complications if exposed.

About 50 percent of pregnant women are immune to parvovirus B19. So, these women and their babies are usually protected from getting the virus and 5th disease.

Pregnant women who are not immune usually do not have serious complications after they are exposed to others with 5th disease. They usually have only mild illness. Also, their babies usually do not have any problems. However, sometimes a baby will develop severe anemia, and the woman may have a miscarriage. But, this is not common. It happens in less than 5 percent of all pregnant women with parvovirus B19 infection and more commonly during the first half of pregnancy. Pregnant women who are not immune and are not currently infected with parvovirus B19 may want to stay away from people with 5th disease, see:
