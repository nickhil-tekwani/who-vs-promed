ANTHRAX, WILDLIFE - INDIA: (KERALA) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Tests conducted on carcasses of wild boars found on the premises of
the Kerala Police Academy [in Thrissur] have confirmed anthrax.
Carcasses of 7 wild boars, an eagle, and a toddy cat were found on
the campus of the academy at Ramavarmapuram, a part of which has
thick vegetation. Some of the carcasses were reportedly 2 to 3 months
old. Others were 2 or 3 weeks old.

District Medical Officer V Divakaran said that tests conducted at the
Kerala Agricultural University's College of Veterinary and Animal
Sciences on carcasses revealed the animals had anthrax.

A meeting was held at the academy on Thursday [25 Feb 2010] to
formulate measures to tackle the problem. The District Medical
Officer; Divisional Forest Officer ML Thomas; District Veterinary
Chief Officer Sanil V Cheeran; and officials of the academy took part in it.

Later, the carcasses were burnt. The meeting said that animals within
a few kilometres from the academy would be immunised if further cases
were reported.

Confirmation of anthrax in the area is a cause for concern as the
academy also houses the police kennel unit. Cases of anthrax in dogs,
however, were rare, according to Aravind Ghosh, professor and head of
the College of Veterinary Science Hospital.

Steps have been taken to prevent transmission of the disease," Dr
Divakaran said.

[Posting has been delayed in the hope of acquiring further
information on this event. Frankly it reads more like a police
college exercise than a real event, but it might have been both.
There are various problems: first, anthrax rarely starts in swine
unless there is contaminated commercial feed, which is not the case
with "wild boars". So there is likely to have been livestock cases in
the surrounding villages, which if so were missed by the authorities.
Secondly, anthrax (the disease) is only regularly seen in ostriches
but the organism is routinely recovered from the faeces of scavenging
birds -- there is a difference between dying from and dying with --
and eagles are not scavengers.

Anthrax is not common in cats, though it is seen in lions and such in
Africa, including civets. The toddy cat (_Paradoxurus
hermaphroditus_) is a black or blackish-brown civet with long coarse
hair. The underparts are whitish, buff, or a rich yellow. Its limbs
are black or dark brown. It inhabits well-wooded regions. The animal
lives mainly on trees, lying curled up by day among the branches or
in a hole in the trunk. The name came about because this creature was
apparently fond of drinking from vessels put in palm trees to collect
sap for making toddy or palm sugar. It is an omnivore. All of which
makes one think that the carcass found was incidental. See
http://www.wildsingapore.per.sg/discovery/factsheet/civetpalm.htm> and
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Palm_Civet>

Clarification of this incident would be appreciated.
