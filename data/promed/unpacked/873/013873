PED-Positive Submissions: Half of New Cases in North Carolina
-------------------------------------------------------------
[In the USA,] the total number of swine accessions and diagnostic case submissions testing positive for the porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus is now 724, according the latest figures reported by the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV) from the USDA lab network dated 9 Oct [2013].

By farm class, this figure for the total number of swine accessions/diagnostic case submissions breaks down as follows between the weeks of 15 Apr and 29 Sep [2013]: suckling, 131 (up 8); nursery, 102 (up 8); grower/finisher, 257 (up 11); sows/boars, 128 (up 6) and 101 (up 7) unknown. The total is up 40 from a week ago.

Once again, no new states reported a positive result in the last week, so the total affected remains at 17. Those states with 10 or more positive tests are: Iowa, 196; Oklahoma, 170; North Carolina, 95; Kansas, 87; Minnesota, 47; Colorado, 27; Indiana, 26; Ohio, 16; and Pennsylvania, 14. Of these states, North Carolina again reported the highest number of new positive results at 19.

For the week 29 Sep to 5 Oct [2013], North Carolina accounts for the most new positive tests (19 out of the total of 40), but there is no clear development in terms of pig age affected there or in other states.

In mid-June [2013], the reporting system was adjusted. For the weeks prior to 16 Jun [2013], laboratories were able to provide diagnostic case submissions as well as the number of premises testing positive for PEDv. Since 16 Jun, the data refer only to diagnostic cases submissions ("swine accessions").

From the week of 16 Jun to week of 29 Sep [2013], the total number of swine samples testing positive is 1919, up from 1750 the previous week (up 169). The most-affected states are: Oklahoma, 520; North Carolina, 456; Kansas, 433; Iowa, 180; Colorado, 79; Minnesota, 78; Ohio, 71; and Indiana, 26. Other states, where positive, reported 20 positives or fewer.

In the most recent week reported (week of 29 Sep 2013), the following states reported one or more positive results: Colorado (5), Iowa (16), Kansas (7), Minnesota (13), North Carolina (90), Oklahoma (18), Pennsylvania (2), Texas (10), and 8 unknown.

The total number of environmental samples testing positive for PEDv has been reported weekly since the week of 16 Jun [2013]. The total has reached 429, which is 63 more than the previous week's figure. The totals for each state are as follows (with the increase in parentheses): Colorado, 14 (no increase); Iowa, 38 (up 3); Kansas, 53 (up 5); Minnesota, 100 (up 46); North Carolina, 8 (up 6); Ohio, 6 (no increase); Oklahoma 157 (up 3); Pennsylvania, 1 (no increase); South Dakota, 1 ( no increase); Virginia, 2 (no increase); unknown, 49(no increase).

[Readers are encouraged to visit the source URL. There are some very nice graphs providing a visual representation of the figures mentioned above. The incidence of this disease has been increasing. The question remaining before us is whether or not the disease incident numbers will climb in the cold weather.
