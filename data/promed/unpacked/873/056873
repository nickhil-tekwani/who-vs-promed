Ebola has resurfaced in Ivory Coast for the 1st time in 25 years, health officials said, after an 18-year-old woman from neighboring Guinea tested positive for the hemorrhagic fever in the nation's bustling commercial capital, Abidjan.

It is the 1st Ebola case in a major West African city since 2016. It comes about 2 months after Guinea declared the end of an outbreak that killed 12 people this year [2021] in the country and as 3rd waves of the coronavirus pummel hospitals across the region.

"It is of immense concern that this outbreak has been declared in Abidjan, a metropolis of more than 4 million people," Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's regional director for Africa, said in a statement. "However, much of the world's expertise in tackling Ebola is here on the continent."

It's unclear whether the Ivory Coast case is linked to the last epidemic, which started in February [2021] in Guinea's forested southeast -- the same region where the deadliest wave of Ebola on record erupted. That 2014-2016 outbreak killed more than 11 300 people, mostly across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

Health leaders in West Africa say they know how to manage the menace. Thousands of Ebola vaccine doses are on the way from Guinea, officials said late Saturday [14 Aug 2021], and health workers -- as well as people suspected to have come into contact with Ebola cases -- will receive the 1st shots.

Ivory Coast's Health Ministry said investigators are rushing to trace contracts but did not specify how many people are thought to have interacted with the young patient, who entered the country by road Wednesday [11 Aug 2021] from Labe, the 2nd-largest city in Guinea, before seeking medical help the next day [12 Aug 2021] in Abidjan.

"This is an isolated and imported case," Health Minister Pierre Dimba said in a statement.

Ebola's origin remains a mystery, but researchers suspect it probably came from bats. One of the flying mammals in Liberia tested positive for the virus in 2019.

Ivory Coast last faced Ebola in 1994, when a scientist investigating primate deaths in the Tai Forest caught the virus after conducting an autopsy on a chimpanzee, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient received treatment in Switzerland and recovered.

Scientists warn that the world will see more battles with lethal disease as deforestation pushes humans closer to animals. Another Ebola outbreak emerged this year [2021] in Congo.

Up to 90% of Ebola patients died in previous outbreaks, but health officials say chances of survival are better than ever with the rise of effective treatments. The scourge spreads mainly through body fluids.

Guinea has yet to uncover other Ebola cases. Last week, the nation reported the region's 1st brush with Marburg virus, another hemorrhagic fever with fatality rates of up to 88%, depending on the strain.

The government has ordered 155 people into 3 weeks of quarantine.

The Ministry of Health of Cote d'Ivoire today [Sat 14 Aug 2021] confirmed the country's 1st case of Ebola since 1994. This came after the Institut Pasteur in Cote d'Ivoire confirmed the Ebola virus disease in samples collected from a patient who was hospitalized in the commercial capital of Abidjan, after arriving from Guinea. Initial investigations found that the patient had travelled to Cote d'Ivoire by road and arrived in Abidjan on 12 Aug [2021]. The patient was admitted to a hospital after experiencing a fever and is currently receiving treatment.

Guinea experienced a 4-month-long Ebola outbreak, which was declared over on 19 Jun 2021. There is no indication that the current case in Cote d'Ivoire is linked to the earlier outbreak in Guinea. Further investigation and genomic sequencing will identify the strain and determine if there is a connection between the 2 outbreaks.

This year [2021], Ebola outbreaks have been declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea, but it is the 1st time an outbreak has occurred in a large capital city such as Abidjan since the 2014-2016 West Ebola outbreak.

"It is of immense concern that this outbreak has been declared in Abidjan, a metropolis of more than 4 million people," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. "However, much of the world's expertise in tackling Ebola is here on the continent, and Cote d'Ivoire can tap into this experience and bring the response to full speed. The country is one of the 6 that WHO has supported recently to beef up their Ebola readiness, and this quick diagnosis shows preparedness is paying off."

WHO is helping to coordinate cross-border Ebola response activities, and 5000 Ebola vaccines doses, which the organization helped secure to fight the outbreak in Guinea, are now being transferred to Cote d'Ivoire, following an agreement between the ministries of health of Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea. An aircraft is departing Abidjan soon to collect the vaccines, which will be used to vaccinate people at high risk, including health workers, first responders, and contacts of confirmed cases.

WHO staff based in Cote d'Ivoire are supporting the investigation into the case. In addition, a multidisciplinary team of WHO experts covering all key response areas will be deployed rapidly to the field. They will help with ramping up infection prevention and control of health facilities, diagnostics, contact tracing, treatment, and reaching out to communities to ensure they take a key role in the response.

Cote d'Ivoire declared the outbreak in line with International Health Regulations, and WHO does not advise any travel restrictions to and from the country.

While countries are focused on the COVID-19 response, they should strengthen their preparedness for potential Ebola cases.

While Cote d'Ivoire borders Guinea and Liberia, which were struck hard by the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, the country has had no confirmed cases reported since 1994, when an outbreak among chimpanzees infected a scientist.

Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks. There is now effective treatment available, and if patients receive treatment early, as well as supportive care, their chances of survival improve significantly.

[A map of West Africa that Robert Garry kindly provided (but unfortunately cannot be reproduced here) shows the "location of the 2021 Marburg and Ebola cases. The area is a spillover zone... Lassa also is endemic in the area." The dates and cases are listed as follows:

Marburg: 1 Aug 2021 Gueckedou 1 case, 1 death
Ebola: 13 Dec 2020 Gueckedou 23K cases, 11K deaths
Ebola: Abidjan 11 Aug 2021 Ebola virus in a traveler by road from Labe, Guinea
Ebola: Goueche 14 Feb 2021 21 cases/12 deaths
Tai Forest virus: 1994 1 case/0 deaths

There are 5 subtypes of Ebola viruses: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest (formerly known as Cote d'Ivoire), and Reston, each named after the location in which it was first identified. The 1st 3 subtypes have been associated with large Ebolavirus disease [EVD] outbreaks in Africa. The Reston subtype is found in the Western Pacific, and although it is highly pathogenic in nonhuman primates, it is not known to cause illness in humans. Marburg virus (named after the city in Germany in which it was first discovered) is another member of the Filovirus family that also causes hemorrhagic fever. Earlier this month [August 2021], on "6 Aug 2021, the Ministry of Health of Guinea informed WHO of a confirmed case of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in Gueckedou prefecture, Nzerekore region, southwestern Guinea. The village where the case resided is near both Sierra Leone and Liberian borders. This is the 1st known case of Marburg virus disease in Guinea and in West Africa" (see Marburg virus disease - Guinea (02): (GU) conf, WHO 20210811.858593).

The virus in the case reported here was likely imported from Guinea and detected in Cote d'Ivoire. It is reported as Ebola, but the subtype has not been reported. The city in Cote d'Ivoire, Abidjan, is on the southern Atlantic coast in West Africa. It's the country's major urban center.

The Ebola outbreak that emerged in Guinea in mid-February 2021 was declared over 19 Jun 2021. But one must be concerned that there may be undetected activity in Guinea that infected this woman, or possibly sexual transmission of Ebola that has remained in the testes of a partner. Sequencing will identify Ebola subtype and possibly origin.

See Formenty P, Hatz C, Le Guenno B, et al. Human infection due to Ebola virus, subtype Cote d'Ivoire: clinical and biologic presentation. J Infect Dis. 1999;179 Suppl 1: S48-53. doi: 10.1086/514285. PMID: 9988164. The abstract follows:

Abstract
"In November 1994 after 15 years of epidemiologic silence, Ebola virus reemerged in Africa and, for the 1st time, in West Africa. In Cote d'Ivoire, a 34-year-old female ethologist was infected while conducting a necropsy on a wild chimpanzee. Eight days later, the patient developed a syndrome that did not respond to antimalarial drugs and was characterized by high fever, headache, chills, myalgia, and cough. The patient had abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and a macular rash and was repatriated to Switzerland. The patient suffered from prostration and weight loss but recovered without sequelae. Laboratory findings included aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activity highly elevated, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and, subsequently, neutrophilia. A new subtype of Ebola was isolated from the patient's blood on days 4 and 8. No serologic conversion was detected among contact persons in Cote d'Ivoire (n = 22) or Switzerland (n = 52), suggesting that infection-control precautions were satisfactory."

Abstract
"An outbreak of Ebola in nature is described for the 1st time. During a few weeks in November 1994, approximately 25% of 43 members of a wild chimpanzee community disappeared or were found dead in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. A retrospective cohort study was done on the chimpanzee community. Laboratory procedures included histology, immunohistochemistry, bacteriology, and serology. Ebola-specific immunohistochemical staining was positive for autopsy tissue sections from one chimpanzee. Demographic, epidemiologic, and ecologic investigations were compatible with a point-source epidemic. Contact activities associated with a case (e.g., touching dead bodies or grooming) did not constitute significant risk factors, whereas consumption of meat did. The relative risk of meat consumption was 5.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-21.1). A similar outbreak occurred in November 1992 among the same community. A high mortality rate among apes tends to indicate that they are not the reservoir for the disease causing the illness. These points will have to be investigated by additional studies."
