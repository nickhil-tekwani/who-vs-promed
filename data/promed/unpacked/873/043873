In 4 days the [number] of suspected St Louis encephalitis [SLE]
[virus infections] has increased to 16, but the San Juan Public Health
Epidemiology unit stated that these are not [laboratory] confirmed
cases. Diario Huarpe [provincial online news] stated in a note that in
addition to these 16 cases, there are 5 people infected by the virus
and they were [publicly] announced last week [week of 28 Mar 2011].

The head of the Vector Control Program, Ruben Carrizo Paez, stated
that fumigation will be carried out over 9 blocks around the houses in
which suspected cases of the disease are found.
