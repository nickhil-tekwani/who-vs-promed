SYPHILIS (2)
============
(In response to 15 March 1996 request by Kathleen Toomey for information
regarding possible interference between effect of illicit drugs and syphilis
serology)
No information of cocaine effects on blood tests, but many people with
darkfield positive chancres will not yet have developed positive serology.

[Moderator: This is a fascinating topic. I hope that anyone with information
(scientific observations) on possible effects of licit or illicit drug use on
serologic tests will comment--
