Comment on Case Fatality Rates in the Ugandan Outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
I feel compelled to comment on the case fatality rates that are
frequently quoted for the recent Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in
Uganda. A recent report mentioned that: "While in past Ebola
outbreaks up to 90 percent of victims died, Ugandan doctors and
international health experts have been able to save 60 percent of the
patients by using aggressive rehydration therapy."
We have to be careful to compare case fatality rates between epidemics
of the same strain. The epidemic in Uganda, caused by the Sudan
strain, should not be compared to the Kikwit epidemic caused by the
Zaire strain, which is considered more virulent and for which case
fatality rates are posted at up to 90%.
The Ugandan epidemic is more appropriately compared to the
outbreaks of the Ebola Sudan strain that occurred in Sudan in 1976 and
1979. These had case fatality rates in the 55-60% range.
We'll have to see how things look when we get all the data together, but
it's not clear that we've made big improvements in clinical care since
the 1970's. Preliminary data from one of the Ebola fever wards in Gulu
show a case fatality rate among confirmed cases of 58%.
Aggressive hydration certainly is important in treating Ebola fever, and
I don't doubt that it can, on occasion, save someone's life. While I
know that all of us involved in clinical care in Gulu did the best [we
could, Ebola fever can be a very aggressive disease. I wish that it was
otherwise, but I suspect that rehydration alone is unlikely to make a
huge difference in mortality.

Suggestions for Follow-up Studies
---------------------------------
With the apparent end of the Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in
Uganda and the high number of survivors, there seems to be an
opportunity to gain some valuable information regarding patient
responses. Has serum from patients been frozen? How about drawn
bloods from survivors to obtain serum samples for assays? Antibody
profiles, particularly allotype, isotype and epitope specificities could be
revealing.
I realize that working with these samples is risky, and use of the virus
as antigen(s) extremely so, yet the data may give us some important
epidemiologic data. If there is a particular protein/peptide that is
immunogenic in survivors -- as evidenced by antibody response as a
start -- this could, by DNA/amino acid sequence, provide a tool for
further study.
Studies of this nature may be ongoing and I hope the data will be made
available to the biomedical community at the earliest opportunity.

[Both preceding comments highlight some topics for post-outbreak
research and analysis. Those involved in the control and containment
of the outbreak deserve some respite from their labors in order to take
stock of the situation and to establish the immediate priorities. In the
meantime all those involved deserve our congratulations. - Mod.CP
