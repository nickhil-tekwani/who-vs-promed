OSELTAMIVIR CONTAMINATION, RIVERS - JAPAN (02): WASTEWATER

In the 3 Oct 2009 posting: "Oseltamivir contamination, rivers -
Japan," there is a reposting of a New Scientist story addressing a
paper in Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP) which confirms the
expectation that oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) does not readily
biodegrade in the wastewater, thus allowing it to reach receiving
rivers. This effectively means that virtually all the Tamiflu being
consumed either for seasonal or pandemic use will pass through humans
into wastewater treatment plants and into our rivers. Owing to the
huge amount of Tamiflu being consumed in the world at the moment,
this is likely to result huge quantities of OC in our rivers. This
scenario was 1st highlighted in a paper in EHP which predicted very
high concentrations of OC in several rivers within England and the UK
during an influenza pandemic
[<http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9574/abstract.html>].

One of the important questions that is raised by the presence of OC
in rivers is that OC might be able to reach drinking water. It
remains untested as to whether OC will be removed by drinking water
treatment. As much of our drinking water is extracted from rivers and
groundwater, this might be an important question to answer. But even
if OC is conserved in the treatment of drinking water, little of the
drug should reach the bloodstream, owing to its poor bioavailability.
Tamiflu is a prodrug and must be taken in the prodrug form to be
absorbed into the blood. It is in the liver where it gets converted
to OC and exhibits its antiviral properties. It remains untested
whether there will be any side-effects from ingesting the antiviral
as OC in relatively low concentration in drinking water, but one
might predict these side-effects might be rare. Another question to
ask is what effect widespread low-dose exposure to humans through
drinking water might have on the hastening of antiviral resistance.

The issue of OC release into the environment hastening antiviral
resistance has been addressed in a meeting report also in EHP, where
it was initially concluded that the problem of OC inducing viral
resistance in wildfowl was possible. However, it was deemed less
problematic than what would already be expected to occur in humans,
as the influenza virus can relatively easily generate resistance in
humans. Moreover, generation of Tamiflu resistance in an avian
influenza virus (while in wildfowl) would also require the relatively
rare event of a species jump (i.e., wildfowl to humans) to become a
serious problem for humans. This conclusion is still being debated;
it should be noted that to date I'm not aware of any research having
been conducted to understand the possible impact of OC on avian
influenza and wildfowl.

I think we are moving towards a point when wastewater will need to be
treated in a very different way from how we have in the past (and
present). It is inevitable that society will need to devise ways of
conserving water by recycling our wastewater. To do this, we will
need to develop technologies to remove pharmaceuticals and all the
other persistent anthropogenic chemicals in the waste stream. This is
no small task and requires a huge amount of investment. Even if we
are slower on the idea of recycling our water, we will need to
improve the quality of our rivers to comply with new legislation,
e.g. the EU Water Framework Directive, and one avenue towards
achieving this is better wastewater treatment technology. Removal of
pharmaceuticals will also address the issue of estrogens and
estrogen-mimicing chemicals constantly being released into our
rivers, which is an immediate concern and has been for quite some
time. Innovation in wastewater treatment could "save many birds with
one stone."
