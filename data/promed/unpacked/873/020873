The Agriculture Department in Lata in the eastern Solomon Islands
province of Temotu is investigating the sudden deaths of dozens of
chickens on Santa Cruz Island.

The department has so far received reports that 40 chickens in a
dozen different villages have died suddenly.

A spokesman for the department, Titus Nume, says they have put in
place quarantine measures to contain the unknown disease.

Mr. Nume says it's the 1st time there has been such an outbreak
around the island and that they have sought additional expertise from
Honiara to try and isolate it.

[This article does not provide enough detail to speculate upon which
of the numerous avian diseases this could be.

The location of the Solomon Islands is south of the equator; they are
entering the autumn season, so there is a temptation to speculate on
avian flu, but there are other virulent diseases capable of killing
poultry rapidly.

If quarantine measures have been initiated, then it is likely that
samples have been sent for diagnosis. We look forward to an
authoritative report regarding these poultry deaths. - Mod.TG]
