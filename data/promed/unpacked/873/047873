EFSA recommends Member States carry out analyses on life patterns of
bluetongue virus vectors
------------------------
The European Commission asked [question EFSA-Q-2007-201] the Animal
Health and Welfare Panel (AHAW) of the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) to deliver advice on bluetongue with specific reference to the
overwintering of the bluetongue virus and the measures that can be
used to protect animals against attacks by vectors.

The Panel said that, although no single mechanism has been found to
be responsible for the survival of the bluetongue virus through
winter, infected _Culicoides_ midges remain the most likely way.

Although recent data showed that in different geographical areas
across Europe some _Culicoides_ midges may remain active indoors
through winter, the role of these insects in prolonging the
transmission period of the virus is still not clear. The Panel
concluded that in some geographical areas in Europe there may not be
an absolute vector-free period.

The Panel added that more information is needed on the daylight and
indoor winter activities of _Culicoides_ and on their ability to
spread the disease. Experts therefore recommended that Member States
carry out in-depth analyses at regional level, since the life pattern
of these insects may vary depending on location and season.

The opinion also reviewed data on the effectiveness of insecticides
as one of the measures to protect animals against attacks from
vectors. The Panel said insecticides may be used to limit the
population of _Culicoides_ and their biting rates, thereby reducing
the risk of subsequent bluetongue virus transmission; however, they
should not be used as a stand-alone measure to protect animals
against _Culicoides_ attacks.

By September 2008, the Panel will also deliver an additional opinion
specifically on the risks linked to the transit of animals through
bluetongue-infected areas.

Bluetongue: scientific opinion of the Panel on Animal Health and
Welfare -- summary
------------------
Following a request from the European Commission (DG SANCO), the
Panel on Animal Health and Welfare was asked to deliver a scientific
opinion on bluetongue (BT) virus (BTV). The Commission required an
update of previous EFSA scientific opinions on bluetongue, as
regards:

i) vector ecology and criteria for the determination of the seasonally
free period;
ii) any new scientific information as regards the overwintering
mechanisms of the BT virus and the length of viraemia of all BTV
serotypes relevant to the EU situation;
iii) scientific advice on the effectiveness and suitability of
insecticides and repellents for _Culicoides_ species, and
iv) scientific advice on the different measures that can be used to
protect animals against attacks by vectors.

As far as vector ecology is concerned, outbreaks of BTV-8 and BTV-1
have occurred in the last 2 years in Europe outside the geographical
range of _C. imicola_, demonstrating that northern Palaearctic [see
comment at end] species of _Culicoides_ are able to transmit BTV. To
date, the specific vector(s) of BTV in these areas have not been
identified, although strong circumstantial evidence implicates members
of the Obsoletus complex, _C. dewulfi_, _C. chiopterus_ and the
Pulicaris complex as the most likely candidates. Laboratory testing
for vector competence should be carried out, where possible, in
parallel with field-based testing. Analyses of the vector competence
of particular species should be conducted with reference not only to
the ability of the vector to become infected by, replicate and
transmit the virus but also to its wider ecological requirements (that
is, its vector capacity), which may vary with region and season.

There is clear evidence of indoor activity (including blood feeding)
of the _Culicoides_ vector species, especially during winter time,
which may extend the seasonal activity of such species when outdoor
activity is absent by an, as yet, undefined period. This has been
mostly suggested by comparing indoor and outdoor light trap captures.
To date, no clear scientific evidence has been reported concerning
the role of adult _Culicoides_ surviving inside stables in prolonging
the transmission period of BTV. Further, the period of survival of
such adults inside premises is also unknown.

No single mechanism has been demonstrated to be responsible for the
overwintering of BTV in northern Europe. Year-round presence of
infected _Culicoides_ remains the most likely although transplacental
transmission cannot be excluded. Due to geographical and inter-annual
variations in _Culicoides_ activity, systematic and extensive
entomological monitoring is advised to be implemented for detection
of overwintering adults. Analysis of the parous females captured
during winter time is recommended in order to detect BTV infected
individuals. This analysis is recommended to be coordinated across
Europe as numbers are likely to be extremely small. The survival
rates of adults _Culicoides_ at lower temperatures is recommended to
be further investigated under laboratory conditions. In order to
understand better the current distribution of the species included in
the Obsoletus complex, it is recommended to perform coordinated
European surveys involving molecular identification of Obsoletus
complex females to species level. In addition, the routine
identification of males from these complexes is also advised to
develop a clearer picture of each species distribution. These data
should be made available in the centralised EU database (BT-Net).

Due to the importance of defining the seasonal pattern of the
_Culicoides_ vector species, their monitoring on a year-round basis
using permanent sampling sites is recommended. It is also important
to link data obtained from entomological sampling with data obtained
from the serological data of BTV surveillance programmes. A
harmonisation of the above entomological monitoring programmes across
Europe is recommended for a better assessment of the annual seasonal
pattern, including age grading of females, the likely total absence
of adults during winter and the first detection of _Culicoides_
activity the following season. Further research is recommended in
order to estimate the relevance of the indoor and daylight activity
in either the extension or reduction of the seasonal pattern of the
different vector _Culicoides_ species. Indoor and daylight activities
should be defined and standardized for research purposes.

The current definition of the Seasonally Vector-Free Period (SVFP)
was based on the epidemiological situation of certain areas in Europe
for certain serotypes and certain species of vectors. The importance
of some species (that is, _C. dewulfi_, _C. chiopterus_, _C.
pulicaris_ and the Obsoletus complex) implicated in the transmission
of the BTV was not specifically included in the current definition.
Recent data demonstrate that some _Culicoides_ species, in some
geographical areas in Europe are active to a greater or lesser extent
throughout the year and that an absolute vector free period may not
exist. However, there are periods of the year when the abundance of
the _Culicoides_ vector species is very low, mainly coinciding with
winter time, and long-standing practical experience demonstrates that
transmission of BTV is substantially reduced or halted during these
periods. Improved and harmonized methods to monitor and quantify
vector activity are required to support the development of criteria
that more accurately define periods of low vector abundance,
especially those relevant to BTV transmission. It is recommended that
each MS develops comprehensive BTV surveillance systems, integrating
local vector abundance and BT incidence data, to establish more
accurately the Vector Activity Threshold (VAT) required for virus
transmission in their area. The VAT should be obtained by using an
annual monitoring programme based on _Culicoides_ adult capture with
UV light traps placed outside stables or animal housing.
Harmonization of the different vector monitoring programmes across
Europe is recommended to establish the minimum requirements for the
accurate assessment of VAT. Pending additional studies, it is
recommended that all suspect and confirmed vector species be
considered equally capable of transmitting all BTV serotypes. The
analysis of age grading of captured _Culicoides_ females is
recommended to be carried out for the establishment of VAT.

In regard to the overwintering mechanisms and the duration of BTV
viraemia, recent data from BTV infections of ruminants regardless of
serotype (including serotype 8) do not show that duration of viraemia
as indicated by virus isolation or RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction], is different from that already described
in the previous EFSA Report. Importantly, the central finding of the
previous EFSA Report is confirmed that animals remain RT-PCR positive
after they no longer circulate infectious virus, so PCR-positive
status and viraemia are not synonymous. Transmission of field strains
of BTV serotype 8 from dam to progeny amongst ruminants in northern
Europe has been demonstrated in both field and experimental studies.
However, the role of vertical infection of foetal or neonatal
ruminants in the epidemiology of BTV-8 infection, including any role
in virus overwintering, is currently uncertain. Field investigations
of natural BTV-8 infections of pregnant animals are required to
reliably establish the role of vertical infection, if any, in the
natural transmission cycle.

Regarding the measures that can be used to protect animals against
attacks by vectors, insecticides may be used to limit the population
of _Culicoides_ and their biting rates, thereby reducing the risk of
sequential BTV transmission. Historical testing of toxicity worldwide
has demonstrated that pyrethroid-based products are more effective in
the laboratory against _Culicoides_ than organophosphate-based
products. Hence, the use of the former is preferred except where
other issues (environmental impact and legislation) preclude it.
However, pyrethroid-based insecticides should not be used as a
stand-alone measure to protect animals against _Culicoides_ attacks.
A common result after treatment with pour-on formulations or ear tags
was the decreasing insecticidal efficacy from the back line to the
belly and legs of treated animals. This is related to the limited
spread of the insecticide and is common to topically applied products
of non-systemic activity. Dipping products have not been assessed to
date for this role in Europe. Systemic products have also not been
assessed, but based on past experience, are unlikely to be useful for
lowering _Culicoides_ population levels thereby preventing BTV
transmission on a significant scale. No new data have been provided
regarding the treatment of housing or transport for animals.
Treatment of breeding sites remains difficult as habitats are poorly
defined for most species.

Studies should be carried out in a proper manner to actually
correlate the use of insecticides with the magnitude of the decrease
of the risk of BTV transmission in treated animals. No insecticidal
products are currently authorised specifically against _Culicoides_
in the EU although a wide range of untested products are available.
In the absence of any valid data on the efficacy and safety of
veterinary medicinal products or biocidal product for the control of
_Culicoides_, no treatment protocols have been formally approved in
the EU for specifically protecting animals against _Culicoides_
attacks. When using substances authorised for other indications or
claims (such as, against nuisance flies), label instructions use
should be followed. When using veterinary medicinal products under
the "cascade," a standard withdrawal period of at least 28 days for
meat and 7 days for milk must be applied, when the product is used in
another animal species, or, when the dosing instructions in the
product literature are not followed in the target species. All use of
chemical treatments should be carefully assessed with regard to
environmental impact, user risk, and the potential for development of
resistance in _Culicoides_ populations.
