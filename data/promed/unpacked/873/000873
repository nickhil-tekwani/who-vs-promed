[According to the OIE WAHIS database, England faced problems with
this disease from February to June in 2008. Since the disease is
transmitted sexually, tracing the disease out to all potentially
infected animals to determine status in the animals and their
respective herds can be a challenge as the current outbreak in the
United States demonstrates -- out of 986 horses involved in the
outbreak, 823 have completed the cycle of testing, treatment and
being declared negative.
