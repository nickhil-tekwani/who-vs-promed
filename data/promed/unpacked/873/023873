An additional 20 cases of pertussis were confirmed last week by Olmsted County Public Health, matching the highest weekly number since the local health department activated its emergency response team on [23 May 2016]. [The city of Rochester, Minnesota is the Olmsted County seat and home to Mayo Medical School and the Mayo Clinic.]

The new recent cases bring Olmsted County's 2016 total to 173, which is by far the most in Minnesota and the highest local level since the 2012 outbreak. Hennepin County [where Minneapolis is located] had the 2nd highest annual total in the state with 62, according to the [30 Jun 2016] report from Minnesota Department of Health; a new state report is expected to be released next week.

While more than half of the state has reported zero pertussis cases, Olmsted County has nearly matched Hennepin's total for 3 straight months, including 52 in May, 46 in June and 58 so far in July [2016].

"Pertussis spreads through the air when a person who is contagious with pertussis coughs or sneezes and exposes others close[by]," said Pete Giesen, director of Olmsted County Public Health. "Although the cough can last more than 100 days, a person is no longer spreading it after the 3rd week or after 5 days of taking antibiotics, which is why it is so important to follow the guidance to prevent further transmission."

The local health department says that the pertussis outbreak continues to impact day cares, youth camps and sporting groups. After just 7 cases were counted between [11-17 Jul 2016], that number nearly tripled to dash hopes that the outbreak was subsiding.

Pertussis, which is also called whooping cough, mimics the common cold for about a week before symptoms worsen. Coughing often comes in uncontrollable fits that can cause vomiting and is often marked by a whooping-like noise. It's highly contagious and most commonly found in teenagers, but it's considered especially dangerous for infants and the elderly.

Oklahoma sees increase in whooping cough as vaccination rate declines. State health officials cite waning immunity and decisions to opt out of vaccinations.

Oklahoma has seen an increase this year [2016] in the occurrence of pertussis, or whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease that can cause serious illness in children and adults. Since [1 Jan 2016], Oklahoma has seen 70 confirmed cases of pertussis, compared to 86 confirmed cases for all of 2015, according to the state Health Department. "We don't know how the rest of the year is going to play out, and if we might end up with the same number of cases, but certainly going through the halfway point of the year so far, we have noted that we have seen more cases this year," said Laurence Burnsed, an epidemiologist at the Oklahoma Department of Health.

The agency's investigations of recent cases have identified several case clusters across Oklahoma among household members and contacts within close-knit community groups, such as day cares and schools, Burnsed said.
