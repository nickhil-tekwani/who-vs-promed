This is an update on the preliminary report [1] of an outbreak of
measles in Norway among a traveling community from England.
As of [13 Jun 2007], 15 cases have been reported. The outbreak is
currently confined to several families of Irish Travellers from
England who have had contact in 2 camping sites in Norway. Most of
them are now living in a campsite outside Trondheim in central
Norway. The date of onset of symptoms ranges from [27 Apr to 2 Jun
2007]. So far, 12 cases have been confirmed by PCR, IgM antibodies or
both. There are 11 female patients. Thirteen are children, all
unvaccinated and aged between 7 months and 9 years (2 less than one
year, 4 between one and 3 years, 6 between 4 and 5 years, and one
aged 9 years). The 2 other cases are unvaccinated adult members of
the Traveller families.
There are currently no indications that the outbreak has spread to
the indigenous population in Norway. Only one other case of measles,
imported from Pakistan, has been reported in Norway this year [2007].
The virus strain from one of the patients has been sequenced. It was
found to be a D4 strain closely matching the measles strain causing
the current outbreak among Irish Travellers in the UK [2].
Conclusions:
------------
The outbreak in Norway is clearly linked to the ongoing UK outbreak
[2]. The cases in Norway belong to the same community; at least one
of the cases visited a gathering of Irish Travellers in south-east
London on 3 Apr 2007, and the Norwegian outbreak strain closely
matches the UK one. It is too early to declare the outbreak over, so
we have to face the following public health challenges:
- Some of the Irish Travellers currently residing in Norway seem to
fly back and forth to England from time to time. This poses a risk of
exposure to infected Irish Travellers in England and subsequent
re-importation and vice versa, i.e. Travellers from Norway infecting
people in England.
- Some of the Irish Traveller families have now moved on from their
main camp site in Norway; their whereabouts are not known. Members of
these families may be incubating measles. There is a possibility of
further contact with non-immune people elsewhere in Norway or
neighboring countries and thus a risk of further spread of the
disease.
So far, several non-vaccinated contacts within the Traveller
community involved in the outbreak have been given the MMR vaccine.
The Traveller community has responded favorably to the Norwegian
health authorities' interventions.
On [14 Jun 2007], as this article was being prepared for publication,
a suspect case of measles (case no 16) with onset on [10 Jun 2007]
was notified to the Norwegian health authorities. The patient is an
Irish Traveller child who had recently moved from Trondheim to
Bergen, over 700 km away.

[Since the last report on this outbreak (see prior ProMED-mail posting
Measles - Norway ex UK (England) 20070525.1673), the number of cases
has increased from 6 to 15 (and possibly 16). As mentioned in the
above report, there is an ongoing outbreak in the UK among an Irish
traveller community with a similar strain of the D4 genotype (see
ProMED-mail post Measles - UK: Irish Traveller community 20070622.2019}.
The above article mentions the potential challenges to other
neighboring countries as well as other possible pockets of
susceptibles within Norway that are at risk of measles infection as a
result of the mobility of the affected population. The bigger
challenge is how to vaccinate migratory population groups that can
serve as efficient geographic spreaders of vaccine-preventable
diseases. - Mod.MPP]
