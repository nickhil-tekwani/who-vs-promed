An outbreak of deadly anthrax in the Northern Cape holds no risk to meat
consumers, and supermarkets are not at risk of selling contaminated meat.
And, although some of South Africa's meat suppliers are keeping an eye on
the outbreak in the Siyancuma Municipality and parts of Zimbabwe, there is
no cause for concern.

Two of the country's biggest supermarket chains, Spar and Shoprite, on
Wednesday [10 Dec 2008] said meat would remain on shelves and that there
was no information of any beef contamination. The assurance comes after the
national department of agriculture's veterinary services confirmed the
Northern Cape outbreak, saying 16 sheep and 3 blue wildebeest had died of
anthrax. The outbreak has been confined to a 1.5 km radius on a farm in the
Douglas (Siyancuma) region.

Group merchandising executive for the Spar group Mike Prentice said "big
suppliers" were not even mentioning a threat to food stocks. "We will keep
an eye open, and everyone is concerned about the situation. But no special
precautions are being taken at this stage," he said.

Sporadic outbreaks of anthrax are not uncommon, with the Northern Cape and
regions near the Kruger National Park being classified endemic anthrax
regions. Earlier this year [2008], the department again had to step in when
thousands of wild and domestic animals were killed by anthrax near
Campbell, 100 km from Kimberley. In that case, rain was blamed for helping
to spread the bacteria, _Bacillus anthracis_, which can also be passed on
to humans through consumption, the handling of contaminated skins or
inhalation of bacteria spores.

Agriculture officials have urged farmers to vaccinate their livestock
against anthrax. "We advise our farmers to vaccinate their livestock. We
also advise them and the community not to cut up dead animals, as these may
expose the bacteria. We believe that our system of information, education
and support to farmers and the community is enough to control the
outbreak," agriculture spokesperson Priscilla Tsotso Sehoole said.

[If the local livestock are at constant risk of anthrax overflowing from
the various parks, national and private, as it can just by livestock being
snuck into the parks for grazing or by haematophagic flies coming out
spreading this disease, it would behoove the authorities to do more than
just advise the livestock owners of the benefits of annual vaccination
against anthrax. Commercial herds, beef and dairy, that pass meat and milk
into the supermarkets do get vaccinated regularly and are therefore seldom
affected. The problem is the local herds run by villagers on common grazing
and such. Not only do they not vaccinate, but they are also at the highest
probability of acquiring human infections by butchering sick and dead
animals. The frequency of outbreaks in this province suggests that the
advice is unheeded. The optimum control is to prevent outbreaks rather than
to have to deal with them when they occur.
