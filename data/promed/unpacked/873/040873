The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has been found in an industrial area of Hayward. This mosquito is not native to California and has the potential to transmit several viruses not currently found here, including dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya.

_Aedes aegypti_ is a small (about 1/4 inch [7mm]), dark mosquito with white markings and banded legs. This particular type of mosquito may be active during dusk and dawn but most often bites during the day and often bites indoors.

The Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District has increased surveillance efforts for _Aedes aegypti_ throughout the county and is investigating the source of this introduction.

Door-to-door property inspections for mosquito breeding sources and treatments for larval mosquitoes have also been intensified in the area surrounding the _Aedes aegypti_ discovery. "Our primary goal is to eliminate this mosquito population so it does not spread," said District Manager Jan O. Washburn.

To assist in eradicating this mosquito and reduce the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes, Alameda County residents and visitors are urged to:
- Report mosquito bites received during the day or sightings of any mosquitoes matching the _Aedes aegypti_ description to the Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District.
- Apply insect repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535.
- Make sure that doors and windows have tight fitting screens that are in good repair to keep out mosquitoes.
- Eliminate standing water and containers that can hold water from around the house.
- Check for hidden bodies of water, such as wells, septic tanks, manholes, and clogged drains.
- Get FREE mosquito fish for ornamental ponds, water features, and horse troughs from the Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District.
- Clean and scrub birdbaths, ornamental fountains, plant saucers, and pet water dishes at least weekly.
- Maintain swimming pools or stock with mosquito fish.
- This type of mosquito has now been found in 10 California counties, including San Mateo.

[This mosquito has been found at several locations in California in the past 3 years. It is not clear whether the above and previous localities of detection of _Aedes aegypti_ are due to repeated introductions or whether there is spread to different locations within the state, or both. So far, there have been no reports that this mosquito has become permanently established. However, the risk of ongoing transmission of introduced viruses remains as long as this vector mosquito is present.

Travelers who have been infected with dengue and chikungunya viruses arrive in California with some frequency. Should _Aedes aegypti_ populations become established, there is a real risk of ongoing transmission initiated by an incoming viremic individual. However, these viruses may not become endemic in southern California because of screens and air conditioning, and especially because of effective vector control that most areas in California have. However, the risk remains for sporadic introduction of these viruses with limited outbreaks.

The 10 counties in California where _Ae. aegypti_ has been found over the past 3 years illustrate 2 critical points; (1) the importance of ongoing surveillance to detect their presence very early on while they are still geographically limited, and (2) rapid response by vector control officials and the public. One hopes that the eradication efforts are successful.
