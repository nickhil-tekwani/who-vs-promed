Europe Is Told It May Not Be Safe to Eat Fish, Either
-----------------------------------
PARIS: Just as worried Europeans are turning their backs on beef and
flocking to the fish counter, there is more bad news about dinner:
scientists have warned that they have found unacceptably high levels of
toxic industrial chemicals in the region's seafood.
Experts from the Scientific Committee for Food, in a report prepared for
the European Union, said fish both from fish farms and from the region's
seas are regularly contaminated by dioxins and similar toxins.
Fish oil and fish meal have the highest levels of these chemicals, the
panel said. Dioxins, which are produced as a waste product by industrial
plants and waste incineration, have been linked to hormone changes, cancer
in animals and other severe disorders.
The scientists also called for changes in the levels of dioxin considered
acceptable for human consumption.
"Nobody is saying we can't eat fish anymore, but consumers must be made
aware that fish contributes significantly to the intake of dioxins," said
Johan Reyniers, a European Union spokesman. This is particularly true, he
said, for fish from the more polluted areas like the North Sea and the
Baltic around Scandinavia.
Mr. Reyniers said Europeans can eat fish in moderation, but "if you eat
fish every day, you are likely to have a problem."
The warning about fish comes as Europeans are already panicking about the
spread of mad cow disease and the consumption of beef is dropping
drastically. With more and more cases of sick cows and infected people in
Europe, agriculture ministers this month decided that large numbers of
suspect cattle must be destroyed and that feed laced with animal products
will be banned.
They have not suspended the use of fish oil or fish meal. But European
officials said that early next year, when the governments debate the new
dioxin findings, these are likely to produce more pressure to reduce
pollutants as fast as possible.
Dioxins were included in the global ban that was negotiated this month by
representatives from 122 nations, but specialists said it would take time
for countries to carry out the provisions of the treaty, which is to be
signed in May. The ban will affect dioxins and a dozen other toxic,
long-lasting chemicals -- "persistent organic pollutants" -- that are
recognized as a threat to the environment, and to human health in particular.
In Northern Europe, the dioxin fallout from combustion has already been
reduced by about half since the 1980's, but lawmakers are now expected to
demand more stringent measures because the new report has confirmed the
troubling buildup of dioxins in the food chain. Once absorbed by animals,
dioxins are trapped in fatty tissues. People consume them in fish, meat
and milk products.
According to the new report, fish meal and fish oils of European origin
have dioxin levels up to 8 times as high as similar products from
nonindustrial regions, like the waters off Peru and Chile. The fish meal
and fish oil also contain up to 10 times more dioxin than is found in meat
and eggs. This is troubling because the fish meal is used in the diets of
farmed fish and other food animals like chickens and pigs. Dioxins are
also found at higher levels in carnivore fish, like salmon, eel and trout,
than in herbivores, the scientists said.
The new report by the Scientific Committee on Food, and a second one by the
Committee on Animal Nutrition, are not binding on the European Union
countries, but their opinions are generally treated seriously. The studies
were made at the request of the European Union after a scare last year,
when Belgian animal feed was found to be laced with dioxins as a result of
a factory mix-up.
Responding to complaints that food safety standards are too lax all over
Europe, the European Union ordered a wide study of dioxin contamination of
food and feed.
If stricter limits for dioxins are set next year, related legislation is
expected to provoke opposition from the strong fishery lobbies in North
European countries, which have a sizable fish-meal industry. Europe
produces 500 000 tons of fish meal a year.
Solutions may include removing the dioxins from the fish meal or replacing
the feed with soy meal. Users argue that soy meal is a less effective feed
because of its lower protein content.

Commission Scientific opinions on dioxin in feed and food:
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/health_consumer/library/press/press86_en.html>

The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and the Scientific Committee on
Animal Nutrition (SCAN) have today published opinions on the contamination
of food products and animal feed by dioxins and closely related
PCBs. Given the persistent nature of these compounds the SCF has
established a temporary tolerable weekly intake (t-TWI) of 7 picogram
equivalents per kilogram body weight for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. The
main conclusion of the SCAN is that fish oil and fishmeal are the most
heavily contaminated feed materials. Both the SCAN and the SCF recommend
an integrated approach to reduce dioxin contamination all along the food
chain, a continuing reduction of the emissions to the environment, and more
systematic and coordinated generation and collection of comparable and
reliable data.
The European Commission has been actively working towards a comprehensive
strategy to deal with dioxin contamination in food and has asked for both
scientific opinions as part of that process. The Feira European Council of
June this year asked the Commission to propose harmonised rules on
contaminants. Today's scientific opinions form the key scientific input to
the development of this strategy. Based on these scientific opinions the
Commission will be consulting with Member States in the near future with a
view to bringing forward legislative proposals early in 2001.

[Readers are referred to last year's postings on the dioxin contamination
of meat and poultry through contaminated feed and the international
response. The SCF and SCAN reports on dioxin limits are very detailed
reports for those interested in the exact science behind the NY Times article:
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/out78_en.pdf>
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scan/out55_en.pdf>
The SCF report concludes "Wild fish and farmed freshwater fish exhibit mean
contamination levels in the order of 10 pg I-TEQ/g, lipid basis, for
dioxins and 30 pg PCB-TEQ/g, lipid basis, for dioxin-like PCBs: the 3-fold
difference of the means appears to reflect a consistently higher
contamination from PCBs. The recorded contamination ranges in fish span
over 2 (for dioxin-like PCBs) to 3 (for dioxins) orders of magnitude." It
also points out that "...a dioxin cut-off value of 2 pg I-TEQ/g, lipid
basis, would keep on the market 95 percent of the eggs, almost 95 percent
of the milk (and its products), and almost 95 percent of the meat.
However, it would keep most of the fish and fish products out of the market."
The SCAN report concludes that "Fish meal and fish oil are the most heavily
contaminated feed materials with products of European fish stocks
(respective means (for dioxins only) of 1.2 and 4.8ng WHO-TEQ/kg DM) more
heavily contaminated than those from South Pacific stock (Chile, Peru,
respective means (for dioxins only) 0.14 and 0.61ng WHO-TEQ/kg DM) by a
factor of ca 8." While the article above focuses on the impact of dioxin
contamination of fish as a food source for humans, the more detailed
reports focus on the impact of the contamination of the fish oil and fish
meal, which are used for feeding animals (cattle, pigs, and in some cases
poultry). Hence, the dioxin contamination of fish also has implications in
contamination of meat and poultry. - Mod.MPP
