Outbreak of enteroviral meningitis among high school students in
British Columbia ex Dominican Republic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Sat 8 Apr 2010, a high school student from the lower mainland of
British Columbia was hospitalized with signs and symptoms consistent
with meningitis after returning from a student trip to the Dominican
Republic. The trip was organized through a social networking site.
Approximately 200 Grade 11 and 12 students departed Vancouver on 25
Mar 2010 and returned on 2 Apr 2010. Students were predominantly from
high schools in the Vancouver region, although some participants were
from schools in Ontario and Quebec.

In total, 23 students were reported as having presented to physician
offices or emergency rooms between 6 Apr and 25 Apr 2010 with
symptoms including fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and sore neck. 5
were hospitalized for a period of 2 to 10 days. Severity of symptoms
varied substantially, but all students recovered. We undertook an
aggressive laboratory search for the etiology given the serious
illness being seen in the affected students and the continued spread
to non-traveler contacts. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from
3 patients and tested for bacterial and viral agents of meningitis.
All culture and PCR tests for bacterial meningitis and herpes simplex
virus were negative. CSF samples were positive for enterovirus by
RT-PCR in 2 of the 3 cases. A stool sample from one of the cases was
also positive for enterovirus by RT-PCR.

Cases were 14 to 18 years old and most were males from the same high
school. 7 cases presenting from 6 to 13 Apr 2010 had participated in
the trip to the Dominican Republic. These included 2 hospitalized
cases, one of whom was positive for enterovirus in CSF and stool
samples. 16 cases who had not participated in the trip were reported
from 13 to 25 Apr 2010. Investigation of exposures revealed that
these were close contacts or schoolmates of cases who had travelled.

In particular, 8 cases were members of a sports team who attended a
game together on 10 Apr 2010. Among these, one case had travelled to
the Dominican Republic and reported sharing drinks with a team member
who subsequently was admitted to hospital and tested positive for
enterovirus in a CSF sample. 6 others were likely secondary or
tertiary transmissions within this group, and the remaining case was
reported at another game one week later.

Although not all students presenting with illness were found to have
symptoms of meningitis, they all had symptoms consistent with
enterovirus infection. Initially, a notice recommending ill students
to seek medical attention was sent to trip participants through the
social networking site. Prevention messages recommending
hand-washing, respiratory etiquette, avoiding contact with saliva and
staying home when ill were distributed to school districts and health
authorities on 9, 13 and 19 Apr 2010. At the school where most cases
attended, disinfection of commonly touched surfaces began on 19 Apr 2010.

This outbreak of meningitis generated considerable anxiety among the
trip participants and their parents particularly when the etiology
was unknown and early cases were treated empirically with
antibiotics. It highlights the need to be vigilant for clusters of
illness in travelers and the need to search for viral and other
causes of infection that may be endemic or circulating in the country
visited, as well as local pathogens.

[Meningitis is caused predominantly by microorganisms (bacteria,
viruses, parasites, and fungi). These microorganisms infect the blood
and the cerebrospinal fluid. Viral meningitis is generally less
severe and resolves without specific treatment. Viral meningitis
(also called aseptic meningitis) is an infection that causes
inflammation of the layers (meninges) that surround the brain and
spinal cord. Many different viruses can cause meningitis; the most
common are the enteroviruses. These viruses are present in the
intestines and can cause colds, sore throats, stomach upsets and
diarrhoea. Only rarely do these viruses spread through the body to
the meninges causing meningitis.

Enteroviruses are most often spread from person to person through
fecal contamination, and through respiratory secretions (saliva,
sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person. When an enterovirus
causing meningitis is identified, it is usually either a
coxsackievirus or an echovirus.

Individuals and parties visiting countries with less well-developed
economies and variable standards of personal and community hygiene
are likely to expose themselves to common enteric viruses to which
they have little preexisting immunity. This is evident in the party
of children from Canada visiting the Dominical Republic and spreading
infection in their home country on their return. Fortunately
enteroviral meningitis is a mild condition generally without serious outcomes.

ProMED-mail is indebted to Professor David Patrick for providing this
detailed account of the analysis of this outbreak. It would be useful
to know the precise identity (species of enterovirus) responsible for
this outbreak, if this information becomes available in due course.
