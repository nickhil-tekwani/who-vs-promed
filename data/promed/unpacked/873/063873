A newborn baby has died after contracting a rare killer bug at a neonatal unit in Glasgow [Scotland]. The premature baby -- who had existing complex medical problems -- died in the Neonatal Unit linked to the Royal Hospital for Children at the weekend [31 Oct 2015-1 Nov 2015].

Health board chiefs said a probe has been launched after the increase in cases of bacterial infection, _Serratia marcescens_. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Public Health Protection Unit and Infection Control Team are investigating.

5 other babies, who are currently in the same unit, have the _Serratia marcescens_ bacteria present in their bodies [that is colonization], but doctors stressed they are not giving any cause for concern. Another 7 babies, who are no longer in the hospital, were confirmed as having _Serratia marcescens_ colonization. Medical staff confirmed not all the cases involve the same strain of the organism. Investigations are continuing to establish if there are any links.

Alan Mathers, chief of medicine for Women and Children's Services, said: "Our deepest sympathies are with the family of the baby who has so sadly passed away. None of the 5 babies in the unit who are colonised are giving cause for concern as a result of the colonisation. _Serratia marcescens_ can be naturally occurring in the gut and its presence on or in the body (colonisation) is not harmful in healthy people. However given the vulnerability of premature babies, _Serratia marcescens_ infections, where the colonised bacteria get into the bloodstream, can occur."

Health board bosses said a "small increase" in _Serratia marcescens_ colonisation cases was identified in July [2015] and staff have been closely monitoring all colonisation cases since then. They said appropriate infection control procedures are in place and the situation continues to be monitored closely. _Serratia marcescens_ is an organism that occurs naturally in the gut. Mr Mathers added: "Since the increase in incidence of _Serratia marcescens_ colonisation cases was indentified as part of our routine surveillance we have been closely monitoring the situation in line with national guidance. Given that there are no other cases of infection and that all the appropriate infection control procedures are in place the unit will continue to admit new patients as normal. Our staff are in communication with the families to keep them fully informed."

[Serratia is a Gram negative bacillus and a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. _Serratia marcescens_ is the commonest clinical isolate of all the _Serratia_ species and the most important human pathogen.

Because of the ability of some strains of _S. marcescens_ to produce a red pigment (prodigiosin), and because of its presumed low virulence at the time, _S. marcescens_ was used as a biological marker to establish routes of infection. On several occasions _S. marcescens_ was used by the US military in biological warfare test experiments conducted on the general population that resulted in fatal infections in some of those exposed in the 1950s (http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1003703226697496080). Serratia is not normally part of the human flora and _S. marcescens_ has been increasingly recognized as an important pathogen, especially in healthcare settings and in adult and pediatric compromised patients (1). The organism is also known for its propensity to develop antimicrobial resistance. Colonized or infected patients represent the most important reservoir for cross transmission. In healthcare settings _S. marcescens_ can be found on the hands of healthcare workers and in food, sinks, respiratory and other hospital equipment. _S. marcescens_ has also caused NICU sepsis outbreaks due to contamination of intravenous (IV) fluids (see ProMED-mail post Serratia marcescens - Venezuela (02): (CA) NICU, fatal 20120417.1103584). Contaminated liquid soap used for handwashing has also been found to be a source in another NICU outbreak (2).

The respiratory tract, the genitourinary tract, intravascular devices, and surgical wounds are the commonest sites of _S. marcescens_ infection. _S. marcescens_ is a rare cause of meningitis and endocarditis. Genotyping of the isolates have been used to establish transmission pathways.
