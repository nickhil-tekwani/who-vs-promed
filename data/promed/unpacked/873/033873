Vietnam's southern Ho Chi Minh City has been stricken by foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD] in the last few days, according to local newspaper Vietnam
Economic Times on Tuesday [30 Jan 2007].
The disease broke out in Binh Chanh district, affecting a number of pigs.
The city's Veterinary Bureau has detoxicated [disinfected? culled? --
explanation will help. - Mod.AS] affected farms and vaccinated healthy
cattle against the disease.
However, the Department of Animal Health under the Vietnamese Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development has yet to announce outbreaks of FMD in
Ho Chi Minh City.
Now the disease has hit 23 communes in 14 districts in 8 provinces and one
city, affecting 655 bulls and buffaloes as well as 1724 pigs, said the
department.
Under a national agriculture development plan approved by the government in
2005, Vietnam will, by 2010, have 35-40 million pigs, 6.5-6.7 million bulls
and cows, 2.8-3 million buffaloes, and 380- 390 million poultry.

[Our last update on the Vietnamese FMD situation, archived 20070121.0282,
included the data of 8 FMD-infected Vietnamese provinces (in brackets,
their respective numbers on the
administrative map, available at
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>):
North Viet Nam: Cao Bang (19), Tuyen Quang (58), Phu Tho (43) and Yen Bai
(61; yet to be officially announced); South Viet Nam: Can Tho (18), Soc
Trang (50), Dong Thap (22) and Phu Yen (44).
According to the current newswire, a 9th province has been added; Ho Chi
Minh City is situated in South Viet Nam, shown as No 5 in the said map.
Viet Nam's last FMD update to the OIE was sent on 24 May 2006 (archived as
20060530.1510). It included information on the evolution of a massive FMD
epizootic: FMDV serotype O was reported to affect cattle, buffaloes and
swine in 330 communes, situated in 114 districts within 32 provinces. In
addition, FMDV of serotype Asia 1 reportedly infected the same animal
species in 19 communes situated in 6 districts within the province of Ha Giang.
Since May 2006, the disease remained active, but the number of affected
provinces allegedly decreased. On 30 Dec 2006, a Vietnamese newswire said
that 5 provinces were still affected. (see 20061231.3664).
In the absence of an official report since May 2006, the FMD situation in
Viet Nam remains unclear. This refers both to its geography as well as to
its epidemiology, including the identity (serotypes) of the circulating
virus. - Mod.AS]
