Clinical Presentation of West Nile Viral Infection
------------------------------------------------
The clinical presentation of the flavivirus group (West Nile, St. Louis
Encephalitis, Japanese Encephalitis and others) is one of three syndromes:
fever, fever with aseptic meningitis, or fever with encephalitis. West Nile
virus in the tropics characteristically causes a mild illness and most cases
present with fever associated with a macular and papular rash or a roseolar
(measles-like) rash of the upper body in about 50% of cases. In the tropics
West Nile virus infections can also cause a hepatitis.
For reasons that are not known the epidemics of West Nile encephalitis can
occur in temperate climates. In these cases it tends to be more severe and
more prone to epidemic spread.
Incubation period for the flavivirus encephalitides ranges from about 4 to
21 days, but usually it is about 1 - 2 weeks. The fever may be 40C or
higher and is associated with severe frontal headache, malaise,
gastrointestinal symptoms which can precede the fever by 1 - 3 days.
Conjunctival and pharyngeal hyperemia is common [blood-shot eyes & throat].
A wide variety of central nervous symptoms can be seen.

During the summer of 1996 an unusual clustering of meningoencephalitis cases
was recorded in the Capital City, Bucharest, and in some areas from
South-East Romania. After an initial suspicion of an enteroviral etiology
was discarded, West Nile etiology was confirmed by specific antibodies
demonstrated through hemagglutination-inhibition and ELISA tests.
This study included 251 patients with the diagnoses of West Nile acute
encephalitis (166 cases), acute meningitis (57 cases) and acute febrile
disease (33 cases). The patients' age ranged from 1 to 89 years (mean 51.1
years). The most frequent clinical manifestations were: fever (95.7% of
cases), cephalalgia [headache] (92.6%), stiffness of the neck (89.1%),
vomiting (62.5%), marked asthenia [weakness] (46.5%), myalgia [muscle
pain] (28.9%). In addition, patients with encephalitis exhibited: alteration
of consciousness (89.2% of cases), tremor of extremities (40.4%), ataxia
(44%), paralysis (15.1%).
The fatality rate was 15.1% in acute encephalitis, 1.8% in acute meningitis
and zero in the acute febrile disease.
