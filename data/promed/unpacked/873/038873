First Report of _Puccinia helianthi_ (Race 314) on Sunflower in Mozambique.
A Zazzerini and L Tosi, Department of Arboriculture and Plant Protection,
Borgo XX Giugno, 74, 06121 Perugia, Italy. Plant Dis. 87:448, 2003;

Sunflower rust (_Helianthus annuus_ L.) caused by _Puccinia helianthi_ [Ph]
Schwein. is a major disease in Mozambique where local ecotypes, from
Peredovik and Record selections, and South African commercial varieties
were all susceptible to race 4, which was prevalent among isolates
collected from 1996 to 1997 (1).
Disease surveys carried out in southern Mozambique (Maputo) during August
and September 2002 revealed an increase in the incidence and severity of
sunflower rust compared to previous investigations on the same varieties.
Rust symptoms, observed in all fields, appeared on the last leaf pairs of
plants at the 5.1 growth stage.
Disease severity (percentage of leaf area infected) (2) ranged from 20 to
60 percent, but the disease did not cause noticeable yield loss because
infection started near the end of the season. Argentine and African
commercial varieties and some experimental Mozambican selections from
sunflower accessions of different origin were the most severely affected.
2 rust samples were collected from infected leaves, stored at 5 deg C, and
increased on the universal suscept (S-37-388). Race identification of both
isolates was determined on 3 sets of 9 differential lines (3 lines per
set): S-37-388, CM 90 RR, MC 29; P-386, HA-R1, HA-R2; and HA-R3, HA-R4,
HA-R5 using the triplet coding system (3).
2-week-old seedlings (4 per 10-cm pot) of each differential line (4 pots
per line) were inoculated on the upper surface of the first pair of true
leaves. Inoculated seedlings were covered with plastic bags, placed in a
growth chamber without light for 18 to 22 h, and then transferred to a
greenhouse under alternate day/night temperatures of 22/18 +/- 2 deg C, 60
to 70 percent relative humidity, and 12 h of light (180 microE·m -2 ·s -1 )
per day. The inoculation test was repeated twice.
Assessment of host differential reactions, 14 days after inoculation, was
based on 5 categories of sunflower reaction to rust (4). Both isolates were
identified as race 314 and to our knowledge, this is the first report of
this race in Mozambique. Since Ph completes its life cycle annually, the
occurrence of new races is expected.
The opportunity for new races to occur is particularly high and severe in
Mozambique where all sunflower varieties grown as summer (January to June)
and winter (August to December) crops are susceptible.

[Sunflower rust is a constraint on sunflower production worldwide. Ph
infects both cultivated and wild sunflower. Teliospores overwinter on
infected sunflower residue and can remain viable in soil for several years.
Effective disease management may consist of one or more control measures,
including cultural practices (early planting, short-season hybrids, crop
rotation) and/or fungicide sprays. There are several known races (at least
5 in North America), and new races emerge over time. - Mod.DH]
