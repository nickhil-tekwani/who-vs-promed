Blood samples of 41 people suspected of contracting anthrax were sent to the Center of Health Laboratory in Makassar, South Sulawesi. The 41 people were admitted at Health Community Centers (Puskesmas) at Malimpung and Teppo, Patampua District.

Teppo health community center doctor Vikayani Wekoila explained that she had established an outpost since dozens of cattle died in the area. "The 41 patients were admitted with cough, fever and respiratory problems," Vikayani said on Friday, 18 Mar 2016. According to Vikayani, most of the patients suffered from respiratory infection after consuming beef suspected of being infected with anthrax.

Two patients who were treated in Lasinrang General Hospital's isolation room had been declared negative of suffering from the disease caused by the _Bacillus anthracis_ bacterium.

"It's probably just an allergy," Mursalim, head of disease control and environment health at the Pinrang Health Agency, said on Friday, 18 Mar 2016. Families and neighbors of the 2 patients had also been declared negative. Lasinrang General Hospital director Hasnah Syam said that the 2 patients had been released after being treated for 6 days.

Over the last 2 weeks, as many as 31 cows and 5 buffalos had been found dead at Malimpung Village, causing panic among farmers and residents. The outbreak of anthrax in Pinrang Regency gained attention from the central government. Muladno, director general of livestock and animal health at the Agriculture Ministry, visited Malimpung on Tuesday, 8 Feb 2016 [Mon 8 Feb 2016 or Tue 9 Feb 2016?]. Muladno has called on farmers not to sell cattle suspected of being infected with anthrax. "Consuming beef infected with anthrax is very dangerous for humans. It can cause death if the bacteria attacks the spleen," he said.

Muladno admitted that he was shocked knowing that a cattle farmer sold his dead cow suspected of being infected with anthrax for Rp 1.5 million [about USD 115].

[Diagnosing anthrax in humans can present problems, especially if done just on clinical symptoms in "exposed" individuals. Humans and their physicians have a tendency to treat 1st with antibiotics before taking blood samples, forgetting that this pathogen is extremely sensitive to antibiotics. And even when there are cutaneous lesions, there is at best only a 30 percent chance of finding organisms in the bloody fluids underlying the lesion (Benyamin Cherkasskyi, personal communication, who struggled with this disease in the USSR). And while many people may well have been exposed, the chances for the pathogen to reach the dinner plate is a function of culinary expertise. Over-cooked meat will have few viable organisms and they will have to survive gastric acid passage. They were lucky this time. - Mod.MHJ
