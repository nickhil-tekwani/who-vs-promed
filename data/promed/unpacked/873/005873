--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overwhelming evidence shows that infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) causes dysfunction of multiple organ systems, including the nervous system. Neurologic symptoms are frequently reported even in patients with mild illness and for some, these neurologic symptoms may persist as part of long-haul COVID.

To describe the prevalence, associated risk factors and outcomes of serious neurologic manifestations among patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) studied 16 225 patients from 179 hospitals in 24 countries as part of the Society for Critical Care Medicine's Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study.

The researchers found nearly 13% of patients admitted for COVID-19 in the 1st year of the pandemic developed serious neurologic manifestations. Specifically, 1656 (10.2%) had encephalopathy (any diffuse disease of the brain that alters brain function or structure) at admission, 331 (2.0%) had a stroke, 243 (1.5%) had a seizure, and 73 (0.5%) had meningitis or encephalitis at admission or during hospitalization.

"Our findings show that encephalopathy at hospital admission is present in at least 1 in 10 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while stroke, seizures and meningitis/encephalitis were much less common at admission or during hospitalization," explains corresponding author Anna Cervantes-Arslanian, MD, associate professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medicine at BUSM.

Additionally, they discovered all serious neurologic manifestations were associated with increased disease severity, greater need for ICU interventions, longer length of stay, ventilator use and higher mortality.

According to the researchers, patients with neurologic manifestations were more likely to have medical comorbidities. Most notably, a history of stroke or neurologic disorder increased the odds of developing a neurologic manifestation.

Moreover, they found neurologic manifestations differed by race. Black patients had an increased frequency of stroke, seizure and encephalopathy when compared with white patients. "Given the association of neurologic manifestations with poorer outcomes, further study is desperately needed to understand why these differences occur and what can be done to intervene," added Cervantes, who also is a neurologist at Boston Medical Center.

Citation: Björk J, Bonander C, Moghaddassi M, et al. COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants -- surveillance results from southern Sweden, December 2021 to March 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(18): pii=2200322; https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.18.2200322
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We compared vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 between December 2021 and March 2022 when omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were the dominating SARS-CoV-2 variants in Scania county, Sweden. Effectiveness remained above 80% after the transition from BA.1 to BA.2 among people with at least 3 vaccine doses, but the point estimate decreased markedly to 54% among those with only 2 doses. Protection from prior infection was also lower after the transition to BA.2. Booster vaccination seems necessary to maintain sufficient protection.

Discussion
----------
The main finding of the present study was the marked decline in protection against severe COVID-19 during omicron BA.2 dominance among persons with 2 vaccine doses only. The decline occurred quite rapidly over 2 months and thus cannot be explained by waning vaccine effectiveness alone. A more likely explanation is increased immune evasiveness properties of BA.2, which gives this genetically distinct subvariant a competitive advantage in highly vaccinated populations (1; see source URL for all references]). The relatively stable protection among individuals with at least 3 doses during follow-up in our study suggests that a very robust immune response is necessary to confer protection also against BA.2.

Although the overall vaccination uptake of 2 doses among adults is high (83%) in the study cohort, only 57% had accepted the booster dose that was generally offered to everyone in Scania by the end of the study period. The Scania region is ethnically and socioeconomically diverse, and we have previously reported substantially lower vaccination uptake among population groups born outside Sweden (7). In the current study, the overrepresentation of foreign-born individuals among cases with severe disease decreased during the transition from BA.1 to BA.2, which suggests more widespread dropouts from the vaccination programme after 2 doses also among people born in Sweden. This means that the overall population protection against severe COVID-19 can be insufficient in case of new intermittent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics that may become the "new normal" (8).

Another notable finding was that the protection associated with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection also declined after the transition from omicron BA.1 to BA.2. A recent total population study from Sweden reported long-lasting protection among unvaccinated persons who have survived and recovered from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (9). However, the follow-up of that study ended before omicron became dominant. Our study, with a more recent follow-up, suggests that the natural protection from previous variants of concern against severe disease is markedly lower when omicron BA.2 is dominant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background: Omicron subvariant BA.2 circulation is rapidly increasing globally.

Aim: We evaluated the neutralising antibody response from vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection against symptomatic infection by BA.2 or other variants.

Methods: Using 50% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT50), we assessed neutralising antibody titres to BA.2, wild type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and other variants in Comirnaty or CoronaVac vaccinees, with or without prior WT-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Titres were also measured for non-vaccinees convalescing from a WT-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralising antibodies in BA.2 and BA.1 breakthrough infections and in BA.2 infections affecting non-vaccinees were additionally studied.

Results: In vaccinees or prior WT-SARS-CoV-2-infected people, BA.2 and BA.1 PRNT50 titres were comparable but significantly (p < 10x-5) lower than WT. In each group of 20 vaccinees with (i) 3 doses of Comirnaty, (ii) 2 CoronaVac followed by one Comirnaty dose, or (iii) one dose of either vaccine after a WT-SARS-CoV-2 infection, 19 or more individuals developed detectable (PRNT50 titre 10 or greater) antibodies to BA.2, while only 15 of 20 vaccinated with 3 doses of CoronaVac did. Comirnaty vaccination elicited higher titres to BA.2 than CoronaVac. In people convalescing from a WT-SARS-CoV-2 infection, a single vaccine dose induced higher BA.2 titres than 3 Comirnaty (p = 0.02) or CoronaVac (p = 0.00001) doses in infection-naïve individuals. BA.2 infections in previously uninfected and unvaccinated individuals elicited low (PRNT50 titre 80 or less) responses with little cross-neutralisation of other variants. However, vaccinees with BA.1 or BA.2 breakthrough infections had broad cross-neutralising antibodies to WT viruses, and BA.1, BA.2, beta and delta variants.

Conclusions: Existing vaccines can be of help against the BA.2 subvariant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Behavioural sciences have complemented medical and epidemiological sciences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As vaccination uptake continues to increase across the EU/EEA -- including booster vaccinations -- behavioural science research remains important for both pandemic policy, planning of services and communication. From a behavioural perspective, the following 3 areas are key as the pandemic progresses: (i) attaining and maintaining high levels of vaccination including booster doses across all groups in society, including socially vulnerable populations, (ii) informing sustainable pandemic policies and ensuring adherence to basic prevention measures to protect the most vulnerable population, and (iii) facilitating population preparedness and willingness to support and adhere to the reimposition of restrictions locally or regionally whenever outbreaks may occur. Based on mixed-methods research, expert consultations, and engagement with communities, behavioural data and interventions can thus be important to prevent and effectively respond to local or regional outbreaks, and to minimise socioeconomic and health disparities. In this Perspective, we briefly outline these topics from a European viewpoint, while recognising the importance of considering the specific context in individual countries.

[3] Global death toll
Date: Thu 5 May 2022
Source: BBC News [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-61327778


The COVID pandemic has caused the deaths of nearly 15 million people around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates. That is 13% more deaths than normally expected over 2 years. The WHO believes many countries undercounted the numbers who died from COVID -- only 5.4 million were reported.

In India, there were 4.7 million COVID deaths, it says -- 10 times the official figures -- and almost one-third of COVID deaths globally. The Indian government has questioned the estimate, saying it has "concerns" about the methodology, but other studies have come to similar conclusions about the scale of deaths in the country.

[See the source URL for a graphic showing the breakdown of global excess deaths, 57% male and 43% female, and middle income countries having the highest proportion of excess deaths at 81%.]

The measure used by the WHO is called excess deaths -- how many more people died than would normally be expected based on mortality in the same area before the pandemic hit. These calculations also take into account deaths which were not directly because of COVID but instead caused by its knock-on effects, like people being unable to access hospitals for the care they needed. It also accounts for poor record-keeping in some regions, and sparse testing at the start of the crisis.

But the WHO said the majority of the extra 9.5 million deaths seen above the 5.4 million COVID deaths reported were thought to be direct deaths caused by the virus, rather than indirect deaths.

[See the source URL for a chart showing the ratio of excess deaths vs official reported COVID deaths in 2020-2021, with Egypt at the top with 11.6 higher, India 2nd with 9.9 times higher, and Pakistan 3rd with the excess death toll 8 times higher.]

Speaking about the scale of the figures, Dr Samira Asma, from the WHO's data department, said "It's a tragedy. It's a staggering number and it's important for us to honour the lives that are lost, and we have to hold policymakers accountable," she said. "If we don't count the dead, we will miss the opportunity to be better prepared for the next time."

Alongside India, countries with the highest total excess deaths included Russia, Indonesia, USA, Brazil, Mexico and Peru, the WHO figures suggest. The numbers for Russia are 3.5 times the country's recorded deaths.

The report also looks at the rates of excess deaths relative to each country's population size. The UK's excess mortality rate -- like America, Spain and Germany -- was above the global average during 2020 and 2021.

[See source URL for a graphic showing the excess deaths per 100 000 by country based on WHO estimates, with Peru at the top with 437 per 100 000, Russia with 367 and South Africa with 200. The global average is 96 per 100 000, and China, Japan and Australia show up as having registered negative excess deaths.]

Countries with low excess mortality rates included China, which is still pursuing a policy of "zero COVID" involving mass testing and quarantines, Australia, which imposed strict travel restrictions to keep the virus out of the country, Japan and Norway.

The academics who helped compile the report admit their estimates are more speculative for countries in sub-Saharan Africa because there is little data on deaths in the region. There were no reliable statistics for 41 out of 54 countries in Africa.

Statistician Prof Jon Wakefield, from Seattle's University of Washington, helped the WHO and told the BBC: "We urgently need better data collection systems. It is a disgrace that people can be born and die -- and we have no record of their passing. So we really need to invest in countries' registration systems so we can get accurate and timely data."

- The Americas region reported 23.6% of cases and 67.7% of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 153.46 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region. The USA reported 82 589 cases in the last 24 hours, followed by Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and Chile, all reporting more than 1000 cases. Additionally, Barbados, Peru, and Panama reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the last 24 hours. Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay, among other, did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 42.0% of cases and 18.8 % of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 216.09 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Spain, Ukraine, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 16 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, with no country reporting more than 100 000 cases, 4 reporting more than 10 000, and 12 reporting over 1000 cases, and 6 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 0.32% cases and 0.82% of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.70 million cases. Tunisia (519) reported the highest number of cases, followed by Bahrain. Overall, the reporting from the region has declined considerably over the last few days, with most countries reporting fewer than 200 cases. Whether this low trend is attributable to reduced reporting on account of Ramadan and Eid-ul Fitr, or an actual reduction, should become clear in the coming weeks.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily cases and 0.95% of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.80 million cases. South Africa (6170) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours. Most of the remaining (7 reporting) countries reported 100 or fewer cases. A total of 42 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 30.2% of daily case numbers and 7.5% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 55.40 million cases. Australia (46 295) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours, followed by South Korea, China, Japan, New Zealand, Viet Nam, Singapore, and Malaysia.

- The South-East Asia region reported 2.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 4.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 57.90 million cases. Thailand (9790) reported the highest number of cases, followed by India (3275) and Indonesia (250).
