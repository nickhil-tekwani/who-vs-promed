I may update your knowledge regarding Armenia, Azerbaijan [AZ and
Nogorno-Karabagh [NK. The latter, which the moderator called "a piece of
Armenia", is in fact an autonomous region within the republic of
Azerbaijan. It was/is mainly inhabited by ethnic Armenians, has been the
cause of an unfortunate war and is presently under Armenian occupation. [I
regret the error. This means that malaria cases in NK are not included in
the totals for AZ - Mod.JW
WHO/EURO's HFA [Health for All database, which is based on official
reports by countries, indicates that there has been an upsurge in reported
malaria cases in the Caucasus and Central Asia since the disintegration of
the former Soviet Union.
The breakdown of curative care and the former spraying activities, caused
by economic collapse, wars and civil disturbances -- with vast numbers of
refugees and internally displaced persons -- are claiming their toll.
Between 1990 and 1996, reported malaria incidence per 100,000 increased
tenfold in Armenia, 175-fold in Azerbaijan, 100-fold in Tajikistan and
25-fold in [both Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan.
Also, in the adjacent countries of Russia and Turkey there has been
reported an increase in malaria incidence per 100,000, respectively, of 2
and 8 times.
During a recent visit to Azerbaijan, central and peripheral health
officials mentioned the upsurge in malaria as an important public health
problem (among others in Barda district, where a high proportion of the
present population are internally displaced persons). Reported cases in
1997 were, however, lower than in 1996.
Fortunately, malaria in Azerbaijan is caused by _Plasmodium vivax_
[meaning that it is less deadly -- and less resistant to treatment -- than
_P. falciparum_ - Mod.JW
