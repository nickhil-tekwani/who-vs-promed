After several outbreaks of influenza virus in horses in the UK and continental Europe, there seems to be an outbreak of equine influenza in an area southwest of Munich, Bavaria, Germany.

A horse arrived 10 days prior to 1st symptomatic cases. Of the 50 horses, about 15-20 developed high fever and coughing within 36 hours. Several nasal swabs were collected and were PCR-positive for influenza A virus. More samples were collected and sent to the OIE reference laboratory at FU Berlin.

The premises are under voluntary quarantine as equine influenza is not a reportable disease in Germany. Very few horses at this operation were vaccinated against equine influenza.

[Since late 2018, outbreaks of equine influenza caused by EIV H3N8 Florida clade 1, a pathogenic virus strain, have been reported from several west European countries, including Netherlands, France, Belgium, Ireland, and, in February 2019, the UK. In the latter, the outbreak caused temporary closure of several holdings and postponement of several equestrian events, since vaccinated horses were affected as well. Complementary vaccination efforts combined with sanitary measures were instrumental in resolving the issue.

This virus strain was reportedly the same one that had shut down racing in Australia for 3 months in 2007, affecting more than 10 000 horses. It is a strain endemic to North and South America.

It will be interesting to note whether the Bavarian case reported above is caused by the same virus strain. - Mod.AS
