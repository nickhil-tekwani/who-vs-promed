This Moroccan newspaper reports from official sources propagation of
the epidemic to the Meknes area. Regional stockbreeders report an
increase in the number of affected flocks. The director of the
Direction Provincial de l'Agriculture at Ifrane said that 577 000
sheep have been vaccinated, representing 90 per cent of the regional
flock.
The official OIE (Office International des Epizooties) report was
describing the disease in 3 localities situated around 100 km of
Meknes, Ifrane (south), Kenitra (west), Khemisset (west), and
Khouribga (in a different geographic area, over 150 km south east of
Casablanca and more than 200 from Meknes).

[Unfortunately, there is still no indication of the strain of virus.
This appears to be a continuing outbreak from the one that started on
10 Sep 2006. It certainly seems like there has been ample time for
strain typing. - Mod.TG]
