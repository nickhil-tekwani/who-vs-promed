The North Carolina Department of Agriculture has confirmed eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in an unvaccinated yearling donkey jenny in Duplin County, the Equine Disease Communication Center reported on 30 Jul 2018.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to equids by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Equids surviving might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective EEE prevention tool. Equids that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually, one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the equid will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[Horse owners should vaccinate their horses and use equine approved fly and mosquito spray. Home owners as well as horse owners should remove mosquito breeding locations of standing water in such places as old tires, and even the catch pans of potted plants. Some counties do widespread spraying. This disease can affect humans and birds. It is a serious disease and should be taken seriously by horse owners for their animals and themselves. - Mod.TG
