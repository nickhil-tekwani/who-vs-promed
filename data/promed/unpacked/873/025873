Disease engulfs rice crop
-------------------------
Off-season cold and rainy weather has created havoc for agricultural
production in the Northern Central region. Thousands of hectares of
rice that was sprayed with insecticide and pesticide were washed off
by rainwater.

Thua Thien-Hue Province has warned of the black streaked dwarf
epidemic in 15 communes and wards, where over 1100 hectares [2700
acres] of rice have been plagued with disease and worms while another
150 hectares [370 acres] have been infected with the black streaked
dwarf virus. Local authorities are guiding farmers to take preventive
measures against the disease.

The Quang Tri Province Plant Protection Department has also reported
the ravaging effects of the disease in several areas of 4 districts.

[Black streaked dwarf disease (BSDD) of rice due to _Rice black
streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) is known to cause
serious crop losses in South East Asia. Symptoms include darkening and
distortion of leaves, black streaked tumours along leaf veins, and
severe stunting of plants. It also affects some other graminaceous
hosts including maize, wheat, oat, and barley and is spread by
planthoppers including _Laodelphax striatellus_ and _Unkanodes_
species.

In 2009, the spread of a new virus associated with BSDD symptoms, but
transmitted by the white backed planthopper (WBPH, _Sogatella
furcifera_) which is not a vector of RBSDV, was reported from southern
China and northern Viet Nam. The new virus has been tentatively named
Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV). RBSDV and the
closely related _Maize rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV) have both been
classed into the serogroup 2 of _Fijivirus_, and SRBSDV appears to
belong to the same group.

Disease management for rice viruses includes cultural practices,
vector control, and use of cultivars with resistance to the virus, the
vector, or both. However, since genetic traits for resistance against
the new SRBSDV have not yet been analysed, insecticide sprays against
the vector, as reported above, are currently the only available
avenue. The new SRBSDV and an increase in WBPH numbers are a major
concern in the region where the crop is already frequently affected by
other diseases including several viruses (for example, ragged and
grassy stunt).
