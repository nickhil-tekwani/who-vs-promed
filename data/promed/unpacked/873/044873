The Enugu State Ministry of Health has confirmed that there is a cholera outbreak in New Artisan Market, Enugu, which resulted in the death of 7 people, while 19 ill persons are identified with the symptoms of loose stool and vomiting.

Confirming the cholera outbreak in the market, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Emmanuel Ikechukwu Obi, disclosed that the Ministry's rapid response team, upon receiving reports of the incident carried out an immediate investigation and "it was observed that the patients presented with sudden onset of passage of loose stool and vomiting". He added that "the ill persons identified within the area were immediately and safely evacuated to the state teaching hospital and are receiving treatment, while health education on safe and hygienic practices were given to the inhabitants of the market".

According to the Health Commissioner, "further tests carried out by the State Ministry of Health at the Teaching Hospital revealed that all the persons were suffering from cholera. Samples were collected for further confirmatory tests of this finding. Surveillance, contact tracing and risk assessment have commenced at the market and its environs, while the Enugu State Ministry of Health Emergency Operations Center for cholera outbreak response will be activated on Sat 17 Jul 2021".

Dr. Obi, who on behalf of the Enugu State Government, prayed for the repose of the souls of the deceased and commiserated with those who lost their loved ones, enjoined "the general public to keep safe as the situation is under control and the Enugu State Ministry of Health will keep the public informed on future developments". He explained that "cholera is an infection caused by some strains of the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Risk factors are from poor sanitation, and contaminated drinking water. The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Symptoms range from none, to mild, to severe. Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and even death. Symptoms start 2 hours to 5 days after exposure. It is prevented by improvements in sanitation, use of clean water, hand washing and vaccines. Treatment involves replacement of lost body fluids orally or intravenously, zinc supplementation, and antibiotics."

Heated arguments broke out between residents and the area councillor today in Abheypur [Panchkula district] over "acting late" in the matter of cholera outbreak that has so far left a 9-year-old boy dead and around 250 ill.

A local resident, said, "I came across a newspaper article which quoted the CMO as saying that Abheypur people live in poor sanitary conditions and that's the reason behind the spread of the disease. People are upset over the statement. Secondly, those approaching the Civil Hospital are not being treated well or referred to the PGI, Chandigarh. Officials are just pretending to be working, but in reality, they are not." A woman said, ''People who live in the village belong to lower economic strata and most work as daily wage laborers. Let's hope we get clean water through the pipeline as we can't afford packaged water.''

Local people reported issues related to the water supply. According to the HSVP, drinking water may have mixed with sewage water that led to the contamination.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
