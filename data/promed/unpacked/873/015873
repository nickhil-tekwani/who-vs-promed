Mumps outbreak spreads to West Nipissing students
-------------------------------------------------
The outbreak at Nipissing University and Canadore College last month
[November 2009] -- traced to someone who travelled outside of the
country -- has spread to West Nipissing, with a total of 13 confirmed
cases in the district, said Dr. Jim Chirico, medical officer of
health with the North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit.

The average age of people infected is 20 and has been primarily
males. "This is probably the largest cluster in Ontario," Chirico
told a news conference on Tue 8 Dec 2009, noting there are 60 cases
in the province. Meningitis can occur in 10 percent of cases, with
one case in the district likely linked to the mumps virus.

Anyone born after 1992 likely received 2 doses of the MMR (mumps,
measles, rubella) vaccine, while people born between 1970 to 1992 may
have only received one dose of vaccine and can get a catch-up
vaccination. Two vaccination clinics are planned in West Nipissing.
Chirico said 62 percent of cases in the district involve people who
received both doses, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has seen that in about 72 percent of cases.

"One of the theories is that the virus has mutated. That's possible
[but unlikely - Mod.CP]. Other possibilities could be that the
vaccine [i.e., immunity] wears off in a shorter period of time than
we had anticipated," Chirico said. He said close contact in schools
could also be behind the outbreak.

Mumps is an infection of the salivary glands caused by a virus, and
it spreads easily through the exchange of saliva by sharing drinks,
food, cigarettes, musical instruments, kissing, coughing and
sneezing. "Teenagers are more likely to spread it just because of the
social contact that they have. That's why we're trying to get the
message out to them," Chirico said.

The health unit recommends people check to see if they have received
both MMR vaccine doses, as well as washing hands frequently and not
sharing personal items that come in contact with saliva. "If you
don't have the catch-up vaccination, you should really look at your
immunization records and check with your family doctor to make sure
that you've had the 2 doses." Chirico said affected school boards
have been contacted to work with teachers and staff to reduce the
risk of exposure.

Northern Ontario is seeing the same strain as an outbreak that
started in August (2009) in the northeastern United States. Chirico
said mumps outbreaks peak every 2 to 5 years, and it's curious to see
one during an H1N1 flu outbreak. Before this year, there was only one
case in the district in the last decade, he said.

Mumps
-----
Anyone with the following symptoms is asked to contact their health
care provider and isolate themselves for 9 days: Fever; swelling and
painful salivary glands on one or both sides of the jaw; headache;
cold-like symptoms. There is no treatment for mumps. Most people will
recover from the infection, and some may not even know they have it.
Complications may include swollen and tender testicles in males, and
ovarian inflammation resulting in abdominal pains in women.

Mumps rarely leads to sterility, but can lead to meningitis or a
swelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Mumps
may also cause hearing loss and miscarriages in the 1st 3 months of
pregnancy. One to 2 cases out of 10 000 can cause encephalitis or
swelling of the brain that can lead to paralysis, neurological damage
and seizures. About 4 percent of mumps cases can cause an inflamed pancreas.

[West Nipissing, adjacent to Quebec province, is the most bilingual
community in Ontario, with 73.4 percent of its population fluent in
both English and French. Its location is shown in the map of Ontario
at: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Nipissing,_Ontario>.

In the absence of other information it is presumed that this outbreak
is an extension of the recent mumps outbreak in Quebec, and is not an
extension of the trans-Canada outbreak in university student of the
previous year. In Sep/Oct 2009 members of traditional religious
communities attending a summer camp in New York state, where there
was an outbreak of mumps (which subsequently became the largest in
the United States since 2006), traveled to the province of Quebec to
attend religious gatherings. Subsequently 15 cases of mumps were
reported in Montreal and the Laurentian region of Quebec province.

Further information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
