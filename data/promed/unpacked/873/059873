A horse from Hopkinton [New York] has tested positive for the Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE), according to St Lawrence County public health director James O Rich. This is the 3rd confirmed EEE case in the state this year [2015] involving horses, with the others occurring in Franklin and Wayne counties, according to the state Department of Health. There also have been 2 human cases, one in Onondaga County and the other in Oswego County.

Mr Rich said the state conducts its own mosquito surveillance activities and St Lawrence County does not plan to initiate its own plan. "Although it's an extremely serious disease, it's an extremely rare disease," he said. Last month [September 2015], a horse from St Regis Falls in Franklin County was identified as infected with the virus.

Mosquitoes infected with the EEE virus can infect people, horses and other mammals, some birds, reptiles and amphibians. [Please note: the mosquito does the transmitting; you cannot get it from your horse. - Mod.TG]

The Health Department recommends that people take precautions against mosquito bites by wearing an effective repellent, long pants and long sleeves. Residents also should ensure that window screens are in good repair and that standing water is removed to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. The risk of getting EEE is highest from late July through September. People at the greatest risk of developing severe disease are those older than 50 and those younger than 15.

Last year [2014], a horse owned by a Heuvelton-area Amish family tested positive for the disease. There is a vaccination for horses, but not for humans. Symptoms in human beings include high fever, severe headache, stiff neck and sore throat.

[I would emphasize the importance of horses being vaccinated. Veterinarians should emphasize that there is a vaccination for horses and it should be given. It is very effective and is frequently combined with West Nile virus.

The immunity to EEE wanes approximately every 4 months so the vaccine should be repeated at 4-6 month intervals. - Mod.TG
