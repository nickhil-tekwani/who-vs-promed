The department of veterinary pathology in Ranchi veterinary college Ranchi has diagnosed that the robust young adult elephant -- less than 30 years old -- died of _Bacillus anthracis_ [infection], the cause of anthrax.

A blood smear of the ear vein of the deceased elephant was submitted to the Ranchi veterinary college's veterinary pathology department. The blood smear was collected by Dr Ajay Kumar. Kumar is a vet officer in BB Biological park Ormanjhi.

The examination of the blood smear found typical bacilli with a bamboo stick appearance. The "bamboo stick" appearance is a chief characteristic of _Bacillus anthracis_. Pathologically and morphologically it is now proven that anthrax killed this young elephant in PTR [Palamu Tiger Reserve]. The elephant was found dead on May 26 [2017]. Blood smear was oozing from its orifices.

Field director of PTR, M P Singh, has confirmed this examination report of blood smear by the vet pathology of Ranchi vet college Ormanjhi. Singh referred to the report of K K Singh who is the chairman of the veterinary pathology. It is K K Singh's signature on the report which reads _Bacillus anthracis_.

PTR officials have their fingers crossed. Cattle grazing is just non stoppable [in the wildlife parks] as farmers and cattle owners are too apathetic towards the welfare of the wildlife here.

M P Singh said that as this elephant is still buried and not burnt [they are open to] suggestion for its DNA test too to trace the strain of anthrax.

[For a description of Ranch in Jkarkhand state, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranchi, and for Kharkhand go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand.

It is an old story of the risks posed by local farmers granzing their livestock in wildlife parks, which just increases the problems. It is no small effort to bury an adult elephant and the PTR people are to be congratulated on achieving it. - Mod.MHJ
