Some 531 chickens were culled at a poultry farm in Gazipur on Monday
[25 Jan 2010] in presence of the district livestock officer after it
was affected by bird flu virus H5N1.

The Field Disease Investigation Laboratory at [Joypurhat District,
Rajshahi Division] on Sunday [24 Jan 2010] confirmed that the virus
affected Lata Poultry farm at Khetlal Upazila [sub district].

Earlier this month [January 2010], Yati Poultry Farm in the same
upazila was affected with the virus. The district livestock
authorities culled some 932 chickens and 183 eggs to contain the
spread of the virus within 12 hours of confirmation.

Talking to The Daily Star, Joypurhat District Livestock officer, Dr
Shahidul Islam, said the newly affected farm was less than 0.5 km [0.3
mi] away from the previous one where H1N1 virus was confirmed on 5 Jan
2010. "The virus broke out due to lack of bio-security maintenance.
Both the farms are situated adjacent to the dwelling place and people
are coming in contact with the farms frequently," he said.

The last outbreak was experienced in the country in August 2009 in
Bogra [Rajshahi Division]. But it was not a massive one, said sources
at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR).

Bird flu killed at least 287 people affecting 467 worldwide since it
began to ravage poultry stocks in Asia in late 2003. World Health
Organisation has counted the fatality at more than 60 percent.

[It will be interesting to note if the detection of the described
outbreak was obtained within the active surveillance, conducted in 150
out of 487 sub-districts of Bangladesh as part of an USAID funded FAO
project (see ProMED-mail post 20090909.3180). A total of 450 community
animal health workers (CAHW), 50 additional veterinary surgeons (AVS),
and 150 upazila livestock officers (ULOs) are using short message
service (SMS) gateway (that is, method of sending and receiving SMS
messages between computers and mobile phones) to collect data and
report on disease and death in poultry.

The H5N1 epizootic in Bangladesh has been continuous since its start
on 5 Feb 2007; if the current described outbreak, Lata Poultry farm,
is officially confirmed, it will become outbreak no. 326. Bangladesh
has submitted, so far, 21 follow-up reports on the H5N1 situation to
the OIE.

The previous outbreak, no. 325, in the Yati poultry farm, Khetlal
Fakirpara, Joypurhat, Rajshahi, was reported to the OIE in
Bangladesh's follow-up report no. 21, submitted on 20 Jan 2010. It
involved a commercial layer flock where 250 chickens died out of 1132
on the farm. The remaining 932 birds were destroyed, in line with the
prevailing national disease control policy, which prohibits the use of
vaccine. The report, including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8866>.

A summary of all reports, including a map showing the location of the
outbreaks, is available at
