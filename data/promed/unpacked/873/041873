[This is now the 22nd case of WPV1 associated paralytic disease reported by Pakistan and the 7th case reported from the KPTD with onset of paralysis this year (2019). It would not be surprising to learn the child did not receive adequate doses of the polio vaccine to prevent the disease as KPTD is an area with high degree of distrust for governmental interventions such as vaccination activities. A recent media report out of Afghanistan mentions the Taliban is blocking vaccination activities due to concerns that the government (Afghanistan) is using the vaccination program to target militant leaders (see https://beta.canada.com/news/world/taliban-bans-polio-vaccine-staff-over-fears-they-are-spying-on-commander/wcm/277b58f2-3158-4cd5-b2da-f8a1268ccc94/amp). North Waziristan in KPTD is an area recently highlighted in a BBC exposee of human rights abuses on the part of both the Taliban as well as soldiers fighting the Taliban in the area and is very much part of the same culture as in Afghanistan (https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/bbc-report-exposes-human-rights-violations-in-north-waziristan20190604185836/) with which North Waziristan shares a border.
