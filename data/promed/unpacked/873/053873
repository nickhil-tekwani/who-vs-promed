Agricultural scientists in Kashmir have found that the pathogen causing the blast disease that reduces productivity of rice plants in Kashmir, [is related] to Chinese and Japanese variants, and not the Indian ones.

Dr Mehraj-u-Din Shah, SKUAST [Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology] said, "The morphological characters, pathogenicity tests and sequence analysis helped in identification of our isolates, confirming that our pathogen was more closely related to the sequences of Chinese and Japanese isolates of _M. oryzae_, as compared to Indian ones."

Shah said the close [relationship] between the pathogen isolates can be attributed to the fact that Kashmir has been using rice cultivars from China for a long time. He said the analysis holds great significance for fighting this disease. It could allow researchers to select resistant rice varieties developed in China and Japan. "Experiments could be conducted on the varieties to see how they react to our pests," he said.

"Rice blast has, in the last few years, shown resurgence across North India, mostly due to crop shift and climate change," Shah said. The disease has made a comeback after Basmati replaced traditional rice varieties grown across north India. The pathogen attacks Basmati varieties more [and] the prevalence of the disease has distressed farmers.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_, previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

The work reported above makes an important contribution to the regional management of rice blast by enabling more efficient resistance breeding. However, resistant crop cultivars need to do well in local conditions. It is therefore necessary, as stated above, to test resistant cultivars developed elsewhere for their suitability to a different regional environment.
