- 06:10 GMT - Philippines temporarily bars incoming flights
Incoming passenger flights are barred from entering the Philippines for one week to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

- 04:51 GMT - World 'needs a robust airline system for COVID-19 recovery'
Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of Airline Ratings, has said more needs to be done to assist airlines with their recovery. "Across the globe, we've all got to make concessions. This is all costing us money. At the same time, whether we are supporting our local airline or our favourite local restaurant with takeaways -- everybody needs help, and the airlines are no different. Because the airlines are losing half of their revenue for 2020, and some of the bailouts are absolutely massive," he told Al Jazeera. "In certain jurisdictions, it has been enough. For instance in the Middle East -- some of the countries there have stepped up significantly, like Qatar. In other jurisdictions, they haven't. In Australia, the federal government hasn't supported its 2 airlines. So coming out of COVID-19, you're going to get some airlines that are very well looked after and other ones that are not." He added: "A lot more needs to be done because aviation is the fabric of the economy of the world and we need a robust airline system to help with this recovery ... Certainly, we want to preserve as many of these airlines as we possibly can for the highly competitive market that we want post-COVID-19."

- 03:05 GMT - Roche gets US FDA approval for antibody test
Roche Holding AG said received emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus. The Swiss drugmaker said its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, has a specificity greater than 99.8% and can help assess patients' immune response to the new coronavirus, officially known as SARS-Cov-2.

- 02:17 GMT - Rise in virus cases in crowded Indian jails prompts concerns
The spread of the coronavirus in India's notoriously crowded prisons prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease.
"It is a terrifying situation. If measures aren't taken soon, then things can become extremely difficult," Madhurima Dhanuka, head of the Prison Reforms Program for the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, told the Associated Press news agency. Although there are no official numbers on how many inmates have been infected by the virus, India's correction facilities are slowly recording more infections and have temporarily banned visitors. On Thursday [30 Apr 2020], authorities locked down Nagpur Central Jail in coastal Maharashtra, among the Indian states worst hit by the pandemic. It was the 8th prison in Maharashtra to be locked down. The move came after 19 inmates in Indore Central Jail in central Madhya Pradesh state tested positive for the virus on Tuesday [27 Apr 2020]. Indian prisons are highly overcrowded. According to the latest data by the National Crimes Records Bureau in 2018, India has some 450 000 prisoners, exceeding the country's official prison capacity by about 17%. Prisons in New Delhi and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state have the highest occupancy rates, at more than 50% above capacity. Making matters worse, "the health facilities in prisons are not up to the mark," said Dhanuka.

- 01:46 GMT - Hundreds in US state of Oregon protest against stay-at-home order

Most of the protesters did not wear face masks, but they waved American flags and Trump campaign signs in the rain. Other signs read, "Reopen Oregon" and "Let me earn a living". A group of healthcare workers demonstrated at the top of the Capitol steps, urging a phased plan to ease the state's social distancing requirements. Most of the other protesters ignored them.

- 00:54 GMT - Yemen's Houthi rebels call for more test kits
Taha al-Mutawakel, the Houthi public health minister, urged the United Nations to increase the number of testing kits for COVID-19. "We are sending this appeal given the global situation of coronavirus, the ongoing assault against our country, the embargo on our country, and because the amount of the PCR tests which the World Health Organization has sent to us is very little and is about to run out," he told reporters in Sanaa on Saturday [2 May 2020].

- 00:26 GMT - UN calls for probe into Venezuela prison riot that left 46 dead
The UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights [OHCHR] has called for an investigation into a prison riot in western Venezuela that left 46 people dead and 75 injured. The OHCHR said on Twitter it is "gravely concerned" about the incident on Friday [1 May 2020] at the Los Llanos penitentiary in Portuguesa state. The South American country's prisons are infamous for extreme levels of violence and poor conditions. "We urge the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation, tackle overcrowding, and guarantee basic rights," the office said. The riot came shortly after prison officials barred inmates' family members from bringing them food, a measure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus within prisons.

- 00:12 GMT - Guards freed after prison riot at Brazil's Manaus
Prison authorities in Brazil said 10 guards and 5 inmates suffered non-critical injuries following an uprising at a prison in Manaus, a state capital in the Amazon rainforest. The inmates held seven guards hostage for more than 5 hours, but the situation was brought under control, according to the state's public security secretariat. Relatives of inmates said the prisoners at Puraquequara prison were protesting against the suspension of all family visits and poor conditions at the lockup amid the coronavirus pandemic.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 44 050 new cases (53.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 6213 deaths (71.8% of the global newly reported deaths). Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 60.7% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 14.1%, Peru at 7.9%, and Canada at 4.3%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 35.9% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 20.1%, Canada at 11.1%, Mexico at 8.8%, Chile at 8.3%, and Ecuador at 6.5%.

The European region reported 27 032 new cases (32.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 2081 deaths (24.0% of the global newly reported deaths). Russia reported 39.3% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 17.8%, Turkey 7.3%, Italy 7.0%, Spain 5.1%, and Belarus 3.4%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5618 new cases (6.8% of the global newly reported cases) and 130 deaths (1.5% of the global newly reported deaths). Saudi Arabia reported 24.2% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 17.6%, Iran at 14.3%, Qatar 13.8%, and the United Arab Emirates at 10.0%.

The African region reported 1465 new cases (1.8% of the global newly reported cases) and 51 deaths (0.6% of the global newly reported deaths). South Africa reported 26.3% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 14.9%, Algeria at 9.6%, Ghana at 6.4%, Senegal at 6.2%, and Cote d'Ivoire at 5.9%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1041 new cases (1.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 63 deaths (0.7% of the global newly reported deaths). Singapore reported 42.9% of the newly reported cases, followed by Japan at 28.2%, the Philippines at 15.0%, and Malaysia at 10.1%.

The Southeast Asia region reported 3557 new cases (4.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 119 deaths (1.4% of the global newly reported deaths). India reported 74.3% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 15.5% and Indonesia at 8.2%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 60.5% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 32.0%, and the Maldives 5.6%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 3 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
