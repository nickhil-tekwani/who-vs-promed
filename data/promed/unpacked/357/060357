In regards to the influenza vaccine failures we have had a similar
experience. I'm a second year Fellow in Infectious Diseases in Dayton Ohio,
there have been several vaccine failures in the area (including my program
director!) with culture positive influenza despite receiving the vaccine in
October-November. This included an extended care facility, all of the
patients that developed the flu had received the vaccine, for this all the
patients at the facility were placed on rimantadine. I do not have all the
details, but seems that this year there have been more failures than on
previous years.

We had a similar experience here in Beijing in our Embassy population
during the month of December. The Pasteur-Merieux-Connought vaccine
(Fluzone) seemed to offer little protection in my patient population to
what was called by the Chinese "Harbin Strain." Here in North China it
appeared to be a new strain which had a very high attack rate in the local
population. There as a strong feeling among the Chinese scientists that
this was a "new" variant or strain. Interesting, though. With such a high
attack-rate, the
influenza-attributed death rate did not seem correspondingly high.
Fluzone (1998-99) was made from the following three strains:
A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1)
A/Sydney/05/97
B/Harbin/07/94 (a B/Beijing/184/93-like strain)
What is the composition of the Evans vaccine?
CDC and WHO are looking the strains from here and Mongolia. It would be
interesting to see if the strains which hit your facility were similar to
what hit us here last December. There are certainly plenty of people
traveling back and forth between here and the East Coast to pass the
viruses back and forth.

We use a different vaccine, and my comments do not directly address the
vaccine issue. I have personally seen outbreaks such as described below
both last year and this year;
however we were able to reduce the impact by the prompt and aggressive use
of amantadine prophylaxis. However, I think that the following should be
considered
in the interpretation of this outbreak, even assuming that there is a good
match between the influenza vaccine of the year and circulating viruses:
a) The efficacy of influenza vaccines in preventing influenza illness among
elderly persons in nursing homes may only be in the range of 30% - 40% in
preventing illness; and 50% - 60% in preventing hospitalization and
pneumonia (ACIP, 1998).
b) Epidemics of influenza commonly occur in long term care(LTC) settings;
and have been documented to occur even when high rates (i.e., 90%) of
vaccine coverage among the residents of the LTC facility have been attained
(Coles, 1992), and
c) it is extremely important to attain high rates of staff vaccination. The
vaccination of health care workers was associated with reductions in total
patient mortality and in influenza like illness - however the paper that
presented these data described a population where staff vaccination rates
exceeded 60% (Potter et al, 1997).Staff vaccination rates of 35% or less
are, alas almost the norm rather than the exception. (I would be
interested in hearing from anyone who is using immunization as a condition
of employment....)
Finally, the early use of mass amantadine prophylaxis can chop off
outbreaks and reduce morbidity from influenza in a LTC setting, and its'
use is recommended by ACIP.
However, even given all of this, is might be appropriate to let CDC/your
state health department know of your experience.
