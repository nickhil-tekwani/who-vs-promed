Japan will cull 170 000 more chickens after a bird flu virus from the
H5 family was detected at farm north of Tokyo, a news report said
Tuesday [8 Nov 2005].
The Agricultural Ministry said Monday that chickens at the farm
tested positive for antibodies for the virus, though no viruses had
been found. But local authorities corrected that announcement
Tuesday, saying the virus had been detected in 2 chicken pens at the
farm in Ibaraki prefecture (state), about 64 miles north of Tokyo,
public broadcaster NHK reported.
Officials said the chickens probably had the H5N2 strain of the
virus, which is less virulent than the H5N1 strain that has ravaged
Southeast Asia since 2003 and killed at least 63 people there.
The 170 000 chickens in the 2 pens will be culled nevertheless, NHK said.
Local authorities were not available for comment Tuesday night.
The virus was detected last Friday [4 Nov 2005] at Moriya Farm, but
local authorities failed to report their findings because they wanted
to prevent panic, NHK quoted Ibaraki official Hitoshi Kashimura as
saying.
Agricultural authorities found H5 antibodies at several other farms
in Ibaraki last week, prompting them to cull 180 000 free-range
chickens. But this was the 1st time the bird flu virus, rather than
antibodies, were detected in Japan since August 2005, NHK said.
Ibaraki prefecture has prohibited the movement of eggs or chickens
within a 3.1-mile radius around the farm. The quarantine affects some
1.23 million chickens.

[The AI situation in Japan is somewhat ambiguous. Since 27 Jun 2005,
Japan has sent 4 reports to the OIE on the identification of a
low-pathogenic H5N2 A influenza virus on poultry farms. According to
those reports, a low-pathogenic-avian-influenza H5N2 strain has been
lingering in Ibaraki since April 2005, identified in 31 farms
throughout the period until mid-September 2005. The illegal use of a
deficient vaccine, which might have included a live virus, was
suspected but not (officially) proven.
According to recent FAO information (see 20051106.3251), on 31 Oct
2005, antibodies to AI (H5?) virus were detected in chickens by AGID
and HI tests at an open-type farm with 82 046 chickens in Ibaraki
prefecture, within the quarantined area of a previous outbreak in
August 2005. No virus was isolated. All the birds at the farm have
been culled. In a separate outbreak on the same day, AI infection was
detected in a duck farm in Osaka Prefecture. AI H4 strain was
diagnosed.
According to information (translated from Japanese) from Japan's
economic journal Nihon Keizai Shimbun of 7 Nov 2005, more than half
of former tests on bird flu in Ibaraki were performed by employees of
commercial enterprises or by private vets, not by authorised
officials. See
<http://health.nikkei.co.jp/birdflu/index.cfm?i=2005110407510ph&genreNum=1>.
Japan's last follow-up report to the OIE, No 3, sent 23 Sep 2005,
included the following statement pertaining to the source of
outbreaks or origin of infection: "unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological investigations to elucidate the cause of these
outbreaks are continuing". Reportedly, an advisory team nominated by
Japan's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, chaired by
Seiji Terakado, has delivered last week its drafted conclusions on
the situation. Some of its contents have been published by Japanese
media (see 20051031.3174). Its official publication is pending. A
new, updated follow-up report will hopefully help in elucidating the
Japanese avian influenza picture, including today's new outbreak and
the additional culling of 170 000 birds. - Mod.AS]

[2] Malaysia, pigeons deaths
Date: Tue, 8 Nov 2005

The deaths of more than 11 wild pigeons in Sungai Petani is worrying
health authorities. In 24 hours they will know whether the birds died
of avian flu -- the disease that has killed 62 people in Asia since
2003. But no one is taking any chances.
Veterinary Services Department director-general Datuk Dr Hawari
Hussein said he has already alerted all state directors.
"All the States are prepared for an outbreak and the moment we detect
a case, we will activate our preparedness plan," he said.
As for the dead wild pigeons, Dr Hawari said samples had been sent
for analysis to the Veterinary Research Institute in Ipoh.
"The death of the wild pigeons is cause for concern," he said, adding
that officers had been sent to Sungai Petani to monitor the situation.
Meanwhile, residents in Taman Mutiara, Sungai Petani, claimed the
flock of pigeons which used to stay around the shophouses, started
dying one by one since last Thursday [3 Nov 2005].
The sight of the carcasses did not alarm them at first until it
increased in numbers.
A complaint was lodged with the Sungai Petani Municipal Council,
which in turn alerted the local veterinary office. Both teams turned
up at the housing estate today. While veterinary officers picked up
stool samples for testing, council workers disinfected the area.
Meanwhile, Kedah Veterinary Department director Dr Quaza Nizamuddin
Hassan Nizam said test results would be known within 24 hours. "We
are taking this precautionary measure. At the moment, there is no
indication of a bird flu case in the country but we have to be
careful under the current situation," he said.
Since late 2003, bird flu has ravaged poultry stocks across Asia and
jumped from birds to humans. Most of the human deaths have been
traced to close contact with infected birds.
