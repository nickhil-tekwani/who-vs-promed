[This is the 2nd OIE report this month from Cuba, the previous one being on
rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Probably the most interesting bit of
information here is the seroprevalence of 10.6 per cent and the lack of
deaths or clinical signs. A previous report referenced below
(20050106.0033) summarizes the results from a serosurvey of healthy horses
on Guadeloupe in 2002. In 6 months, the prevalence increased from 2.8 to 50
per cent, so if this is a recent outbreak we might expect more horses to
seroconvert. It would be important to confirm if there were actually no
clinical signs in any of the outbreak horses since the emergence of the
disease in Cuba, or if the horses just weren't showing signs at the time of
the serosurveillance. The report seems to indicate that "there have been no
clinical signs". If accurate, then it would imply that a newly emerged West
Nile virus caused little or no illness in equines.
The disease has been reported in 3 humans in Cuba recently and there is
evidence of West Nile virus in birds in Cuba from 2004.- Mod.PC]
