The National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) has confirmed 3 more
cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) pushing up the number of confirmed cases
to 143. Of these, 95 are from the Free State, 37 from the Northern Cape, 8
from the Eastern Cape, and one from the North West. Since the 1st incident
on 13 Feb 2010, 9 patients have died -- 5 in the Free State and 4 in the
Northern Cape.

The Department of Health said the majority of cases have had mild flu-like
symptoms and have not developed complications. "The risk of disease is to
persons having direct contact with blood or tissues of infected animals and
the majority of people affected have been persons working on farms,
veterinary workers, and slaughtermen," the department said on Wednesday [21
Apr 2010]. The department added that the disease is generally seen on farms
and not in the cities other than related to the occasional informal
slaughter of infected animals. "The eating of well-cooked meat poses no
risk, nor does the drinking of pasteurized milk. It is likely that the
number of animal cases and therefore human cases will decrease as the
weather gets cooler."

An animal vaccination programme on farms and suspected areas has been
implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to
protect livestock.

On Tuesday [20 Apr 2010], the NICD also assured visitors coming to South
Africa for the FIFA [International Federation of Association Football]
World Cup that they are not at risk of contracting the disease, unless they
handle infected carcasses on farms or handle raw meat from infected
animals. "There is no risk to visitors to Game Parks as the disease
typically only affects ruminants such as sheep, cattle, and goats," NICD
deputy director Lucille Blumberg said at the time.

[Since the previous ProMED-mail report from South Africa, dated Wed 14 Apr
2010, the number of confirmed human cases has increased from 120 to 143,
whereas the number of deaths remains at 9. The disease (in humans) remains
confined to the Free Sate, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, and North West
provinces. Those infected have been people working with livestock,
suggesting that mosquito borne transmission is not a major factor in
transmission of infection in this outbreak. Consequently visitors attending
the FIFA World Cup football matches in South Africa in June 2010 should not
be at particular risk.
