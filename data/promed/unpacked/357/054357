According to the Health Ministry, there have been 2788 cases of malaria diagnosed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia since 2011.

Most malaria victims come from the Tahama (Tihamah) region like Jazan and Al Qunfutha. Most cases occur during the rainy season and about 97 percent originate outside the Kingdom.

The [Tihamah] region and Jazan are some of the most crucial areas for malaria in the Kingdom and are not covered by the control program because of poor roads, communication difficulties, and lack of manpower. But the situation has improved with the registration of 59 cases in Jazan at 80 percent [presumably originating outside the Kingdom] and Aseer at 13.04 percent [presumably originating outside the Kingdom], while the other areas didn't register any cases.

The rise in the number of cases started in January [2013] in all areas and began to fall in March. It is expected to rise again in October and continue until December, especially in Jazan. Statistics show there is a decline in the number of malaria cases beginning in March and reaching lowest rates between May to September, and rising in October.

[Saudi Arabia reported nearly 3000 cases of malaria in 2011 where more than 95 percent were imported cases (see World Malaria Report 2012, country profile for Saudi Arabia; http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2012/wmr2012_country_profiles.pdf).

If the 2788 cases reported here cover 2012 and 2013 up to now, the trend is decreasing compared to the 2011 World Malaria Report numbers.

The cases were all in the South Western area where the WHO estimates the annual incidence rate to be not more than 0.1 cases per 1000 population annually.

Jazan is an industrial center (see below) and it must be assumed that many migrant workers come from malaria endemic areas and may give rise to local transmission as has lately been seen in Greece and Dubai (see previous ProMED reports cited below).

The Tahama (Tihamah) region refers to the Red Sea coastal plain of Arabia from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Bab el Mandeb Strait (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tihamah.png).

Al Qunfutha is located on the Red Sea Coast halfway between Jeddah and the border of Yemen.

The Province of Jazan lies in the south west section of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has a population of approximately 1.2 million. Jazan is home to the Port of Jazan, Saudi Arabia's 3rd most important port on the Red Sea (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazan_Economic_City). - Mod.EP
