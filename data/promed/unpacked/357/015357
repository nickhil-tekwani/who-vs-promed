New outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: San Pedro, Aguaray Amistad, San Pedro, San Pedro
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Dec 2011
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: cattle
Susceptible: 131
Cases: 15
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the Nazareth cattle farm has an area of 50
hectares [124 acres] divided into 10 plots; it is a breeding and
fattening farm with no other susceptible species. There is a cattle
population of 131 heads (adult cows and animals under 24 months) and
there are no tenants.
During the epidemiological surveillance carried out in the farm, 15
cattle under 24 months old showed clinical signs compatible with a
vesicular disease: salivation and lameness. Samples were collected
from 23 animals: 23 blood samples and 6 epithelial samples. During
clinical inspection, 6 cattle showed rupture of oral epithelium and
lesions on the interdigital and coronary space.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: we think that
this new outbreak notified in this report is epidemiologically linked
with the previous event notified on 18 Sep 2011 and closed on 30 Dec
2011.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected
animals
Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country;
screening; zoning; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

laboratory)

[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Paraguay is available at
http://healthmap.org/r/1Bi_. The location of the outbreak can be
seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

Again, we see that foot-and-mouth disease is a very tough disease to
beat thoroughly and completely. It certainly can be done but it is not
an easy task. This is the 2nd recent outbreak in San Pedro region of
Paraguay and the OIE suspects a linkage.

Unfortunately, this new outbreak comes after the slaughter of 819
cattle infected last September (2011) with the same serotype O and the
implementation of extensive biosecurity measures including movement
controls, surveillance, seroepidemiologic testing, and vaccination
programs that appeared to be successful.

This problem must be all the more vexing for the Paraguayan Veterinary
Authorities because San Pedro is in the middle of the country and its
source is not likely cross border spread as is so often cited in this
region. Of course, that begs the question, where did this new outbreak
and the previous, possibly linked outbreak originally come from? These
are tough questions to answer definitively and scientifically but we
hope the disease is eradicated this go round. - Mod.PC]
