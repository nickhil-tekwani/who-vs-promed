Foot & mouth disease - Bahrain 981226192903

This is in reference to the Foot and Mouth outbreak in Bahrain after
vaccination with a Trivalent Foot and Mouth Vaccine.
[The key piece of information that is referred to was:
Location Description of affected population
- -------------------------------------------------------
Bouri village local cattle kept under intensive system
Janabiya village local sheep and cattle (farm was vaccinated two weeks
before with a trivalent FMD vaccine)
quarantine centre cattle imported from a country in southern Africa. - MHJ
In July-August 1998, I had a similar experience with my own personal herd
of regularly vaccinated Cross-Bred Cows, which are quite isolated, at
Hyderabad, India, after vaccination with an Indian vaccine [name deleted.
There was no known outbreak in the area. It would interesting to find out
which vaccine was used and what was the FMV strain isolated from the
Bahrain animals. The preliminary laboratory diagnosis was that my animals
had an 'O' Strain.

[Vaccines based on FMDv "O" are common as O FMDv is a common cause of
outbreaks. Faulty FMD vaccines which are not apathogenic are also not unknown
though thankfully infrequent ... I saw such an iatrogenic epidemic in
Brazil in 1975/76. There was a price war going on between the various
vaccine companies, domestic and foreign, in Sao Paulo at the time. It would
be appreciated if those "in the know" would inform us as to the reality in
Bahrain and India concerning this suggestion from India. - Mod.MHJ
