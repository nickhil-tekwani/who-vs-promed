According to various news reports, there was an outbreak of _E. coli_
O157:H7 at a nursing home in Yamaguchi Prefecture, about 500 miles west
from Osaka, Japan. The first report of the outbreak came from the Yamaguchi
Prefectual Health Department on November 20.
As of November 24, at least 36 patients, residents and staff members of the
nursing home, have been hospitalized. One of them is in serious condition.
A male resident, 78, died on November 19. He developed a hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS). Two more residents, a female, 86, and a male, 78, also died
on November 21 after developing HUS.
The Health Department traced the source of the outbreak to daikon-tuna
salad, which was served at the nursing home on November 10. Among 50
residents, 47 of them, four short-stay residents, and one staff member, ate
the salad.
The Health Department isolated _E. coli_ O157:H7 from the salad, and
confirmed the production of stx II from the isolates. The salad contained
daikon, lettuce, wakame, tuna fish, and non-oil dressing. The Health
Department could not identify which food item was actually contaminated
with _E. coli_ O157:H7.
This is the first outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in Yamaguchi Prefecture.
