Re: PRO> Smallpox vaccination strategies - USA (08)
-----------------------------------
The smallpox vaccine contraindications include close contacts with
immunocompromised individuals. Some at our Cancer Center take this to
mean anyone who is working directly or may be within 6 feet of our
cancer patients (i.e., virtually everyone). How have other centers
with immunosuppressed populations interpreted this contraindication?
My understanding is that in a 1968 study from 10 state surveillance,
only 27 post-vaccination transmissions were documented per million.
With better wound care, strict hand-washing, and vaccination of only
those with a preexisting scar, shouldn't the risk be considerably
lower?

[Dr. Tarrand's questions re: smallpox vaccination risks are
legitimate ones that face many health care institutions. This
moderator chooses to preface a response with an acknowledgement that
definitive answers are not easy to come by. Information and studies
on the adverse effects of smallpox vaccination are primarily from
times of outbreaks and from the era when routine smallpox vaccination
was conducted. As routine immunizations were discontinued in the USA
in 1972, and worldwide in 1982, the numbers of immunosuppressed
persons who were potentially exposed to recently vaccinated
individuals was significantly lower than today (in the general
public), and definitely lower than patient populations in the
hospital institutional setting.
There is a good summary of the data from Lane's papers on smallpox
vaccination adverse effects at:
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccine-safety/adverse-events-chart.asp>
(1. Lane JM, Ruben FL, Neff JM, Millar JD. Complications of smallpox
vaccinations, 1968: national surveillance in the United States. New
Engl J Med 1969;281:1201-1208.
2. Lane JM, Ruben FL, Neff JM, Millar JD. Complications of smallpox
vaccination, 1968: results of ten statewide surveys. J Infect Dis
1970;122:303-309. )
The numbers of inadvertent inoculations per 1 000 000 vaccinees cited
in the 2 studies were:
(the primary vaccinees were predominantly infants less than one year of age):
NATIONAL SURVEY (Ref 1 above)
All primary (i.e., first-time) vaccinees 25.4
Vaccinees greater than or equal to 1 year of age 27.1
10-STATE SURVEY (Ref 2 above)
All primary (i.e., first-time) vaccinees 529.2
Vaccinees greater than or equal to 1 year of age 532.0
The last paragraph in the discussion is important: "The authors of
the studies state that the national survey statistics should be
considered minimal estimates of the risks of smallpox vaccination.
The authors assert, on the other hand, that a small number of
patients included in the 10-state survey may have been vaccinated
prior to or after 1968. Those rates, therefore, may overestimate
slightly the true incidence of complications. Thus, when describing
rates of the more severe smallpox vaccine adverse events in 1968
(vaccinial encephalitis, vaccinia necrosum, and eczema vaccinatum),
it appears to be preferable to use the range presented by the 2
studies. The 10-state survey data may present a better estimate of
less severe adverse event rates from 1968 (generalized vaccinia and
accidental autoinoculation)."
Yes, there is a reported shorter duration of inoculation site
infection in those with pre-existing immunity. However, the current
body of literature is unclear on the duration of immunity; the
commonly accepted duration is 10 years, but current studies are few.
Frelinger and Garba (ref 1 below) reported that 13/14 subjects
studied had detectable antibody 35 or more years after last known
exposure to smallpox vaccine. A study by Suari et al. in Maryland
involved 621 subjects and concluded that approximately 75 percent of
his population had no evidence of residual immunity as defined by
"take rate" following revaccination (ref 3 below). A study by Frey
et al. (ref 2 below) of 680 never-vaccinated individuals, while
addressing the issue of dilution of vaccine dose, noted that 5.7
percent (37) of vaccinees had rashes at sites other than the
vaccination site on days 7,8, and 9 and 10.1 percent (67) on day
10,11, or 12 with an overall 14.3 percent (95) having a rash at a
site other than the vaccination site.
This moderator cannot address the question of how other centers with
immunosuppressed populations are interpreting this contraindication
but can only guess that there are significant concerns, especially
given the high level of "unknowns" at present. ProMED-mail would be
very interested in hearing how other institutions are interpreting
this contraindication to vaccination in light of the planned
vaccination activities.
