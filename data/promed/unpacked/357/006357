Background on Toxoplasmosis, multi-species - Australia
--------------------------------------------
Australia:
An estimated 520 to 650 babies are born with congenital toxoplasmosis each year.

Prevalence surveys:
- 3.7 percent of encephalitis cases in Australia (221 cases reported, 1990 to 2007)

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 35 percent of pregnant women in Western Australia; 23 percent to 45 percent in Melbourne; 23 percent in South Australia; 26 percent in Queensland
- 50 percent of feral cats in Tasmania (1997 publication)
- 67 percent of captive common brushtail possums (_Trichosurus vulpecula_, 2008 publication)
- 15.5 percent of Western grey kangaroos in the Perth region (2009 publication)
- 5 percent of wild brush-tailed rock-wallaby populations in southeast Queensland (2010 publication)
- 0 percent of Australian fur seals (_Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus_, 2007 to 2009)

Cases of human infection have been ascribed to ingestion of poorly-cooked kangaroo meat.

- High abortion rates are reported among pregnant Tasmanian ewes, which are infected through ingestion of cat feces.
- Toxoplasmosis has been demonstrated among humpbacked dolphins (_Sousa chinensis_) stranded in Queensland, and in common wombats (_Vombatus ursinus_)
- Toxoplasmosis has been reported in kakariki (_Cyanoramphus_ spp.)

Notable outbreaks:
- 1984 (publication year) - An outbreak (5 cases) of toxoplasmosis among members of a Lebanese family in Australia was ascribed to contaminated Kibbi (a traditional meat dish).

New Zealand:
- 164 primary maternal infections are estimated annually, with resultant infection of 66 fetuses.
- The maternal seroconversion rate is 0.62 percent per year.

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 33 percent of pregnant women in Auckland (IgG, 2000)
- 42.9 percent of healthy blood donors in Waikato (2007 publication)
- 85 percent of ewes (2006 to 2009)
- Toxoplasmosis has been documented in wallabies (_Macropus eugenii_, _Macropus rufogriseus_) exported to the United States from New Zealand.

[_Toxoplasma gondii_ is ubiquitous in mammals and birds. Felines support the sexual cycle, which results in the production of oocysts which are excreted in feces. Once the oocysts have sporulated, they can remain infective in the environment for months depending on temperature and humidity. Sheep and lambs (and other mammals and birds) can become infected from pastures contaminated with _T. gondii_ oocysts. - Mod.EP]
