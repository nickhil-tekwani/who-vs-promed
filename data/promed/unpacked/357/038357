Hemorrhagic disease suspected in deer
--------------------------
Wildlife biologists think that a flurry of recent deer deaths in 14
Kentucky counties is the result of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD).
EHD is caused by a virus spread by biting gnats, or midges, and occurs in
Kentucky about every 2 years, according to Department of Fish and Wildlife
Resources biologist Danny Watson. It is commonly found in deer throughout
the Southeast.
Watson said officials have not been able to confirm that the deer are dying
from EHD because reported carcasses are more than 24 hours old, by which
time the virus has died. However, several of the dead animals suffered from
mucus in their lungs, hearts, and other organs, and most were found near
water -- all signs of hemorrhagic disease. "We have enough evidence to
strongly suspect EHD," Watson said.
The worst outbreak has been in Breathitt County, where more than 58 deer
have been reported dead. Deaths also have been reported in Adair, Boyle,
Casey, Cumberland, Fleming, Green, Hardin, Henderson, Larue, Marion, Rowan,
Taylor, and Woodford counties.
The disease can kill fairly quickly, but deer also can suffer for weeks or
even months. It's not always fatal.
Signs of the disease depend on the strength of the virus. Clinical signs
include fever, labored breathing, and swelling of the head, neck, tongue,
and eyelids.
The disease also infects cattle and sheep, but it isn't transmitted from
animal to animal and doesn't affect humans.
When first infected, a deer might show no outward signs of the disease.
Watson advises hunters who take a whitetail and then discover a tumor or
abscess under the skin or in the body cavity not to use that part of the meat.

[EHD is an acute, infectious, often fatal viral disease of some wild
ruminants. This malady, characterized by extensive hemorrhages, has been
responsible for significant epizootics in deer in the northern United
States and southern Canada. A similar hemorrhagic disease called bluetongue
also occurs in wild ruminants. The 2 diseases are antigenically different,
although there are similar clinical signs.
The first occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in 1955,
when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) succumbed
in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was considered a new disease of
deer, and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic disease" was suggested to
describe its main clinical and pathological features.
Since these initial confirmed outbreaks of EHD, documented epizootics have
occurred in white-tailed deer in South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and
Alberta, Canada. Suspected EHD outbreaks have occurred in Missouri,
Washington, Nebraska, Iowa, and British Columbia. South Dakota, Missouri,
and Nebraska have experienced periodic outbreaks of EHD, and the disease
might be considered enzootic in these areas.
Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily among
white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O. hemionus_) and
pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have also succumbed.
The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ biting fly
or gnat. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated vector
in North America. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers
of deer (as in Michigan, New Jersey, and Alberta) is that they are single
epizootics that do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer (as
experienced in South Dakota and Nebraska) occur almost annually, and the
disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of
EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October) and
have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.
Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are similar. White-tailed deer develop
signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A consistent characteristic
of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and
fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop
rapid pulse and respiration, and finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and
lack of oxygen in the blood result in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa,
hence the name "bluetongue." Between 8 and 36 hours following the onset of
observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate, and die.
The gross and histological lesions of EHD are characterized by extensive
hemorrhage, ranging from pin-point to massive in size, and involve
different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs appear to be
exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved being the heart,
liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract. Extensive hemorrhaging
is the result of interference with the blood-clotting mechanism together
with degeneration of blood vessel walls.
Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant effect
upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers drastically.
Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild ruminants. The EHD
virus can infect domestic animals but rarely causes disease. Presently
there is no evidence that the virus crosses into humans. (Portions
