Indonesia: Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease Cases Reported in Bandung and Jakarta
--------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 27 May 2004, the Indonesia Ministry of Health has recorded 2
cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) this year. One HFMD case was
reported from Bandung, West Java province, and the other from Jakarta. So
far, there have been no deaths.
HFMD is a common illness of infants and children. It is characterized by
fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters. HFMD begins with a
mild fever, poor appetite, malaise ("feeling sick"), and frequently a sore
throat. One or 2 days after the fever begins, painful sores develop in the
mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become
ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums, and inside of the
cheeks. The skin rash develops over 1 to 2 days with flat or raised red
spots, some with blisters. The rash does not itch, and it is usually
located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It may also appear
on the buttocks. A person with HFMD may have only the rash or the mouth ulcers.
HFMD usually is not serious. HFMD caused by Coxsackievirus A16 infection is
a mild disease, and nearly all patients recover without medical treatment
in 7 to 10 days. Complications are uncommon. Rarely, the patient with
coxsackievirus A16 infection may also develop "aseptic" or viral
meningitis, in which the person has fever, headache, stiff neck, or back
pain, and may need to be hospitalized for a few days. Another cause of
HFMD, enterovirus 71 (EV71) may also cause viral meningitis and, rarely,
more serious diseases, such as encephalitis, or a poliomyelitis-like
paralysis. EV71 encephalitis may be fatal. Cases of fatal encephalitis
occurred during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997 and in Taiwan in 1998.
HFMD is moderately contagious. Infection is spread from person to person by
direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from
blisters, or the stool of infected persons. A person is most contagious
during the 1st week of the illness. HFMD is not transmitted to or from pets
or other animals.

[These sporadic cases of hand, foot and mouth disease, though insignificant
in number, may be the forerunners of a more serious epidemic, particularly
if Enterovirus 71 proves to be the etiologic agent. Epidemics of HFMD in
recent years have tended to be more serious in East Asia than elsewhere in
the world. Information on the identity of the agent would have general
interest. - Mod.CP]
