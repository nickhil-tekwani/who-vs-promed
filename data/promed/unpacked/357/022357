WHEAT DISEASES - USA (KANSAS): CROP LOSS

High winds brought a quick halt to last-gasp attempts to protect this
year's [2007] wheat crop from leaf rust, a disease brought on by this
year's abundant moisture. While that moisture is making the prospects of a
bumper crop -- at least in the western third of the state -- a distinct
possibility, it is also bringing with it difficulties that are sure to rob
some of the yield potential from this year's crop.
Strangely enough, Kansas State University wheat breeder, Joe Martin, said
he's already seeing signs of drought stress, even though the soil is full
of moisture. "I'm afraid what we've got is a wheat crop that is used to
three-quarters of an inch [2cm] of rain every week," he said. Less than
that fell in the Hays area last week [7-13 May 2007], even though the rest
of the state was inundated by floods.
The 2007 wheat crop is also struggling with wheat streak mosaic, a disease
spread by the wheat curl mite. [There are also a few] fields that are
suffering from both wheat streak mosaic and the relatively new _Triticum
mosaic virus_. Together, those 2 viruses can decimate a crop. "The plants
are dying," Martin said of fields that are battling both diseases. "That's
what happens. [With] both of these viruses together, [the plant] will
probably die off before it matures." But there's still plenty to learn
about the disease, he said, including exactly how it is spread or what
effect it might have on the future of the wheat industry. "I'm not sure how
important this virus will be in the long run," Martin said.
Until the [strong winds started], it was leaf rust that was a concern. Crop
experts, however, say it's simply too late to do anything now in the area.
In the Plainville area, there had been plans to even apply to wheat fields
a fungicide by ground sprayers -- an exceptionally uncommon practice this
late in the season -- to bring leaf rust to a halt, but the warmer
temperatures hurried along the crop, pushing it into the flowering stage --
the last point when fungicides can be applied.
Likely, however, wheat fields in far north west Kansas might be seeing some
application of the chemical to halt the spread of leaf rust. It's an
expensive proposition, however, costing anywhere from USD 20 to USD 25 an
acre (0.4 hectare) for the farmer. Leaf rust, Martin said, can reduce
yields by about 30 per cent.
Spraying should have started about 3 weeks ago, said aerial applicator John
Werth. "The conditions were right with the weather," he said. Now, it's too
late. "Somebody wasn't on their toes," he said of taking steps to get the
fields sprayed. As a result, he added, some of the fields are hurting.
"Some of it is in really sad shape," Werth said of wheat fields in the
McCracken and Bison areas. There, farmers were hoping to harvest 50 to 60
bushels (1.36-1.64 metric tonnes) of wheat. Now, he said, they will be
lucky to get 25 bushels (680 kg) an acre. Some of those fields, Martin
said, might be taking [the 3 diseases]: leaf rust, wheat streak and
triticum mosaic -- 'trim-v' as it's generally called in the industry.
Spraying for leaf rust is supposed to take place once the flag leaf emerges
and up until the plant starts flowering. That happened over the weekend
[12-13 May 2007] and so the spraying will stop. The idea of the timing,
Werth said, is to allow at least 45 days from the time of spraying until
harvest. In addition to the leaf rust, Martin said there have also been
some fields that are showing stripe rust. "It looks like leaf rust is going
to win," he said, adding that stripe rust likes cool weather.
Midland Marketing agronomist, Lee Niblock, said farmers in the Plainville
area had been spraying, and continued to do so until the heat advanced the
crop. What effect the rust will have is uncertain because there's no way to
tell what the weather will do. "The weather from here on is going to decide
that," he said.

[The main rust diseases on wheat are:
leaf (brown) rust caused by the fungus _Puccinia triticina_ (formerly _P.
recondita_ f. sp. _tritici_)
stripe (yellow) rust caused by _P. striiformis_
stem (black) rust caused by _P. graminis_.
The fungal spores are spread mainly by wind dispersal and with infected
plant material. Rust management can be used at key decision times defined
by the growth stages of wheat to reflect the changing risk as the season
unfolds.
_Wheat streak mosaic tritimovirus_, genus _Potyviridae_ is spread by the
wheat curl mite _Aceria tulipae_. It can also be mechanically transmitted
and seed transmitted at a very low level. It infects wheat, maize (some
cultivars), grasses, and also oats and barley in experimental inoculations.
_Triticum mosaic virus_ is an as yet unclassified virus in the genus
_Potyviridae_. It was discovered very recently (2006) in the Hays area in
wheat cultivars developed for their resistance to _Wheat streak mosaic
tritimovirus_.
Each of the 4 pathogens alone can cause serious losses to wheat crops, thus
a combination may indeed prove devastating.
