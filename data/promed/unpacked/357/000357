The city zoo will remain closed for another week to enable
authorities to ensure that the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) that
claimed the lives of 19 animals has been brought fully under control.
The technical committee set up by the government to help the zoo
manage the FMD situation will meet again on 20 Jul 2007 to discuss
the reopening of the facility to the public. These were among the
main decisions taken at a meeting of the committee here on Friday [13
Jul 2007].
"The committee felt that undue haste should not be shown in trying to
reopen the zoo. If the zoo is reopened and there is another outbreak
of FMD, it might prove to be uncontrollable," zoo director Elcy George said.
The sources of meat supplied to the city zoo for the past 2 months
will be traced in an attempt to try and identify whether the virus
entered the zoo through the food supplied to the animals. In future,
the zoo will procure meat only from a known source. In the case of
fodder given to herbivores, the committee decided to find out the
possibility of procuring grass and fodder from government agencies.
The committee also suggested that fodder and grass be cultivated
under the supervision of the zoo authorities.
It was decided at the meeting that the garbage generated inside the
zoo should be disposed of only after being sprayed with a 10 per cent
formalin solution to ensure disinfection. The committee resolved that
the zoo should seek the help of the City Corporation to dispose of
waste from the zoo premises. It was also decided to stop the dumping
of garbage or any other waste material from the garden area inside the zoo.
The committee has suggested to the zoo authorities to keep a register
of visitors who come to the zoo from outside the state and the country.

[2] Mysore (Karnataka) zoo: precautionary measures

The closure of Trivandrum [Thiruvananthapuram] Zoo due to FMD has
sent a warning signal to officials of the Mysore zoo. Not ready to
take any chances, they are being extra cautious before the onset of
the disease.
Though the Mysore zoo has no history of FMD in the last decade or so,
the veterinary department has gone the extra mile for a fool-proof
system to avoid viral diseases. In fact, the system was in place at
the outset of monsoon itself, when the zoo made it mandatory for foot
dips for visitors.
The foot dip is a trough filled with Khorasalin chemical-medicated
water placed at the entrance of the zoo. And it was mandatory for the
visitors to compulsorily pass through it to remove viruses and
bacteria. Recently, foot dips were made obligatory for even
zookeepers to enter the enclosures.
"We protect all animals through regular vaccinations of 6 months, 10
months and annual vaccination. The foot dip outside the enclosures
also prevents cross infection," explained senior veterinarian of the
Mysore zoo Nanjappa.
The pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons were a high risk time for animals
to become infected with FMD or hemorrhagic septicemia.

According to a previous report (archive 20070710.2206), the species
at the Thiruvananthapuram zoo, affected by FMD serotype O with a very
high mortality rate, were the Blackbuck [_Antilope cervicapra_] and
the Mithun [_Bos gaurus_]. We commented that severe cases in
blackbucks had been reported in the past (Kar et al, 1983) and
requested information on past history of FMD in _Bos gaurus_.
It appears that such information is indeed available, describing
cases in the Gayal (_Bos gaurus frontalis_). According to the paper
(Ref 1), 5 gayals of different ages were affected in October 1990 by
FMDV serotype O in 2 adjacent enclosures of the Calcutta zoo. Four of
the animals -- a calf, a heifer, a cow and a bull -- died within 10
days following the onset of the disease. PM lesions revealed massive
myocardial damage.
The high mortality rates seen in adult Indian mithuns (2007), gayals
(1990), and blackbucks (1973, 2007) are exceptional and reminiscent
of the high mortality recorded in adult gazelles in Israel (1985).
All those cases were related to FMDV serotype O; the Israeli field
observations were supported by experimental infection trials, with
cardiac and pancreatic lesions.
Generally, FMD virus will cause mortality of less than 5 (and in most
cases less than 2) percent in adult animals (cattle, sheep, goats);
high mortalities in offspring are not rare.
The pathogenicity of FMD, caused by serotype O in _Antilope
cervicapra_, _Bos gaurus frontalis_ and _Gazella gazellae_ is a
matter for further studies.
