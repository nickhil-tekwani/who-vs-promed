Indonesia: measles outbreak kills 10 in Alor
--------------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles has hit the Alor regency, with 10 people in
Padangsul Tamalabang sub-district reportedly dying of the disease and 149
others seriously ill, an official said on Wed 8 Dec 2004.
"The residents reported the fatalities to us and we dispatched a team of
doctors to treat the victims and offer immunizations," said Alor Health
Office head Paul Manumpil.
An outbreak of the disease in October spread to 3 other sub-districts in
the regency, killing 26 residents [see ProMED-mail posts: Measles -

[The outbreak of measles, first reported in the area in October 2004, does
not appear to have been controlled, and it must be presumed that the
population remains poorly vaccinated. As previously commented by
correspondents, the high number of fatalities is not unusual for measles
outbreaks in poorly immunized communities in this part of the world. The
extent of the outbreak is obscured by the absence of a denominator. - Mod.CP]
