Does yellow fever immunization offer any cross-immunity to dengue and, more
importantly, is it a risk factor for DHF?

[Yellow fever and the four dengue viruses all are members of the genus
_Flavivirus_, family _Flaviviridae_. However, they belong to different
antigenic complexes (i.e. yellow fever as the sole member of the yellow
fever complex and the four dengue viruses as the only members of the dengue
complex) and are only distantly related to each other, although they are
related (else they would have been placed in the same antigenic group,
originally called the "Group B arboviruses").
Cross-protection between yellow fever (YF) virus and other flaviviruses has
been shown in laboratory animals. More germane epidemiologically, prior
immunization of monkeys with dengue (DEN) viruses confers some protection
(reduction of viremia) against YF virus.
James Porterfield showed that infection with any of many flaviviruses
enhances the infectivity of subsequently infecting flaviviruses ("immune
enhancement"). That is, when an animal is infected with one flavivirus,
low levels of antibody to that virus enhance infectivity by another
flavivirus. Scott Halstead has proposed (Halstead et al., Yale J Biol Med
42:311-328, 1970) that severe dengue infections (dengue hemorrhagic
fever/dengue shock syndrome) had an immunopathologic basis and that those
forms almost always occurred only in people who had previosly been
sensitized by a heterologous dengue type (i.e. dengue-1 virus infection
followed by dengue-2 virus infection). This hypothesis has provided the
basis for answers to questions about dengue hemorrhagic fever in children
of mothers who have a history of dengue and in adults with a previous
history of mild dengue fever.
There is no evidence, however, that immunization with YF vaccine or prior
natural infection with YF virus will "prime the pump", so to speak. I know
of no evidence for an increase in dengue hemorrhagic fever in people who
had YF immunization prior to their dengue infections. Thus, while in
theory such vaccination could be a risk factor for dengue hemorrhagic
fever, there is no evidence that it is.
One thought: Might widespread application of YF vaccine in a community
bring about a decrease in dengue viremia in people with a dengue virus
infection? That is, might heterologous antibody (to YF virus) partially
protect the individual but, more significant epidemiologically, by
decreasing dengue viremias also decrease the likelihood that a subsequently
feeding mosquito will acquire and pass on the (dengue) virus? Might this
be a means of aborting epidemics without having a dengue vaccine? I simply
do not know. - Mod.CHC
