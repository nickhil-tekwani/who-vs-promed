St. Louis encephalitis found near Fallon
----------------------------------------
The state of Nevada reported its 1st [finding] of St. Louis encephalitis [SLE]
this year [2005], detected in a mosquito pool collected just 4 miles north of
Fallon along the Carson River near Tarzyn Road.
Nancy Upham, district manager for the Churchill County Mosquito
Abatement District, said this particular pool was sampled on 1 Jun
2005. The sample was taken to the Nevada Department of Agriculture's
Animal Disease & Food Safety Laboratory in Reno, where it was
confirmed that the pool tested positive.
According to representatives from the Nevada Department of Agriculture, SLE can
produce the same flu-like symptoms that are often found in West Nile virus
infection, and both are spread through mosquito bites.
One area in which SLE is different from West Nile virus is that the
encephalitis strain rarely shows up in horses. Birds and humans can, however,
contract St. Louis encephalitis.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 3 human
cases of SLE have been reported in Nevada since 1964. The fatality rate for
people suffering from the disease runs from 3 to 30 percent and increases with
a person's age. The elderly, people who live in crowded areas and those who
have outdoor occupations are most likely to catch the encephalitis strain.
Despite the fact that it was found near Fallon, Upham said she does not believe
people should worry about an outbreak. Upham said she and representatives from
the county's mosquito abatement district have been setting mosquito traps and
collecting pools across the area. She said they have been testing areas where
the West Nile virus was detected last year [2004] and also any areas with
enough water to breed mosquitoes.
In the Tarzyn Road area, Upham said testing would be continued in that area as
well as in others. "We're going to look at it and look real hard at the
(mosquito) species that's carrying (SLE), and try to figure out the sources
based on that species," Upham said.
As for what the public can do to combat the spread of SLE, the West Nile virus
and other mosquito-carried diseases, Nevada State Veterinarian David Thain said
he would like to remind people that it is not too late to vaccinate horses. "I
think the big thing is those folks that haven't got their horses vaccinated
need to do so immediately," Thain said. "It's not too late. Contact your local
veterinarian and feed stores."
Framsted said people can combat mosquito breeding by doing simple chores like
draining dog dishes, maintaining pools and throwing away tires or anything that
holds water. "It's prevention, prevention, prevention," Farmstead said. "I
mean, we're going to sound like a broken record throughout this entire season.
But unfortunately for humans, we don't have a vaccine. It's a virus, so
therefore the only kind of care is supportive care. You can't take an
antibiotic. So the best way is to prevent even getting bitten."

[St. Louis encephalitis virus was found in 2004 in a pool of mosquitoes
collected near Fernley, Nevada [after going undetected for a decade in that
state. - Mod.JW]. Both St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile virus are
mosquito-borne flaviviruses that infect, besides mosquitoes, birds, horses,
humans and certain other mammals. As with West Nile virus, most people infected
with St. Louis encephalitis virus show few or no symptoms. Severe cases of the
disease do happen, some of which include convulsions, coma and spastic
paralysis and even death. Severity of the clinical syndromes increases with
age, and persons over 60 years old have the highest frequency of encephalitis.
The primary transmission cycle involves wild passeriform and columbiform birds
and _Culex_ sp. mosquitoes. CDC case-fatality rates (CFR) range from 3 percent
to 30 percent, with the elderly being at higher risk. An average of 128 St.
Louis encephalitis human cases are reported each year in the USA. Disease
transmission forecasts can help minimize human and domestic animal health risks
by indicating where disease control (such as detection of infected mosquitoes)
and prevention efforts should be focused. - Mod.RY]
