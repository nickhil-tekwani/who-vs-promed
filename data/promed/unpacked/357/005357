[1] Vaccine development and history

The race to find a cure for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is heating up around the world as countries battle to see which one can produce a winner first. While Russia announced it has a vaccine that it expects to be approved this month [August 2020] that it plans to administer in a mass vaccination campaign in October [2020], the Chinese military has already approved a "specially needed drug" in June [2020] for limited military use. It normally takes 10-plus years to develop a vaccine that is safe and effective, but the stakes to be first are high, particularly, it would seem, between the US, Russia, and China. Trump has repeatedly promised his administration would have a drug by the end of the year [2020], but more recently, he has said he's optimistic that a vaccine will be available even sooner, perhaps sometime around the US election in November [2020]. If Operation Warp Speed, his USD 10 billion vaccine initiative, is successful, he stands to gain politically.

Heidi Larson, Director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, recently told Reuters, "[F]ast is good for politicians. But from the public perspective, the general sentiment is: 'too fast can't be safe'."

And that is precisely what has some scientists concerned that federal regulators may be put under extreme political pressure to approve a drug that isn't safe or effective. Others worry that even if a vaccine is carefully vetted, it may not be long-lasting or effective in ending the pandemic. A recent article in the New York Times that breaks down the vaccine testing process summarizes the status of drugs currently in development, and while it's clear that in some cases steps are being combined (phase I and II trials), we must ensure that none are skipped and that no rules are bent.

At a recent Congressional hearing, top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci offered some assurance that the US is not likely to use a vaccine developed in Russia or China, where regulations are less transparent than in the US. "I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccine before they are administering the vaccine to anyone," he said. "We are going very quickly. I do not believe that there will be vaccines, so far ahead of us, that we will have to depend on other countries to get us vaccines."

In 2019, the World Health Organization identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global health threats, which makes public mistrust another concern for public health officials. A recent Gallup poll indicates that 35% of Americans wouldn't get a free, FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccination if it were available today [10 Aug 2020 -- date of publication of article]. As urgent as it is to develop a vaccine, it's important to remember that any vaccines that don't live up to their promises may actually further erode public confidence.

At the same time, we would be wise to remember the history of recent vaccination mishaps. The 1942 hepatitis B epidemic in the US Army during the 1st year of World War II is a historical reminder that policy decisions made by health experts can go awry. Yellow fever never occurred in either Axis or Allies troops during the subsequent war years, but tropical disease experts argued for the use of the vaccine, resulting in tens of thousands of cases of HBV infection. Although the resultant epidemic has faded from contemporary thought, major new policy decisions should be aware of Robert Burns' timeless admonition about the best-laid plans of mice and men. Read: The Yellow Fever Vaccine Misadventure of 1942 by Dr John Marr in the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice [https://journals.lww.com/jphmp/Fulltext/2017/11000/The_Yellow_Fever_Vaccine_Misadventure_of_1942.18.aspx].

"Along with chlorination, pasteurization, and sanitation," Dr Marr said in an email, "immunization has been one of the most successful tools in the history of public health -- but some were serious failures. The 1955 Cutter polio vaccine mishap caused polio; in the mid-1960s an attenuated measles [vaccine] led to the atypical measles syndrome; the 1976 swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] initiative may have been responsible for an epidemic of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome; in 2017 a Philippine dengue fever vaccine induced hemorrhagic dengue syndrome in recipients when they contracted a natural dengue virus; in 2001 a Lyme disease vaccine was withdrawn because of serious side reactions. Untoward and unexpected sequelae of immunizations have a long undistinguished history but a little known adverse vaccine-associated epidemic in 1942 was the largest in our country's history."

A new JAMA Viewpoint by Shah, Marks, and Hahn provides some reassurance that the FDA is aware of these concerns and has issued guidance, summarized below, to help ensure the safety and efficacy of any new COVID-19 vaccine that will be used widely in the US.

- Clear recommendations around efficacy thresholds -- "[T]he primary efficacy endpoint point estimate for a placebo-controlled efficacy trial should be at least 50%, and the statistical success criterion should be that the lower bound of the appropriately alpha-adjusted confidence interval (CI) around the primary efficacy endpoint point estimate is higher than 30%."

- Population diversity in clinical trials to ensure a comprehensive assessment of product safety and effectiveness to properly inform decision making, which includes disproportionately affected populations such as racial and ethnic minorities, older adults, and individuals with medical comorbidities.

- Safety considerations prior to the initiation of most large-scale COVID-19 vaccine trials, including postmarket surveillance such as the FDA's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and the Sentinel Initiative, coupled with existing federal collaborations on vaccine safety to ensure that infrastructure is in place for pharmacovigilance, especially for certain subpopulations.

Vaccines have made the world safer and healthier. Immunizations are critically important to the elimination (or near elimination) of infectious diseases such as smallpox and polio and help to reduce seasonal flu and other viruses. Still, it's imperative that we heed the lessons of past vaccine misadventures as we work quickly and carefully to develop a new vaccine for COVID-19 that the public can trust.

[A timely reminder of the history of vaccine associated problems. There was also the original rotavirus vaccine that was implicated in cases of intussusception. If a vaccine is prematurely released and leads to serious problems it will further erode confidence in vaccines on the part of the general public, something that will lead to many more serious problems and increased morbidity and mortality from vaccine preventable diseases. - Mod.MPP]

[2] New Zealand: new cases
A. Auckland
Date: Tue 11 Aug 2020
Source: ABC News, Associated Press (AP report) [edited]
https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/coronavirus-breaks-zealand-102-days-72301218


New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday [11 Aug 2020] that authorities have found 4 cases of the coronavirus in one Auckland household from an unknown source, the 1st reported cases of local transmission in the country in 102 days.

Ardern said Auckland, the nation's largest city, will be moved to alert level 3 from midday Wednesday [12 Aug 2020] through midnight Friday [14 Aug 2020], meaning that people will be asked to stay at home, while bars and many other businesses will be closed. "These 3 days will give us time to assess the situation, gather information, make sure we have widespread contact tracing so we can find out more about how this case arose and make decisions about how to respond to it once we have further information," Ardern said at a hastily called news conference late Tuesday [11 Aug 2020].

"I know that this information will be very difficult to receive," Ardern said. "We had all hoped not to find ourselves in this position again. But we had also prepared for it. And as a team, we have also been here before." She said that traveling into Auckland will be banned unless people live there and are traveling home.

She said the rest of the country will be raised to level 2 through Friday [14 Aug 2020], meaning that mass gatherings will be limited to 100 attendees and people would need to socially distance themselves from each other.

Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the infections were confirmed after a person in their 50s went to their doctor on Monday [10 Aug 2020] with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. 6 other people in the person's household were then tested, with 3 more positive results.

"Importantly, the person has no history of overseas travel," Bloomfield said, adding that the source of the infections remains unknown.

Until Tuesday [11 Aug 2020], the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travelers who had recently returned from abroad and were being held in quarantine at the border. The country has been praised globally for its virus response.

New Zealand initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March [2020] when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease. That stopped its spread. Life had returned to normal for many people in the South Pacific nation of 5 million, as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent. New Zealanders have never routinely worn masks, but authorities have been urging people to buy them just in case.

[New Zealand has been a model country for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, having gone several months with occasional single digit cases confirmed. From 21 May 2020 to 16 Jun 2020, there were 25 consecutive days with no newly confirmed cases (according to Worldometer data). The identification of a cluster (household based) of 4 cases with no history of travel is disconcerting as it may be a result of silent community based transmission ongoing in the country. As an Island Nation they have the advantage of being able to regulate their borders. It will be interesting to learn of the epidemiologic investigation of this cluster to see if there may have been contact with returning travelers. - Mod.MPP]

B. Christchurch retirement villages NOT COVID-19

https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/300080008/coronavirus-residents-from-two-christchurch-retirement-villages-test-negative-for-covid19


Residents from 2 Christchurch retirement villages who were displaying signs of respiratory illness and flu-like symptoms have tested negative for coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2]. Several residents at The Village Palms Retirement Village in Shirley were swabbed for COVID-19 on Tuesday [11 Aug 2020] after displaying signs of respiratory illness. Their family members were notified and the residents were placed in lockdown. A further 8 residents from Brookhaven Retirement Village in Woolston were also tested and put in isolation awaiting results after they displayed flu-like symptoms last week [week of 3 Aug 2020].

However, Health Minister Chris Hipkins told Newstalk ZB on Wednesday morning [12 Aug 2020] the results had come back negative. "The advice I had last night was that the tests there had all been negative so there is no link at all," he said. Auckland has moved back to level 3 lockdown, while the rest of the country is in alert level 2 after 4 new cases of COVID-19 were identified in south Auckland.

The Government is urgently trying to work out where the case came from, as no link to the border or overseas travel has been established.

[In areas where there are no restrictions on movement and mass gatherings, there is the usual daily life with free movement of people and other viruses responsible for flu-like symptoms, including the influenza virus. That being said, outbreaks in retirement homes are definitely cause for concern as the residents are at high risk of serious disease.

Auckland is located in the North Island and Christchurch is located in the South Island. For a map of New Zealand see https://www.planetware.com/map/new-zealand-new-zealand-map-nz-nz.htm. - Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO situation report 204 (as of 11 Aug 2020)
Date: Tue 11 Aug 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200811-covid-19-sitrep-204.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 11 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Nearly 20 million cases of COVID-19 have now been recorded. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros stressed that behind these statistics there is a great deal of pain and suffering. He emphasized that 'There are 2 essential elements to addressing the pandemic effectively. Leaders must step up to take action and citizens need to embrace new measures...My message is crystal clear: suppress, suppress, suppress the virus'.

- Dr Tedros sent a message of solidarity to the people of Beirut in the aftermath of the massive explosion which killed over 150 people, injured more than 6000, and made over 300 000 people homeless. 'To the people of Beirut, the health workers and emergency workers on the ground, our thoughts are with you and we will continue to support you', he said. WHO has sent surgical and major trauma supplies and personal protective equipment worth USD 1.7 million, as well as providing support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, address psychosocial needs, and facilitate the rapid restoration of damaged health facilities. WHO has issued an appeal for USD 76 million in support of this work.

- A large shipment of medical respirators, medical masks, goggles, and gowns -- worth Euro 1.1 million [about USD 1.3 million] -- was recently delivered to the Republic of Moldova. The shipment was funded by the European Union and procured by WHO to help health care workers respond effectively and safely to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Young people have an important role to play in the COVID-19 pandemic, both in terms of reducing transmission and in engaging in the response. Tomorrow [12 Aug 2020] we celebrate International Youth Day. This is explored in the 'Subject in Focus' below.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 49.5% of the global newly reported cases and 53.4% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 10.6 million cases. The USA reported 44.9% of cases (47 964), followed by Brazil 21.5% (23 010), Colombia 9.9% (10 611), Peru 6.6% (7012), Argentina 4.4% (4688), Mexico 4.1% (4376), and Chile 1.9% (1988).

- The European region reported 9.9% of the global newly reported cases and 6.3% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 23.2% (4945) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by (Spain 0 % (0), Kazakhstan 0% (0), France 21.7% (4619), Turkey 5.6% (1193), Ukraine 5.4% (1158), Germany 4.5% (966), Israel 4.1% (884), UK 3.8% (816), Romania 3.7% (779), Uzbekistan 3.4% (725), Poland 2.9% (619), and the Netherlands 2.7% (575). Countries not reporting any new cases include Spain, Belgium, and Kazakhstan.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.1% of the global newly reported cases and 10.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 26.3% (3484) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 16.1% (2132), Morocco 15.5% (2056), Saudi Arabia 9.5% (1257), Libya 5.3% (697), Kuwait 5.2% (687), Pakistan 4.0% (531), Palestinian Authority 3.6% (470), Bahrain 2.9% (386), Qatar 2.4% (315), and Lebanon 2.2% (295). Cases are continuing to increase in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 3.5% of the global newly reported cases and 6.4% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 49.5% (3739) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ethiopia 10.2% (773), Algeria 6.6% (498), Kenya 6.5% (492), Nigeria 3.8% (290), and Ghana 2.8% (209). While South Africa is the dominant country in the region, it has almost halved its daily case count in the past 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 3.9% of the global newly reported cases and 1.2% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 80.5% (6725) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 11.2% (938), Australia 3.7% (313), Singapore 2.3% (188), China 1.4% (113), and South Korea 0.41% (34). The Philippines doubled the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Japan and Australia continue with elevated transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 27.2% of the global newly reported cases and 22.4% of global deaths. India reported 91.3% (53 601) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 5.0% (2907) and Indonesia 2.9% (1687). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same, even with residual weekend reporting artifact. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries that have resurgences of cases associated with lifting of restrictions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (10 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (61 252), followed by Brazil (54 923), and USA (54 511) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (52.4%). There were 7082 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, USA, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Spain, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3396 to 61 252. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Bolivia, Bangladesh, Philippines, South Africa, Iran, Venezuela, Israel, Indonesia, Chile, and Saudi Arabia; their range of reported new cases is 1521 to 3329.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change (an increase of 0.43%,) and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 1.1%. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether this is a reporting artifact. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind!).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; albeit, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases and deaths (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate is stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with cases increasing daily, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
