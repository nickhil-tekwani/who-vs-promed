A total of 2046 cases and 98 deaths (case fatality rate, 4.8 percent) have
been reported from 14 Jun to 22 Aug 2004 in Western Chad, some distance
from the refugee camps in the east of the country. The outbreak started in
Massaguet (Hadjar Lamine) north of N'Djamena; from there it spread to Lac
and Kanem provinces as well as to the capital city N'Djamena. The previous
week a total of 453 new cases occurred in N'Djamena.
No cases have been reported from the Eastern part of Chad where the
refugees from Darfur are gathering, though they are seen to be at high
risk. They have only limited access to water and proper sanitation is
scarce, with the rainy season ongoing.
In N'Djamena, the city council together with the Ministry of Health and
other partners are working to improve sanitation and access to safe water.

Death toll from Sierra Leone cholera outbreak rises to 53
--------------------------------------------------
A new outbreak of cholera is continuing to claim lives in Sierra Leone,
health officials said, with the death toll rising to 53 from a total of
some 531 cases.
Torrential rains have overwhelmed the war-ravaged west African state's
already decrepit sanitation system, sending raw sewage seeping into the
streets of the capital, Freetown. The city has become an incubator for the
water-borne bacterial disease, which manifests itself through diarrhea and
severe dehydration, one hygienist told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Doctors are blaming the "unhygienic practices" of most people, imploring
them to wash their hands after using the toilet and to take greater care in
preparing and handling food. "The situation is further aggravated by many
traders ignoring warnings to cover food displayed to the public," the
hygienist said.
Initially confined to the Freetown area, particularly the eastern Rokupa
district, the outbreak has spread to Yeliboya, an archipelago nestled in
the Atlantic Ocean near Guinea, local media reported.
Though there had been no cholera in Sierra Leone for the past 4 years, the
15 islands that make up Yeliboya are regularly infected with the disease
due to poor sanitation.

Cholera Epidemic Associated with Raw Vegetables - Lusaka, Zambia, 2003-2004
--------------------------------------------------
Zambia experienced widespread cholera epidemics in 1991 (13 154 cases),
1992 (11 659), and 1999 (11 327) (1). In response to the large outbreak in
1999, the Zambian Ministry of Health (ZMOH) urged use of in-home
chlorination with the locally produced solution, Clorin, and the practice
increased substantially Clorin had been introduced in Zambia in 1998 as
part of the Safe Water System (SWS), a point-of-use water disinfection and
safe-water storage strategy* launched by the Society for Family Health, in
partnership with ZMOH, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and
CDC. Although no outbreaks were reported during 2000-2002, cholera remained
endemic.
Epidemic cholera returned to Zambia in November 2003, when cases of
toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor were
confirmed in the capital city, Lusaka. During 28 Nov 2003- 4 Jan 2004, an
estimated 2529 cholera cases and 128 cholera deaths (case-fatality rate
[CFR] = 5.1 percent) occurred in Lusaka. In Feb 2004, the Lusaka District
Health Management Team (LDHMT) invited CDC to assist in an investigation of
the epidemic. This report summarizes the results of that investigation,
which implicated foodborne transmission via raw vegetables and demonstrated
a protective role for hand washing with soap. The results underscore the
importance of hygiene, clean water, and sanitary food handling for cholera
prevention.
In response to increasing cases, Zambian authorities began opening
designated cholera-treatment centers (CTCs) in Lusaka in Dec 2003. All 7
CTCs were functional by early Jan 2004, and all patients with suspected
cholera were referred to these facilities. During 5 Jan- 1 Mar, an
additional 2101 cases and 25 deaths from cholera (CFR = 1.2 percent) were
recorded at CTCs in Lusaka. Investigators conducted a matched case-control
study to identify risk factors for cholera. A case was defined as watery
diarrhea in a person aged >5 years, who was admitted to the Chawama or
Kanyama CTC during 11-22 Feb 2004. Stool cultures were performed for all
eligible patients. Homes of enrolled patients were visited, and one age-,
sex-, and neighborhood-matched control per case was selected systematically
from neighboring households.
A total of 71 case-control pairs were enrolled in the study. _V. cholerae_
O1 was identified in stool cultures from 52 (74 percent) patients. Both
bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed, comparing all cases
with culture-confirmed cases; because data were comparable for the 2
groups, results are reported for all cases in aggregate. The median age of
patients was 27 years (range: 5-75 years); 58 percent were male. Common
symptoms, in addition to diarrhea, included vomiting (61 [86 percent]) and
leg cramps (44 [62 percent]).
Bivariate analysis indicated that consumption of raw vegetables was
associated with cholera (matched odds ratio [MOR] = 3.9; 95 percent
confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-9.6; p = 0.0004). Hand soap was observed in
41 (58 percent) case homes and 64 (90 percent) control homes. Presence of
hand soap was considered a proxy for actual hand washing and was determined
to be protective (MOR = 0.14; 95 percent CI = 0.05-0.40; p = 0.0001).
Consumption of kapenta, a local sardine-like dietary staple, also was
protective (MOR = 0.35; 95 percent CI = 0.2-0.8; p = 0.005). Drinking
untreated water was reported by 48 (67 percent) case-patients and 37 (52
percent) controls, but the association with disease did not reach
statistical significance (MOR = 1.9; 95 percent CI = 0.9-3.9; p = 0.06).
In-home chlorination of drinking water with Clorin was reported by 48 (67
percent) controls and 47 (66 percent) case-patients. Free chlorine
residuals were detected in stored water in 19 (27 percent) case homes and
14 (20 percent) control homes (MOR = 1.5; 95 percent CI = 0.7--3.3; p = 0.21).
Kapenta, raw vegetables, presence of soap, and in-home water treatment were
included in a multivariate model. Water treatment, either by boiling or
home chlorination, was not significantly protective. Consumption of raw
vegetables remained significantly associated with cholera (adjusted odds
ratio [AOR] = 4.7; 95 percent CI = 1.7--13.0). The presence of hand soap
remained significantly protective against cholera (AOR = 0.1; 95 percent CI
= 0.04--0.40), as did consumption of kapenta (AOR = 0.3; 95 percent CI =
0.1--0.7).
On the basis of these results, the Zambian Central Board of Health and
LDHMT enhanced cholera-prevention efforts by reinforcing hand-washing
promotion messages and recommending that vegetables be cooked or washed in
treated water. Plans were created to improve hygiene and increase
availability of latrines at Lusaka's major market to minimize
cross-contamination of produce. Long-term prevention measures under
discussion by local authorities include improving the quality and quantity
of municipal water supplies. In Apr 2004, cholera cases declined
dramatically, and LDHMT closed the CTCs.

Editorial Note:
This month marks the 150th anniversary of the removal of the famed Broad
Street pump handle after John Snow's classic study of epidemic cholera in
London. Cholera is caused by toxigenic _V. cholerae_, serogroup O1 or O139.
Infection can result in rapidly progressive, profuse, dehydrating diarrhea,
with CFRs >22 percent when treatment is delayed (2). Cholera, which is
still propagated by many of the same vehicles described by John Snow in the
mid-1800s (3), remains a public health threat in sub-Saharan Africa and
certain Asian countries. In 2003, the WHO reported a total of 111 575
cholera cases and 1894 deaths (CFR = 1.7 percent) in 45 countries; 97
percent of reported cases occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (4). In recent
decades, the CFR of cholera has decreased because of dramatic improvements
in oral and intravenous rehydration therapy (5).
In this epidemic of cholera, the primary mode of transmission was foodborne
rather than waterborne, a possibility recognized by Snow (3). The
implication of vegetables as a vehicle of transmission in this epidemic
emphasizes the need for further assessment of produce hygiene during
transport, delivery, and use in the home.
This investigation also documented the widespread acceptance of the SWS in
cholera-affected communities in Lusaka. Implemented as a pilot project in
Zambia in 1998, SWS has been determined to reduce the risk for diarrhea
by >40 percent (7). The SWS consists of Clorin, a dilute solution of
locally produced sodium hypochlorite bleach, packaged and marketed for
disinfection of water in the home, and promotion of plastic 20-liter
jerricans for safe storage of treated water. The demand for Clorin
escalated during the 1999 cholera epidemic, and sales increased steadily in
subsequent years. In 2003, approximately 1.7 million bottles of Clorin were
sold in Zambia. Findings of this investigation suggest that, 5 years after
introduction of the SWS in Zambia, >20 percent of persons residing in
Lusaka's shantytown purchase Clorin solution and add it to their water.
The presence of soap in the home, which serves as a proxy for improved
hygiene, was protective against cholera during this investigation. This
finding is consistent with other studies that suggest hand washing reduces
the risk for diarrhea by >40 percent (8) and echoes the work of Snow, who
implicated poor hand hygiene in cholera transmission.
Approximately 50 percent of Zambia's 10 million residents live in cities.
An estimated 60 percent of the 2 million residents of Lusaka reside in
shantytowns without municipal water supplies or sewer systems (9). Snow's
London of 1854 resembles numerous cities in the developing world today,
where inadequate water and sanitation services and overcrowding contribute
to a high burden of preventable diseases such as cholera. An estimated 1.1
billion persons in the world live without access to improved water supplies
such as piped municipal systems; hundreds of millions more use inadequate
systems, which routinely provide water that is contaminated and unsafe.
Waterborne transmission of enteric pathogens contributes to the estimated 2
million diarrheal deaths that occur among children aged <5 years each year
(10). In recognition of this continuing problem, member states of the
United Nations established a Millennium Development Goal for Water to
reduce by half the proportion of persons without sustainable access to safe
drinking water by 2015. To achieve this goal, an estimated 300 000 persons
must gain access to safe drinking water each day for the next 11 years.
Even if this challenge is met, more than half a billion persons will still
lack access to safe drinking water. As in Snow's day, field epidemiology
and practical prevention strategies remain critical to meeting public
health challenges in the modern world.

[4] Cholera - Cameroon

Village Crier Joins Cameroon's War on Cholera
---------------------------------------------
With his trumpet and loud hailer the Fessett village crier in this Cameroon
community has a message that may save lives. Emerging at dusk, when the
streets are filled with farmers trudging home, boys bearing firewood and
little girls carrying buckets of water, the crier sounds his horn and begins.
"When you come home after the day's labor in the field, make sure you have
a wash. Always wash your hands before and after your meals," he cries. The
village crier is at the forefront of the battle against cholera, a deadly
intestinal infection spread by contaminated water and food that has broken
out in this part of Cameroon for the 1st time since 1997.
Africa had been free of cholera for more than century when the disease hit
western regions in 1970. It spread quickly and eventually became endemic
across most of the continent. In 2004 so far, there have been deadly
outbreaks in Mozambique in the South, Chad, Cameroon and Democratic
Republic of Congo in the center and Guinea in the West, killing at least
333 people. Since 2001, cholera outbreaks have hit a further 10 African
countries including South Africa, Nigeria and Ivory Coast.
The disease, which can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death, has
infected at least 6400 people and killed more than 130 in Cameroon so far
in 2004, according to government figures. In Fessett, 150 people became ill
and 18 died in the first 3 weeks of the outbreak in May 2004, said Ahmadou
Nsangou, chief of the community of 15 000.
While enlisting a village crier to educate people about how to contain the
disease was a local initiative, aid organizations and the authorities in
the capital Yaounde launched a concerted public health campaign to bring
the outbreak under control. Measures included making treatment for all
cholera patients free of charge, rushing extra doctors to hospitals in
hard-hit towns, and sending mobile teams to rural areas to teach people
basic hygiene in house-to-house missions. In the southwestern coastal town
of Limbe, authorities decreed every Wednesday would be devoted to public
cleanliness campaigns.
Offices and shops closed and taxis stopped running to get as many people as
possible involved.
Cholera breaks out almost every year in Cameroon, usually in the major port
city of Douala, where hundreds of thousands of slum-dwellers depend for
water on improvised wells that are often adjacent to latrine pits. In the
giant shanty of Bepanda, 80 percent of people do not have access to safe
drinking water, and poor drainage leaves pools of stagnant water and piles
of waste in densely populated areas -- a perfect breeding ground for cholera.

[5] Cholera - India (Kashmir)
Date: Tue, 31 Sep 2004

A cholera scare has gripped Jammu and Kashmir. Amid fears over the quality
of drinking water supplies in the state, people in some rural areas have
reportedly been affected by cholera. As many as 24 people have been
admitted with cholera-like complaints to a hospital here and at least one
of them, a woman, has tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_, the bacteria
responsible for spreading the disease.
The issue has rocked the state assembly. Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad
Sayeed blamed the media for indulging in "yellow journalism" by carrying
sensational stories about a cholera scare that he said had no basis. But to
Sayeed's embarrassment, the positive cholera test was carried out by the
government-run medical college in Srinagar. Kashmir has earlier been hit by
cholera epidemics that have killed many. With better healthcare and safe
drinking water, locals had forgotten the scourge. But it now seems the
disease could re-visit the Kashmir Valley unless the health department and
the people act fast.
"The problem could be really serious in rural areas where people relieve
themselves in the open. Human feces from an infected person could get into
rivers and other water sources as toilets in villages are usually built
close to water sources," said Pervaiz Koul, a doctor. Kashmir's best-known
gastroenterologist, Muhammad Sultan Khuroo, expressed similar views.
"Cholera invariably spreads through water contaminated with human feces in
the initial stage. Edible items, fluids and linen contamination may spread
the infection secondarily," Khuroo said. "I don't know whether the patients
consumed tap water or some other water, but it must have been highly
contaminated with human excreta," Khuroo said. He also suspected that the
disease might have reached the Kashmir Valley through laborers who came
from other states.

Watery diarrhea: Srinagar on red alert
--------------------------------------
Amid reports of "watery diarrhea" spreading in many pockets of Srinagar, a
red alert has been sounded in all the city hospitals. The doctors and
paramedical staff have been instructed to take precautionary measures while
treating such patients.
During the last 3 days, more than 150 patients suffering from dysentery,
vomiting and severe dehydration have been treated in SMHS and Valley's
premier hospital, SKIMS. Many patients, mostly from the city suburbs, are
still admitted in the hospitals.
A 50-year-old woman from Kawadara pocket of the summer capital died and
doctors who treated her confirmed that she died of cholera. "This is the
only confirmed case of cholera death. Most of the other patients admitted
in different are hospitals are suffering from gastroenteritis," said a
doctor at SKIMS.
In fact, it was only after the death on Thu, 26 Aug 2004, that an alert was
sounded in Srinagar hospital. "After the death, a meeting of department of
emergency medicines, gastroenterology, nephrology, microbiology, nursing
administration and hospital management was called by the authorities,"
disclosed Dr Syed Amin Tabish, medical administrator of SKIMS. "We have to
be alert, but there is no need for any panic," he said, adding that Ward 2A
of the hospital was vacated from the indoor patients, as those suffering
from gastroenteritis are now admitted in the ward. He termed this disease
as 'watery diarrhea'.
"Recently, we have marked an increase in the number of patients who have
gastroenteritis which follows a refractory course. All precautionary
measures have been taken which include immediate isolation of the patient,
intravenous fluid, antibiotics, investigations, including cultures and
transporting culture media," remarked Dr Syed Zafferullah, a senior
resident at SKIMS.
Senior doctors believe that the disease had been transmitted through
"contaminated" drinking water. "The source of its outbreak is water and we
advise people to consume only boiled water," said Dr Tabiash, adding that
they had constituted a team of microbiologists to examine the quality of
water from the localities from which reports of disease had come.

Borderland in brief: Cholera-like germ is in Ascarate Lake water
--------------------------------------------------
Bacteria that can cause diarrhea has been found in Ascarate Lake, prompting
health officials to caution people not to water ski on the lake, allow its
water to enter cuts or eat fish from the lake without cooking it properly.
The _Vibrio cholerae_ germ, a non-01 type, is "not the toxic bad one that
we worry about becoming a cholera epidemic," said Dr. Jose Magana, director
of the City-County Health and Environmental District. The contamination
resulted from runoff of pollutants after rain combined with warm weather,
he said. Drier weather and cooler temperatures should stop the problem.
[Non 0-1 (and Non O-139) _V. cholerae_ isolates do cause less severe
disease and are not uncommonly associated with cases along the Gulf Coast
of the USA. Cases, however, have been documented associated with shellfish
in New England. - Mod.LL]
