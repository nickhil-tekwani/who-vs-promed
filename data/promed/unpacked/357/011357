[In response to a German subscriber's request for official information
on a measles epidemic in Italy, Dr. Stefania Salmaso was contacted and
her reply is below. - Mod.MPP]

Regarding the measles outbreak in Campania, in the period January-
April 2002 data from the sentinel pediatric surveillance show an
incidence of approximately 1600 cases per 100 000 population, which
corresponds to more than 15 000 cases in children less than 15 years of
age. The highest incidence is in the age group 5-9 years, followed by
10-14 years. These data refer only to Campania and are based on the
observation of 41 000 children less than 15 years of age (that is 4
percent of the regional total of the same age group).
In the period January-May 2002 there were 368 hospitalizations in
Campania due to measles, 83 percent of which were in children less
than 14 years of age. There were 13 cases of encephalitis (all in
individuals less than 20 years of age) and 3 deaths (in children aged 6
months, 4 and 10 years).
The epidemic is attributable to a poor vaccination coverage (the most
recent estimate refers to the 1998 birth cohort, and is of 53 percent by
24 months of age). In May 2002, the Campania Regional Health
Authority recommended vaccinating all the susceptible children and
adolescents. Since there were cases in children less than 1 year of age,
vaccination was recommended also in infants aged 6-11 months, who
must receive a 2nd dose after 12 months of age.
Measles cases were also observed in the 20 other regions in Italy, but
the incidence is much lower (a mean of 33 per 100 000 cases). Data on
the monthly incidence of measles cases by region are available on the
web in Italian:
The first international announcement of this outbreak appeared in the 4
Apr 2002 Eurosurveillance Weekly. There will be an update provided
to Eurosurveillance Weekly for this week.

[Many thanks to Dr. Salmaso for this report. For readers who are
interested in seeing the monthly incidence data with an excellent
mapping by region, go to <http://www.spes.iss.it/Report.htm> and
select the month of interest: for disease (mallatia) put in "morbillo" for
measles. The data on the website are very well presented and readable
even for those of us who do not read Italian. As clearly stated in the
above summary, the ongoing outbreak is related to low vaccination
coverages with a resultant large cohort of susceptibles, a situation in
which a resultant outbreak is not unexpected. The measures taken to
start immunization at 6 months of age with a follow-up dose after 12
months of age are prudent. - Mod.MPP]
