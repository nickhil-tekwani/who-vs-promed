A new case of Venezuelan equine encephalitis [VEE] was registered this weekend [14-15 Apr 2012] in the locality of La Paila in the Zarzal municipality, with the death of an asymptomatic equine animal. The 1st registered case of this viral disease occurred last month [March 2012] in the Macropolis zone of the Obando municipality, and was effectively controlled.

However, because the infection, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and affects mules, horses, and donkeys can reach humans, a contingency plan led by the departmental [state equivalent] Health Secretariat, the San Rafael Hospital in Zarzal, the UES [Sanitation Implementation Unit], the mayor's office of the municipality, and ICA [Colombian Institute for Agriculture] was activated this weekend [14-15 Apr 2012].

"It is a joint effort that begins with a census done with the 402 equine animals of the area, a search for asymptomatic cases that may exist around the area, and the elimination of mosquito breeding sites through fumigation. Above all, human cases of the disease are sought to be able to control VEE, as in the case of Obando, and be able to bring to the community in this area a little tranquility," explained the Secretary of Health of the Valle del Cauca department, Jaime Mosque Borja.

Carolina Ocampo, Director of the Municipal Agricultural Technical Assistance Unit (Umata) of Zarzal. stated that the group along with ICA, has vaccinated 848 equine animals in the municipality and that animals in the area are being evaluated.

The Director of the Executive Health Unit of the Cauca Valley, Leonardo Vidal, stated that fumigation activities and search for mosquito breeding sites are being carried out and also stated they will deliver mosquito nets and [mosquito] repellants to the community. We will help the municipality concerning the census and will prevent the propagation of the virus to the inhabitants of the Zarzal municipality," he concluded. [Equine animals are both reservoirs and amplifiers of the virus. There can be spillover from equine animals to humans, via vector mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]

The Health Department Secretariat recommended that the Zarzal and Valle del Cauca communities around the focus of infection consult with health professionals in case of presenting with symptoms, be continuously hydrated, and above all, not self medicate.

If the virus is not treated promptly, it can become transmitted between humans and lead to death. [This statement is not correct -- see comment below. - Mod.TY]

[Transmission between humans is not significant in VEE virus outbreaks. Because equine animals are the important hosts, equine vaccination is the only effective way to halt cases both equine and human. Although equine case fatality rates can be very high (up to 80 per cent), the human case fatality rate is less than one per cent.

The report does not indicate how the laboratory diagnosis of VEE virus was made, or which virus subtype was responsible. VEE virus subtypes IAB and IC are usually responsible for outbreaks in equine animals in South America. If the case was in fact due to VEE virus, prompt response with equine vaccination when an equine case occurs, as was done in this situation, is the key to control. Presumably, when the report speaks of asymptomatic equine animals, they are referring to neurological symptoms.

Because isolation of infectious VEE virus is difficult from dead or moribund animals, an effective strategy is to take the temperature of pasture-mates and draw blood from febrile, but apparently normal animals for virus isolation.

The only way to effectively prevent human cases is to prevent equine transmission with subsequent spillover to humans. The report is incorrect in indicating that prompt treatment of human cases prevents ongoing human-to-human transmission.
