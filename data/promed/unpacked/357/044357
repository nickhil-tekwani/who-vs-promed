This [Thu 7 Dec 2017] Jundiaí registered its 1st case of suspected human yellow fever. According to the Health Management and Promotion Unit, the patient is a 55-year-old man, resident of the Ivoturucaia neighborhood region. He is hospitalized since [29 Nov 2017] in the intensive care unit of a private hospital in the city.

According to the Director of Epidemiological Surveillance, Fauzia Abul Abbas Raiza, the man was the only member of his family who had not been vaccinated against the disease. "The patient is suspected of having yellow fever and also leptospirosis. The confirmatory tests take up to 30 days to be completed," stated Fauzia.

After being notified of the suspected [case], Epidemiological Surveillance today [7 Dec 2017] initiated house-to-house vaccination in the Ivoturucaia region seeking to immunize residents who had not yet been vaccinated.

The municipal government stated that 92 percent of the population of the city has now been vaccinated against the disease. Even so, with the permanent circulation of the virus [in the forest cycle], the vaccine will be continuously available to the populations of the 36 basic health units, including those units with ample hours of operation (Tamoio, Hortolândia, Agapeama, and Novo Horizonte).

[If this case is confirmed as yellow fever (YF), presumably, it is another instance of spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission. The swift response of Epidemiological Surveillance to vaccinate previously unvaccinated individuals is an important step in prevention of spread either from the forest cycle or the _Aedes aegypti_ urban cycle of transmission.

Ivoturucaia is located 57 km (35 mi) north of São Paulo. Maps of Brazil can be accessed at http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5496846,6. - Mod.TY]

At the end of November [2017], the Rio Pardo Valley [Rio Grande do Sul] registered the 1st death from yellow fever [confirmed? - Mod.RNA] after 8 years. Since 2009, when there was an outbreak of the disease, the region ceased to be considered an area of transmission. In that earlier era, there were 11 cases with 2 deaths, both in Vera Cruz. This time, the victim, from Candelária, is 36 years old and died on [24 Nov 2017] in the Ana Nery Hospital in Santa Cruz do Sul.

According to his family, the man was healthy, played sports and was never sick [was not vaccinated against yellow fever? - Mod.RNA]. He was married, with a 7-year-old son. About 10 days before he died he was in a resort in the interior of Vera Cruz, where his father indicated that he had contact with an infected mosquito. "My son is gone, but it is necessary to alert other people so as not to become victims of the disease," he stated.

The man, who worked with his father in the family quarters, began to feel headaches, body aches, and fever [when? - Mod.RNA]. He sought medical attention in Candelária, where the 1st [disease] suspected was leptospirosis. When his condition worsened, he was admitted to the Ana Nery Hospital on [23 Nov 2017], where he was admitted to the intensive care unit but died the night of [24 Nov 2017].

Blood samples were sent to Health Surveillance in Santa Cruz do Sul in Porto Alegre, where the cause of death was confirmed [as yellow fever? Which tests were done and what were the results? - Mod.RNA]. According to the Coordinator of Health Surveillance of Regional Health Coordination (13th CRS), Beanir Lara, 2 additional complementary tests [other samples? Which tests? - Mod.RNA] were sent to São Paulo and the results should become available soon.

However, in addition to compatible symptoms, the initial diagnosis [what initial diagnosis -- laboratory? - Mod.RNA] confirmed the death as yellow fever.

Beanir points out that at the beginning of the year [2017], the State Center for Health Surveillance (Cevs/RS) issued an epidemiological alert for yellow fever, with recommendations to the savanna municipalities. Last month [November 2017] a 2nd communication was issued. "It is not necessary to panic. Those who have had a dose of the [yellow fever] vaccine at some point in their lives are protected," she stated, recalling that [previously] the dose had to be reapplied every 10 years, but that there is no such requirement now. [The patient in question resided in an area with a vaccination recommendation. There is no mention of his vaccine status. Was he vaccinated? If not, why not? - Mod.RNA]

On [Mon 11 Dec 2017] the Municipal Health Secretary, Renice Vaccari, intends to meet with representatives of the 13th Regional Health Coordination [organization] to draw up a strategy for how to act now in Santa Cruz do Sul. The intention is that more doses of the vaccine be sent to the municipality as a preventive measure. According to Beanir, physicians will be advised to be alert to symptoms and outreach campaigns on the disease will be strengthened.

[Other information concerning this possible case was not found. For now, the information above is the only that has been identified. For that reason, until further information is forthcoming and new official or unofficial news becomes available, it will be assumed that this is a possible case and is still suspect.

If confirmed, this would be a confirmed case in an area already considered one of transmission risk in the southern region of Brazil. However, it would be confirmation after years of an "epidemiological lull" in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and in a year where until then, all the attention (and prioritization of doses of vaccines, laboratory resources have been focused in the Southeast region of the country.

Additional information will be extremely important and more than welcome. - Mod.RNA

The constant concern with the yellow fever cases this year (2017) in Brazil is that spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle, which occurs widely in Brazil, could initiate urban, _Aedes aegypti_ transmission. Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses have been transmitted widely in Brazil this year (2017) indicating that this vector mosquito is abundant. The concern is compounded by the fact that significant segments of the human population have not been vaccinated against yellow fever. Health authorities in affected areas have initiated vaccination campaigns and, so far, no urban cases have been reported. The risk, however is real, and intensified surveillance is essential. - Mod.TY
