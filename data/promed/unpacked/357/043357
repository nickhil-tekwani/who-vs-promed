Ivory Coast: H5N1-infected birds reported
-----------------------------------------
Agricultural authorities in the Ivory Coast report that 30 wild
white-necked ravens have been found dead and 9 tested positive on the
highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1.

The birds died suddenly while they were flying over the secondary
school located at Cocody in Abidjan. The school was closed for 3
days. The staff members who handled the birds are under medical supervision.

The site and its surroundings have been completely disinfected using
Virkon. A surveillance zone was established within a 2 km [1.2 mi]
radius around the point where the birds fell.
