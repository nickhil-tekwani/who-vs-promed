All of the postings and comments emphasizing the importance of reporting
communicable diseases are, of course, correct. They fail to consider,
however, the variety of factors that impede reporting.
It is almost impossible to underestimage the wrath of patients who feel they
are likely to be subject to any sort of discrimination or financial loss as
the result of reporting. They respond with threats of legal action, bodily
harm, and administrative mischief. Yes, the
higher duty to society exists, but the price to be paid for reporting can be
high. Even if the practitioner wins a lawsuit or is cleared by an
administrative board after a
complaint, the financial and personal costs are enormous.
If you don't believe that this happens, consider the case of the Olympic
athletes who collected huge (mulitmillion dollar) settlements against
Olympic authorities after being found positive with state of the art drug
tests. It seems that science seldom satisfies the courts and athletes are
so very popular.
The burden needs to be made clear to society at large, but even then, look
at the delays in the institution of even timid reporting requirements for
AIDS/HIV.
Public education and protection for the front line clinical care
professionals need to be developed much further before reporting can become
effective in our litigious, antiscientific, me-first society.

No argument with your reasons for noting the importance of reporting
reportable diseases. There are a number of other reasons that can also be
given. A basic problem is that in our medical education system, public
health surveilance is not taught or discussed in any detail. Concerning
schools of public health, there are some who do offer a course in public
health surveillance and there are others who mention the topic in one or
several courses, but the full importance is not stressed. This limits the
education to persons already committed to public health.
We need to educate the medical and nursing students to the importance of
disease reporting to the community as well as to themselves and to the
patient. Every state has a law requiring the reporting of reportable
diseases but has a health professional ever been brought to court for not
reporting a reportable disease? I know of no such cases .

Like (I suspect) most ProMED subscribers, I am disappointed and indignant
about the failure of the Texas physician, lab, and hospital to report a
confirmed case of HPS.
However, in terms of public health risk, I think there is an even greater
problem in the US with intentional and negligent non-reporting of sexually
transmitted infections, some of which have emerging resistant strains. If
disciplinary action against the providers who routinely do not report STIs
(and other *communicable* reportable infectious diseases) is undesirable and
impractical, and educational messages aren't getting out
there or are being ignored, what options are left?
Clearly more funding for education and active lab surveillance is needed.
Is there any role for professional disciplinary or legal action? (I'm
asking, not advocating.)
