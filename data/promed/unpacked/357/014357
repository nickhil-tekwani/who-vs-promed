Highly pathogenic avian influenza in Germany: Lifting of restriction measures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(follow-up report no. 3)
Information received on 25 Jun 2003 from Dr Karin Schwabenbauer, Head,
Animal Health Division, Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and
Agriculture, Bonn:
End of previous report period: 4 Jun 2003
End of this report period: 25 Jun 2003.
No further cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been
reported in Germany since 13 May 2003.
In accordance with European Commission (EC) Decision 2003/428/EC, 400
sentinel birds (laying hens), aged 5.5 weeks, were placed in the cleaned
and disinfected affected holding in the district of Viersen on 30 May 2003.
In the process, 160 blood samples were taken, which tested negative in a
serological blood examination. The animals were subjected to clinical tests
every day, with no clinical signs suggestive of the presence of HPAI being
detected.
Upon the expiry of a period of 21 days (on 20 Jun 2003), the birds were
examined for the presence of avian influenza viruses and specific
antibodies, pursuant to subparagraph 9 of the Annex to the aforementioned
Decision. Two random tests were performed to meet the requirements laid
down in the EC Decision. For this purpose, 60 blood samples were tested for
antibodies and 60 carcasses were subjected to virological tests (polymerase
chain reaction = PCR), i.e. a total of 120 animals. All tests yielded
negative findings.
The remaining 280 animals, which did not display any clinical signs, were
culled and safely disposed of on 20 Jun 2003.
Germany has therefore fulfilled all the requirements in relation to
Decision 2003/428/EC and all restriction measures were lifted as of 24 Jun
2003.
The Community measures in relation to avian influenza laid down in Decision
2003/358/EC, last amended by Decision 2003/386/EC, which were still
applicable to the western part of North-Rhine Westphalia, have been lifted.
