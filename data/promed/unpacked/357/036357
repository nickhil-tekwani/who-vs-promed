As many as 10 831 new cases of tuberculosis (TB) have been reported
at state-run health care facilities in 35 districts across Pakistan
during February 2011. This alarming number is a cause of serious
concern for the government particularly in the Punjab province that
accounted for 86 percent of the reported cases in 18 districts.

According to FAFEN's [Free and Fair Election Network] monthly Health
Scan, the number of confirmed cases of TB reported in February 2011 is
double than the 4910 cases of the disease reported a month earlier in
37 districts.

FAFEN Monitors collected the data of disease cases from district
health offices in 64 districts for February 2011. Executive District
Officer (EDO)/Health offices in 24 districts of Punjab, 18 districts
in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), 13 districts in Sindh and 7 districts in
Balochistan, as well as the office of the Agency Surgeon Health (ASH)
in FR Peshawar, and that of the office of Health Management
Information System (HMIS) in ICT shared the requested information with
FAFEN Monitors.

[Pakistan ranks 6th among countries with the highest burden of TB in
the world in 2010
(http://tribune.com.pk/story/133614/pakistan-ranks-sixth-in-tb-patients-who/),
and Pakistan contributes about 44 percent of the tuberculosis burden
in WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region
(http://www.ntp.gov.pk/about.htm). About 300 000 new tuberculosis
cases are reported each year in Pakistan
(http://tribune.com.pk/story/133614/pakistan-ranks-sixth-in-tb-patients-who/).
Tuberculosis remains Pakistan's leading cause of death among
infectious diseases
(http://www.usaid.gov/stories/pakistan/fp_pk_tb.html).

The Pakistan Ministry of Health began implementing DOTS (Directly
Observed Therapy, Short-course, the internationally recommended
strategy for TB control) in 1995, with certain regions selected as
pilot programs. However, many patients do not have access to DOTS even
within the designated DOTS areas
(http://www.jpma.org.pk/full_article_text.php?article_id=234). A
study found that a majority of patients with tuberculosis were very
poor, but nonetheless initially sought care from private practitioners

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10619693), who have been found
to have inadequate knowledge to diagnosis and treat the disease
(http://www.jpma.org.pk/full_article_text.php?article_id=234).
Almost all patients in the aforementioned study
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10619693), reported problems
with access to treatment, both in terms of time and money; this was
particularly true of women, whose freedom to travel in Pakistan was
said to be limited. In addition, patients were unwilling to disclose
to health care providers that they had received previous treatment for
tuberculosis, which means that many patients, who had failed a
previous course of drug therapy, were prescribed treatment regimes to
which their pathogen was likely resistant.

Emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) are facilitated by
inadequate detection and treatment. MDR-TB is defined as tuberculosis
resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. XDR-TB is defined as
tuberculosis that has developed resistance to at least rifampin and
isoniazid, as well as to any member of the fluoroquinolone family of
antibiotics and at least one of the following second-line anti-TB
injectable drugs: kanamycin, capreomycin, or amikacin.

Resistance among new cases is defined as the presence of resistant
isolates of _M. tuberculosis_ in patients who, in response to direct
questioning, deny having had any prior anti-TB treatment (for as much
as 1 month) and, in countries where adequate documentation is
available, for whom there is no evidence of such a history. Drug
resistance among new cases is used to evaluate recent transmission.
The impact of including patients with a prior history of TB treatment
may result in an overestimation of the resistance rates among new
cases. Accurate data for Pakistan on the frequency of MDR-TB among new
cases of tuberculosis would be hard to come by in view of the tendency
of Pakistani patients not to disclose their histories of prior
treatment for tuberculosis.

A WHO study reported that the estimated frequency in 2000 of MDR-TB
among all new TB cases of tuberculosis in Pakistan was about 10
percent, but the upper 95 percent confidence limit was about 22
percent
(http://www.emro.who.int/STB/Media/PDF/JID%20paper.pdf). However,
WHO reported that between 2002 and 2007, the estimated frequency for
Pakistan of new MDR-TB cases was 3.4 percent and the upper 95 percent
confidence limit was 18.4 percent, but that Pakistan accounted for 60
percent of the MDR-TB burden within WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region

(http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2008/drs_report4_26feb08.pdf).
For comparison, WHO reports that the highest proportion of MDR-TB
among new cases (>10 percent) occurs in countries of the former Soviet
Union
(http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2008/drs_report4_26feb08.pdf).

In a study of XDR-TB in Pakistan during 2006-2009, a total of 9523
_M. tuberculosis_ strains were isolated in a reference laboratory,
including 3682 (38.7 percent) MDR-TB strains
(http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/9/1473.htm). Although the MDR-TB
rate remained constant, the XDR-TB rate (expressed as a percentage of
MDR-TB isolated in a year) showed a significant increase from 1.5
percent in 2006 to 4.5 percent in 2009. The XDR-TB strains in this
study were genetically diverse, which supports the concept that XDR-TB
in Pakistanis is likely to be a consequence of inadequate treatment of
tuberculosis
(http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/9/1473.htm).

Tuberculosis control in the USA and Western Europe is now tempered by
the burden of TB among foreign-born persons residing in the country.
In the USA, the incidence rate among foreign-born persons is at least
8 times higher than that among U.S.-born persons; the top 5 countries
of origin for foreign-born persons in the USA with TB are Mexico, the
Philippines, Viet Nam, India, and China. In the UK, the incidence rate
of tuberculosis among ethnic minority groups (of which about 50
percent are South Asians,
http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=455) is over 100
times higher than that among the "white" population (see Mod.ML's
comments in ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis - UK: resurgence 20101223.4522).
