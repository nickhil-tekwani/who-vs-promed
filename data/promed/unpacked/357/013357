Through July 2014, the Secretariat of Health of Petrolina, in the inland area of Pernambuco, identified 46 suspected cases of pertussis, almost twice the number as last year (2013), in which the municipality recorded 25 cases.

According to the coordinator of Epidemiological Surveillance, Silvana Mute, Petrolina is the city that has the largest number of suspected cases notified. "We have the largest population, and control of the disease is being done. We recorded the notifications, which is not always done in other cities. A house to house check will be made by the healthcare teams to visit the homes in both rural and urban areas to assess the current vaccination status of children. Children who are not up to date will receive pertussis vaccination at the time of the visit."

[It appears that more of the suspected cases are in children with inadequate immunization. In the USA, most analyses have found in the rising number of cases of pertussis that only 10-15 percent of the total are not immunized. Although not a great number of the total, their risk of acquiring pertussis is higher than those with presumed waning immunity.

Pernambuco is a state of Brazil, located in the Northeast region of the country. The state of Pernambuco also includes the archipelago Fernando de Noronha. To the north are the states of Paraiba and Ceara; to the west is Piaui; to the south are Alagoas and Bahia, and to the east is the Atlantic Ocean. A map of Brazil showing the state's location can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco. - Mod.LL
