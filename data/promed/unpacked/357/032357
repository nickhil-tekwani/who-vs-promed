A case of African swine fever (ASF) has been registered in Pskov region on Friday [19 Jul 2013] as a farm animal contracted the disease in the village of Senyukhino, Nevel district, the regional administration said in a statement.

This was the region's 1st ASF case. Acting regional governor Maxim Zhavoronkov issued a decree ordering that a quarantine zone be established and animals kept on farms in it be seized and slaughtered.

There was a tentative plan to seize and slaughter about 60 animals, according to Pskov region's Chief State Administration for Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine and State Technological Surveillance. In Senyukhino there are only 3 animals. The Velikiye Luki Pig-Raising Complex lies outside the quarantine zone. The local authorities are promising that the disease will be localized shortly.

There have been registered ASF cases among domestic and wild animals in 13 Russian regions and 3 districts in Belarus, which borders Pskov region. Emergency measures launched in north western Russia include sanitary raids into facilities where animal products are sold, setting up sanitary checkpoints on motor roads, and the mass-scale culling of wild boar populations.
