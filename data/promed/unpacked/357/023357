Written Ministerial Statement by Hilary Benn on Specified Animal
Pathogens Order license conditions at Merial Animal Health - 22 Nov 2007
----------------------------------------------
The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Hilary Benn)

I promised to keep the House informed of matters relating to the FMD
outbreak. An incident has occurred at the Merial facility on the
Pirbright site. While the incident was contained, I thought it right
to report the matter given the understandable public interest in this
site. On 6 Nov 2007, Defra restored the Specified Animal Pathogens
Order (SAPO) licence to Merial Animal Health to permit the use of FMD
and bluetongue viruses for vaccine production. The licence was
restored following detailed Defra and HSE inspections that confirmed
that the terms of the licence (including operating procedures and
installation of security measures) had been fully met and that it was
safe for vaccine production to recommence. The licence requires
several layers of biosecurity to be in place. This includes, 1st, a
new facility which has been installed to heat treat waste from virus
production. Secondly, it requires the re-lining, sealing and testing
of the effluent pipes and man hole covers as identified in the HSE
and Spratt reports. Thirdly, the ground above the drains has been
made a contained area and all movements across it controlled with
decontamination required of any one who has need to enter that area.
Lastly, all effluent passes into the chemical treatment facility,
which, as the final layer of biosecurity, would deactivate any live
virus. It is monitored and tested daily.

All of these measures provide several independent layers of safety
and ensure that the process is contained.

On Mon 19 Nov 2007, Merial discovered a shortfall in the quantity of
virus recovered from production batches from the previous week. On
inspection of the vaccine production equipment, they identified
possible technical problems with the functioning of a valve on a pipe
leading from the centrifuge that is used to separate live virus from
waste product. Operations were immediately stopped, and the machine
and associated pipe work were decontaminated with steam. Citric acid
was added in bulk to the effluent sump to disinfect any live virus
that might have leaked out of the centrifuge.

Having been contacted on Monday [19 Nov 2007], an engineer examined
the machine on the morning of Tue 20 Nov 2007. No problems were
identified with the centrifuge, and investigations focused on a valve
on a steam line used to sterilise the associated pipe work. This
valve separates the live virus product line from the line which
provides an outlet for the condensate from the steam cleaning stages.
This water should not come in contact with live virus, but, as a
precaution, does enter the contained drainage system leading to the
final chemical treatment facility. As part of the SAPO licence, we
require Merial to apply rigorous Standard Operating Procedures. In
relation to the valves, these mean that each time the centrifuge is
used, 2 operators must certify that the valve is locked shut, and its
integrity is confirmed by pressure tests before and after each batch.
In addition, the preventive maintenance system includes regular
inspections, and, although the valves on the centrifuge have a 3-year
life expectancy, they are replaced annually.

All these checks must be recorded.

Despite these measures Merial judged that the valve had been leaking,
allowing an unintended probable release of live FMD virus into the
contained drainage system, which was then pumped to the final
chemical treatment facility without being heat treated.

During the course of Tue 20 Nov 2007, Merial arranged for the valve
to be replaced and tested the centrifuge to ensure that it was now
working properly. Merial informed Defra officials at 4 pm of this
incident and of the action that they had taken. Having learned of
this possible breach of an SAPO licence condition, Defra suspended
Merial's SAPO licence with immediate effect.

A joint Defra, HSE and Veterinary Medicine Directorate inspection
team visited the site yesterday [22 Nov 2007] morning. They confirmed
that all work with live virus had stopped; they confirmed the details
of the incident that Merial had reported and carried out detailed
inspection, including of record keeping.

The inspection team judged that while it was possible that live FMD
virus had entered the contained drainage system, from their
discussions and the evidence gathered, they are assured that live
virus has not been released to the environment. The extensive layers
of biosecurity that we require under the SAPO licence effectively
contained the virus in the closed, re-lined drainage system before
deactivation in the chemical treatment facility. The SAPO licence
remains suspended, and the inspection team will produce a full report
to the Acting Chief Veterinary Officer. We will then consider what
further action needs to be taken.

I will report further to the House in due course. Page published: 22 Nov 2007.

[Such events do occur; the utmost value of the double safety measures
in the facility, namely 2 affluent inactivation systems, thermal as
well as chemical, have been clearly demonstrated. Final findings and
conclusions are awaited.

following the previous event (leakage) in Pirbright earlier this year
(2007) can be visited at
