-----------------------------------------------
The ProMED-mail updates are very much valued and followed with interest and
used throughout the network of the International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) worldwide. It is important, therefore, that
the activities and response of the IFRC are [not over-looked and receives
proper recognition. In the Ugandan Ebola haemorrhagic fever situation it
should be noted that the Ugandan Red Cross, the IFRC and the International
Committee of Red Cross remained in Gulu, whilst many/most other
organisations left.
For more than 2 weeks, we have had more than 50 trained volunteers
carrying out house-to-house information dissemination as well as case
finding. Furthermore, we assist with transport, radio communication
equipment, and provision of protective clothing. Together with the Uganda
Ministry of Health, we are printing large numbers of information sheets etc.
Also, an additional 200 - 300 volunteers are now undergoing training in the
9 neighboring districts and in Kampala, who can be utilized more
intensively if there is any further a spread of the disease, despite the
precautions which are now being taken. For further information, please
communicate directly with Hakan Sandbladh via the e-mail address given
below, - or preferably via mobile phone number 41 79 357 16 13.
