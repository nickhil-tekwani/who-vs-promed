Main surveillance developments in weeks 23-24 2012 (4-17 Jun 2012)
------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2011-2012 influenza season has ended but the surveillance of influenza will continue during the off-season period and the bulletin appears on a fortnightly basis until week 40/2012 [week ending 7 Oct 2012].

- During weeks 23-24/2012, all 16 countries reporting experienced low-intensity influenza activity.
- Of 68 sentinel specimens, one was positive for influenza type B virus. Since week 40/2011, 89.3 percent of the detected influenza viruses have been type A and 10.7 percent type B. The A(H3) subtype represented 98.5 percent of influenza A type viruses detected during the 2011-2012 season.
- Many of the A(H3) viruses reacted poorly with post-infection ferret antisera raised against the A/Perth/16/2009 H3N2 vaccine component, prompting the WHO's decision to recommend a change to the A(H3N2) component for the northern hemisphere 2012-13 influenza season. The need for change is consistent with an observed low vaccine effectiveness for the A(H3N2) component.

[2] Thailand (Nakhon Ratchasima): H1N1

The Ministry of Public Health reported Wednesday [20 Jun 2012] that 41 people have been confirmed as being infected with H1N1 influenza in northeastern Nakhon Ratchasima province since early June [2012].

Public Health Ministry Inspector General Kamron Chaisiri said 6 female and 35 male patients, including 6 hospital staff, have been admitted to Nakhon Ratchasima Rajanagarindra Psychiatric Hospital. The Xinhua news agency says initial investigation showed that the 1st flu victim was reported on 12 Jun 2012.

Kamron said all patients were given antiviral flu [medication?] and none of them is in critical condition. The hospital, however, has stopped admitting new patients until the situation is confirmed safe.

Health officials have sampled schools in the province but discovered no other cases of infection.

[3] New Zealand: H3N2

There's been a noticeable spike in the number of influenza cases among New Zealanders in recent weeks. Latest data show the influenza strain A/H3N2 has been most predominant in Auckland and South Canterbury.

Virus expert and National Influenza Specialist Group spokesperson Dr Lance Jennings says the predominance of the H3N2 virus is a major concern. He says infections with this virus can be particularly severe for the elderly, and those with an ongoing medical condition.

Dr Jennings says a major outbreak of H3N2 would cause a surge in hospital admissions and deaths.
