Re: "Officials claim case of mad cow disease found in Ukraine" in
ProMED-mail posting "BSE - update (07) July 20020707.4691 [No 1]"
---------------------------------------
The literal translation of rabies from Russian is "Cow
Madness", "BESHENSTVO" in Russian. This is the reason that Russian
speaking veterinarians -- from former USSR countries -- usually confuse
prion-borne "mad cow disease" with viral rabies, because of the name
similarity. To make things even worse, the translation of "mad cow disease"
from English into Russian is sometimes similar to the name for rabies in
Russian.
Many of the vets are even confused about the fuss around "mad cow disease"
and are amazed that countries like England cannot stop it by simple
vaccinations.

[We are grateful to Artashes Khachatryan for the linguistic approach to
clarifying the issue. We had considered a possible mix-up of terms before
posting the item, but decided to proceed in view of the statement: "Ukraine
suffered a mad cow scare two years ago, but tests later showed that the
suspect cows had died of rabies", demonstrating a clear (linguistic)
differentiation between the two.
If rabies was, indeed, suspected in the village of Petrokorbovka, then its
laboratory confirmation could enable exclusion of BSE. On the other hand,
if rabies was not confirmed, BSE could be excluded histopathologically or
by one of the other tests currently available and internationally approved.
Cumulative test results for 2001, in 15 EU member-states, showed 1086
positives among 3634 "suspect animals" (animals reported as BSE clinical
suspects) and 744 positives among 771 272 "risk animals" (dead-on-farm
animals, emergency slaughtered animals, animals sent for normal slaughter
but found sick at ante mortem inspection). Similar monitoring is being
undertaken in other countries. It could be useful to note if BSE tests are
carried out in the Ukraine in suspect animals.- Mod.AS].
