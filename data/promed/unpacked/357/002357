A citizen of Libichova [Dobrovice, Central Bohemia (Středočeský)], has drawn the attention of the Regional Veterinary Administration to mass mortalities of wild turtle doves in the village since the end of February 2016. A sample from the dead birds was sent, in early March 2016, to the State Veterinary Institute, Laboratory, in Prague, where experts identified the deadly pigeon disease as paramyxovirus which is a close relative of the Newcastle disease virus of poultry.

The birds are initially visibly depressed, subsequently suffering from diarrhea and then neurological signs: twisting of the neck, paralysis, loss of balance, and orientation. The neck twisting together with other signs make doves unable to eat. The incubation period is 3 to 5 days.

"The infection is transmitted from wild birds, including turtle doves, to domestic pigeons. Spreading to domestic fowl poultry is difficult, "the Central Veterinary Administration" Director Zdeněk Císař, said in a report.

There are numerous breeders of domestic pigeons whose are based at Dobrovice, but they can prevent the disease by vaccination of their birds.

"Pigeon populations belonging to breeders who exhibit at shows or races, are usually vaccinated. Breeders are currently refraining from showing pigeons, said Milan Hradec , who confirmed the preventive measures of the basic organization of the Czech (Pigeon) breeders Association.

The Veterinary Administration recommended that in case more turtle doves are detected, not to tamper with sick or dead animals, and instead to report the finding to the village officials.

[Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1; family _Paramyxoviridae_) is the etiologic agent of Newcastle disease. APMV-1 strains maintained in pigeon populations have some antigenic differences from other APMV-1 isolates, and are sometimes called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), which was first reported in racing pigeons in Italy in 1981, and then it became pandemic.

Several Newcastle disease outbreaks in chickens have been attributed to PPMV-1, which makes it a real threat to the poultry industry.

The European turtle dove (_Streptopelia turtur_) is a member of the bird family _Columbidae_, the doves and pigeons. The turtle dove is a migratory species with a southern Palearctic range covering most of Europe and the Middle East and including Turkey and north Africa.
