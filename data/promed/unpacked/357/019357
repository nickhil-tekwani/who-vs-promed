The New Mexico State Department of Health on Thursday confirmed a
case of septicemic plague in a 49 year old San Juan County man. It
is the first case of 2007 in New Mexico and the first in a San Juan
County resident since 1999. The department will conduct an
environmental investigation at the victim's home to determine if
there is any continuing risk.
Plague is generally transmitted to humans through bites of
infected fleas. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with
infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets.
Septicemic plague occurs when the bacteria multiply in the
blood. Health Department public health veterinarian Paul Ettestad
said winter and spring precipitation has allowed rodents and their
fleas to survive and multiply.

[Bubonic plague is the classical form of _Yersinia pestis_
infection,representing 85-90 percent of clinical presentations. The
process arises as a result of a bite from an infected flea or by
contamination of an open skin lesion. Local bacterial proliferation
is sometimes evident (4-10 percent of cases) in the form of an
abscess or ulcer at the site of infection (1).
Septicemic plague may occur as a consequence of more common
bubonic form or may occur after exposure without the development of
a bubo. The absence of a bubo may delay considering the appropriate
diagnosis and treatment, increasing morbidity and mortality.
The mechanism of transmission of plague from flea to mammalian host
is as follows:
Fleas become infected upon feeding on the blood of a rodent suffering
from bacteremic infection. The bacteria are restricted to the
alimentary tract of the flea, where they multiply in the midgut. The
bacteria may form large brown clumps that extend throughout the
midgut, esophagus and proventriculus, a valve-like chamber situated
between the esophagus and the midgut. The clumps increase in mass
over a few days until the proventriculus is blocked.
The "blocked" flea then feeds on blood, but the meal is unable to
pass into the stomach. The flea continues to attempt to feed, but as
it futilely sucks blood from the host, the blood meal, mixed with
bacteria from the foregut, is regurgitated into the mammal. As many
as 24 000 bacilli may be transmitted in a single attempted feeding (2).
