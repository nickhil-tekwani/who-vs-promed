Prohibitory orders banning import of pigs and piglets from neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh were today issued in Mizoram's southernmost Lawngtlai district. An official statement said that the district magistrate of Lawngtlai, Dr A Muthamma, [had] issued the order banning import of pigs and piglets from Myanmar and Bangladesh for 2 months.

The order was issued following reports that pigs and piglets were getting infected with the dreaded porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and classical swine fever. It was issued as prevention of further spread of the diseases in the district as well as other parts of the state.

PRRS, which hit the state in endemic proportions, resulted in the death of more than 3000 pigs and piglets in 2013 and more than 4000 pigs and piglets in 2016. Experts said that PRRS spread from piglets imported from Myanmar since the disease was prevalent in that country.

[Mizoram, a state in north eastern India, borders several Indian sister-states as well as the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar. See map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizoram#/media/File:IN-MZ.svg.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), an OIE-reportable disease, is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory disease in pigs. Initially recognised in 1987 in the United States of America, in 1989 in Japan and in 1990 in Germany, it has since become a pandemic. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. Apart from domestic pigs, feral swine and wild boars, no other species are known to be naturally infected with PRRSV. The virus does not pose a zoonotic risk and it is not infectious for humans or for cells of human origin.

For further information, please refer to the chapter 2.8.6. of OIE's Manual, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.06_PRRS.pdf. - Mod.AS
