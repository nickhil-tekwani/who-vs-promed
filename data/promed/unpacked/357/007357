A Comment on the ProMED-mail Post "Hepatitis A, hostels - UK (Sheffield)"
-------------------------------------------------
One aspect of hepatitis A transmission which has not received a lot
of notice is the connection with intravenous (IV) drug use. During 6
years as epidemiologist for the Texas Department of Health, I worked
on or was aware of numerous hepatitis A outbreaks in rural counties
of north Texas and neighboring Oklahoma, which were believed to have
struck the IV drug-use communities. Oklahoma Health Department staff
found, as we did, that a small number of confirmed hepatitis A cases
admitted to IV drug use. They also agreed with us that the
demographic characteristics and risk profiles of these outbreaks --
young poor white adults with no history of international travel or a
connection with a day-care center, often transient, unemployed and
hard to locate -- seem to offer no other explanation. For what it's
worth, the local rumor mill in the small towns would sometimes report
to us that "it's in that drug-using crowd."
The connection between hepatitis C transmission and IV drug use is
well documented, and it has also been demonstrated that the viremia
associated with acute hepatitis A infection lasts 2 months or even
longer. It has also been shown that hepatitis A virus resists drying
and ambient room temperature conditions even better than hepatitis B
virus does, and therefore could probably survive in a reused needle
at least as well. Add to that the fact that local (in-town)
manufacture of amphetamines was known to be widespread in these
areas, and that amphetamines do not need to be heated prior to
injection (therefore opening the possibility of transmission from an
infected drug manufacturer or distributor to users via fecally
contaminated amphetamine crystals, which are then dissolved and
injected).
Finally, the cliquish nature of small-town drug users ensures that
even if IV drug use didn't transmit hepatitis A through this
community, more conventional means (shared meals and lodging) might
be the culprit. This despite the fact that some patients would deny
knowing anyone else in town who has hepatitis A for fear that the
health department would share information with law enforcement (which
we were strictly barred from doing).
In a classic example, a hepatitis A case being interviewed was asked
for close contacts who might be candidates for immune globulin, and
while some on the list would confirm that they were contacts, some
would vehemently deny it and hang up or get unreasonably upset, only
to show up on the hepatitis A case list weeks later. Others on the
list would be lost to follow-up because of old or bogus addresses,
but again would show up for medical care and be diagnosed with
hepatitis A weeks to months later.
You can tell that the nature of these investigations was such that
little hard evidence was available, due in part to the patients' lack
of trust and cooperation. This probably accounts for the paucity of
published articles about this link. Suffice it to say that
investigators here had strong suspicions about a link between IV drug
use and hepatitis A, and that the Sheffield investigators might want
to consider this if their situation warrants.
