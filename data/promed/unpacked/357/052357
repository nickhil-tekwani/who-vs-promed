USA: Oregon outbreak prompts multistate frozen oyster recall
------------------------------------------------------------
A disease outbreak investigation by Oregon state and Marion County public
health officials has led to a multistate recall of thousands of pounds of
frozen oysters, officials at the Oregon Department of Human Services Public
Health Division said on Monday [11 Dec 2006]. The recall, announced on
Monday by the United States Food and Drug Administration, covers a large
lot of frozen oysters on the half-shell imported from Korea.
"This is a great example of how public health programs work together to
prevent illness," said Mel Kohn, MD, state epidemiologist in the DHS Public
Health Division. Kohn said the investigation unfolded rapidly, starting
late on 22 Nov 2006. The Marion County Health Department 1st heard reports
of illnesses following a private reception in Woodburn. County and state
public health officials worked late into the evening collecting
information, developing a questionnaire and interviewing a sample of the
250 people who attended the reception. By Thanksgiving morning [23 Nov
2006], interviews were completed, and questionnaire data had been analyzed.
The result was clear: People had been sickened by eating oysters, which
were served raw on the half shell. "Eating raw shellfish is always risky,
regardless of their origin or the time of year," said Kohn. "Whether they
come fresh or frozen, it's always best to cook shellfish thoroughly."
Subsequent specimen testing at the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory in
Portland confirmed the infection was by a norovirus. And while there were
no reports of serious illness or hospitalization, Kohn said it is estimated
about 40 people were affected. Oregon notified other state and federal
officials on Thanksgiving. The Oregon Department of Agriculture and the FDA
worked with the DHS Public Health Division to trace the oysters through a
chain of suppliers to their source in Korea. Other portions of the same lot
were sold in Oregon, California, Colorado, Texas and Nevada, but no other
illnesses have been reported, according to Kohn.
On 7 Dec 2006, an FDA lab confirmed the presence of noroviruses in samples
of frozen oysters from the same production lot, and the recall became
official. More information about the recall can be found on the FDA's
website: <http://www.fda.gov>.
Noroviruses, [previously designated] Norwalk-like viruses, are the most
common cause of acute gastrointestinal illness in Oregon and the United
States. Oregon has confirmed more [than] 100 norovirus outbreaks this year
[2006], Kohn said. "In healthy people, the infection typically lasts one or
2 days, but the infection is not trivial," Kohn said. "Some people become
completely incapacitated by the symptoms, which [may] include vomiting and
diarrhea." This investigation reflects state and local communicable disease
and food safety programs working together, Kohn noted, and represents one
of many public health activities within DHS that focus on prevention and
helping people manage their health so they can be as productive and healthy
as possible.

[Noroviruses have become associated predominantly with outbreaks of
sudden-onset gastroenteritis ("winter-vomiting disease" in the northern
hemisphere), particularly in circumstances where groups of people from
diverse backgrounds are brought together in close proximity (such as cruise
ships, hospitals, care-homes, and schools). In these situations, the virus
is spread by person-to-person transmission. In this respect, Richard I
Frankel (emeritus professor of medicine, University of Hawaii John A Burns
School of Medicine) has suggested to the moderator that it should be
pointed out that viral gastroenteritis, whether caused by norovirus or
another virus, is generally not spread directly by the respiratory route,
although the projectile vomiting associated with norovirus infection may
cause droplet-contamination of the environment at a distance from an
affected person.
Outbreaks of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis can also be a consequence
of fecal contamination of food or water, and foodborne outbreaks are not
uncommon. In particular, contaminated shellfish are major causes of
norovirus-associated gastroenteritis, with bivalve molluscs (oysters,
mussels, and cockles) being the most common source. These animals are
filter-feeders and can become infected where there is discharge of
untreated sewage.
Filter-feeding shellfish are a source of infection because they are often
consumed partially cooked or raw. Heat treatment at normal cooking
temperatures would destroy infectivity. In general, consumption of raw
shellfish anywhere in the world (see references below) should be avoided. -
