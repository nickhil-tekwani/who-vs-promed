A scandal over Belgian poultry laced with cancer-causing dioxin spread from
chickens to pork and beef Thursday, engulfing most of the nation's meat
industry. The government approved new measures banning the slaughter and
even transport of poultry, pork and beef across the country, worsening the
biggest food scare in the 15-nation European Union (EU) since Britain's
1996 mad cow disease.
And the EU expanded its decision to destroy Belgian poultry that may be
contaminated to include pork and beef, and said it will also ban the export
of such products. Nations from Greece to Ghana scrambled to keep Belgian
food off supermarket shelves.
The sale of poultry had already been outlawed, but Belgian Health Minister
Luc Van den Bossche said the government also would "take a more stringent
attitude when it comes to pork and beef."
"We needed to reinforce the measures because we thought we had the total
list of suspect farms involved, but that appears not to be the case," he
said.
The scandal broke last week when a television station reported that
dioxin-laced fat was used to make poultry feed. Dioxin is a carcinogenic
byproduct in the manufacture of some herbicides and pesticides.
Van den Bossche said 175,000 pounds of contaminated animal feed had been
distributed to poultry, beef and pig farms early this year. Initial tests
have shown that dioxin levels in some chickens were 1,000 times the
accepted limit.
Belgian authorities were checking more than 1,000 farms to see whether
animal feed containing dioxin had been used. Some 70 beef farms were
quarantined Thursday, since they were on a list of farms that may have been
given the contaminated animal feed.
All over Europe, Belgian products containing more than 2 percent poultry or
egg product were being destroyed.
The Dutch government said it closed 350 pig farms to conduct checks on
fodder and swine suspected of contamination. Portuguese authorities seized
more than 10 tons of Belgian chicken products.
In Greece, the government temporarily banned the sale of 146 tons of
Belgian chicken and poultry products. Russian health authorities reportedly
confiscated 20 tons of ground turkey. And as far away as Ghana, the
government ordered an import ban on all chickens, eggs and pork from Belgium.
In Belgian supermarkets, a massive operation cleared all products
containing even a trace of poultry or eggs from the shelves -- from pork
chops to egg salad, mayonnaise to ice cream.
"What is there left to eat?" headlined the daily Het Nieuwsblad.
The food scandal has forced the resignations of two Cabinet ministers. Two
managers of the animal feed fat producer where the contamination is thought
to have originated are under arrest on fraud charges.
In 1996, the EU Commission imposed a worldwide export ban on British beef.
The move came after the British government acknowledged a possible link
between a brain-destroying cattle ailment called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) with an equally fatal human illness, new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD).

The British government added beef to a list of Belgian products banned from
British shelves in the latest European food scare. It is expected to issue
an emergency order on Friday for the destruction of beef, pork, chicken and
egg products from more than 400 Belgian farms under the Food Safety Act.
The products are feared to contain the cancer-causing chemicals dioxin,
after animals at the farms were given contaminated feed.
The European Union (EU) has ordered the destruction of millions of pounds
of chicken and egg products exported from Belgium since 15 January. It said
it would demand the removal from sale and destruction of pork and cattle
products from farms that used dioxin-tainted feed tainted.
In Belgium, the new Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche has placed a
temporary ban on the slaughter and transportation of all poultry, cattle
and pigs while it confirmed which farms used the contaminated feed.
In the United States, agriculture officials will block imports of chicken
and pork from EU countries as Belgium's contaminated feed scandal deepens.
A spokesman for the US Department of Agriculture said the ban would be
temporary. It will apply to all products containing pork and poultry in
addition to just the meats, the Agriculture Department said.The US move is
the latest in a string of bans and restrictions being imposed in the wake
of the Belgian scandal.

As public fears of dioxin-poisoned Belgian chickens and eggs spread across
Europe, the European Union (EU) ordered a vast array of potentially tainted
Belgian food products, including cakes, cookies, mayonnaise and pasta made
with suspect eggs, be withdrawn from sale and destroyed.
The EU acted after the Belgian government decided to ban the sale of all
chicken- or egg-based foods after high levels of the carcinogenic chemical
were found in animal feed sold to poultry farms by a Belgian processor.
The suspect shipments of animal feed date to mid-January. Belgian
authorities reportedly were tipped to the problem 3 months later. More than
a month elapsed before Belgian health and agriculture officials, confronted
by press disclosures, admitted they had been investigating the reports but
had not warned the public of the potentially fatal hazards of ingesting
dioxin in the reported quantities, which were as much as 1,500 times higher
than the acceptable level. To date, there have been no reported illnesses
from the dioxin contamination.
Health officials in Belgium believe the feed manufacturer had used a batch
of animal and vegetable oils, routinely added to the pellet mixtures fed to
chickens, had been laced with dioxin-contaminated motor oils. European
officials reportedly are investigating the possibility the poisoned feed
also was distributed to pork producers.
Pending action by the EU, the French government blocked the sale of
chickens and eggs from the 30 French farms that bought the suspect feed.
Greek authorities seized a 40-ton shipment of French chickens, while
German, Italian, Dutch, Polish and Russian authorities slapped temporary
bans on Belgian poultry imports.
Other countries' health officials said they were awaiting evidence the
contaminated products had found their way into national food distribution
systems. But enough time has passed for plenty of dioxin-tainted foods --
how much may never be known -- to have passed through the marketplace and
into human alimentary systems.
The developing toxic food crisis -- dubbed "chicken a la dioxin" in the
French media -- stirred recent memories of public hysteria, bureaucratic
turmoil and European bickering over Britain's outbreak of "mad cow
disease," suspected in 1996 of infecting beef-eating humans. The crisis
forced Britain to slaughter tens of thousands of cattle and led the EU to
impose an export ban on British beef that has not yet been lifted.
The increasing interdependence of European nations as goods pass routinely
across borders means that any food-related health problem in one country
almost automatically becomes a health problem for the continent.
