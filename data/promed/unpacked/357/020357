A Comment on Canine Rabies Vaccination in China
-----------------------------------------------
[Merritt Clifton, the Editor of "Animal People"
(<http://www.animalpeoplenews.org>), has sent the following interesting
observations on canine rabies vaccination policy and practice in China. -
Mod.CP]
We just returned from our 2nd investigative visit to China, where we
somewhat unexpectedly spent much of our time doing rabies education. China
has uniform compulsory vaccination of pet dogs, and it seems to be rather
stringently enforced: if the owner is not carrying a vaccination
certificate when asked to produce it, the dog is often killed on the spot.
Guangdong Province, however, where the 312 people have died this year,
leads the universe in raising and slaughtering dogs for meat, and Chinese
officials insist that these dogs are not at risk of getting rabies because
they are confined. Therefore there is no requirement that dogs raised and
sold for meat must be vaccinated.
The overwhelming majority of the dogs who have been killed as result of
rabies outbreaks this year have been in dog meat production areas, where
there are few if any pet dogs.
