South Bass Island Gastrointestinal Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many people are sick?
----------------------------
As of 13 Sep 2004, the Ottawa County Health Department has
interviewed 1450 people who share a history of gastrointestinal
illness and travel to South Bass Island. There have been 5 new cases
reported in Sep 2004, the latest date of onset being Tue, 7 Sep.
Patients have been identified from 17 states, a European country and
a Canadian province; we are working with colleagues in these areas to
identify and interview patients.
The 1450 people identified have 2 things in common: GI illness and a
travel history to South Bass Island. The interviews will help
determine what else they may have in common, such as how they
traveled to the island, places they visited, what they ate or drank.
They range in age from 7 months to 83 years. No one has died that we
are aware of.
When did the outbreak begin?
------------------------------
A vast majority of patients report getting sick beginning the 1st
week of Aug 2004; however, interviews have determined a small number
of illnesses dating to early Jun 2004 and reports continue to come in.
Is South Bass Island or Put-In-Bay closed? Are there any travel restrictions?
---------------------------------------------------
We are in the early stages of our investigation, and no common source
has been determined. We are providing all available information so
people can make the most informed decisions possible regarding their
health. There are no travel restrictions to South Bass Island.
What's causing this?
---------------------
There are 15 laboratory-confirmed cases of _Campylobacter_, one of
the most common bacterial causes of diarrheal illness in the USA, 9
lab-confirmed cases of Norovirus, a common cause of viral
gastroenteritis, 1 lab-confirmed case of salmonellosis, and 1 case of
giardiasis.
Are these common illnesses?
----------------------------
The Ottawa County Health Department has cast a wide net in this
investigation, as the cause of illness is still undetermined. Reports
of gastrointestinal illness are not uncommon in Ohio, in fact more
than 1300 cases of _Salmonella_ infection and more than 1200 cases of
_Campylobacter_ infection were reported to the Ohio Department of
Health in 2003.
Are there any other islands involved?
-------------------------------------
The investigation is focused on South Bass Island at this time.
What's being done?
--------------------
The Ottawa County Health Department has tested 42 private wells, 32
of which tested positive for total coliform and/or _E. coli_. These
results, in addition to the Ohio EPA testing of public wells, are
beginning to confirm the suspicion of possible widespread groundwater
contamination. Therefore, the Ohio Department of Health urges South
Bass Island residents with wells to consider boiling water before
consuming it. Visitors may want to consider drinking bottled water.
This is NOT the _E.coli_ associated with eating undercooked,
contaminated beef. Rather, this is indicative of pathogens in the
water that may make some people sick.
A team of water experts from the CDC National Center for
Environmental Health arrived in Ottawa County Wed, 8 Sep 2004 to
assist in launching an aquifer study on the Island. This
investigation, led by ODH, will focus on sampling some 90 residential
wells for total coliform, _E. coli_, _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_,
nitrates and chlorides. These tests will give us a clearer picture of
the condition of the Island's water supply.
The case-control study continues. Interviews are ongoing with about
100 sick people and their well traveling companions to determine what
they may have done differently while on the Island. This may help
investigators narrow the focus of their investigation.
The epidemiological and environmental investigation continues with
work from local health departments, ODH, the Ohio Department of
Agriculture, Ohio EPA and the CDC.
