2008 West Nile virus activity in the United States (through 3 Jun 2008)
-----------------------------------------------
Data are being collected from state and local health departments on a
weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing
county-level wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data are published each
week on the collaborative USGS (US Geological Survey)/CDC West Nile
virus website.

As of 3 Jun 2008, human, avian, animal, or mosquito West Nile virus
(WNV) infections have been reported to CDC ArboNET from the following
states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,

WNV antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses) have
been found in California, Florida [Note: not all states have WNV sentinel
programs. - Mods.JW/TY]

WNV equine infections have been reported from Alabama

WNV has been detected in dead wild birds in Arizona, South Carolina

WNV has been detected in mosquito pools collected in California, Illinois,
Indiana, Texas

[2] Puerto Rico, human (2007)
Date: Fri 30 May 2008

[edited] <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5721a2.htm>

On 19 Jul 2007 [last year], the American Red Cross in Puerto Rico
notified the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH)of 3 persons whose
blood donations were positive for WNV by nucleic acid-amplification
test (NAT) screening. These 3 donors had the first confirmed human WNV
infections detected in Puerto Rico. In response, PRDH and CDC
conducted in-depth interviews of the blood donors. This report
describes these human infections and other recent surveillance for
transmission of WNV in Puerto Rico...

None of the 3 donors reported travel outside of Puerto Rico within 2
weeks before donation [the maximum known incubation period. - Mod.JW].
All 3 lived near San Juan and had not traveled to areas where WNV
transmission previously was detected in animals [in Puerto Rico]...

Detection of WNV infections in human blood donors indicates that
heightened clinician awareness, ongoing surveillance, and educational
activities are needed to monitor and assess the public health threat
posed by WNV in Puerto Rico.

[Interestingly, this is the first publicly available report of human West Nile
virus (WNV) infection in Puerto Rico, which occurred in 2007. The
USGS/CDC maps
for 2007 only reported evidence of WNV infection in sentinel animals
in Puerto Rico (see ProMED archive no. 20071114.3703). - Mod. TY.
