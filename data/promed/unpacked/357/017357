LEPROSY - NEPAL (TANAHU) (02)

I am a leprologist from Malaysia. I follow with great interest the leprosy
situations in Nepal and in other affected countries. I want to find out
more about the situation concerning leprosy in Tanahu, Nepal.
The news article stated that, "except for 2, all the others are normal
leprosy patients." There is no definition of "normal leprosy patients." The
disease is either the infectious form (Lepromatous leprosy, Borderline
lepromatous leprosy) or the non-infectious form (Tuberculoid leprosy,
Borderline tuberculoid).
Please give clarification, because, if the majority of cases are of the
infectious form, then the pool or reservoir of leprosy is still present,
which will have an implication on the elimination program.

[Dr. Fadzilah's question is appropriate. We have no additional information
and would welcome input from anyone with direct knowledge of the situation.
