A case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- so-called mad cow disease -- has been confirmed at a farm in Aberdeenshire. BBC Scotland understands the isolated case involves a beef herd in the Huntly area. Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said a movement ban was now in place on the unnamed farm.

Investigations are underway to identify the origin of the disease -- the 1st in Scotland in a decade -- which was found after an animal died. The case involving a 5-year-old animal was identified before entering the human food chain. In addition, 4 others from the herd were being destroyed as a precaution.

There are understood to have been 16 cases in the UK since 2011, with the last in 2015 when farming officials confirmed a case of BSE in Carmarthenshire, Wales. That was discovered following routine tests carried out when a farm animal dies. The monitoring of BSE has been an important function since the crisis of 1986 when 180 000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered to eradicate the disease in the UK.

On the Aberdeenshire case, Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: "I would urge any farmer who has concerns to seek veterinary advice." She added, "While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question."

Andrew McCornick, president of NFU Scotland, said: "It is disappointing to learn of this BSE case within the Aberdeenshire area." He added, "Whilst we lose our negligible risk status, it is not unexpected to see a new case and demonstrates the efficacy of the surveillance measures in place. This simply brings us back in line with the rest of Great Britain, reverting back to where we were 18 months ago. When Scotland applied for BSE negligible risk status, it was with the full knowledge that there was every possibility of a sporadic case of BSE emerging, as has been the case in France and Ireland."

Ian McWatt, director of operations in Food Standards Scotland, said that there were strict rules in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed. Although the BSE case in Scotland is significant, the industry is genuinely not concerned about any immediate impact. Movement restrictions apply only to the farm identified.

Unlike in the 1980s and 1990s, the disease is more clearly understood. There have long been cases of BSE, and there will continue to be so. But the practice of feeding infected meat and bone meal back to the cattle was what led to the rapid acceleration in numbers, which became the crisis.

Some of the most recent cases are a legacy of that -- the offspring of older cattle. But the Aberdeenshire case is in a 5-year-old animal, and so it is likely that it was just predisposed to the condition.

A lot has changed since the BSE crisis. Brain and spinal cord no longer enter the food chain, and there is a more rigorous process for monitoring. So, the risk to human health is virtually nil. And it is not a condition that can be passed from animal to animal, other than through birth.

The biggest concern is in international confidence. BSE has long been a barrier to exporting beef, as other countries did not want anything to do with nations where there had been cases.

It has been a decade since the last case in Scotland. A country is classed as "negligible risk" 11 years after the birth of the last known case, and that status was achieved in 2016. This latest case takes them back a step but only to the same level as the rest of the UK. But with Brexit on the horizon -- and wider trade deals being a big part of that -- there are fears that this will be a barrier to entering new markets.

Scotland confirmed a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), so-called mad cow disease, Thursday [18 Oct 2018], but authorities are unsure whether the animal developed the illness in a one-off genetic mutation, or whether a more worrying underlying factor such as contaminated food was involved. Scottish government spokesman Luke Boddice said a 4-year-old cow had died on a farm in Aberdeenshire, in the northeast of the country, and authorities discovered that it had contracted BSE after a routine check. "We are chasing its cohorts and will be destroying them in line with [European Union (EU)] regulation in the coming days," Boddice said, referring to other cows in the vicinity.

BSE is an incurable disease that wastes the brains and nervous systems of infected cattle, causing muscular twitching or even frenzy. Scientists also believe that humans who eat BSE-infected meat can contract variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a fatal brain disease. Britain was the epicenter of a BSE outbreak during the 1980s and 1990s, which led to a continent-wide food safety crisis and, eventually, to the creation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2002.

However, the crisis also triggered global trade bans -- the effects of which meat exporters still feel today. Brussels banned all British beef exports between 1996 and 2006, for example, while major importers such as China and the US unilaterally blocked all EU beef exports. Both countries have only recently begun lifting these bans. Beijing signed off on British imports only in June [2018], and it lifted its ban on Dutch veal only on Wednesday [17 Oct 2018].

Still, both Edinburgh and Brussels are adamant that the recent case is an isolated one. Scotland's Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said he has imposed a ban on transporting cattle from the farm as a precaution.

BSE comes in 2 types. The 1st, "classical BSE," can infect cattle through infected food. Investigations suggested BSE-infected cattle feed -- containing protein particles known as prions that cause brain proteins to fold in on themselves -- caused the British outbreaks of the 1980s and 1990s. This led to an EU-wide ban on feeding processed meat to livestock.

In rare cases, however, cattle can also develop the disease sporadically. This is known as "atypical BSE." Boddice said that Scottish authorities are now determining whether it was "a random mutation or it was some external factor" that caused the death of the cow in Aberdeenshire.

EFSA Executive Director Bernhard Url said there is no immediate reason to suspect that the infection came from infected feed. "We know that there are -- very rarely -- but there are sporadic cases of BSE. It can happen on a sporadic basis," he said. "I would be cautious."

A European Commission spokesperson also said she thinks the case is a sporadic one. "It's not like it didn't happen for the last 10 years," she said, referring to a French case from 2016.

However, one of the main consequences of the case is that Scotland could lose its "negligible" risk status for BSE, awarded by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The OIE said that downgrade is not automatic, and that it could not comment on the next steps.

Since the Brexit referendum, British beef exports have been boosted by the relative weakness of the pound. The main export destinations are Ireland and the Netherlands.

[According to OIE's International Animal Health Code, article 11.4 (BSE), countries or their specified zones are rated into one of the following 2 classes concerning their official BSE risk status:
Negligible BSE risk: Article 11.4.3.
Controlled BSE risk: Article 11.4.4.

All other countries are rated as having an "Undetermined BSE risk." http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bse.htm

A country's or zone's official BSE risk status may become of high significance when its exports (animals and their products) are to be agreed with importing countries. Countries with undetermined BSE risk status may encounter difficulties as exporters of bovine animals and their products, such as beef.

The BSE risk status recognition requirements address "classical" BSE (C-type BSE), while excluding "atypical BSE" (H-type BSE and L-type BSE) as a cause for downgrading or delisting a country. The corresponding updated lists are available at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/. Currently, 48 countries (including Scotland) are recognized as "negligible BSE risk."

The following text from the summary section of OIE's Manual Chapter 2.4.5. "Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy" (at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.05_BSE.pdf, updated May 2016) provides some essential background.

"Identification of the agent: Clinical C-type BSE had a peak incidence in cattle aged between 4 and 5 years during the height of the epizootic. The clinical course is variable but can extend to several months. Overt clinical signs are distinctive, if differential diagnoses can be eliminated. Early clinical signs may be subtle and mostly behavioural, and may lead to disposal of affected animals before suspicion of BSE is triggered. In countries with a statutory policy toward the disease, clinically suspect cases must be killed, the brain examined and the carcass destroyed. Now, in most countries involved, active surveillance at abattoirs and the screening of fallen stock identifies preclinical cases and cases in which there may have been unrecognised clinical signs. No diagnostic test is currently available for live animals.

"A disease-specific partially protease-resistant, misfolded isoform of a membrane protein PrPc, originally designated PrPSc, has a critical importance in disease pathogenesis. According to the prion hypothesis, PrPSc is the principal or sole component of the infectious agent. Confirmation of the diagnosis is reached by immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or immunochemical detection of PrPSc in brain tissue. Atypical forms of BSE are believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate, and has only been identified in older cattle. They have been detected in many countries, but only as an incidental finding when conducting intensive surveillance for C-type BSE.

"The discrimination of atypical phenotypes from the classical BSE type is based on Western immunoblot banding pattern and bioassay characterisation. Commercial diagnostic kits for BSE are available and are used in many countries; similarly a number of anti-PrP antibodies form the basis of many diagnostic methods. Some are available commercially, or from OIE Reference Laboratories or other laboratories with active TSE surveillance programmes."

In addition, all currently recognised forms of BSE are detectable by the above methods, although a full sensitivity and specificity evaluation for atypical forms (H and L types) has not been carried out.

Although to date there is no evidence that atypical BSE is transmissible, recycling of the atypical BSE agent has not been ruled out; therefore, measures to manage exposure risk in the feed chain continue to be recommended as a precautionary measure.

Scotland was recognised as a UK zone with "negligible BSE risk status" in October 2016, after 11 years of classical BSE's absence. The UK was recognised as a zone (consisting of England and Wales) with "controlled BSE risk status" in September 2007.

UK's OIE report on the event in the zone Scotland is expected to include the details of the causal agent and the test(s) applied. - Mod.AS
