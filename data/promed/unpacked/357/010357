A deer killed on a Marathon County hunting preserve has tested positive for chronic wasting disease. State officials say it's the 1st new CWD case in 5 years from a Wisconsin game farm.

State veterinarian Paul McGraw says the 5-year-old buck was among about 370 deer at the preserve near Eland. McGraw has quarantined the preserve and the other 3 registered farms owned by the same entity. The state did not immediately identify the game farm.

[Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a disease in the group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or TSE. The prion, a misfolded protein is believed to be the cause of the neurological disease. CWD has been known since the 1960s. To date, there is no evidence of this disease transmitting from cervids to humans.

States view the disease as problematic in their cervid herds. However, this is not the 1st case of captive cervids being found with the disease. But it does seem a long time since their last case, so one has to wonder, what happened? An imported animal? A latent disease? Or a wild deer being able to transmit the disease though the fence?

Multiple questions, and perhaps we will learn the outcome of the investigation.
