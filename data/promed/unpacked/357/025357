Abstract
Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral disease of cattle and buffalo, caused by a Capripox virus. A field study was performed during an LSD epidemic which occurred in 2012-2013 in Israel, in order to assess the efficacy of 2 commercial vaccines for protection against LSD. 15 dairy herds, vaccinated 2-5 months prior to study onset with a single dose of 102.5 TCID50 of RM65 attenuated sheep-pox vaccine, and not affected previously, were enrolled in the study. 4694 cows were randomized to be either vaccinated with a 103.5 TCID50/dose of RM65 vaccine (x10RM65) or with a same dose of an attenuated Neethling LSD virus vaccine. A case of LSD was defined as the appearance of at least 5 lesions typical to LSD and a severe case was defined if this sign was accompanied by either fever (greater than 39.5 C) or/and a 20 percent reduction in milk production. Deep lesion biopsies and blood samples were collected from 64.5 percent of the cases in an attempt to detect DNA of LSD virus by PCR and to differentiate between the wild strain and the vaccine Neethling strain. 76 cows were affected by LSD in 8 herds with an incidence of 0.3-5.7 percent. Mantel-Haenszel relative risk (RRmh) for LSD morbidity at least 15 days after vaccination in x10RM65 vs. Neethling was 2.635 (CI 95 percent = 1.44-4.82) and 11.2 (2.3-54.7) for severe morbidity. RRmh for laboratory confirmed cases was 4.28 (1.59-11.53). An incidence of 0.38 percent (9/2356) of Neethling associated disease was observed among Neethling vaccinated cows while no such disease occurred in x10RM65 vaccinated cows. We conclude that the Neethling vaccine is significantly more effective than x10RM65 in preventing LSD morbidity, though it might cause a low incidence of Neethling associated disease. No transmission of the Neethling strain to non-Neethling vaccinated cows was observed in this study.

[In view of the continuous spread of LSD in a north-eastern direction (into Azerbaijan, Dagestan, Chechniya) as well as its introduction into south-east Europe (Northern Cyprus, Greece), the application of vaccines in susceptible cattle has attained recently increased attention. Greece has already initiated emergency vaccination, applying the attenuated Neethling LSD virus vaccine.

In this context, subscribers are referred to the recommendations included in EFSA'a Scientific Opinion, published in January 2015 (Ref 1 and item [3] in ProMED-mail posting 20150121.3109000). The following selected excerpts are copied from their findings/recommendations:

"Based on a model to simulate LSD spread between farms, culling animals with generalised clinical signs seems to be sufficient to contain 90 percent of epidemics around the initial site of incursion, but the remaining 10 percent of simulated epidemics can spread up to 400 km [about 250 miles] from the site of introduction by 6 months after incursion. Whole-herd culling of infected farms substantially reduces the spread of LSD virus, and the more rapidly farms are detected and culled, the greater the magnitude of the reduction.

Only live attenuated vaccines against LSD are available. Homologous vaccines are more effective than sheep pox strain vaccines. The safety of the vaccines should be improved, and the development of vaccines for differentiating between infected and vaccinated animals is recommended. Epidemics are not self-limiting when effective vaccination or culling are not applied. Active surveillance, rapid detection, and prompt culling of infected herds are effective measures for LSD control. The role of vectors for LSD transmission should be further investigated in both controlled environments and the field. Awareness-raising campaigns for farmers and veterinary staff to promote recognition of LSD should be considered.

Owing to the risk of LSD spreading from the Middle East to the rest of Asia or to Europe, the development of safe, efficient and non-replicating 'differentiating infected from vaccinated animals' (DIVA) vaccines against LSDV is required, as well as an associated diagnostic test. Furthermore, the efficacy of currently available live vaccines in cattle against LSDV should be evaluated using challenge experiments in controlled environments."

When BTV-8 spread in north/central Europe (2006-2008), the mass application of vaccines with live attenuated virus was spared by the development and manufacturing of an inactivated vaccine (recently, applied around the new focus in central France). Later, when another vector-borne virus appeared in Europe, namely the Orthobunyavirus coined Schmallenberg, similarly an inactivated vaccine was developed, approved and manufactured. It will be interesting to note if a similar approach/effort has been undertaken in Europe in regard to LSD.

The new LSD outbreaks, reported to the OIE since September 2014, are to be seen on OIE's interactive map available at http://tinyurl.com/p9846ba (click on the cluster, zoom in). The said map does not show the outbreaks detected in Northern Cyprus in late 2014 (Turkish-administered Northern Cyprus is not an OIE member).
