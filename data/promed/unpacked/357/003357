The Illinois Department of Public Health is investigating a single new case of legionnaires' disease. Tuesday [31 Dec 2019], staff is revealing how policies helped them respond to this case they say: quickly and efficiently. They said for now, no other resident has been infected at the vets home, but they say they will continue to monitor for legionnaire's disease.

Staff at the Illinois Veterans' Home in Quincy is on edge after a new confirmed case of legionnaires' disease. "I think that because we are put in the spotlight, that's why we always do take over precaution a lot," said adjutant Dawn Whitcomb. Whitcomb said the man who contracted the disease lives at Fifer Infirmary. She said the water at the home gets tested every day.

"Different buildings get tested at different times. Flushing occurs twice a day here at the home. We also do thermal, meaning that we heat the water to a certain temperature and bring it back down to ensure that it's safe for our residents and our staff," said Whitcomb.

Meanwhile, the state has committed USD 230 million to renovate the entire home. That includes new systems that officials say should dramatically reduce the possibility someone contracts legionnaires' disease. "The money that's been allocated to us from the government will help with a new water loop. We'll be putting in a new water loop," said Whitcomb.

Officials said the man who contracted legionnaires' is recovering after being diagnosed last week [week of 23 Dec 2019]. He and other respiratory patients are being monitored closely. "We're doing what we call vital signs every 2 hours to make sure we are keeping an eye on those residents," said Whitcomb. It's the 1st confirmed case at the Illinois Veterans' Home in Quincy since 2018. State officials said Illinois Department of Public Health is working with the facility at the home to collect information and further investigate this most recent case.

The legionnaires' outbreak started in 2015 when 12 residents died and 56 others were sickened. State officials unveiled a new USD 5 million dollar water treatment plant at the home in 2016. There have been cases every year since 2015. Officials revealed plans for a new USD230 million dollar facility last year.

[Many veterans' homes are managed and funded by state governments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_soldiers%27_home). The Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy, Illinois, is responsible for providing long-term care for veterans and their spouses, which includes domiciliary care, intermediate care, and skilled healthcare (http://www.quincyivh.org). According to its website, the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy is one of the larger and older veterans homes in the country, with nearly 450 residents and over 25 buildings that house a post office, bank, assembly hall, guest house, mini post exchange, chapel, animal park, museum, and television station; water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone, and data networks are owned and maintained by the Veterans Home.

In 2015, ProMED-mail posted a report on 53 cases of legionnaires' disease, including 12 deaths, at the Quincy veterans home, plus another 4 patients with legionnaires' disease in Quincy who were said to be not connected to the veterans home (Legionellosis - USA (15): (IL) fatal, veterans home, update, RFI 20150924.3668124).

The outbreak recurred in 2016, when 2 cases were reported in July 2016, less than a month after a nearly USD 5 million state-of-the-art water treatment plant and delivery system was unveiled at this facility (Legionellosis - USA (04): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new cases, RFI 20160728.4377020).

Again in October 2017, 2 more cases were reported in residents of the Quincy Illinois Veterans Home (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (17): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new cases 20171020.5394079) and a month later another case was reported in a resident of the Illinois Veterans Home (Legionellosis - USA (23): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new case, RFI 20171130.5474288).

We have not been told the species of _Legionella_ involved, the results of genotyping the patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates, or any epidemiological linkages among the patients. More information in this regard from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

_Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas and hot water tanks and heaters. Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems, usually done by culture, would miss VBNC [viable but nonculturable] _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249). The persistence of _Legionella_ over many years in the water system at the veterans' facility could perhaps be due to VBNC organisms.

Quincy, with a population of 40 633 in 2010, is a city on the Mississippi River and the county seat of Adams County, Illinois, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Illinois). - Mod.ML
