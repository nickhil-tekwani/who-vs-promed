At least 100 goats have died of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), also known as goat plague, in flood affected areas of the [Lalmonirhat] district [Rangpur division].

[MA], 42, of Dharla river Char Shiberkuti in Sadar upazila [sub-district] said 2 of his 3 goats died of the disease last week [week of 11 Sep 2017] and another was affected yesterday [19 Sep 2017]. "I took the affected goat to the upazila livestock office for vaccination," he said. No livestock official visited their village to create awareness about the viral disease of goats after the flood, he added.

[MB] said one of her 2 goats died yesterday [19 Sep 2017] and the other died 2 days ago due to the disease. "I did not have any idea about PPR disease so I could not vaccinate my 2 goats," she added.

[AT], 48, said one of his 4 goats died of the disease on Monday morning [18 Sep 2017]. "I collected PPR vaccine from the livestock office and vaccinated the other 3 goats yesterday [19 Sep 2017]," he said.

[NJB], 52, of Bumka village said 2 of her 5 goats died of PPR disease last week [week of 11 Sep 2017]. "As I did not know about the disease, I could not provide treatment to my goats," she said.

[AH], 56, of Teesta river Char Sholmari in Kaliganj upazila, said one of his 3 goats died and many villagers lost their goats due to the disease that broke out after the flood.

District Livestock Officer Nasir Uddin Khan said PPR vaccine is available in their stock but people are not aware about the disease, so they do not contact livestock officials in this regard. Livestock officials have started working to create awareness about PPR disease among the flood affected people and are also providing vaccines, he added.

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), is an acute contagious disease caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family Paramyxoviridae. It affects mainly sheep and goats and occasionally wild small ruminants. Based on the fact that PPR has been reported on a few occasions in camels, cattle and buffaloes, those animal species are considered to be susceptible although their potential role in the circulation of PPR virus (PPRV) has not been formally established.

The clinical disease resembles rinderpest in cattle. It is usually acute and characterised by pyrexia, serous ocular and nasal discharges, diarrhoea and pneumonia, and erosive lesions on different mucous membranes particularly in the mouth. At necropsy, erosions may be noted in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The lungs may show interstitial bronchopneumonia and often secondary bacterial pneumonia. PPR can also occur in subclinical form (http://www.rr-africa.oie.int/docspdf/fr/2017/FMD_PPR/2.07.11_PPR.pdf). The disease in not zoonotic.

A Power Point presentation of PPR is available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/DiseaseInfo/disease.php?name=peste-des-petits-ruminants&lang=en.

Since it was first identified in CÃ´te d'Ivoire in 1942, PPR has spread to some 70 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, currently known to be infected. In 2007, China reported its 1st outbreak (Tibet); since 2013, the disease spread further throughout the mega state. In September 2016, Mongolia reported its 1st-ever case of PPR. In Central Asia, only few countries have reported infection; the exact situation in the region as a whole deserves to be revisited.

Over 80 percent of the world's sheep and goats are found in the PPR-infected regions, where many families rely heavily on products like goat milk, mutton, and wool for their nutrition and livelihoods. FAO estimates some 300 million small-scale farming families worldwide depend on small ruminants for food and income. In all, the annual global damage due to PPR is estimated to be between USD 1.4 billion and 2.1 billion.

PPR was first detected in Bangladesh in 1993, in its western part, and has since spread throughout the country, now regarded to be endemic. It was last reported from Lalmonirhat, a district of Rangpur Division, bordering India's Sikkim, in September 2013; see 20130908.1930666.

No clinical signs in the current event in Bangladesh have been included in the media report above. A description of the clinical signs, or a confirmation by a professional, would be helpful.

A major international plan to eradicate PPR globally, in a 15 year effort, was launched by the FAO and OIE in October 2016. This ambitious stepwise initiative is described briefly in 20160511.4215729.

The FAO/OIE document "Global Strategy for the Control and Eradication of PPR" is available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4460e.pdf. - Mod.AS]
