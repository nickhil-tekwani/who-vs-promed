A 43-year-old South African professional hunter was active in the Eastern Province of Zambia during July and August 2021, where he experienced a number of tsetse fly bites.

He developed an acute febrile illness, which did not respond to self-medication with an antimalarial. He was admitted to a hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, and a diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was suspected. The test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative.

He was transferred for further management to a hospital in Pretoria, South Africa. On admission, jaundice, scattered petechiae, and a typical trypanosomal chancre on one ankle, were noted. Marked thrombocytopenia, moderate leucopenia, and mildly deranged liver functions were found. A very scanty trypomastigote parasitaemia was noted on a Giemsa-stained blood smear, which was confirmed by rtPCR.

The patient has responded well to suramin (course presently being completed), and examination of the CSF was negative for parasites on microscopy and PCR, with normal biochemistry and no leukocytes. In contrast to the 2017-2019 period, when several patients with East African trypanosomiasis were medivaced to South Africa for treatment, COVID-19-related travel and tourism restrictions and economic constraints have probably reduced human exposure to the disease in endemic areas of Central and East Africa during 2020-2021.

[ProMED thanks Drs Louis Kock, Pieter Ekermans, Lucille Blumberg, and John Frean for this report. East African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) is still endemic in game reserves in southern Africa, and anyone with fever and a negative malaria test should be suspected of trypanosomiasis if there is a history of exposure. - Mod.EP
