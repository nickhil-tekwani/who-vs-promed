[According to the Mozambique page on the WRLFMD [World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease] website at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/moz.htm, the following serotypes have been recorded there throughout the years:

FMDV-O: 1974, 1980
FMDV-SAT 1: 1955, 1964-1967, 1971, 1974-1975, 1977-1978, 1981, 2002-2003
FMDV-SAT 2 1951, 1958, 1960, 1964-1965, 1969-1972, 1977-1981, 1983, 2010, 2014-2016
FMDV-SAT 3: 1959
Note: All three SAT types are probably endemic in the African buffalo population.

A map of FMD distribution by serotype and topotype for Southern Africa, 2012-2016, is available in the EUFMD's (European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly global report for October 2017 (page 26).
