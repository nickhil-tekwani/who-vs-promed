Outbreak summary:
Total outbreaks: 53 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 534 / 392 / 12 / 58 / 451

Data from other species (sheep, goats) have not become available. This may be due to absence of disease or deficient surveillance. The current, 4th follow-up report from Algeria adds outbreaks that had taken place earlier during the event and were not included in previous follow-up reports; this includes 3 outbreaks in the western province of Tlemcen, bordering Morocco, which had taken place in July/August 2018. Such spread is obviously of concern to Morocco. In 2016, an epizootic caused by another topotype of FMD virus serotype O engulfed all 3 Maghreb countries when eventually it entered Morocco from its eastern neighbour Algeria.

The virus strain currently circulating in Algeria (serotype O, topotype EA3; see 20180805.5947341) is almost identical to the strain causing an epizootic in Guinea. This fact led to the hypothesis that the 2 events can be linked and that they have a common origin in West Africa. From a reliable source, we are informed that FMD outbreaks are recently seen in Mauritania, in herds returning from transhumance from southern neighbouring countries (e.g., Mali and Senegal). The disease spread is from the eastern part of Mauritania toward the west and northwest, where the main dairy production is located. FMD virus serotype O (EA3) is known to be one of the circulating strains.

Notably, in early 2017, FMD virus O topotype EA-3 penetrated, on the eastern side of the Mediterranean, 2 Asian territories: the Gaza strip (PAT) and southern Israel. This spread most probably originated in Egypt, where EA-3 had been circulating for several years. - Mod.AS
