An 8 year old boy is lucky to be alive after suffering a serious illness as the result of a mosquito bite. He fell ill 2 weeks ago, initially complaining of a headache and running a fever. Of course, his parents thought it was just a virus that would have to run its course and were not too alarmed. They tried typical over-the-counter medications to reduce the fever and to get rid of the headache.

"But the treatments we were using didn't seem to be working very well and on Sunday, 2 Aug 2015, he took a turn for the worse. Late Sunday afternoon he asked his Dad to carry him to the living room, he must have been tired of lying in his bed after sleeping many hours throughout the past few days. At that point that it was time to take him to the hospital," his mother said. His parents rushed him to the emergency room and in a matter of 10 minutes he was totally unresponsive, lethargic, screaming and crying. After running some tests, the doctor on staff suspected that he had meningitis. By 10 pm that evening, the boy was being transported to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus [Ohio], where he spent 5 days recovering from his illness.

"When we reached the emergency room at Children's, he was still unresponsive, but was still crying and you could tell that he was in a lot of pain. They did a cat scan and then did a lumbar puncture or spinal tap. After running numerous tests, an MRI revealed that the entire left side of his brain was swollen. After running more tests, they gave the family the LaCrosse encephalitis diagnosis, which was causing the swelling of the brain," his mother said. He was discharged from the hospital and returned home on 7 Aug [2015].

[The above Ohio case occurred in 1 of the focal La Crosse virus (LACV)-endemic areas. From 2004-2013, 178 cases of La Crosse encephalitis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov/lac/resources/LACbystate-table_2004-2013.pdf). Clinical encephalitis caused by La Crosse virus is commonest in pre-school-aged children but can also occur in older individuals. It is seldom fatal, but significant hospital stays may occur and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses, because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus, without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. The mosquito involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_, the reservoir of the virus that is maintained in this mosquito through transovarial transmission.

LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas:
1 - in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois;
2 - Ohio; and
3 - the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html).

There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA. CDC has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution and clinical characteristics (http://www.cdc.gov/LAC/index.html).
