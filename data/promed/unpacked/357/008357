Russia: 10 cases of tickborne encephalitis in Kuzbass
-----------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the "tick" season 23 839 people including 5184
children have sought treatment for tick bites in the Kemerovsk district
(Oblast) according to the director of the Rosptrebnadzor Service, Valentin
Sokolov.
In the past week [25-29 Jun 2007], 1715 people have sought treatment for
tick bite, which according to local epidemiologists is an indication that
the risk [of contracting tickborne encephalitis] is decreasing. In all 23
280 people have been vaccinated.
About 400 people have been admitted to hospital on a provisional diagnosis
of tickborne encephalitis, 68 of them during the past week. Valentin
Sokolov admitted that these are high numbers in comparison with those of
last year [2006]. But he thinks that those in hospital are people who
delayed seeking treatment for tick bites.
So far tickborne encephalitis has been confirmed by laboratory tests in the
case of 10 patients. No fatalities have been reported so far.
