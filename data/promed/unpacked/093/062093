China has confirmed a fatal H7N9 avian flu case in a 66 year old woman, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said today [3 Sep 2014].

The woman is from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the country's far north west. The only other reported H7N9 case in the region, in a 53 year old man, was confirmed last week. All other mainland H7N9 cases have been in eastern provinces, hundreds of miles away. The 2 cases are not epidemiologically linked, the CHP said.

The CHP, which reported both cases today [3 Sep 2014], said the woman died last month [August 2014] but gave no other details about her case. A case list compiled by the infectious disease message board FluTrackers, however, says she became ill on 14 Jul 2014, was hospitalized on 17 Jul 2014, and died on 3 Aug 2014.

The country has now confirmed 454 H7N9 cases, according to the FluTrackers list.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (3 Sep 2014) received notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of 2 cases of human infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) affecting a woman and a man aged 66 and 53, respectively in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The woman passed away last month [August 2014]. According to the NHFPC's information, the 2 cases were sporadic and were not epidemiologically linked.

A total of 438 cases have been confirmed in the Mainland, including Zhejiang (139 cases), Guangdong (109 cases), Jiangsu (56 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Fujian (22 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (8 cases), Shandong (5 cases), Beijing (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (2 cases), Guizhou (one case) and Hebei (one case).

"Locally, we will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities are ongoing according to the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH said. "In view of cases confirmed in the Mainland, further sporadic cases are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Those planning to travel outside Hong Kong should maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times," the spokesman urged.

"All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

Regarding health education for travellers, display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are proceeding. Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas and provinces.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:
* do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
* if contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
* avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
* poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
* wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
* cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
* avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
* wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

The public may visit the CHP's avian influenza page at http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html and website at http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influ,enza_e.pdf for more information on avian influenza-affected areas and provinces.

Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus -- update
------------------------------------------------------------
On 2 September 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Details of the cases are as follows:

A 66 year old woman from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. She had onset of symptoms on 14 July 2014, was admitted to a hospital on 17 July 2014, and died on 3 August 2014. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry.

A 53 year old man from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. He had onset of symptoms on 5 August and was admitted to a hospital on 9 August. He is currently in a mild condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:

strengthened surveillance and situation analysis;
reinforced case management and medical treatment;
conducted risk communication with the public and released information.

The overall risk assessment has not changed.

The previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry. At this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. There has been no evidence of sustained human to human transmission, therefore the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

[The significance of this report can be appreciated best by viewing the map of the locations of previous human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection in China. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is remote from previous outbreaks of human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection: see http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/downloads/topics/cidrap_h7n9_update_080414.pdf. From the other data compiled by CIDRAP News and displayed at this site, it is possible that this case may indicate the onset of a 3rd wave of human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP

The 1st identified cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in humans occurred in China during Feb and Mar 2013.

Most people with confirmed H7N9 virus infection had severe lower respiratory tract illness, were epidemiologically unrelated, and had a history of recent exposure to poultry. However, limited, non-sustained human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission could not be ruled out in 4 families (ref 1).

In April 2013, the Chinese Veterinary authorities notified the OIE about the occurrence of infection of pigeons and chickens with low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus H7N9, suggested as being very similar to the virus infecting humans. This LPAI virus does not cause serious clinical signs in animals. Circumstantial evidence suggested that humans were infected from subclinically infected avians.

The source or possible reservoir of influenza A(H7N9) is being investigated by relevant authorities including Veterinary Services, the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the animal health services of China, as well as at international levels through the collaboration between the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Health Organization (WHO) (ref 2).

The 1st human case in Hong Kong of H7N9 involved a person returning from the mainland in late November 2013; the Hong Kong government suspended the import of live chickens from the relevant farms and notified Mainland authorities and the WHO about the case. HK's handling of the issue is exemplary. New measures, since January 2014, include -- in addition to the enhanced surveillance activities on the Mainland -- the destruction of live poultry consignments in case found PCR-positive upon arrival in HK, as well as their contacts (see 20140118.2182744).

Countries at risk for cross-border spread from China include Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and Mongolia.
