In response to Mr. Merritt Clifton's statement on vaccination taboos in India:
I am appalled by [the statement that "Many Indians believe that
vaccination violates fundamental precepts of their religious beliefs
because they interpret it as ingesting an animal substance...This antipathy
toward vaccination explains the use of a homeopathic response to JE. No
matter how JE vaccines are made, the belief will be that they are animal
products, and their use will be resisted for that reason."
Many more Indians, than generally assumed in the Western world, ingest
animal substance in India and certainly when they reside abroad. As far as
I know there is no taboo in Hindu religion against vaccinations. I can
confidently state that religious taboos as far fetched as those indicated
in this message are practiced by a MINORITY in India. The rate of
childhood immunizations are high enough to negate the declaration in this
message.
Japanese encephalitis vaccine is not a universally recommended childhood
vaccination and there is no known curative drug(s) for encephalitis other
than clinical case management. So whether the person opts for homeopathy
or other traditional form of treatment, the ultimate result would be the
capacity of the patient to be able to overcome the neurological damage
caused by the encephalitis. I may be biased towards the allopathic case
management techniques available in a hospital setting that may enhance a
positive outcome. But, that again depends upon the hospital.
What might be more appropriate as a criticism is the lack of a systematic
approach to the issue; i.e., how was it decided that there was indeed an
outbreak? Was the illness meningitis or encephalitis? What was the
epidemic curve in time, geography, and demography? What were the organisms
that were ruled out as causative agents? How was Japanese encephalitis
confirmed? How was the association with pigs considered higher risk than
the association with mosquitoes? Were any steps taken to rule out
Malaysia's Nipah virus which started with a report of a Japanese
encephalitis outbreak in Feb 1999?
All these steps may have been undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh Health
Ministry but not reported by the media or picked up by the various
ProMED-mail contributors.

I hail from Andhra Pradesh and I still have strong roots in India. Although
it leaves [me totally flabbergasted, the news of "public resistance or
indifference to vaccination owing to religious reasons", saddens me.
I can assure you though, that in the urban and rural areas where I have
lived for almost 25 years, I have only seen people scrambling to get
vaccinated. Government hospitals offer vaccinations free of cost to
increase public health awareness among the masses. In a country where
vaccinations are as well received as the popular adage itself, "PREVENTION
IS BETTER THAN CURE", this day in age, I find the news very hard to believe.

This is in reference to Merritt Clifton' s comments about religious beliefs
hampering the success of immunization programs in India. For one who
practised in Pune, (Maharashtra), India for over seven years, I never came
across anybody who refused immunizations on the grounds of religious
beliefs. I was practising in a cosmopolitan area where people from all
walks of life and religious denominations, including Jains, lived. As per
the 1991 census Jains constituted only 0.4% of India's total population
which today stands at 993,169,512 (Registrar General & Census Commissioner
of India). In Andhra Pradesh State, the state in question, there are 26,564
Jains out of a population of 66,304,854. This is only 0.04% of the
population and less than the total Jain population of the United States
(approximately 60,000).
In 1986/87 we ran a successful Polio Immunization Program with the Round
Table Club (a young men's service organisation akin to the Rotary and Lions
Clubs) where we immunized over 2000 children in the slum areas of Pune,
over a five month period (Pulse Immunization). During this period we never
came across a single parent who refused the immunization on the grounds
that the children were ' ingesting an animal substance'. Our coverage was
over 90% of the population in those areas. Nor did we have a problem with
BCG,DPT or Measles/MMR Immunizations (which are part of the Primary
Immunisation schedule) at our Well Baby Clinic. In fact I have had more
problems convincing members of Jehovah's Witnesses in Kenya (where I was
practising for 8 years) about the benefits of immunizations and need for
blood transfusions than I have ever had with any other group. So to talk
about the beliefs of a community which are are as Premchand B. Gada
(JAFNA/JAINA Education Committee) puts it 'in very low minority' and try
and extrapolate this to the beliefs of a vast majority of Indians would
seem a little unfair.
As regards the pigs, Merritt Clifton's assertion that these are 'street
pigs and a vital part of the garbage disposal system' maybe true to some
extent. However, we must remember that the Erukala community in Andhra
Pradesh earns a livelihood by rearing pigs and is protesting against the
State Government's drive to kill all the them. The failure, if any, of the
immunization programme in Andhra Pradesh probably stems more from what an
Indian Express (National Daily) correspondent described as 'when the
killer came calling this year, the administration of country was deep
asleep. By the time the Government woke up, Japanese Encephalitis had
spread across the State and had killed 180 children (as reported on
1/12/99). The logistics of covering the vast affected areas and the ability
of getting the vaccine to the State which costs about Rs.500 (Â£7) per dose
is only going to further hamper any progress in getting to grips with this
problem. The Orissa State Government 's incompetence during the recent
cyclone only goes to show that 'preventive measures' are not words that
state or national bureaucrats and politicians in India are familiar with.
Its always appears to be case of closing the stable after the horse has
bolted out.

[Three excellent contributions. It is always easier to blame the victims
for their illnesses (JE, Nipah, AIDS, etc.). We will cut this string with
a quote from Mahatma Ghandi who, when asked what he thought of Western
civilization said, "I think it would be a good idea." - Mod.CHC
