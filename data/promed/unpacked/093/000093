Horse virus toll at 6, with death in Wellington
-----------------------------------------------
Another horse died Friday [29 Dec 2006] evening after contracting the
highly contagious equine herpesvirus.
Veterinarians euthanized Seabreeze after the horse, which was being housed
at the Palm Beach Equine Clinic in Wellington, developed acute neurological
symptoms early Friday [29 Dec 2006], said Mark Fagan, spokesman with the
Florida Department of Agriculture.
Seabreeze was the latest horse euthanized since a racehorse at the Payson
Park training center in Indiantown was put down on 22 Dec 2006 after
displaying symptoms of the virus.
A total of 6 horses have died after contracting the virus since the
outbreak began on 29 Nov 2006.
On Friday [29 Dec 2006], another horse, housed at S&L Farms in Wellington,
tested positive for the virus, and veterinarians began monitoring 2 others
for signs of illness. The other 2 are at the Palm Beach Equine Sports Complex.
Veterinarians became suspicious of Seabreeze after they noticed the horse
wobbling and not using its tail to swat away flies. Both are classic
examples of neurological disorders, Fagan said.
The virus is spread through the air, primarily by horse sneezes. It can be
carried on shoes, clothes, hands and barn tools. The virus cannot be passed
to humans.
Infected horses display flu-like symptoms, and pregnant horses may abort.
In extreme cases, the virus attacks the horse's nervous system,
necessitating euthanasia.
The Florida Department of Agriculture has placed 10 facilities under
state-mandated quarantine: 7 in Wellington, one in Ocala, one in Indiantown
and one in Jupiter Farms.
State veterinarians are optimistic that they have the virus under control,
Fagan said. "This is not alarming to us because this death is within the
quarantined facilities," he said. "We're still encouraged that there are no
new (cases) outside the quarantined areas."
Scott Swerdlin of Palm Beach Equine Clinic said, "Everything's under
control, and I'm sure that this thing will be over in a few days."
The equine herpes outbreak is hitting at a time when thousands of horses
from around the world travel to Wellington for the 10-week Winter
Equestrian Festival and for polo matches. Scheduled to begin on 24 Jan
2007, the festival generates millions of dollars, village officials estimate.
The outbreak was traced to 5 horses from Europe that arrived in Wellington
on 29 Nov 2006 by way of New York.

HV-1 Update: Golden Gate Horse Positive; Quarantine Issued
-----------------------------------------------
Dr. Rick Arthur reports no "cross relationship" between EHV outbreaks in
California and Florida.
Golden Gate Fields, Bay Meadows and Pleasanton were placed under quarantine
on 29 Dec 2006 after a horse from Golden Gate was diagnosed as positive for
the neurological strain of EHV-1 [Equine Herpesvirus-1].
The California Horse Racing Board (CHRB) Friday [29 Dec 2006] issued an
advisory placing the 3 tracks under quarantine as one facility. Racing will
continue as normal at Golden Gate, but no horses may leave those
facilities, and horses that enter those tracks will then be subject to
EHV-1 quarantine conditions.
Royal Brass, a 3-year-old gelding trained by Lloyd Mason, "showed signs of
neurological discomfort" following exercise on the track at Golden Gate on
28 Dec 2006, said track spokesman Tom Ferrall. Royal Brass was sent to the
University of California-Davis for testing, and the EHV-1 finding was
confirmed there Friday [29 Dec 2006] morning. Three horses entered Friday
by Mason were scratched, and all of his barn's horses were to be tested.
The quarantine restrictions will remain in place for a minimum of 10 days.
About 2100 horses are affected by the quarantine in Northern California:
1300 stabled at Golden Gate, 600 from Bay Meadows and 200 based at Pleasanton.
Dr. Rick Arthur, the equine medical director for the CHRB, said that it
does not look like the Golden Gate case is related to the current situation
in Florida. Earlier in December 2006, it appeared that some horses on a
flight to California might have come into contact with the warm-bloods that
may have triggered the Florida situation, but Arthur said that all of those
horses have since tested negative.
"We can't find any cross-relationship at all," Arthur said Friday [29 Dec
2006], "which is what made this somewhat surprising and one of the reasons
we moved as quickly as we did. The horse from Golden Gate Fields is at the
University of California at Davis with severe clinical signs of EHV-1."
The CHRB advisory said that the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine is
assisting the CHRB with its infectious disease control efforts.
Arthur said that during the quarantine, horses from the 3 Northern
California tracks would not be allowed to travel to Santa Anita for racing.
Shortly after the advisory was released Friday [29 Dec 2006] at about 2
p.m. Pacific Standard Time, Arthur said that the CHRB would "have to figure
something out" for horses currently in transit.
Though Arthur could not speculate on how long the quarantine period would
last, he said that, typically, the incubation period for EHV-1 is 8 to 12
days. New testing procedures will allow the CHRB to obtain results much
more quickly than in the past, he added.
This is the 1st outbreak of this strain of EHV in California, Arthur said.
