[The most recent annual report from Laos available at OIE's WAHID
interface is the one of 2005. According to its information, FMD was
present clinically in the country during 2005 and no vaccination
against it has been applied. From the current report it appears that
FMD vaccination is still not applied in Laos.

The following updated information on FMD in Laos (Lao People's
Democratic Republic) is derived from the country-page, the Web site
of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD), available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/lao.htm>:

FMD 1st recorded: O (1978), Asia 1 (1984), A (2003)
FMD eradicated: No
Serotypes (last reported): O (2008), Asia 1 (2002), A (2006)
Current status: Endemic.

It is further indicated that during the 3 years 2005-2007, 9 samples
sent from Laos were found FMD positive (serotypes A and O). During
2008 (more specific, on 24 Jul 2008), 5 samples from Laos were
received, all found to be of serotype O, topotype SEA (South East
Asia), strain Mya98. The said Web site includes also a Molecular
Epidemiology Report Form, with information on the 10 most closely
related viruses. The 1st 3 in the said list (difference less than
0.31 percent) are O/MAY/4/2007, O/MAY/7/2007 and O/TAI/7/2007. There
is also a list of the relevant reference strains (for possible
vaccine selection).

According to the information available on the Web site of the OIE
SEAFMD Regional Co-ordination Unit (monthly reports of member countries, at
<http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php?site=seafmd>) the October 2008
outbreak is the 1st FMD outbreak (of all serotypes) reported from
Laos since at least 5 years; this information is clearly deficient,
but is compensated by the following summary available in the "News
and events" section, which includes the summary "FMD at a Glance in
2008," <http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/news.php?articleID=74>:

"...Only outbreaks of serotype O were noted in Vietnam and the total
number of outbreaks and circulating serotypes were continuously on
the decline as compared with 2007. In Lao PDR, outbreaks of serotype
O were only limited in 2 provinces (Vientiane and Xayaburi) while
Myanmar had some sporadic cases of serotype O following the
devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis. Cambodia has seen a relative
increase in the number, and geographical distribution of outbreaks
this year, clustering in the provinces nearby Phnom Penh and southern
part of the country."

The current official notification to the OIE is, hopefully, an
enunciator of improved animal disease reporting from Laos. - Mod.AS]
