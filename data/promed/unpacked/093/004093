Clemson Livestock and Poultry Health officials have confirmed eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) in the state's 9th horse for 2020. The affected horse, a 5 year old Tennessee walking horse mare from Lexington County, is deceased.

Previous EEE cases in South Carolina have occurred in Berkeley, Edgefield, Florence, Horry, and Marion counties. Horry has been hardest hit, with 4 confirmed cases. Other affected counties have had just one confirmed case each.

A mosquitoborne illness has been found in South Carolina horses, according to the South Carolina Dept. of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). The EEE virus is transmitted between black-tailed mosquitoes and various tree-perching birds, peaking in the spring and summer months. Once the mosquitoes have contracted the virus, they can to pass it to people and animals, such as horses.

The EEE virus is most commonly found in the Lowcountry, Midlands, and Pee Dee regions, and has been confirmed in horses in 8 South Carolina counties: Aiken, Berkeley, Colleton, Florence, Horry, Jasper, Lexington, and Marion.

Horses with the EEE virus face a 90% fatality rate and can take 2 to 5 days to show signs, which include: stumbling and poor coordination, inability to rise, paralysis, head pressing, circling, and convulsions.

The EEE virus takes 3 to 10 days to show symptoms in people, which can include fever, malaise, intense headaches, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting. EEE can also cause neurological symptoms which may appear within 5 days. These include meningitis, encephalitis, seizures, and coma. DHEC found that 96% of people diagnosed do not show symptoms; however, of those who do, 1/3rd or more die, while others can suffer permanent and severe neurological damage.

Dr Chris Evans, the state public health entomologist with DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services, lists some ways to help protect yourself from mosquito bites: use an EPA-registered repellent, citronella, or lemon eucalyptus oil; avoid the outdoors at dawn or dusk; wear long sleeves and pants; keeping the property clear of standing water in which mosquitoes can breed.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) today announced that EEE, a mosquitoborne illness, has been detected in 11 horses in 8 South Carolina counties in the Lowcountry, Midlands, and Pee Dee regions from 10 Jun 2020 to 21 Aug 2020.

South Carolina counties in which the virus has been detected include Aiken, Berkeley, Colleton, Florence, Horry, Jasper, Lexington, and Marion.

The EEE virus amplifies itself in nature during spring and summer by being transmitted between black-tailed mosquitoes (_Culiseta melanura_) and various tree-perching birds in forested freshwater swamps. Since black-tailed mosquitoes thrive in these swamps in the north eastern and southern parts of the state, EEE virus is more commonly detected in the Lowcountry, Midlands, and Pee Dee regions.

During late summer and fall, the virus is acquired by other mosquito species after having fed on EEE-virus infected birds. These other mosquito species are then able to transmit EEE virus to people and other animals, such as horses. The virus cannot be transmitted directly from horses to people or from horses to mosquitoes.

In horses, EEE virus takes 2 to 5 days to cause signs and has a 90 per cent fatality rate. The virus causes stumbling and poor coordination, inability to rise, paralysis, head pressing, circling and convulsions. Veterinarians in South Carolina frequently recommend vaccination before likely exposure to mosquito bites and booster vaccinations to ensure appropriate immunity levels. Consult your veterinarian for vaccination guidance.

"The black-tailed mosquito is not often targeted for control because this species is not a major nuisance to people, and due to the inaccessible nature of many freshwater swamps that makes ground-based control of larvae and adults difficult," said Dr Chris Evans, state public health entomologist with DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services. "Efforts to reduce black-tailed mosquito populations are usually made when EEE virus is detected in an area, but virus transmission also can be mitigated by control of other mosquito species transmitting the virus from infected birds to people and other animals. Despite the cooler weather of the approaching fall season, residents still need to protect themselves from mosquito bites," said Evans. "The risk for EEE and West Nile virus transmission to people is always greater toward the end of mosquito season, even after extended periods of cold weather."

Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) officials have confirmed 3 horses in 3 separate counties with eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) and suspect that a 4th horse succumbed to the disease on 22 Aug 2020.

Affected counties include Clare, Montcalm, and Newaygo. The Montcalm County horse, an under-vaccinated yearling filly of unspecified breed, experienced onset of clinical signs on 17 Aug 2020. Signs included ataxia (loss of control of bodily movements), circling, and dull mentation. She was confirmed positive on 24 Aug 2020 and was subsequently euthanized.

On 18 Aug 2020, a Newaygo County horse and a Clare County pony began showing clinical signs. The horse, a 4 year old draft mix gelding, experienced ataxia, fever, and hind-end weakness and was euthanized.

The 3 year old pony mare from Clare County experienced ataxia, circling, head-pressing, and tremors. Veterinarians confirmed her positive on 24 Aug 2020. The pony, which was under-vaccinated, is deceased. An additional Clare County horse suspected to have EEE experienced similar clinical signs and died on 22 Aug 2020 within 36 hours of showing signs of illness.

Michigan's 1st case of EEE in a horse was confirmed earlier this month [August 2020]. A 2nd case occurred about 10 days later.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the EEE virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquitoborne diseases in the United States.

**Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
**Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
**Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
**Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
**Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the US. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses.
**Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
**If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
**Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
**Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

Six horses in north western Wisconsin have tested positive for EEE according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS). WDHS is urging everyone to continue to protect themselves from mosquito bites after the positive tests for EEE were discovered.

According to WDHS, the EEE virus can be spread to humans, horses and other animals through a bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire EEE virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus will not spread from person to person or directly between animals and humans.

But, the presence of EEE positive horses in the state confirms mosquitoes in the area are infected with the EEE virus, spreading the virus to people and other animals. No EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin in 2020 at this time.

Many people infected with EEE virus do not get sick. Those who do become ill may develop encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that typically begins with the sudden development of fever, headache, chills and vomiting, according to WDHS.

WDHS also stated the illness may become severe, resulting in disorientation, seizures, coma or death. There is no specific treatment for EEE illness, and death occurs in approximately 30% of people who develop encephalitis from EEE. To learn more about the EEE virus visit:

[Eastern equine encephalitis is preventable. The vaccine for EEE is usually combined with some other mosquitoborne diseases such as West Nile virus (WNV) (mentioned in this update), and western equine encephalitis (WEE). These vaccines usually have tetanus included, hence a lot of protection for the dollars spent. The vaccine is a series of 2-3 vaccines given 3-4 weeks apart.

EEE protection wanes the fastest, and in areas where the prevalence of the disease is high, horse owners are encouraged to revaccinate approximately every 3-4 months for best protection. - Mod.TG
