Seafood lovers have been warned to be careful with raw mussels after an outbreak of foodborne illness.

New Zealand Food Safety announced on Fri 21 Jun 2019 that it has seen an uptick in the number of people contracting food poisoning from _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_.

Most of the people who got sick ate commercial grown mussels harvested in Coromandel. Symptoms are stomach cramps, watery diarrhea and sometimes nausea, vomiting and fever. There are concerns the strain affecting people could be unusually aggressive.

"It is possible that the strain of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is unusually aggressive, which may mean that even low numbers could cause illness," NZ food safety director of regulation Paul Dansted said. "Additional testing of mussels and the waters that they are being grown in is also underway to help us understand why this has happened. The mussels at the centre of the outbreak were all bought in their raw state, in the shell. They are not the mussels that can be bought in plastic pottles. Those mussels are cooked and marinated and are not affected."

NZ Food Safety says people need to be careful when cooking mussels and heat them above 65C [149 F]. It also advised washing hands after handling shellfish and to avoid cross-contamination between raw and cooked shellfish.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is commonest in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska and British Columbia, accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Indeed, eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the Northern Hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
