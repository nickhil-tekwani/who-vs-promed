Cases of leptospirosis have been reported in the Chernovtsy region of
Ukraine. According to Natalia Gopko, Manager of the Especially
Dangerous Infections Department of the Chernovtsy regional
sanitary-and-epidemiologic station, this week 2 inhabitants of
Chernovtsy fell ill with leptospirosis.
For the first 10 months of 2005, 27 inhabitants of the region
received treatment in the infectious disease hospital of Chernovtsy
for leptospirosis, and 8 persons died. These mortalities were thought
to be caused by delay in seeking medical attention.
Very high percentages of positive results for leptospirosis have been
found in 2005 in mice: in Aug 2005, 25 percent; in Sep 2005, 10
percent.
