Another "yellowing" disease found in Bac Giang
-----------------------------------------------
In the summer-autumn season 2010, farmers in Bac Giang province in
Northern Viet Nam observed yellowing symptoms in their rice crops
about a month after high populations of green leafhoppers (GLH) were
observed [see figures below]. The syndrome seemed similar to rice
tungro virus disease, which is prevalent in Southeast Asia.

However, scientists from Hanoi Agricultural University and Plant
Protection Research Institute using RT-PCR identified the disease to
be caused by _Rice yellow stunt virus_ (RYSV; also known as Rice
transitory yellowing virus). The virus is known to be transmitted by
GLH. It was first found in 1965 in Taiwan and in Southern and Central
China, and later reported in Japan and Thailand. In 1985 the diseases
were also reported in Viet Nam and Laos.

Leaf samples collected in Bac Giang province in September 2010
reacted positive to antiserum for RYSV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay.

[_Rice yellow stunt virus_ (RYSV; genus _Nucleorhabdovirus_; synonym
Rice transitory yellowing virus) affects naturally only rice.
Symptoms may include leaf yellowing (starting on lower leaves),
reduced tillering, and mild stunting. Plants may recover temporarily
and appear healthy, but symptoms may reappear ('transitory'
yellowing). Rice varieties differ in symptom expression and
_japonica_ (see link below) types are more susceptible and show more
severe symptoms than _indica_ types.

RYSV is transmitted by green rice leafhoppers (_Nephotettix_ species)
at different levels of efficiency. Insects remain infectious for life
but the virus does not pass through eggs. Infectious vector insects
transported on air currents or by people movements can spread the
virus over long distances. RYSV shares common vectors with _Rice
dwarf virus_, _Rice tungro bacilliform virus_, and _Rice tungro
spherical virus_, and they frequently occur together. No information
is available on possible seed transmission of RYSV.

After the harvest of late-planted rice, RYSV overwinters in rice
stubble or in the vector. The incidence of RYSV is generally low in
the 1st crop of the season and high in the 2nd. Weed hosts of the
vectors may also play a role in the infection cycle. Disease
management may include vector control, cultural practices to minimise
inoculum, and the use of rice varieties with low RYSV susceptibility.
Research is being carried out into developing RYSV resistant
transgenic rice lines by using nucleocapsid protein gene sequences.

In Viet Nam, RYSV was reported from southern areas in 2008 and 2007
(ProMED-mail posts 20081017.3291 and 20070614.1939). A number of
other viruses also affect rice crops in the country, but control
measures are difficult and slow to implement.
