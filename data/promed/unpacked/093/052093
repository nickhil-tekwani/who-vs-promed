[This outbreak has occurred within the same geographical area as the
5 previous outbreaks of December 2008, around Fianarantsoa, a city
south of the capital. ProMED-mail is still expecting
information with respect to any human cases from the outbreak area.
We also hope that village dairy cattle are not sentinels for human
disease as has occurred elsewhere. - Mods.FE/PC]
