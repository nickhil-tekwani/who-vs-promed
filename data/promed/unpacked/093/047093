Anthrax hits Chipinge
---------------------------
At least 20 cattle have died in Chipinge following an outbreak of anthrax this month [October 2020]. Most of the anthrax cases were recorded in Chibuwe, Dakate, Zamuchiya, and Chisumbanje, which are periodically hit by the disease due to its proximity to Save Conservancy.

It is believed that wild animals such as buffaloes stray and mix with domestic animals.

While Manicaland's Provincial Veterinary officer, Dr Charles Guri said they are yet to receive any reports of the disease, an official from the Chipinge Livestock Department spoke on condition of anonymity citing protocol and confirmed the development. The official said the Department of Veterinary Services is on the ground compiling statistics. "Extension officers from the affected areas are encouraging farmers to follow the Department of Veterinary Services' instructions on how to bury the carcasses of cattle that would have succumbed to the disease," he said.

Chipinge Rural District Council Ward 20 Councillor Charles Mugidho also confirmed the outbreak. He said villagers are risking their lives by consuming anthrax infected meat.

He said villagers are risking their lives by consuming anthrax infected meat. "Farmers are counting their losses and in Ward 20 of Dakate Village, more than 10 cattle are reported to have died, while another 11 cattle are said to have succumbed to the disease in the neighbouring Zamuchiya area. The number of cattle being affected is swelling and some of the farmers are not forthcoming with the number of the beasts that have died since they are selling the meat," said Councillor Mugidho.

He called for awareness campaigns on the risks of consuming infected meat.

Anthrax is a highly infectious and fatal disease. Infected animals that do not receive treatment die within a few days. Humans usually get anthrax through direct contact with infected livestock, often when spores get into a cut on the skin or through consuming infected carcasses Without treatment, anthrax can be fatal. However, early treatment with antibiotics is very effective.

[Chipinge District is the southernmost district in Manicaland province. It is bounded on the north by Chimanimani District, on the west by Masvingo Province, and on the east by Mozambique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipinge_District).

Zimbabwe is overdue to niche map potential anthrax areas in the country which would be an important step in setting up a proactive control and surveillance programme. Responding to outbreaks as they occur and are reported -- 2 different events, unfortunately -- is not the most cost effective way of handling this disease, though traditional. Niche mapping allows the identification of high risk areas for proactive vaccination. As new outbreaks occur and vaccination begins to have an impact, these areas can be redefined and contracted. Believe it or not but livestock anthrax, if efficiently controlled, is simultaneously subject to eradication.

Believe me, there are many success stories for anthrax eradication. To take just 2 examples, North Dakota is within sight of it; the UK has had just sporadic singular outbreaks in 2002, 2006, and 2015 but earlier they routinely had over 400 outbreaks each year. It is disappearing in Europe. - Mod.MHJ
