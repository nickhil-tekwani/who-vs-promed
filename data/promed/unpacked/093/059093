[Repeating last week's comment, "Reviewing reports for cases and positive environmental samples since 1 Jan 2021, there have been cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) confirmed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Liberia, Madagascar (cVDPV1), Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Yemen (cVDPV1) (cases associated with cVDPV2 in all but Madagascar and Yemen). Counties with no AFP confirmed cases but positive environmental samples (ES) for cVDPV2 include Egypt, Kenya, Somalia."

Interpretation: cVDPV transmission/circulation continues in 14 African countries, 4 Eastern Mediterranean region countries, and 1 European region country. It appears as though transmission in Nigeria is picking up with 8 states showing either AFP cases or positive environmental samples. Note that in last week's update there was notice of positive environmental samples in Kano state (Poliomyelitis update (15): global (cVDPV2), Nigeria 20210715.8522150). This week a positive case of AFP associated with cVDPV2 infection was confirmed, demonstrating the value of environmental sampling in identifying locations where the identified virus is circulating. For a map of Nigeria showing states, see https://nigerianfinder.com/map-of-nigeria-states/.

While there were no positive AFP cases or positive environmental samples for WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1), it has only been 2 weeks since the last positive environmental sample in Pakistan was reported. (Poliomyelitis update (14): Global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2, cVDPV1) 20210708.8505008). Right now, the risk of disease from the vaccine is greater than the risk from the disease from the wild virus.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. one sees cases of cVDPV are in a band across Africa and in Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP
