Abstract
--------
We identified influenza A(H9N2) virus G1 lineage in poultry in Burkina Faso. Urgent actions are needed to raise awareness about the risk associated with spread of this zoonotic virus subtype in the area and to construct a strategy for effective prevention and control of influenza caused by this virus.

[The 1st known infection by influenza A(H9N2) occurred in 1966 among turkeys in Wisconsin. During the 1990s, the virus reportedly circulated in turkeys in USA and among domestic poultry populations in several Asian and European countries, such as domestic ducks, chickens and turkeys in Germany, chickens in Italy, pheasants in Ireland, and chickens in Korea. More recently, it caused widespread outbreaks in commercial chickens in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, Korea, UAE, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq and Egypt. In several of these countries, vaccine has been deployed to bring the disease under control. Nevertheless, H9N2 infections have become endemic in commercial poultry in a significant number of countries and is now considered to have a near global, albeit sporadic distribution among poultry. Influenza A(H9N2) has also been identified in wild birds, domestic mammals, and, occasionally, in humans.

Zoonotic transmission of influenza A(H9N2) was not considered a concern until 1998-1999, when the virus was 1st isolated from pig samples; seropositive human cases were initially detected in Guangdong Province, China; and the virus was isolated from hospitalized patients in Hong Kong. More recently, human cases were reported also from Bangladesh and Egypt. Serological evidence of human infection has been reported in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and parts of North America. A map presenting the reported global distribution for influenza A(H9N2) in humans and animals from 1997 to 2013, is available at http://tinyurl.com/yc54uxws (derived from the review paper, Ref 1). In the said map, countries that detected influenza A(H9N2) in poultry (until 2013) have an orange background. Species-specific symbols were assigned to each country. When a human or animal was found to be seropositive for influenza A(H9N2), the species was colored green; if a virological sample from humans or animals tested positive, the species was colored red. Egypt, which reported its 1st human case in 2015, was obviously not signed in the (older) map.

The following comment of Mod.UBA, included in posting 20160901.4451359, is applicable: "The crucial role of H9N2 viruses at the animal-human interface is due to the wide host range, adaptation to both poultry and mammals, and extensive gene reassortment. In China, which is regarded as an epicenter of avian influenza viruses, the H9N2 virus has been detected in multiple avian species, including chicken, duck, quail, pheasant, partridge, pigeon, silky chicken, chukar, and egret".

As reminded in the current paper, which becomes ProMED-mail's first report on H9N2 in Burkina Faso, 3 main genetic lineages have been described among the Eurasian H9N2 subtype viruses: G1, Y280, and Y439 (Korean) lineage. In the past decade, the G1 lineage has spread mostly in gallinaceous birds across Asia, the Middle East, and eventually North Africa, where H9N2 outbreaks were reported in Libya (2006 and 2013), Tunisia (2010-2012), Egypt (2011-present) and Morocco (2016). The authors further indicate that "H5 strains belonging to clades 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4 are currently circulating in West Africa. This finding, combined with detection of human-like receptor specificity and 2 mutations typical of human influenza viruses in the H9N2 subtype virus from Burkina Faso, might indicate emergence of a strain capable of infecting humans and warrants additional attention to the avian influenza situation in West Africa. Furthermore, identification of H9N2 subtype viruses in Morocco and Burkina Faso in chickens suggests that commercial poultry trade between North and West Africa might have played a key role in spread of the virus".

The samples from Burkina Faso, collected in Jan 2017 from a layer farm that was experiencing decreased egg production and respiratory signs, were submitted to the OIE/FAO Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (Legnaro, Padova, Italy).
