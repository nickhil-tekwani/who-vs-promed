A Quebec City [Canada] based veterinary consultant says contaminated feed appears to be the most probable source of the outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED or PEDv). Authorities in the US are working to identify the source of an outbreak of PED that has spread to 17 states.

Dr Marie-Claude Poulin, a Quebec City based veterinary consultant who first encountered PED in 2000 while working in China, explains the infection is highly transmissible and she notes some of the farms she worked with became infected with PED when they did not become infected with PRRS [porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome].

The main problem is with contaminated transport trucks, which are contaminated with materials and fomites and are transported by humans.

Recently with some of the outbreaks in the USA it has been shown that the virus might be transmissible by aerosol over long distances but this remains to be confirmed and assessed in a more scientific way.

Interestingly there has been another study in the USA where they looked at trucks going to the slaughter house and 11 percent of the trucks that arrived clean, without PED virus, were leaving back with viruses. That means one truck out of 10 gets contaminated during the process of unloading the pigs.

So far it has not been possible to confirm how the disease got into the USA pig population. However, preliminary reports on the epidemiological investigation of the 1st cases has outlined that if there is some area that might need to be better investigated it is the feed.

Obviously they're not making a straight relationship with that, but if there is something to look at, it's probably the 1st aspect that we need to look at.

Dr Poulin says in the absence of effective vaccines the best defense against PED is adherence to strict biosecurity protocols.

[While feed may indeed become contaminated with viruses, the question may be: Why is the virus in the feed? What is the source of the virus?

One study indicates trucks unloading may acquire the virus. That implies the virus was already at the unloading place, and the virus is airborne. But is the source of the virus the pigs, the feces, the soil? Where is the virus that allows the feed to become contaminated? How did the virus get to the feed mill? Is this bulk feed, or bagged feed, or both?

This article raises more questions than it answers. - Mod.TG
