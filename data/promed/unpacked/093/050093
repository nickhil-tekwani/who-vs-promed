The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak has peaked nearly 2 months before
the original forecasts, although it will linger for months. The key,
according to Professor David King, the Chief Scientific Adviser, has been
the culling of healthy animals. The Government announced that on 23 Apr
2001 it would lift the restrictions on the tens of thousands of British
farmers with healthy animals in infected zones. Professor King said it was
the policy of culling healthy animals living next to infected farms that
was the direct cause of the downturn, which was expected to decline to a
few cases by 7 Jun 2001, the expected date of the election.
It was on the strength of his calculations the Government began the culling
policy on 23 Mar 2001. That date coincides almost exactly with the day when
the number of new cases began to fall. However, it was also over a week
after advisers told the Government that culling only the infected animals
was failing to contain the virus.
King said the slaughter of infected animals within 24 hours and of animals
on neighboring farms within 48 hours remained the key to a successful
eradication of the epidemic. However, this goal was still not being
achieved fully. He said vaccination would not replace this policy, but it
remained an option.
Professor King said "I believe it is the implementation of both these
aspects which has begun to turn this epidemic around. The key point is that
we must keep up the effort with the slaughtering-within-24 hours policy."
The average number of new cases per day was 32 last week, 11 fewer than the
previous week. This week the average could be even lower, especially since
Tuesday's unexpectedly high number of 41 contained many cases which were
confirmations of those in the previous week.
In Cumbria, the epidemic was in decline; but Devon and the Welsh borders,
particularly Gloucestershire, were still causing concern because the way
the disease was spreading was still not fully understood. Although there
had been 41 cases on Tuesday and 28 yesterday, bringing the total to 1234,
Prof King said the average had fallen to 20 to 30 cases a day. The
epidemic, he said, had plateaued.
Devon was one of the only areas to show no improvement, he said, which was
"a point of concern". He was also worried by outbreaks miles away from
infected farms, and blamed reckless movement of farm workers or animals.
"This is a plea to those working on infected farms to cut down their
movement to a minimum, and to use disinfection, and move animals only when
absolutely essential," he said. He said the general public were not
responsible for spreading the disease, and could visit the countryside as
long as they did not go near infected farms.
Professor King's projections at the end of March, which were compiled by
statisticians at Imperial College, London, showed the epidemic dwindling to
a handful of cases around the end of June. This week's figures are so
encouraging they may surpass their expectations.
There was good news for 3 other areas, placed under restrictions since
early March but had not since had a case. Large areas, designated infected
areas, will be reduced in size. It is hoped they will soon be removed from
restrictions entirely. Parts of Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, and
Somerset will have 2098 farms liberated from restrictions, which will allow
stock to be taken to abattoirs to sell into the meat market.
In other infected areas, some restrictions on movement will be lifted to
allow healthy animals to be taken for slaughter to enter the food chain.
This scheme is designed partly to help organic farmers get their stock to
local abattoirs and supply nearby shops. It depends on abattoirs
cooperating and is not expected to start before 23 Apr 2001. Lady Hayman,
the agriculture minister, said this would take pressure off the welfare
disposal scheme, where there are 1.6m animals waiting for slaughter. It
would also help to increase the amount of British meat on the market.

Scientists explain today for the first time the reason slaughter around the
areas affected by FMD is more effective than ring vaccination. They say
ring culling or vaccination is essential if the scale of the epidemic is to
be reduced from a worst-case scenario, where half the country's livestock
would eventually have to be slaughtered. But "culling is more effective
than vaccination," says Dr Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, in Science
with colleagues Dr Christl Donnelly and Prof Roy Anderson. Prof Anderson's
team concludes "extensive culling is sadly the only option for controlling
the epidemic."
Dr Ferguson's calculations show rapid culling on infected farms within 24
hours, and of surrounding farms within 48 hours, is required to stem the
epidemic. The cull on surrounding farms removes the "fuel" for the
epidemic, but ring vaccination is equally effective but must be more
widespread to have the same effect.
Vaccines, which consist of inactivated FMD virus, take up to 4 days to
produce immunity and vaccinated animals may harbor and pass on the virus.
The report says "culling reduces the susceptible population and reduces
transmission by removing infected (but undiagnosed) animals, while
vaccination essentially only achieves the former." Because vaccinated
animals need to be culled anyway to meet conditions allowing export
restrictions to be lifted, this "further questions the benefit of such
vaccination policies".
The team shows that movement restrictions introduced soon after the first
confirmed case resulted in a drop in the spread of the disease over a
distance of 9000 meters from 38 percent to 12 percent. However, these
measures were not enough, because the computer model revealed each case
would trigger up to 4 new cases. The 21 Mar 2001 measures - dubbed the
24/48 policy - cut that to closer to one new case, bringing the outbreak
under control by the end of March.
The report concludes that logistical difficulties in processing large
numbers of animals and significant delays between reporting cases and
culling on farms are still hindering efforts to fight the disease.
