Some of the country's passion fruit growers have lost up to 80% of their crops due to fusarium disease, also known as passion fruit wilt. The NZ Passion fruit Growers Association said the disease had been more prevalent in the last 2 years due to warmer weather. It was first discovered in New Zealand in 2015 but is suspected to always have been in the country since it is common in the crop elsewhere.

The disease is devastating for some growers, because once it is in the soil, it is difficult to get rid of. New plantings tend to die. There are some passion fruit varieties resistant to the wilt. The Association is looking at different root stocks being trialled by 10 growers and hope to know within the next 6 to 12 months if they are suitable.

[Strains and pathovars of _Fusarium oxysporum_ have now been reclassified as members of a species complex (FOSC; see link below for new taxonomy). The pathogens within the species complex vary in host range. Passion fruit wilt (also called 'sudden death') is caused by _F. oxysporum_ f.sp. _passiflorae_. Symptoms include yellowing of vines, wilting of branches, and root and collar rot. Eventually the whole plant dries up and dies.

FOSC fungi can survive in the soil for decades. Consequently, disease management is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. Integrated approaches have been developed for some crops, which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the diseases. Constant vigilance is required in areas where one of the fungi is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Different members of the FOSC cause wilting diseases with serious losses in other crops, such as banana (Panama disease), guava, vanilla, date palm, and a range of cucurbits. Each is highly specialised, attacking only a single crop species.
