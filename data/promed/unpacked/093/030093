Since the beginning of July 2012, 2 chikungunya cases imported from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have been diagnosed by the French Reference Laboratory, IRBA Marseille.

The 1st case is resident in Kinshasa, DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo]. She presented onset of symptoms (fever, headache, joint pains) on 1 Jun [2012], travelled to France on 3 Jul [2012] and attended an outpatient department on 10 Jul [2012] in Laveran military teaching hospital in Marseille (South of France) with persisting arthralgia. ELISA tests were unambiguously positive for both IgM and IgG anti-chikungunya

[ProMED thanks Violaine Gauthier for providing this firsthand information. These types of reports are especially valuable, as ProMED seldom receives reports of chikungunya virus infections acquired in Africa, although there was an outbreak in neighboring Republic of the Congo last year (2011), across the river from Kinshasa (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110702.2017). The infection was acquired before 1 Jun 2012 and the patient traveled to France on 3 Jul 2012, well after the viremic period, so there was no probability of ongoing transmission in France, even though _Aedes albopictus_, a vector mosquito competent for chikungunya virus transmission, is present in southern France.
