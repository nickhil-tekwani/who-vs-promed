In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in Canterbury, New Zealand, health officials put the total cases at 30, not including one under investigation. Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr. Ramon Pink says measles numbers continue to increase in Canterbury. Dr. Pink says 27 000 doses of the MMR vaccine arrived in Canterbury last week. "We have enough vaccines to immunise those who need it most -- people aged between 12 months and 28 years who have never been immunised."

The Macau Health Authority has confirmed 2 new cases of measles. They involve a female hospital doctor and a Nepalese migrant worker, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Macau to 8 in the first 3 months of this year [2019]. In the same period of 2018, 3 cases were recorded.

A 38-year-old Macau woman who is said to be a doctor working for the Department of Medicine in Kiang Wu Hospital in Santo Antonio, developed a fever on 14 Mar 2019 and a skin rash 5 days later. The doctor, who is now in fair condition at an isolation ward in the hospital, reportedly had contact with a patient infected with measles at work.

Another case reportedly involved a 37-year-old migrant worker from Nepal, who is said to be a groom working for Macau Jockey Club.

A 11-month-old baby boy was infected with measles after having travelled to Switzerland, the Health Bureau (SS) announced, classifying it as an imported case. This is the 4th case of imported measles in Macau since January 2019.

According to the SS statement on Tuesday [19 Mar 2019], the baby was born in Macau but was in Switzerland during the incubation period. Pediatric Emergency Service of the Public Hospital Conde de San Januario (CHCSJ)'s laboratory results on 19 Mar 2019 confirmed that the patient was infected with measles.

He was not vaccinated against measles virus since he had not yet reached the age of vaccination, which is 1 year of age. The SS stated that the patient is currently hospitalized in the isolation nursery of the CHCSJ, still with fever but with a clinical condition considered to be normal.

[5] Singapore: 38 cases, more than triple that of the same period last year

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/spike-measles-cases-in-first-11-weeks-of-2019-11366368


The number of measles cases in Singapore in the first 11 weeks of this year [2019] was more than triple that of the same period last year [2018], the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thu [21 Mar 2019]. As of 17 Mar 2019, there were 38 cases of measles recorded in Singapore, up from the 11 cases in the same period in 2018. There have been no deaths arising from the infection this year [2019], the MOH confirmed. This year's figure is the highest number recorded in the first 11-week period of the year since 2015.

MOH said there is currently no evidence of further spread of measles in the community, as majority of the reported cases this year were "single and sporadic local infections". It added that there were only 5 separate instances of the infection spreading to a family member or close friend.

Of the 38 people infected this year [2019], 25 contracted the virus locally, while the others were infected in the Philippines, Vietnam, Dubai and Thailand. Children made up 14 of the cases. Of these, 5 had missed their MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination and 9 were infants who were not due for their vaccinations.

Among the 24 adults, 15 were not known to have been vaccinated. The ministry said the majority of measles cases over the past 5 years were locally infected cases.

Measles vaccination is compulsory for all children residing in Singapore. As of 1 Feb 2019, a new requirement was introduced for foreign-born children applying for a long-term visit pass to Singapore to have their vaccinations. Those aged 12 and under will have to submit documentation of their vaccinations against diphtheria and measles.

In Ukraine, 11 people have died and more than 30 000 people have been infected this year [2019] in a major measles outbreak.

https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/03/article/hong-kong-confirmed-measles-cases-reach-12/


The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) in Hong Kong on Mon [18 Mar 2019] confirmed that a 41-year-old Hong Kong man was infected with measles, bringing the total number of cases in Hong Kong to 12 in the 1st quarter of 2019. The patient tested positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the measles virus. He was in a stable condition and has since been discharged.

The patient had not been vaccinated against measles and did not have contact with measles patients during the illness's incubation period, nor had he been traveling during the period of communicability. His immediate family and contacts, who have so far remained asymptomatic, have been put under medical observation. Investigations are ongoing and relevant contact tracing has been conducted, including the man's workplace.

Figures from the CHP showed that at least 12 confirmed measles cases were recorded in the first 3 months of this year [2019] compared with 4 cases recorded in all of 2017 and 15 cases in 2018, Apple Daily reported. Seven people are suspected to have imported cases from the Philippines, mainland China and Japan.

The number of measles cases in Pahang has alarmingly increased by 200% (21 cases) this year [2019] compared with only 7 cases reported during the same period between 1 Jan and 16 Mar last year [2018]. State health director Datuk Dr Sha'ari Ngadiman said parents shunning vaccinations was a major concern as 30% of measles cases in Pahang was due to their failure to provide immunisation. He said records revealed that Kuantan was the worst affected district with 19 cases while Rompin and Temerloh had one case each.

[8] Costa Rica: American family with 4 children suspected of having measles

The office of the Patronato Nacional de la Infancia (PANI) -- Costa Rica's child welfare service -- in Cobano, Puntarenas, says it will intervene in the case of the American couple with 4 children suspected of having measles The parents of these children, who have 5 other children, did not have them vaccinated and did not enroll them in any school in the Costa Rica.

The family of 11 is in strict isolation in Cabuya de Cobano, where they reside, to prevent them from infecting other people in their community. "We have already pronounced on our power to force the children to be vaccinated. In this case, what we ordered was that the local office initiate a special protection process, which means that the PANI will visit the family to assess if there are any violation of the rights of the children; in this case, health and education," said Vega.

It has become frequent for the PANI to intervene in situations like this. Last year [2018], Vega said, they were called by the Hospital Mexico due to the refusal of an Italian couple to vaccinate their newborn baby. The child was finally vaccinated with PANI intervention.

If the virus infection is confirmed, it would be the 1st autochthonous cases in Costa Rica since 2006, when the last patient was registered. These minors could have been infected with the virus by having contact with an American woman who visited them, who left the country on 12 Mar 2019 after presenting the characteristic symptoms of measles. Field research is also being done to locate potential contacts in the community where the family lives.

Health officials say these children have no relationship with the 1st imported cases that were registered in the country, of the 3 French citizens who arrived in Santa Teresa de Cobano on vacation in February 2019. The French family, who entered the country on 18 Feb and left on 6 Mar [2019], remained hospitalized for a week in the Puntarenas hospital. The epidemiological quarantine that the health teams made prevented spreading the highly contagious virus.

A 2nd confirmed case of measles has been identified in Collin County, Texas, as of 18 Mar [2019]. As of 19 Mar [2019], this case has not yet been reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) but would be considered the 12th confirmed measles case in Texas this year [2019], said Chris Van Deusen, director of DSHS media relations.

The DSHS has confirmed 11 cases of measles this year as of 8 Mar 2019. Two of these cases came from Denton and Collin counties, which each had one case at the time. In 2019, Texas has seen the highest number of confirmed measles cases since 2013, according to DSHS data.

[10] Texas
Date: Mon 18 Mar 2019
Source: Texas Observer [abridged, edited]
https://www.texasobserver.org/in-texas-three-more-measles-cases-and-four-new-anti-vaccine-bills/


Since early March [2019], Texas has confirmed 3 new measles cases amid an ongoing outbreak, and added several new anti-vaccine measures to the roster of bills filed this session. Texas has seen 11 cases of the disease so far this year [2019], already surpassing the state total for any year since 2013. Across the country, there have been at least 228 cases in 12 states. The World Health Organization recently identified "vaccine hesitancy" as a growing international threat that "threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases." Yet in the last 2 weeks, Texas lawmakers have proposed 4 measures that experts say spread misinformation and stoke fear about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

"Overall, I am shocked at what is happening," said Rekha Lakshmanan, director of advocacy and public policy at the Houston-based Immunization Partnership, who called the legislation a "scare tactic." "It's extremely irresponsible. In essence, those bills will weaken public health security, as I see it, by creating an environment where potentially more outbreaks can happen."

Among the new Texas proposals is an "informed consent" bill filed by state Representative Bill Zedler, an outspoken anti-vaccine member of the House Public Health Committee. Zedler drew national attention after he downplayed the resurgence of measles, which he had as a child, telling the Observer last month [February 2019], "Today, with antibiotics and that kind of stuff, they're not dying [of measles] in America." (Hundreds of Americans died of measles each year before the disease was considered eradicated in 2000, thanks in large part to the development of a vaccine. Also, antibiotics don't treat measles, which is a virus.)

Zedler's measure would require doctors to provide the "benefits and risks of immunization" and a list of ingredients for each vaccine -- information that's already public, but can be confusing without context. Zedler didn't respond to a request for comment about the bill, but told the Observer last month [February 2019] that he is "adamantly opposed to people being forced" to vaccinate their kids. He argues that the ingredients have a "known hazard," even though researchers have repeatedly found them to be safe. People "ought to have the freedom of conscience to avoid them or to not do the whole schedule, if they want to pick and choose," he said, referring to the medically recommended timing for childhood vaccines. "You know, our bodies are not automobiles, where you change the oil every 3000 miles and you're good. We're all different."

A bill filed by state Senator Bob Hall, R-Edgewood, would ban vaccines that haven't met criteria that Hall -- a retired business owner -- has determined the US Food and Drug Administration should be using for approval. The bill also requires the state health department to post online a "disclosure of any known injuries or diseases caused by the vaccine" and that the vaccine be "evaluated for [its] potential to: cause cancer, mutate genes, affect fertility or cause infertility, and cause autism spectrum disorder."

The bill is "dangerous" and a "misunderstanding of how science and clinical trials work," Lakshmanan said. Any link to autism, 1st proposed in a now-retracted study, has been repeatedly debunked. "The insinuation of this legislation is that vaccines are not well-tested and not safe, which is erroneous, incorrect and misleading," she said. Hall did not respond to a request for comment.

Also of top concern for immunization advocates are proposals to make it even easier to opt out of vaccine requirements, even as "conscience" exemptions have skyrocketed in Texas from about 2300 in 2003 to nearly 53 000 in 2017. A bill filed by House Freedom Caucus member Jonathan Stickland, R-Bedford, would allow nurses to sign off on exemption forms rather than just doctors. Another, from state Representative Tony Tinderholt, would prohibit doctors from refusing to see patients who aren't vaccinated. And one from caucus member Matt Krause would make it easier to submit vaccine exemptions, and prevent the state health department from tracking them. Health experts say this would prevent the state from preparing for potential disease outbreaks, as well as make it impossible for families of very young or immunocompromised kids to know which communities have low vaccination rates.

[Introduced bill: 86R13486 SRA-D By: Zedler; H.B. No. 4274, Texas Legislature Online https://capitol.texas.gov/Search/DocViewer.aspx?ID=86RHB042741B&QueryText=vaccine%2bOR%2bzedler&DocType=B
This bill is like reinventing the wheel. How many times must scientists prove the MMR vaccine is safe? And how many times must non-scientists who have no knowledge of the science and clinical trials behind vaccines be given a public forum? Unfortunately when vaccines or other preventative measures make diseases rare, people forget about how serious they are. The outbreaks occurring now may serve as a reminder, but probably not to people in the more highly developed countries. - Mod.LK]

Health officials said 4 additional measles cases in Oakland County have been confirmed and 3 other possible cases are currently under investigation. This comes after officials confirmed a case of travel-related measles in the county. Officials said the travel-related case of measles came from an individual visiting from Israel.

"Measles is in the community and highly contagious. You need to get vaccinated if you are unsure whether you have been vaccinated or unsure if you have had measles in the past," said Leigh-Anne Stafford, health officer for Oakland County. "If symptoms develop, do not visit your doctor or emergency room unless you call ahead so they can take precautions to prevent exposure to other individuals."

New York City health officials reported 23 additional measles cases from the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg (21) and Borough Park (2), bringing the outbreak total to 181 since last October [2018]. The breakdown of cases from Brooklyn and Queens since the outbreak started is as follows: Williamsburg, 130 confirmed measles cases; Borough Park, 46; Midwood/Marine Park, 2; and one each in Bensonhurst, Brighton Beach and Flushing, Queens.

Most of these cases have involved members of the Orthodox Jewish community. According to the Israel Ministry of Health, more than 3600 people contracted measles during the past year. The initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn or Rockland County.

The Oregon Health Authority confirmed a 2nd case of measles Tuesday [19 Mar 2019] in Salem. The case is linked to a traveler from Illinois who recently visited the county and is unrelated to the outbreak in Multnomah County and Clark County, Washington, Oregon Health Authority officials said in a release.

Officials said the latest Salem measles patient does not attend Salem-Keizer Public Schools. While most Oregonians have been vaccinated and have a low risk of illness, the risk could be higher for unvaccinated individuals who were exposed.

Between September 2018 and early March 2019, measles killed 1141 people, mostly children, according to figures from the Ministry of Public Health. Just under 100 000 cases have been recorded by the authorities and 104 of 114 districts are in the epidemic phase. Between malnutrition, refusal to seek treatment in a hospital and reluctance to vaccination, the big island struggles to fight against the disease.

The Anivorano-North health center welcomed 510 patients with "kitrotro" or "kisaosy", the 2 local names of the disease. Officially, only 4 have died. A number far below the reality, say many residents of the city, where the rumors are going well.

Just one year after a wave of plague that left more than 200 dead and rekindled terrors of another century, this is the island of the Indian Ocean facing another health crisis. "This is a major epidemic," says soberly Dr. Vincent Sodjinou, of the Malagasy antenna of WHO. "For almost a decade, vaccine coverage has not lived up to expectations and has increased the number of unprotected people over several generations." The country's current vaccination rate is only 57%.

"Normally, we only treat one case of measles every 2 months," says its leader, Dr. Ravohavy Setriny Mahatsangy, "since December [2018], we are already at 444". In the dock, he cites "social promiscuity, which facilitates the spread of the disease, the refusal to seek treatment in a hospital and reluctance to vaccination."

[I am not sure what is meant by "social promiscuity", but when people are in close quarters, measles virus spreads rapidly.

https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/03/20/nigeria-accounts-for-highest-burden-of-measles-globally-says-who/


The World Health Organisation (WHO) has lamented that Nigeria accounts for the highest number of measles cases on the globe. The Borno State Coordinator of WHO, Dr. Audu Idowu, was quoted in a statement on Wed [20 Mar 2019] to have said: "Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines, Nigeria accounts for the highest burden of measles globally, with 3.3 million unimmunised children."

The statement signed by Eva Hinds, a Communication Specialist with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said in order to tackle the growing cases of measles, the Nigerian Government is working in collaboration with UNICEF and WHO.

The statement read in part: "Following a growing number of reported cases of measles, the Government of Nigeria, in collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organisation (WHO), will conduct a vaccination campaign in Borno to protect 1.7 million children aged 6 months to 10 years against measles." The statement disclosed that the campaign will run from 21 to 25 Mar 2019.

The statement quoting Babagana Adiso, Director of Disease Control in the Borno State Primary Health Care Agency, said: "Immunisation remains one of the most effective ways to protect children from killer diseases. This campaign gives us the opportunity to protect the lives of children at risk of missing out on routine immunisation in Borno."

The statement said the Nigeria 2017 Demographic Health Survey revealed that only 65% of eligible Nigerian children receive their 1st dose of measles vaccine every year, lamenting that in Borno, this low coverage has led to the deaths of at least 13 children in the current measles outbreak.

The statement said measles vaccine will be administered free-of-charge in all mosques, villages, IDP camps and health facilities, targeting all children under the age of 10 years in high-risk areas of Borno, irrespective of their previous measles vaccination status or history of disease.

Wajir County in northern Kenya reported 256 cases with 4 measles-related deaths last year [2018]. Blood samples sent to Kemri tested positive. The 1st documented case was a 2-year-old boy from Danaba health centre in Wajir North. The 1st wave occurred in February 2018, while the 2nd outbreak was confirmed in September 2018. Following the 2 outbreaks in 2018, Wajir County has launched a measles vaccination drive.

Deputy governor Ahmed Mukhtar led the exercise at Qorahey grounds yesterday [21 Mar 2019]. The county government intervention includes community education, defaulter tracing and enhanced vaccination. The vaccination campaign targets 94 000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. It will be done within the next 5 days across the county.

Mukhtar said the county government is committed to investing in immunisation to attain the targets and eradicate the disease. "To achieve this, we have established 102 immunisation centres out of the 115 operational facilities," Mukhtar said, adding that plans are underway to provide equipment in the remaining facilities to bridge the access gap.

[18] Vaccine hesitancy
Date: Wed 20 Mar 2019

http://tinyurl.com/y6ha8u46


Much of the media and policy conversation about the [measles] outbreak has focused on fake news and social media. If only Facebook could banish false vaccine posts, the problem of vaccine hesitancy would go away. But that narrative ignores a crucial part of the anti-vaccine problem in America today. Measles in Washington -- like many recent measles outbreaks in the US -- has been spreading in a particular type of community: tight-knit and traditional.

In Washington, the virus has predominantly hit Russian-speaking groups hailing mainly from Ukraine and Russia, according to a source close to the matter. These groups have the lowest rate of vaccination of any population in Washington, the state's most recent data show.

And they're not unique. An ongoing measles outbreak in New York involves mostly people from an undervaccinated Orthodox Jewish community. Since October 2018, 304 people have been sickened by the virus -- the highest number in the state in decades. Before that, it was vaccine-refusing Amish in Ohio and Somali Americans in Minnesota.

These communities have become an urgent focus of health departments across the country, said Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When measles strikes, outbreaks in tight-knit groups tend to be "explosive" and more difficult to control.

According to CDC data, 12 of the 26 measles outbreaks in the past 5 years (involving more than 5 cases) centered on tight-knit communities, which Messonier defines as people of a similar background who share values and beliefs and interact often. And because these outbreaks have been bigger, they account for 75% of recent measles cases.

While the reasons for vaccine skepticism may be different in each of these communities, the groups themselves have a lot in common. They're cohesive and conservative. They appear to trust each other more than outsiders. They also speak the same languages and read or watch the same news. "We think these communities are more alike," Messonnier added, and their insularity helps "outbreaks escalate."

More than Facebook, the real-life social networks in these groups seem to turbocharge the spread of anti-vaccine views, and along with them viruses like measles. Just look at what happened in Washington, where Kobylnik became an influencer -- and later changed her mind about vaccines.

Like every recent US measles outbreak, the one in Washington was sparked by a traveler. The person brought the virus back from Eastern Europe, where there's a measles epidemic. (In Ukraine, vaccine hesitancy helped the measles vaccine rate fall to 31% in 2016. In 2018, there were 54 000 measles cases. This year [2019], there are already 28 600.)

When someone with the measles brings the virus into an undervaccinated community here, it can spread like wildfire because measles is so incredibly contagious. Nearly everybody in a population needs to be immunized in order to stop the virus from spreading. Even a 5% opt-out rate can threaten what's known as "herd immunity."

In Washington, Russian-speaking populations have the lowest rate of vaccination, "a consistent pattern since 2008," according to a 2012 health department report (the most recent data available).

The problem also pops up in a 2016 Pediatrics study of vaccination uptake in the state's immigrant groups, showing children of Ukrainian- and Russian-born parents were less likely to be vaccinated than their US-born counterparts. According to the 2016 study, 80% of the children of Ukrainian-born parents and 85% of the kids of Russian-born parents were vaccinated against measles -- too low to sustain herd immunity. By comparison, 92% of their American counterparts were vaccinated at the time.

[ProMED-mail thanks Nelly Hugh-Jones for submitting this important article from Vox examining the psychology behind how opinions are formed. We recommend reading by those interested in understanding the challenge of combating vaccine hesitancy in tight-knit communities not only in the US but also throughout the world. The issue affects not only reluctance to be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, but also hepatitis A, meningococcus, and most other vaccines. - Mod.LK
