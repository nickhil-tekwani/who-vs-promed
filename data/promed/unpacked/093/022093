The southern province of Binh Phuoc has recorded 973 malaria cases in the 1st half of the year [2018], up by 66 per cent year-on-year, including one death, reported by the provincial Department of Health on [16 Jul 2018].

The cases were mostly found in the districts of Phu Rieng, Hon Quan, Bu Dop, Loc Ninh, Bu Dang and Bu Gia Map, and Binh Long town. In particular, Bu Gia Map discovered 666 cases, accounting for 68.5 per cent of the total, much higher than the 349 cases recorded in the same period last year [2017].

This spike in diagnosed cases has been attributed to the prolonged rainy season in the area, as well as a rise in infections for those over the age of 15.

The provincial health sector will work to prevent malaria, especially in ethnic minority areas and communities near forests, lakes, and rivers. It will also strengthen supervision over the discovery and treatment of malaria cases in district-level hospitals and commune-level medical stations. Public awareness of malaria prevention and control will also be raised, particularly of methods involving anti-mosquito sprays, hanging mosquito nets, long-sleeve clothing, and necessity of medical help once infected.

[Binh Phuoc is endemic for malaria and one of the last 3 provinces with malaria transmission in Vietnam including also Gia Lai and Ninh Thuan. One problem with _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in these provinces is an increasing decreased susceptibility to the artemisinin class of drugs.

One study from Viet Nam reported "The prevalence of K13 mutations were 29 per cent (222/767), 6 per cent (11/188), and 43 per cent (45/105) in the Binh Phuoc, Ninh Thuan, and Gia Lai Provinces of Vietnam, respectively. Cys580Tyr became the dominant genotype in recent years, with 79.1 per cent (34/43) of isolates in Binh Phuoc Province and 63 per cent (17/27) of isolates in Gia Lai Province carrying this mutation. K13 mutations were associated with reduced ring-stage susceptibility to dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in vitro and prolonged parasite clearance in vivo" (Thuy-Nhien N, Tuyen NK, Tong NT, et al. K13 propeller mutations in _Plasmodium falciparum_ populations in regions of malaria endemicity in Vietnam from 2009 to 2016. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2017;61(4). pii: e01578-16. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01578-16). Thus an increasing number of cases may be due to treatment failure.

The detection of these mutations in _P. falciparum_ from Viet Nam is probably part of a wider expansion of these clones with reduced susceptibility to the artemisinins in South East Asia (Imwong M, Suwannasin K, Kunasol C, et al.
