The Ministry of Agriculture and the State Administration for Exit-Entry
Inspection and Quarantine of China banned imports of cattle, sheep, pigs
and their products from Japan and the Republic of Korea yesterday, after an
outbreak of highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).
Experts said FMD can cause animals to get blisters on their mouths and
hooves and fevers, causing a loss in appetite. It can kill animals and
infect entire beef and milk-cow herds.
Responding to allegations from Japan and the Republic of Korea that Chinese
hay may have transmitted the disease, a ministry official said the rumor is
simply not true.
As a result of nationwide monitoring and control efforts, the ministry has
so far not received any reports of FMD outbreaks.
Wang Changjiang of the Animal Quarantine Division said it was "impossible"
for the Chinese hay to have spread the disease. "Judging from the hay
drying and processing procedure in China, it is impossible to spread the
FMD viruses through imports of hay even if China was found to have the
disease," Wang said. He added the 2 countries had not presented any
scientific evidence to support their claims.
Zhao Weining, director of the Animal Quarantine Division, said it was an
important role of the ministry to prevent possible foreign livestock
infections.
Last year, the ministry prohibited imports of meat and other animal
products from more than 20 countries where animal diseases were discovered,
Zhao said. The ministry later lifted some of the bans as measures were
taken to ensure food safety in those countries.
The ministry has called for the country's 100 000 veterinarians and animal
quarantine workers to help prevent epidemic outbreaks among animals.
Vice-Minister Qi Jingfa said quarantine inspection activities should be
conducted in animal-rearing establishments and slaughterhouses.
Ministry official Yang Zhenhai said since 1987, China declared all imported
animal feeds be registered with the Ministry of Agriculture before entering
the Chinese market. Yang said last year's Animal Feed Management Provisions
stipulated the ministry should check and test all foreign feed and
additives imported to China. He said these provisions are intended to
protect humans and animals from disease. Recently a permit-granting system
was implemented for the fodder industry to supervise animal feed producers
and processors, he said.
