Biosecurity Queensland says it has detected a new outbreak of the potentially deadly Hendra virus near Mackay. Biosecurity officials say a vet treated a gravely ill horse at a property near Mackay in the state's north on Tuesday [26 Jun 2012]. The horse was later put down.

Biosecurity officials say a vet treated a gravely ill horse at a property near Mackay in the state's north on Tuesday. The horse was later put down. Health authorities say only one other person had contact with the sick animal.

Queensland's chief veterinary officer Dr Rick Symons said the property manager contacted a vet after discovering the horse was gravely ill on Tuesday.

"There are a number of other animals including horses on the property and on adjoining properties," Dr Symons said in a statement. "Tracing is a priority to determine what contact the infected horse had with other animals on all properties." Biosecurity Queensland officers are currently in the process of quarantining the property.

"These are stock horses, these are working horses on the property, so it's nothing to do with the racing industry," Dr Symonds said.

"And I'd just like to emphasise there's no risk to the industry or other horses in the Mackay area."

He said the vet's actions helped contain the disease. "The vet took the precautions that we've been working with the Veterinary Association to establish ... he made sure the owner and the person with him weren't exposed, and he cleaned up afterwards," Dr Symons said.

He said the case was the 4th Hendra virus incident in Queensland this year [2012].

Horse owners are being warned to monitor their animals for signs of the disease.

The continuation of this outbreak is most sad for horses, for owners, for veterinarians. It is good news that proper precautions were taken by the veterinarian to protect himself, the owners, and other animals.

Because of the other animals on the property this investigation may expand. We are likely to hear more about this. Let us hope future news is that there are no other exposures. - Mod.TG]
