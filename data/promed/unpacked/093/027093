Rice farmers in Katsina State experienced a strange disease which dried their crops before they mature. A farmer said: "Only a few of us noticed the attack at its early stage; many only realised the damage at the point of harvest. The pests are in a form of small worms that are sucking the seedlings dry." Efforts of applying different types of pesticides failed to arrest the disease.

A retired agricultural extension worker dismissed the assertion that the disease is a worm attack. He said: "The pest attack worrying rice these days are ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The fungi will be hard for a farmer to notice at an early stage." He [advised] rice farmers to always dress their seedlings with preventive solutions before planting.

Alhaji Sani Zubairu, Rice Sellers Association, said the pest attacked only selected varieties of rice. He called on the relevant authorities: "Agricultural research institutes should please study this rice problem before it escalates and provide us with a reliable solution. Similarly, government should provide rice farmers with new improved seedlings and pesticides at subsidised rates in order to attain rice self-sufficiency in the country."

[A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes, have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. The symptoms described above are not sufficient for diagnosis. Since only selected rice varieties are reported to be affected, the "worms" mentioned above would be unlikely to be a cause, but may be secondary invaders of affected plants. The suggestion above that fungi or other infectious pathogens may be causing the problem appears more likely, since different crop varieties may show different levels of resistance to these pathogens. Reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
