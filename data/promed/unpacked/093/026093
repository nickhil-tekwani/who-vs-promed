The number of fatalities due to the parasitic disease, visceral leishmaniasis, has increased by 43.75 per cent in the Central-Western Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, according to a Campo Grande News report today [14 Jan 2014]. Based on data from the SES (State Health Department), the state has reported a 15 per cent increase in leishmaniasis deaths in 2013 compared with the previous year, despite there being fewer total cases.

From January 2013 to 20 Nov 2013, 207 cases were reported with 23 deaths from the disease. In 2012, 303 cases with 20 deaths were recorded. According to the report, in the last 3 years [2011-2013] the cases of deaths has been increasing in the state. In 2010, there were 214 cases and 18 deaths; in 2011, there were 273 cases with 16 deaths.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of the female sandfly. There are different forms of leishmaniasis. Cutaneous leishmaniasis affects the skin and mucous membranes. Skin sores usually start at the site of the sandfly bite. In a few people, sores may develop on mucous membranes. Systemic, or visceral, leishmaniasis affects the entire body. This form occurs 2-8 months after a person is bitten by the sandfly. Most people do not remember having a skin sore. This form can lead to deadly complications. The parasites damage the immune system by decreasing the numbers of disease-fighting cells. Cases of leishmaniasis have been reported on all continents except Australia and Antarctica.

[The epidemiology of leishmaniasis has recently been reviewed (Alvar et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS ONE 7(5): e35671. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035671). The country-specific profiles can be found here: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035671#pone.0035671.s036.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) are widespread, and Brazil is the country with the most CL cases in South America.

The disease has spread to many other areas since the 1950s, including metropolitan Belo Horizonte [1,2]. Since the 1980s, there has been an increase in the registered number of cases, from 4560 in 1980 to 35 748 in 1995, with frequent outbreaks [3]. CL has now become a periurban disease in deforested areas. Transmission peaks occur every 5 years, and there has been a further upward trend in the number of cases since 1985, when surveillance and control measures for CL were introduced.

In the period between 1988 and 2007, 554 475 cases were notified, with an annual average of 27 723 indigenous cases and an average incidence of 17.3 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. During the 1980s, CL and MCL were registered in 19 states, and in 2003, confirmed autochtonous cases occurred in 27 states. Nevertheless, the incidence has decreased from 20.3 in 2000 to 10.5 per 10 000 population in 2008 [4].

The MCL rate is less than 5 per cent, but varies according to regions. A higher prevalence has been correlated with areas where CL was only recently introduced and with clustered distribution [5-7].

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) represents a serious public health problem due to its scale and geographical extent. The disease is most prevalent in the north eastern part of the country [8].

Underlying reasons were the population movement from rural to urban areas, poor housing, uncontrolled deforestation, and an increasing number of infected dogs [9,10]. The average annual number of cases was 3246, with an incidence of about 1.85 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, and has a tendency to increase [11]. In recent years, the number of deaths and the case fatality rate related to VL have gradually increased, from 117 deaths (3.4 per cent) in 1994 to 262 (7.2 per cent) in 2006, representing an increase in case fatality rate of almost 124 per cent [4].

In 2007, 52.8 per cent of confirmed cases of VL affected children under 10 years of age, and risk factors, such as concomitant malnutrition or infectious diseases, seem very important with respect to future clinical evolution [4]. Canine visceral leishmaniasis is widespread, with up to 20 per cent of dogs infected in the highly endemic localities. The culling of infected dogs, for the control of VL, is a matter of intense debate [12].

Cases of VL-HIV co-infection have increased over the years. In 2006, 2.5 per cent of cases of VL were co-infected [13]. An active surveillance system and guidelines for co-infected cases management have been established by the Ministry of Health [14].
