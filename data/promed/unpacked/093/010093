El Dorado County, California health officials announced Friday [4 Sep 2015] that a ground squirrel in South Lake Tahoe has tested positive for plague. The dead animal was found at the Kiva picnic area on 17 Aug [2015]. So far, health officials are not aware of any human contact with the infected squirrel.

"It's something that we don't see in large pandemics in the modern era of antibiotics," explained Dr Randall Todd of the Washoe County Health District. "But we do still worry about it a little bit in the western and southwestern states because it lives endemically in some of the rodent populations." Doctor Todd referred to a map from the CDC, which shows where human cases of plague have been reported between 1970 and 2012. Several were right here in northern Nevada.

The disease is carried by fleas, and spread by rodents, and other small animals like rabbits and prairie dogs. Dr. Todd said that if one of these animals allows you to get close, that's unusual behavior. They may be sick. He said don't touch it, and don't let your dogs get close either.

"If you have pets like dogs or cats that are allowed to roam free where they might be exposed to fleas, then you would probably want to take some steps to do flea prevention on your pets, and you probably would not want them to sleep on or in your bed," he says. According to information from the CDC, human infection is rare. Fewer than 20 cases have been reported per year over the past 15 years, but it can be fatal.

If you are exposed, you may have a fever, headache, and painful swollen lymph nodes. Seek medical attention right away.

To reduce your chances of catching the disease, El Dorado County health officials say don't feed squirrels or other wild rodents. Never touch sick, injured, or dead rodents. Eliminate nesting places for rodents around homes, sheds and garages.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection. - Mod.PMB
