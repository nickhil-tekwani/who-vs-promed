Is it possible that Bell's Palsy is related to Flaccid trunk disease? I was
trying to identify whether or not there were similarities to these
syndromes. Are most of the cases in males or all? Is it possible that this
is a familial autosomal disease? Has anyone done any PCR on the blood of
the animals which have been affected. Do you see this disease cycling with
the seasons? What is known about this disease? Has the Zimbabwe park had
any elephants recover from this syndrome with support therapy? If any have
recovered how long has it taken for these elephants to recover?
