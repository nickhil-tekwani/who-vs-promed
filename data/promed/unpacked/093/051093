[1] Sierra Leone: new suspected death

Dead woman tests positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone
---------------------------------------------------------
The body of a woman who died in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the Ebola virus, less than a week after the last person confirmed to have had the disease was released from hospital, health officials said. The new death, if confirmed, would represent a setback for efforts to end an 18-month regional epidemic that has infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than a 3rd of them.

In the latest case, a 67-year-old woman from the Kambia District along Sierra Leone's border with Guinea, died on Sat [29 Aug 2015].

Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo told Reuters that 2 samples tested in Kambia had tested positive for Ebola. However, he said further tests were being carried out in Makeni, the main town in the Northern Province, and in the capital Freetown. "We are particularly concerned because Kambia has gone 50 days without a confirmed Ebola case, suggesting the possibility of an error," Kargbo said.

He added that the woman worked as a trader, though people who knew her said she had not travelled recently. She now becomes the first new case in the country since 8 Aug 2015. Sierra Leone released what had been its last confirmed Ebola patient from hospital on Mon [24 Aug 2015] and began a 42-day countdown to being declared free of the virus.

During the course of the epidemic, the outbreak has ebbed only to flare back again. Liberia was declared Ebola-free in May [2015] but a fresh cluster of cases appeared nearly 2 months later. Liberia's last case was subsequently discharged on 23 July 2015. Scientists say sexual transmission is the most likely explanation for the resurgence in Liberia since the virus can live on in semen beyond the usual 21-day incubation period.

[3] CDC Clarifies Ebola PPE Guidance for U.S. Healthcare Personnel
Date: Thu 27 Aug 2015
Source: Infection Control Today, taken from News, Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) [edited]
http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2015/08/cdc-clarifies-ebola-ppe-guidance-for-us-healthcare-personnel.aspx


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has clarified its guidance regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel caring for suspected and confirmed Ebola patients in U.S. healthcare facilities.

Based on feedback from healthcare facilities that have implemented the current guidance (originally posted October 2014), the guidance clarifies the use of fluid-resistant and impermeable gowns and coveralls. Specifications are provided in the guidance to assist facilities in selecting and ordering the recommended garments.

In addition to clarifying the specifications of gowns and coveralls recommended, the PPE guidance for confirmed Ebola patients is being updated with additional explanation, including:

- Expanding the rationale for why respiratory protection is recommended when caring for an Ebola patient

- Clarifying that the trained observer should not serve as an assistant for taking off (doffing) PPE

- Suggesting that a designated doffing assistant or "buddy" might be helpful, especially in doffing with the Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) option;

- Modifying the PAPR doffing procedure to make the steps more clear

- Changing the order of boot cover removal. Boot covers are now removed after the gown or coverall

- Emphasizing the importance of frequent cleaning of the floor in the doffing area.

The updated PPE guidance for confirmed Ebola patients can be found on CDC's website: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/ppe/guidance.html.

CDC's PPE guidance for clinically stable persons under investigation for Ebola can be found here: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/ppe/guidance-clinically-stable-puis.html.

28 Aug 2015 Sierra Leone: Sierra Leone Ebola survivor gives birth to healthy baby boy
http://globalnews.ca/news/2190270/sierra-leone-ebola-survivor-gives-birth-to-healthy-baby-boy/
[She delivered her child just a few minutes' walk from the ward where just last year [2014] she had hovered between life and death, and nurses and medical staff still wore full protective suits and masks for fear of any lingering infection. She lost 21 family members to Ebola.
Doctors gave her formula and told her not to nurse her baby until they ran tests to be sure there were no traces of the virus in her breast milk.

This is very moving, as Ebola-infected pregnant women have had extremely adverse outcomes, as have their babies. - Mod.LK]

[The people who watched as their family and friends fell victim to the Ebola virus disease [EVD] are doubly cursed. Not only did they lose loved ones, the stigma has never gone away. Tarnished forever by the disease -- an instant death sentence for many -- they have not been able to shake off the widely held suspicion that they remain carriers. ...more]

[While most primary care physicians responding to a survey expressed confidence in their ability to identify potential cases of Ebola and communicate Ebola risks to their patients, when asked how they would care for hypothetical patients who might have been exposed to Ebola, less than 70 percent gave answers fitting CDC guidelines. Those least likely to encounter an Ebola patient were most likely to choose overly intense management of patients actually at low risk. ...more

[Sanford Health is seeking 30 patients from Sioux Falls and Fargo, North Dakota to enroll in a clinical trial testing an Ebola vaccine. The program, which is sponsored by Merck, will explore the vaccine's ability to safely generate antibodies that could protect against future exposure to the virus. Trial participants are required to receive a single shot. 90 percent will get the vaccine, and the remaining 10 percent will receive a placebo. The study is open to adults ages 18 to 65 who have not previously had Ebola or been in contact with someone who has contracted the virus. ...more]

27 Aug 2015: Vaccines weren't ready for Ebola. We can do better
http://www.wired.com/2015/08/vaccines-werent-ready-ebola-can-better/
[...Thanks to a decade of federal assistance, several Ebola vaccine candidates were in the pipeline in 2014. Even so, the dollars directed toward Ebola were inadequate to develop vaccines that were outbreak ready. Few had made the leap from the lab into human trials. As a consequence, West Africa lost precious months last winter [2014-15] to preliminary safety tests. Ideally, these Phase 1 trials would have been done in advance so candidates could have been tested for efficacy soon after cases began to appear in March 2014. ...more

Read this well written article by Kendall Hoyt on the need to allocate federal dollars to bring promising vaccines to an outbreak ready-stage prior to anticipated outbreaks. Hoyt asks: "Can we build generic vaccine scaffolds that require minor modifications for different pathogens? Can we do this in a way that accelerates development times, lowers costs, and facilitates regulatory review?" His answer is yes, and he cites several examples. - Mod.LK]

Quarantine, care, testing and release of pet dog of Ebola infected Texas nurse

Abstract. In October 2014, a health-care worker who had been part of the treatment team for the first laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola virus disease imported to the United States developed symptoms of Ebola virus disease. A presumptive positive reverse transcription PCR assay result for Ebola virus RNA in a blood sample from the worker was confirmed by the CDC, making this the first documented occurrence of domestic transmission of Ebola virus in the United States. The Texas Department of State Health Services commissioner issued a control order requiring disinfection and decontamination of the health-care worker's residence. This process was delayed until the patient's pet dog (which, having been exposed to a human with Ebola virus disease, potentially posed a public health risk) was removed from the residence. This report describes the movement, quarantine, care, testing, and release of the pet dog, highlighting the interdisciplinary, one-health approach and extensive collaboration and communication across local, county, state, and federal agencies involved in the response.
