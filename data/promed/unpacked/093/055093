The affected population was both domestic and wild birds. See event summary and map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21457

Poland is the largest poultry producer in the EU. According to the latest information available (2016) from the OIE WAHID Database, the country has a population of approximately 149 000 000 birds. (Source: https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation)

The OIE Terrestrial Code defines poultry as "all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose.

"Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are kept for shows, races, exhibitions, competitions or for breeding or selling these categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry."
