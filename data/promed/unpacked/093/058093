Three people have died out of 20 cases of monkey smallpox in northern Congo, a statement by the Congolese Ministry of Health and Population in Brazzaville warned.

According to the statement, the epidemic had already surfaced in the same area back in 2003.

Monkey pox is characterized by button-like boils filled with liquid spread all over the body, including the scalp.

It is transmitted through contact with a sick animal but also from a sick human to a healthy person.

There is currently no vaccine against the disease, APA said.

Faced with this epidemic, the government has officially declared monkey pox as an epidemic in Congo to avoid any risk of it spreading and calls on its financial partners to help tackle the disease.

[Monkeypox virus is endemic in the Republic of the Congo, and human cases occur sporadically there as well in DR Congo and the Central African Republic.

The monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent, than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The virus is seldom transmitted directly from one person to another, but there is a documented instance of that in the Republic of the Congo. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ sp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. - Mod.TY
