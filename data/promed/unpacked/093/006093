Two deaths from hemorrhagic fever with acute liver failure occurred in
Fortaleza, State of Ceara, northeastern Brazil. According to a local
newspaper (1), serologies for all suspect viruses (including dengue and
yellow fever) were negative, but hantavirus syndrome seems not to have been
ruled out. The State Health Officer, Dr. Anastacio Queiroz, has sent blood
samples to Evandro Chagas Institute of Virology and to CDC. "There is no
reason for fearing yellow fever", says Dr. Queiroz. But About 3,000 people
per day are [requesting] yellow fever vaccines in Public and Private Health
Services. "There has been an unjustified panic", says the Officer.
Although urban yellow fever has not been detected in the city for the past
five decades, dengue fever is a major concern. The greatest epidemics
occurred in 1994, with dengue hemorrhagic cases [DHF]. A randomized
seroprevalence survey estimated 714,000 cases of classic dengue that
year(2,3). That means one third of the whole city population. _Aedes
aegypti_ is found in 90% of the city by now.
