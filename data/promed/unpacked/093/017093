A 20 year old man, from Ayabaca, Piura, who resided in the Aguajal
sector of the village of Nuevo Jaen in the Campanilla district
[Mariscal Caceres province, San Martin region], was moved urgently to
[the city of Juanjui] because he was seriously ill this past Thursday
(3 Feb 2011) and taken to the MINSA [Ministry of Health] Hospital,
where, unfortunately, he died just minutes after admission, presenting
with a fever of over 38 deg C [100.5 deg F], petechiae (spots or small
punctate hemorrhages in the skin), hypotension, oliguria [diminished
urine production], nausea, and intense vomiting.

This sad ending was due to the late transfer from his place of
residence to the hospital in [Juanjui], which did not permit him to
receive adequate treatment and in due time. Assuming this was a case
of yellow fever [YF] -- samples have been sent to the Tarapoto MINSA
reference laboratory for testing -- it is expected that there are more
cases currently or that might occur later on.

Given this clinical picture, the Mariscal Caceres [provincial] health
authorities have taken the following actions: a) notification of
suspicious [YF] cases to higher authority; b) investigation of
suspicious cases "in situ", taking samples that have been sent to
Tarapoto and to the National Institute of Health in Lima; c) a
vaccination sweep in Campanilla, extending to other districts and the
[provincial?] capital city, for which the appropriate stock of vaccine
has been requested.

It is worth noting that the Nuevo Jaen area and other localities in
the Campanilla district are populated by migrant people from Piura,
Cajamarca, Amazonas, in other words Andean [and other] areas where the
people have not developed defenses against these types of tropical
diseases. This cluster [of people] is considered a population exposed
to a greater risk of contracting the dreaded, at times fatal, yellow
fever [virus infection].

[It is not clear if this report implies that the migrants are thought
to be genetically more susceptible to YF virus infection and severe
disease, or if their living or working conditions or lack of
vaccination places them at greater risk, as seems more likely.
ProMED-mail would be interested to learn the results of the laboratory
tests for this case, confirming (or not) YF virus infection, and if
there are additional YF cases in the area. It will be important to
determine if this is an isolated case of sylvan (jungle) YF, and if
the mosquito vector of the urban/suburban transmission cycle of YF
virus transmission, _Aedes aegypti_ is present in the area where the
fatal case resided, with the risk of an urban outbreak if the
population there is largely unvaccinated. The planned vaccination
campaign by the Ministry of Health is very prudent. Peru has
experienced sporadic cases of sylvan YF in scattered eastern lowland
locations in the recent past (see below).
