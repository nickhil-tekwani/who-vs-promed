Although PCR and NAT are very powerful new tools, they are not foolproof in
terms of false positives and false negatives. A literature search on
MedLine or Dialog can provide more details.
When transitioning to any new testing strategy, the devilish details are
always in how to establish the "Gold Standard" from which to evaluate the
new tests or procedures. This is especially true when venturing into new
aspects of a disease that are not discrete cut-off points, but are rather
continuums along a gradient.
Failure to clearly define the "Gold Standard'' has been the bane of many
who introduce new tests or procedures. One error in 100,000 seem very good
to most who would be interested in selling or promoting a test. It even
sound good to many unassociated observes who do not have any personal
interest in the outcome other than perhaps a mild curiosity.
The magnitude of the amazing odds does not stir amusement to the very few
who find their fate at the unpleasant end of statistical fame rather than
finding themselves holding a larger-than-life payoff check from a large
lottery. Lawyers are even less bemused with statistic discussions than
issues of emotion distress. Hence the terms, "Good Science", "Bad
Science", "Risky Science", "Cautious Science", and even "Political Science".

I would like to draw the attention of ProMED-mail readers to the fact that
nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) testing of erythrocyte and
platelet concentrates for HCV RNA will be obligatory in Germany by April 1,
1999. In order to contain cost, samples are pooled. The required
sensitivity is 5.000 IU/ml HCV RNA (WHO-Standard) with respect to the
individual positive unit.
Testing is already introduced and runs pretty well in some dedicated
centers. One of the unsolved problems are NAT positive pools in which no
individual unit can be identified as positive. It will turn out in a few
months whether contamination will be a problem in less experienced centers.
Another problem may come from patent and licensing issues. There are two
patents to be respected, one for the NAT procedure (PCR, NASBA, TMA, Ligase
chain reaction) and one for the virus sequence (if patented, as is the case
for HCV).
A good reference for most of these issues can be found in a recent subject
issue of the journal "Infusionstherapie und Transfusionsmedizin": Nucleic
acid amplification techniques for virus detection in transfusion medicine,
vol. 25, 2-3, May 1998, ISBN 3-8055-6717-0, which can be ordered as
hard-copy from karger@karger.ch; individual articles can be downloaded from
http://www.karger.com/journals/iut/iut_bk.htm. All articles are written in
English by relevant experts in the field.
An interesting exercise is to discuss cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit
issues of these tests. The consequences of such discussions are, however,
limited by drug laws applicable in different countries, consumer protection
laws for Europe nor politics for which cost may not be a priority in this
context.
HIV RNA testing and the communication of a positive result may create a
special problem. Donors with HCV-RNA but without antibody are in the very
early phase of their infection and are normally highly infectious. In order
to prevent secondary sexual infections, the blood bank would have to
communicate such a result as early as possible, with the risk of
communicating a false-positive result. The regular way to confirm positive
results in a second sample taken independently would take several days
resulting in a risk for the sexual partner(s) of the freshly infected
donor. Has anyone a solution to that dilemma?

[I think the donor should be informed of the result, told that it is
preliminary and will need another specimen & several days to confirm, and
that it would be a responsible act to inform any sexual partner(s) of the
possible risk. - Mod.JW}

At $6-7 per unit times 12 million units per year, we may prevent an
estimated 12 cases of transfusion associated HIV and ~80 HCV for $70 - 80
million per year. Is this the most cost effective way to cut these
diseases? How much education on prevention could we do for $70 million?

[I think the reasoning is faulty here since every new case has the
potential to transmit disease to a number of other people. There is a
multiplier effect. - Mod.ES
[If those 90+ projected cases of HIV & HCV all sued their health care
providers for not using known technology to prevent their infection, that
$70 million saved would soon disappear! - Mod.JW
