[The comment in the previous ProMED-mail post cited above mentioned that other viruses can cause hemorrhagic fever, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Sosuga, yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever viruses.

Information from the Uganda Ministry of Heath above stated that the tests done in the Uganda Virus Research Institute were negative for Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, and Sosuga viruses. No mention was made about tests for yellow fever virus. ProMED will be interested in receiving information about yellow fever test results and if any further cases occur.

EpiCore member Dr Katharina Kopp is thanked for making the inquiry of the Ministry of Health and sending along their reply. - Mod.TY

The hemorrhagic symptoms can be due to malaria as malaria and other severe infections (such as leptospirosis and bacterial septicemia) can lead to a severe thrombocytopenia. - Mod.EP
