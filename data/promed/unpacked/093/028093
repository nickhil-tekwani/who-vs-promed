Brucellosis is continuing to spread across Bosnia and Herzegovina and
is reaching epidemic proportions, the country's leading
epidemiologist warns.

A total of 757 infections in people have been registered in 2008 just
in the bigger Bosnian entity of Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim)-Croat
federation, said Dr. Zlatko Puvacic, the leading federal
epidemiologist, media reported on Monday [1 Dec 2008].

Puvacic warned that this is almost a 100 percent increase compared to
2007. He also warned that the number of unregistered infected people
is estimated to be 3 times higher. Data for the other Bosnian entity,
Republika Srpska, was not immediately available, but brucellosis has
been seen as a growing problem there as well.

With more than 30 infections per 100 000 residents, Bosnia's
Federation entity has seen the greatest share of brucellosis
infections than any other European country, Puvacic said.

Brucellosis is carried by domestic and wild animals and can spread to
humans who work with animals or eat meat which was not properly
cooked.

In addition to hundreds of registered human cases, tens of thousands
of cases of brucellosis have been registered among domestic animals
in Bosnia over the past few years.

Bosnia is especially susceptible to this and other infectious
diseases transmitted by animals because of the weak capacity of its
health and veterinary services, but also because of a complex
administrative setup which prevents cooperation among different
sectors and administrative units. As a result, many infected humans
and animals are diagnosed late. Farmers often have to wait for weeks,
even months for the culling of infected domestic animals, which are
then sometimes inappropriately disposed of.

In humans, brucellosis induces inconstant fevers, sweating, weakness,
anemia, headaches, depression and muscular and bodily pain but is
usually not fatal. It is treatable with antibiotics, although it can
take weeks, even months to recover.

In October 2008, the World Bank announced the launch of a new project
aimed at improving the country's technical and administrative
capacity to fight infectious diseases, including bird flu.

[The current outbreak of brucellosis in Bosnia and Herzegovina was
previously noted in ProMED post Brucellosis - Bosnia & Herzegovina
20080523.1696. At that time, 395 people with brucellosis were
registered in the Muslim-Croat Federation and an identical number
noted in the Republika Srpska, the Serb entity that, along with the
Muslim-Croat Federation, makes up post-war Bosnia. The following is
extracted from this moderator's [ML] comments in ProMED post
Brucellosis - Bosnia & Herzegovina 20080523.1696:

Brucellosis, also called undulant fever or Malta fever in humans, is
an infection caused by a gram-negative bacillus in the genus
_Brucella_. The brucellosis outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina is
apparently worsening: According to the news release above, about 400
cases are now reported so far this year (2008) in the Muslim-Croat
half of the country (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), and a
similar situation is occurring in the Serb portion (Republika
Srpska). ProMED-mail post no. 20050614.1658 reported that a total of
39 patients were treated in a similar 5-month period of 2005, whereas
in 2003 and 2004, there was a total of 47 cases of brucellosis."

The moderator [AS] of ProMED-mail post no. 20080122.0268 noted that:
"Efforts to eradicate _B. melitensis_ from the European countries
affected (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Greece) have been
underway -- with EU support -- for years; though advances are
significant (Greece excluded), total eradication has not been
achieved so far.

_B. melitensis_ is maintained mainly within small ruminants (sheep
and goats), though cases in cattle and buffaloes may occur
sporadically. _B. abortus_ is maintained mainly within large bovines
(cattle and buffaloes)."

The same moderator [AS] noted in ProMED-mail post no. 20080119.0234
that brucellosis "is also a serious zoonosis ... transmitted to
humans mainly in the following 2 routes: by direct contact with
affected animals or their post-partum/post-abortion secretions, or by
the ingestion of contaminated, unpasteurised food products, mainly
dairy products." Direct person-to-person transmission from an
infected mother to infant can occur by means of breast-feeding.
_Brucella_ can also be used as a bioweapon; the microorganism can be
delivered as an aerosol, making it relatively easy to disseminate.
Therefore, an outbreak of infections would be difficult to detect
because the earliest signs are flu-like symptoms.
