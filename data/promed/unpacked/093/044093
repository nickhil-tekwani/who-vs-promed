[1] Cholera - Congo DR (Sud-Kivu Province)

Almost 400 people are infected and 7 have died from cholera in a town
in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with a shortage of
clean drinking water, health authorities said on Thu, 16 Feb 2006.
Dieudonne Kalumuna, a medical inspector in the DRC's Sud-Kivu
province, told AFP that 398 cases of cholera and 7 cholera-related
deaths had been recorded since the start of 2006 in Uvira, a town of
200 000 people. "The epidemic was growing in Uvira," where an average
of 7 cases of the disease are usually recorded every month, before
doctors began raising awareness among locals, he said. Doctors have
been able to slow down the spread of the disease by a campaign in
schools, churches and markets to teach hygiene rules, he added.
The renewed outbreak of cholera in Uvira risks being aggravated by a
recent disconnection of the water supply caused by an electricity
breakdown which has caused residents to take water from the
Tanganyika lake that lies next to the town. Such disconnections are
frequent in the town. 50 cases of cholera were also found in the
southern Sud-Kivu regions of Fizi, Ruzizi and Nundu. Kalumuna said
most cases usually occurred during the current rainy season.

13 people have been admitted at Buliisa Health Center in Masindi
district following a fresh cholera outbreak. The District Health
Inspector, Mr Patrick Baguma, told journalists at his office on Tue,
14 Feb 2006, that the outbreak had been reported in Buliisa County,
along the shores of Lake Albert. This comes 2 months after the
ministry of health declared the area free of the disease.
The disease was last reported in the district in Dec 2005. In 2005,
12 people died between Jul and Dec 2005.
Baguma said they had dispatched a team of medical experts from the
district headquarters to Buliisa to boost manpower in the area. No
deaths have been recorded so far.
He advised the people in the area to drink boiled water, avoid eating
cold food and construct toilets among other measures to control the
spread of the disease.

Cholera has been confirmed in 2 southern Sudanese cities in a rapidly
spreading outbreak that has claimed 27 lives, UN officials said on
Wed, 15 Feb 2006. With cities full to the brim of returning
southerners following a 2005 peace deal, the bare infrastructure
cannot cope and 2/3 of the population drink unclean water, a carrier
of the disease.
"It's particularly alarming in Juba, where a city of at least 250 000
depends to a great extent on untreated water from the Nile," said the
UN children's agency (UNICEF) spokesman Ben Parker.
In less than 2 weeks, 1433 cases have been reported and at least 27
people have been killed by the outbreak first reported in the town of
Yei earlier in Feb 2006, WHO said.
The 1st case confirmed positive as cholera this week, the WHO said.

Health authorities in Zimbabwe said Wed, 15 Feb 2006, that cholera
had killed 5 people in a poor suburb of the capital Harare, and left
20 others hospitalized.
Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said initial indications were the
people became infected after drinking dirty water. He said health
teams had been dispatched to Epworth suburb to bring the outbreak,
the latest in a long series, under control.
"We strongly suspect that the rains could have washed dirt into
wells, which are a major source of drinking water here and
contaminated the water," he said. "We are making efforts to make sure
that people here are fully educated on the risks of drinking water
that has not been boiled and also for them to wash hands before
eating anything," said Parirenyatwa.

2 more people died of cholera in the central Mozambican province of
Sofala over the last 2 days, bringing to 6 the total number of deaths
out of 1622 cases diagnosed in Sofala this year, reports Wednesday's
(15 Feb 2006) issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias".
Because of the seriousness of the situation, health officials at
central level met this week in Beira with representatives of NGOs,
religious leaders, political parties and traditional healers to
discuss ways to check the disease. The Health authorities said that,
of the 2 deaths, 1 occurred in Beira, and the other in Dondo, about
30 kilometres west of the provincial capital. The source said that
31 new cases were notified in the province during the last 48 hours,
11 of them in Beira, 4 in Nhamatanda, 14 in Dondo, and 1 each in the
districts of Buzi and Caia.
Beira had previously been reporting an average of 20 cases a day,
mainly from the neighborhoods of Munhava, Manga, Praia-Nova, and
Chipangara, because of the prevailing very poor sanitation conditions.
Cholera cases have also been reported in the neighboring provinces of
Zambezia and Manica. Zambezia diagnosed 2 new cases during the last 2
days in Namacurra district.
Since the start of 2006, Zambezia has notified a total of 161 cases,
39 of them in the provincial capital, Quelimane, 89 in the district
of Gile, 15 in Mopeia, and 18 in Namacurra.
As for Manica, the health authorities notified 1 new case, in
Chimoio, the capital, during the last 48 hours, thus bringing to 58
the total number of cases in 2006. 56 of these were in Chimoio, and
the other 2 in Manica town.

8 people have died in the last 2 weeks in a cholera outbreak in
southern Cameroon and another 23 have been infected, the country's
health ministry said. The deaths and illnesses have been reported
around the town of Akonolinga, 140 kilometers (about 85 miles) east
of the capital Yaounde.
According to the ministry the disease spread after the body of
someone who had died at Douala, the economic capital of Cameroon, was
transferred to Akonolinga.
"It is an community-type epidemic that has killed 8 people because
they were in contact with the body, but it should be noted that those
who went to health centers were all saved," Dr Emmanuel Ngapana of
the national epidemological committee said.
From Jan 2004 to Apr 2005 more than 8500 cases of cholera were
registered in Cameroon, and 174 deaths were recorded.

There has been an outbreak of diarrhea in a village in the north of
Arakan State and 69 people are suffering critically from the disease,
said a source. The disease outbreak was in the village of Wrat Nyo
Daung under Buthidaung Township, on 11 Feb 2006.
10 people were sent to Buthidaung Township hospital immediately due
to severe symptoms. The remaining diarrhea-affected individuals were
given treatment by a medical team in the village.
In Wrat Nyo Daung Village, there are 187 households and 237 families
but only 20 toilets in the village. Due to inadequate toilet
facilities in the village the diarrhea spread quickly, said a health
worker from Buthidaung.
