There at least 13 countries so far that intend to stop importing pork from Belgium after the deadly African swine fever [ASF] outbreak was confirmed in the country. These include Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Belarus, Philippines, Mexico, Japan, South Africa, Singapore, Serbia, Uruguay, and Malaysia.

In New Zealand, pig herders are demanding for the local government to halt pork products that are coming from Belgium to safeguard the country's pork industry. New Zealand has been importing fresh pork from European countries that include Belgium, Poland, Estonia, and Italy.

On [Tue 25 Sep 2018] European Union Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan called member states to implement a tougher strategy to contain the spread of ASF. He said that the outbreak started in the Baltic States before spreading to Poland, Romania, and the Czech Republic before jumping to Belgium. Hogan said a total of 9 EU member states have been hit by the virus so far.

The commissioner said the deadly outbreak could threaten EU's pork industry, including as much as 15 000 jobs.

Hogan recognized Belgium's prompt response to contain the spread of the virus by culling up to 4000 pigs and placing a region in the country under quarantine. He, nevertheless, called for a strategy that will have farmers compensated, partly by Belgium and partly by Europe while all efforts are being done to stop the virus from further infecting more domestic pigs.

Meanwhile, China has confirmed a new case of an outbreak in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Officials said 4 pigs were infected and 2 died from the African swine fever.

[Since 13 Sep and as of 26 Sep 2018, a total of 15 ASF-confirmed wild boars have been reported from Belgium's Etalle region, within the province Luxembourg. Severe control measures are being undertaken, addressing both domestic pigs and wild boar.

The recent ASF outbreak in China's Inner Mongolia took place in a slaughterhouse in the city Hohhot (map at https://goo.gl/maps/UJn3NrFYzrx). It was notified to the OIE on 25 Sep 2018, reporting 4 cases of which 2 died. The remaining 386 pigs were destroyed (https://tinyurl.com/y7k9mkhc).

China's ASF event became initially public on 3 Aug 2018, but was suspected to had started considerably earlier. The recent outbreak, in Hohhot, is the 4th in Inner Mongolia, which borders Mongolia on its north. The 1st outbreak in Inner Mongolia has been reported to the OIE on 17 Sep 2018; according to the report, it had started 12 Sep, confirmed 14 Sep 2018 (20180917.6034476).

Notably, ASF was reported, in March 2017, from Russia's Irkutsk oblast (map at https://goo.gl/maps/7rpt4iyZbFv) facing Mongolia's northern border (20170328.4929925).

It would be interesting to get information on surveillance activities undertaken in Mongolia with respect to ASF. - Mod.AS
