British doctors fear 'mad cow' contamination in blood stocks.
British experts on hemophilia are seriously concerned about the safety of
blood transfusions amid fears national stocks could be contaminated by the
fatal human form of "mad cow" disease. The Hemophilia Center Directors'
Organization called Thursday for patients to be treated either with blood
products from foreign donors or artificial products to ensure they were not
exposed to the new form of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD). The British
government has acknowledged there is a probable link between recent
occurrences of CJD in unusually young victims and Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, which causes progressive brain
degeneration in cows.
The Hemophilia Society said it was aware that a number of people with the
variant of CJD had given blood before their condition was identified.
Clotting factor concentrates used in treating hemophiliacs are produced by
pooling blood from large numbers of donors, making it "probable" that some
concentrates would have been in contact with blood from donors with CJD,
the society said. It said, however, that it was not aware of any cases of
mad cow-linked CJD among Britain's population of hemophiliacs.
Peter Flanagan of the National Blood Service said "we are sympathetic to
the predicament they (hemophiliacs) are in. The simple fact is we don't
know whether there is a risk." British authorities recently twice recalled
blood plasma products after discovering two of 22 listed victims who have
died from mad cow-linked CJD donated blood.

assessment and risk communication components of such an endeavor will
require considerable thought. - Mod.PC
