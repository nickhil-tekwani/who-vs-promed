Western Australia: Early Detection of Ross River Virus in Mosquitoes
--------------------------------------------------
Shire of Dardanup Environmental Health Officer Tim Batt said yesterday [Tue
7 Oct 2003] that people were being urged to take extra care when outdoors
and take measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Mr Batt said
Dardanup, Harvey and Bunbury councils were bringing forward TV
advertisements aimed at reducing the backyard breeding of mosquitoes.

The warnings come after similar advice from the Health Department,
following the detection of Ross River virus in mosquitoes collected at
several South West locations last week. "There was actually a case of Ross
River virus infection confirmed in Mandurah last week," Mr Batt said.

Mr Batt said detection so early in the season was unusual, but Ross River
virus outbreaks came in 7-year cycles. Between 1995 and 1996 there were 272
confirmed cases in the Leschenault area and 253 in Capel and Bunbury. The
number of cases declined steadily, so that there had only been a total of
20 confirmed cases in the last 3 years.

Shires would use chemicals ­- that were environmentally friendly where
possible ­- to try and prevent mosquitoes from breeding. Above-average
spring rainfall and higher-than-average temperatures, combined with the
action of tides in the southwest, are said to have provided ideal
conditions for mosquito breeding.

[Ross River virus is associated with epidemics of benign polyarthritis
often involving thousands of cases and is endemic in most coastal regions
and along inland waterways in Australia and beyond. A variety of wild and
domestic animals serve as reservoir hosts. Humans exhibit significant
viremia, and the virus can be maintained in some epidemics in a
human-mosquito-human transmission cycle. Different mosquito vectors are
important according to habitat. The incubation period for Ross River virus
infection is variable, from 2 to 21 days, and the illness is generally
mild, although painful arthritis may persist for weeks and occasionally
months. Recovery is complete and there have been no fatalities.

_Ross River virus_ is classified as a virus species in the genus
_Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_. - Mod.CP]
