In recent months the World Health Organization (WHO) has set up an "Early Warning and Response System" to identify possible outbreaks of dangerous diseases within Syria, said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman, according to The Telegraph.

"We have 291 public health providers in government and opposition-held areas reporting suspected diseases that we then investigate. This network has detected hepatitis A, leishmaniasis, typhoid, and measles."

Leishmaniasis is reportedly thriving in the conflict-ridden Aleppo, where streets are filled with putrid and uncollected rubbish. "Doctors recorded tens of thousands of cases of the tropical disease, transmitted by sand flies, that causes skin ulcers resembling leprosy," reports The Telegraph. Leishmaniasis is among the diseases that are suspected to be flaring up in Syria, WHO has said this week.

Some 22 people in the war-torn country's north eastern province of Deir Ezzor are showing symptoms that are "very likely" to be polio, Oliver Rosenbawer from the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative told The Telegraph on Sunday [20 Oct 2013]. "We still need final confirmation from a laboratory, but all the indicators show that this is polio," said Mr Rosenbawer. If confirmed, the polio outbreak would be Syria's first in 14 years.

"The Ministry of Health of the Syrian Arab Republic confirms that it is treating this event as a cluster ... and an urgent response is currently being planned across the country," the Geneva-based WHO said in statement on Saturday [19 Oct 2013].

[The health situation in Syria has been a concern for a long time. A recent review in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (Infectious disease risk from the Syrian conflict. Petersen E, Baekeland S, Memish ZA, Leblebicioglu H. Int J Infect Dis. 2013 Jul 12.) listed leishmaniasis, measles, and polio as emerging threats in Syria. The polio cases have not yet been laboratory confirmed. The initiative to create a network of health facilities reporting suspected cases based on syndromic reporting will be very useful and will be able to generate a crude estimate of emerging infections.

The emergence of infectious diseases in Syria is reflected in the number of ProMED-mail postings, which has accelerated in 2013 (see below). - Mod.EP
