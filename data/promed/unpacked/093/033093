Chicken meat injected with water and animal proteins from the Netherlands
--------------------------------------------------
Hydrolyzed proteins are common flavor enhancers used in food
products. The breakdown products of amino acids and nucleotides
improve and strengthen the taste of foods. The most common example
of the use of hydrolyzed proteins is in the culinary use of soy sauce.
Pumping poultry meat or hams or roast beef with a solution of water,
salt, flavorings, and other ingredients is not done entirely for cost
savings. Very lean meat is unpalatable and dry. Addition of moisture
improves juiciness.
Hydrolyzed meat proteins are expensive, typically costing more per
pound than the raw meat ingredient involved.
This so-called "new report" appears to be a slanted story about a
common ingredient. The story was perhaps intended to inflame public
opinion without otherwise informing them. It certainly doesn't appear
to be balanced.
Finally, enzymatic decomposition of DNA and proteins is not likely to
significantly disinfect BSE-contaminated tissues. Prions are
notoriously inert to common proteinases.

Julian Wei-Tze Tang wrote "Perhaps we should alert our Food Standards
Agencies or similar watchdogs to be on renewed lookout for such
"hydrolysed protein-enhanced meat products" entering our countries".
They do not need telling. Panorama misleadingly presented all this as
a new sensational discovery of their own investigation. [The data
were based on a single investigation about which Dr. Blanchfield
raises a question on the validity.] The UK Food Standards Agency
[FSA] (and the interested public) knew all about the "hydrolysed
protein-enhanced meat products" since December 2001, when FSA
published its survey highlighting the mislabelling of chicken
containing added water and hydrolysed proteins; and it was their
subsequent investigation which brought the extent of it to light. The
Dutch authorities have taken action against several companies
identified in the FSA survey.
Those who may not have seen it [are invited to see] the report of 21
May 2003 (i.e. before the Panorama programme) from the FSA Website on
the latest state of play and history of the chicken fraud [see item 3
below].
It is interesting to see the analytical information reported [in the
said FSA press release]. This does not suggest that the undeclared
protein was undetectable.
Knowing about the background, and watching the Panorama programme, I
thought it was a disreputable and sensationalist attempt to claim
credit for bringing the fraud to light while discrediting the Food
Standards Agency -- the message that came through loud and clear was
"The Food Standards Agency is the UK's watchdog -- but it is failing
us"! That is clearly a false message.

FSA water in chicken update May 2003
------------------------------------
Following surveys by the Food Standards Agency on the adding of water
with proteins derived from pork and beef to chicken, the European
Commission is to publish proposals to tighten the labelling laws on
these products. The Agency has been leading efforts in Europe to
expose and clamp down on the mislabelling of chicken products,
through enforcement action both in the UK and in coordination with
authorities in Holland where the practice is most common. The Dutch
authorities have taken action against several companies identified in
the FSA survey.
The Agency is proposing that if a chicken product contained an
ingredient from any other animal, this would have to be declared and
displayed prominently in the product's name. So, for example, a
chicken product containing hydrolysed protein derived from pork would
have to be prominently labelled as "chicken product containing pork"
or "chicken product with pork ingredients". The proposal will also
tighten the current requirements for labelling of water in chicken.
The Agency wants the use of added water to be declared more
prominently. Water and hydrolysed animal proteins are added to
chicken to bulk up the product, which is then sold on, largely to the
catering industry. It isn't illegal to add water or animal proteins
to chicken if the product is accurately labelled.
However, Agency surveys have uncovered that many chicken products
supplied to UK restaurants and takeaways aren't accurately labelled.
The presence of undeclared pork and beef proteins in chicken has
caused great concern, especially among some religious groups.
There have been 2 surveys on this issue in the UK (December 2001 and
March 2003) and 2 surveys in Ireland (Food Standards Authority
Ireland, May 2002 and March 2003). Of 130 samples in total, 65
claimed to have more meat than was the case, 20 contained pork DNA, 7
contained beef DNA, and 4 contained both pork and beef DNA.
The FSA survey in March 2003 was for enforcement purposes. 20 local
authorities that took part are considering formal enforcement action
against the relevant companies.
In a related development, Dutch authorities report that they have
taken formal enforcement action against 5 companies processing
chicken products in the Netherlands, which is the centre of this
industry. 4 of these companies were targeted after their activities
were highlighted by the Agency's work in the UK.
This is a labelling issue, which does not raise any new safety
concerns. In response to queries about any risks in relation to BSE,
the Agency has identified the source of the beef protein added to the
chicken as collagen from hide, and the European Scientific Steering
Committee concluded that the parts of the hide used for the
production of collagen don't present a risk of BSE, provided
contamination is avoided.
All beef is subject to European-wide BSE controls. Therefore,
provided these controls have been applied, any traces of beef that
may be in other products wouldn't raise any new food safety concerns.
The Agency has always made it clear that it would look into any new
evidence that will help it to crack down on these scams.

[While clearly the FSA and its Irish counterpart, the Food Safety
Authority of Ireland (FSAI), are in no need of a reminder of the
issue -- which they seem to have been addressing persistently and
energetically -- changes in the EU labelling laws and their
implementation are required. A press release from the FSAI dated 12
Mar 2003, under the title "SOME DUTCH CHICKEN FILLETS CONTINUE TO
BREACH FOOD LABELLING LAWS", included the following statement: "These
ongoing investigations highlight a deficiency in the EU legislation
and a lack of compliance with existing labelling legislation. If the
single market is to work effectively, honest, clear labelling across
the EU is required combined with legislation that protects consumers'
interests and full compliance by industry. Our investigations in
tandem with the UK FSA will be kept under review and we certainly
will be raising our concerns at the highest levels in the EU and in
the Dutch administrations". - Mod.AS]
