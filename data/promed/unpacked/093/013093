Up to 88% of sub-Saharan African adolescents COVID-19 vaccine-hesitant
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A 2021 survey published yesterday [5 Oct 2022] in PLOS Global Public Health finds COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy of up to 88% among adolescents in some sub-Saharan countries, mostly because of concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness.

A team led by George Mason University researchers fielded the survey via computer-assisted phone interviewing in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania from July to December 2021. The survey was a follow-up to one conducted with the same respondents in July to November 2020.

Respondents included about 300 adolescents aged 10 to 19 years from randomly selected households in a rural and urban area in each country but Ghana, which included only a rural area, for a total of 2662.

The rate of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, defined as declining or being undecided about vaccination, was 14% in rural Kersa, Ethiopia; 23% in rural Ibadan, Nigeria; 31% in rural Nouna, Burkina Faso; 32% in urban Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; 37% in urban Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; 48% in rural Kintampo, Ghana; 65% in urban Lagos, Nigeria; 76% in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and 88% in rural Dodoma, Tanzania.

Despite the proven safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the top reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about vaccine safety (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 3.52) and effectiveness (aPR, 3.46). The people most likely to influence vaccine willingness were healthcare workers, parents or family members, and schoolteachers.

The study authors noted that while adolescents are less likely than adults to develop severe COVID-19, they can still spread the virus, and some do become severely ill and develop complications. In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescents aged 10 to 19 years make up 23% of the population, making vaccination of this group all the more crucial.

"Therefore, getting COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of adolescents is crucial for Africa to achieve the World Health Organization's target of 70% COVID-19 vaccination coverage by mid-2022," they wrote. "Further, adolescents may serve as agents of advocacy that encourage their family members and friends to get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccination campaigns among sub-Saharan African adolescents should address their concerns and misconceptions about vaccine safety and effectiveness."

"We find that adolescent boys have less COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy than adolescent girls, consistent with existing evidence. The specific mechanisms for the greater vaccine hesitancy among adolescent girls are unclear but may be related to the lower tendency of risk-taking among adolescent girls than among boys (i.e., considering receiving COVID-19 vaccines as a risk-taking behavior) [55]. These findings highlight the need to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, especially among adolescent girls. A study among 472 521 adults in Latin America and the Caribbean finds that having depressive symptoms is associated with greater fear of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccines [39], indicating that vaccine hesitancy for some individuals may be related to underlying mental health issues that must be addressed accordingly. We do not find associations between psychological distress and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the long-term mental well-being of sub-Saharan African adolescents need to be investigated further." - Mod.LK]

[2] Pregnancy pre-eclampsia
Date: Sun 9 Oct 2022

A Brooklyn mother has issued an alarming warning about the risk catching the coronavirus can have on giving birth.

[LP] told how she suffered from preeclampsia after having her baby and linked it to going down with the virus earlier in her pregnancy.

The 32-year-old attorney said she was rushed back into hospital with dangerously high blood pressure just days after having her son.

She urged would-be parents to avoid coronavirus during pregnancy and seek immediate medical advice because she says it saved her life.

It comes as experts fear catching COVID could cause deadly complications with childbirth and even lead to stillbirths.

A swathe of studies during the pandemic found women had a 60% greater risk of having preeclampsia if they had suffered from the virus.

Researchers linked catching coronavirus to a destroyed placenta that was scarred and a tan color rather than the usual dark shade that caused complications.

Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy that results in 70 000 maternal and 500 000 fetal deaths worldwide each year, the Seattle Times reported, and the number of cases jumped during the pandemic.

The illness is just one part of a slew of information scientists are studying to learn more about how COVID affects pregnancy.

Experts say women who contracted COVID-19 during their pregnancy also face an elevated risk of stillbirths.

But they believe vaccination can help prevent these cases, with statistics showing unvaccinated women at higher risk of complications.

Earlier on in the pandemic, many thought the coronavirus didn't affect unborn fetuses because few babies were born with the infection. But in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology study published in September [2022], it was revealed that the infection damages the placenta's immune response to further infections.

'What we're seeing now is that the placenta is vulnerable to COVID-19, and the infection changes the way the placenta works, and that in turn is likely to impact the development of the fetus,' Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf said.

Expectant mothers were 3.5 times more likely to be hospitalized and 13.6 times more likely to die than non-pregnant residents of Washington state who were in their 20s and 30s. The researchers looked at 240 pregnant women with COVID-19 in Washington state between 1 Mar and 30 Jun 2020.

Scientists also believed COVID to be a virus that mainly affected the respiratory system -- but it has now been proven to wreak havoc with the circulatory system too.

Doctors also fear a COVID infection may 'unmask' health conditions that a pregnant woman's immune system would otherwise be able to shield her from.

The placenta, an organ that attaches to the womb during pregnancy, connects with the umbilical cord and provides oxygen and nourishment from the mother's bloodstream to the baby.

In the fall and winter of 2021, Amy Heerema McKenney, a Cleveland Clinic pathologist whose job involves figuring out why some babies die, began receiving eerily similar reports of stillbirths, The Times reported.

She recalled feeling 'pretty panicked' as she began to look into the cases, which happened in quick succession.

While a normal placenta is spongy and dark reddish hue, which shows the nourishing blood flowing through it, the ones she was studying from mothers who lost their babies were like nothing she'd ever seen.

They were firm, discolored, scarred, and more of a tan color. 'The degree of devastation was unique,' she said.

[Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure, which can be deadly for both a woman and her unborn baby if untreated.

It usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure is typically normal.

The most effective treatment is an early delivery; usually via C-section.

However, this may not be best for the baby if it is early on in the pregnancy.

Pre-eclampsia affects about 25 000 women in England and Wales each year, and 4% of pregnancies in the US.

It can have no symptoms if it develops gradually rather than coming on suddenly.

A blood pressure reading above 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) on 2 occasions is usually the 1st sign.

Other symptoms may include:
- Severe headaches
- Blurred vision, temporary loss of sight or light sensitivity
- Upper abdominal pain, particularly under the ribs on the right side
- Sudden weight gain, and swelling in the face and hands, are also symptoms, however, these can occur during normal pregnancies.

Pre-eclampsia is thought to begin in the placenta when its blood vessels narrow and do not react to hormones properly.

This reduces the amount of blood that flows through them. Its underlying cause may be genetic, due to a problem with a woman's immune system or existing blood vessel damage.

A woman is more at risk if she, or a member of her family, suffered from pre-eclampsia before. The risk is also highest during the first pregnancy, and if a woman is over 40; obese; black; having a multiple birth, like twins; or conceived via IVF.

Existing medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, migraines and kidney disease also raise the risk. If untreated, pre-eclampsia can restrict a baby's growth or cause it to be delivered early.

The placenta can also separate from the uterus wall, which can lead to severe bleeding. A woman may also suffer seizures, organ damage and even heart disease as a result of untreated pre-eclampsia.

There is no clear advice on how to prevent pre-eclampsia, however, research suggests taking a low-dose of aspirin and calcium supplements may help. (Source: Mayo Clinic, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745) - Mod.LK]

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccines for Use as a Booster Dose in Younger Age Groups
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today [10 Oct 2022], the U.S. Food and Drug Administration amended the emergency use authorizations (EUAs) of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent to authorize their use as a single booster dose in younger age groups. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent is authorized for administration at least 2 months following completion of primary or booster vaccination in children down to 6 years of age. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent is authorized for administration at least 2 months following completion of primary or booster vaccination in children down to 5 years of age.

These bivalent COVID-19 vaccines include an mRNA component of the original strain to provide an immune response that is broadly protective against COVID-19 and an mRNA component in common between the omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5 lineages to provide better protection against COVID-19 caused by the omicron variant. The mRNA in these vaccines is a specific piece of genetic material that instructs cells in the body to make the distinctive "spike" protein of the original virus strain and the omicron variant lineages BA.4 and BA.5. The spike proteins of BA.4 and BA.5 are identical.

"Since children have gone back to school in person and people are resuming pre-pandemic behaviors and activities, there is the potential for increased risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Vaccination remains the most effective measure to prevent the severe consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D. "While it has largely been the case that COVID-19 tends to be less severe in children than adults, as the various waves of COVID-19 have occurred, more children have gotten sick with the disease and have been hospitalized. Children may also experience long-term effects, even following initially mild disease. We encourage parents to consider primary vaccination for children and follow-up with an updated booster dose when eligible."

With today's [10 Oct 2022] authorization, the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is no longer authorized as a booster dose for individuals 5 through 11 years of age. Both the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine continue to be authorized for primary series administration in individuals 6 months of age and older.

For each of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines authorized today [10 Oct 2022], the FDA relied on immune response and safety data that it had previously evaluated from a clinical study in adults of a booster dose of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that contained a component of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and a component of omicron lineage BA.1. The FDA considers such data as relevant and supportive of vaccines containing a component of the omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5 lineages. In addition, the FDA has evaluated and considered immune response and safety data from clinical studies of the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, including as a booster dose in pediatric age groups. These data and real-world experience with the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which have been administered to millions of people, including young children, support the EUA of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines in younger age groups. ...

...The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also backed the FDA's authorization, clearing the way for the shots to be administered in children.

Overall, COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States have stayed low among kids, with nearly 40% of children aged 5-11 vaccinated with one dose of a vaccine so far.

Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine will be shipped immediately after the CDC's recommendation, the companies said.

Pfizer said it has the capacity to ship up to 6 million pediatric doses in the 1st 7 calendar days, without any impact to distribution output of the doses for individuals aged 12 years and older.

The BA.5 subvariant of omicron currently remains the dominant strain, accounting for nearly 79% of the cases in the United States.

Around 11.5 million people received the updated shots over the 1st 5 weeks of the rollout last month [September 2022], which represents just 5.4% of the people aged 12 or older who are eligible to receive them. - Mod.LK]

[4] Nasal vaccine

A recent clinical trial has found less-than-promising results for a nasally administered version of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, with immune responses observed in only "a minority of participants."

University of Oxford researchers found in their phase one clinical trial that not only were antibody responses seen in only a minority of participants, but those responses were also weaker in comparison to intramuscular vaccinations. The nasal formula that was administered was the same one used for intramuscular injections.

A nasal vaccine dose was administered to 30 participants who had not yet been immunized against SARS-CoV-2. Among those study participants, 14 received a 2nd nasal dose 28 days after their 1st dose.

Another 12 participants in the AstraZeneca-funded trial received mRNA coronavirus vaccines not made by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company, whose own vaccine induces an immune response through a different system.

Following immunization, those who received intranasal vaccinations developed antibodies that "rarely" rose higher than the level of antibodies observed following a COVID-19 infection.

Researchers concluded that while the nasal vaccine was well tolerated, it "induced neither a consistent mucosal antibody response nor a strong systemic response."

"The nasal spray did not perform as well in this study as we had hoped. This was quite different from recent data from China, which has suggested good results can be achieved by delivery of a similar vaccine deep into the lungs with a more complex nebuliser device," said Sandy Douglas, an associate professor at Oxford and chief investigator for the trial.

The vaccine that Douglas referred to was one made by the Chinese company CanSino Biologics. It was approved in September [2022].

There are currently around 100 other similar mucosal vaccines being developed around the world. As noted in the peer-reviewed Nature science journal, one possible benefit of such vaccines is that they induce responses in the immune cells of the nose and respiratory tract, potentially acting much more quickly against infection.

Other human trials looking into the efficacy of intranasal vaccines are being conducted in countries such as India, Mexico and the U.S.

Nasal vaccines are not an entirely new concept. A nasal vaccine is approved for use in the 2022--2023 flu season for healthy, nonpregnant people aged 2 to 49.

"We believe that delivery of vaccines to the nose and lungs remains a promising approach, but this study suggests there are likely to be challenges in making nasal sprays a reliable option," Douglas said. "We urgently need more research to develop vaccines which can block transmission of respiratory pandemic viruses using delivery routes which are safe and practical at large scale."

"An inhaled version of a COVID-19 vaccine, produced by the Chinese company CanSino Biologics in Tianjin, was approved for use as a booster dose in China.

It's one of more than 100 oral or nasal vaccines in development around the world. In theory, these vaccines could prime immune cells in the thin mucous membranes that line cavities in the nose and mouth where SARSCoV-2 enters the body, and quickly stop the virus in its tracks -- before it spreads. Vaccine developers hope that these 'mucosal' vaccines will prevent even mild cases of illness and block transmission to other people, achieving what's known as sterilizing immunity. A few mucosal vaccines are already approved for other diseases, including a sprayable vaccine against influenza. Evidence in animals supports the idea that sterilizing immunity can be induced against COVID-19, although data from humans are scant. Nature explains why mucosal vaccines might help to quash SARS-CoV-2, and what the latest findings mean."
