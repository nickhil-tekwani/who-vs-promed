At least 3 people have died and 24 others are still receiving treatment at the central hospital in Cabinda following a cholera outbreak ravaging the province.

Local health authorities have traced an emergency plan to prevent the spread of the disease. "Actually we do not know yet what disease it is, but the symptoms indicate that it is cholera," said a health professional in an interview with TPA [Angola national broadcaster] in the northern province.

Also according to the health authorities at the moment studies are being done in order to investigate and combat the disease.

[2] Cholera - Uganda (Hoima)

The number of people who have contracted cholera in Hoima District has risen to 56 since the epidemic broke out mid this month April 2013.

The district health office has observed that although the disease broke out at Runga Landing Site on Lake Albert, it had spread to Kababwa, Waki, and Kapaapi villages in Kigorobya Sub-county. "The patients are under treatment at an isolation unit at Runga Landing Site. The death toll has remained 3," the district health inspector, Mr Fredrick Byenume, said at the weekend [27-28 Apr 2013].

Health officials have been joined by Uganda Red Cross volunteers in offering care and support to the affected communities. Communities are being mobilized to dig pit-latrines although they claim their facilities collapse because of the sandy soil.

The Kigorobya Sub-county councillor, Mr Mugenyi Mulindambura, asked the government to roll out an affirmative programme to set up public pit-latrines and other related sanitary facilities in the affected areas.

"Constructing pit-latrines in sandy soils is not only costly but also requires some technical expertise which local communities lack. This calls for government's intervention," Mr Mulindambura, who is also the chairperson of the Hoima District production and natural resources committee, said.

[3] Cholera - India (Kerala ex Karnataka)

The district health officials have confirmed that the recent cholera epidemic in Wayanad [District in north east Kerala] was spread through tribal migrant laborers working in the ginger plantations in the southern districts of Karnataka.

The cholera outbreak was detected in most of those districts 2 months ago and the health officials had warned their Kerala counterparts about the high probability of the communicable disease spreading in the northern districts in Kerala, including Wayanad.

Also, a large number of migrant laborers from Karnataka are employed in several sectors across the district. There was a high chance of the spread of such diseases in tribal colonies due to poor environmental hygiene, lack of access to potable water and risk-posing lifestyles of the tribal population, District Medical Officer A Sameera told Express.

Health workers are directed to be alert as patients that have recovered still carry the bacterium for up to 2 weeks. In 2013, the 1st cholera death in the district was reported in January when a tribal laborer from Noolpuzha in Sulthan Bathery taluk died of diarrheal illness. Currently, 18 persons with symptoms of cholera are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the district and at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital.
