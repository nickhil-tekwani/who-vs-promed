Foot And Mouth Disease Wreaks Havoc in Chivi
--------------------------------------------
Chivi villagers are taking desperate measures to protect their cattle
from foot and mouth disease (FMD), which broke out in the area
recently.
The once peaceful mornings in this usually serene district south of
Masvingo have all of a sudden become busy as villagers wake up early
to administer their own invented doses they think will cure the
infection. It is now common to see villagers carrying buckets of
water and bags of fertiliser to cattle pens, where they mix the 2 to
administer to blisters on cattle hooves and mouths caused by the
infection.
Most of the cattle in Chivi district have been reduced to limping
beasts, as they have become weak due to the effects of the disease.
This has affected plans by many in the district to start preparing
their fields in time for the next planting season expected by the end
of October.
Chivi district has been receiving some rains for the past 3 weeks and
villagers have been hoping to take advantage of the rains to start
preparing their fields. Yet they can only watch in vain as the cattle
cannot be harnessed because they are either too weak to pull the
plough or cannot move effectively because of blisters on their hooves.
No villager is sure of where the idea of using fertiliser as a cure
for the infection originated. But in a move that depicts the effects
of "mob psychology", the villagers have all of a sudden rushed to use
the concoction. Somehow, they believe the mixture of water and
fertiliser will cure the infection, hoping that by cleaning the
hooves and mouths of cattle with fertiliser, the conditions necessary
for the breeding of bacteria that cause the infection will eventually
be removed.
Veterinary Services principal director Dr Stuart Hargreaves said the
use of fertiliser to clear the infection does not work. "The
fertiliser will probably cause more harm to the animals than cure,"
he says. "There is absolutely no use in administering fertiliser to
the cattle. It is not helpful at all."
Dr Hargreaves says there are no immediate plans to send vaccines to
the area because they are not available due to the shortage of
foreign currency.
The FMD infection affects cloven-footed animals, but only makes them
sick without killing them. The infection has devastating effects on
the animals themselves and their owners who have to stand and watch
them suffer, especially in the absence of vaccination. Cloven-footed
livestock are cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, and buffalo.
"We are at a loss because we do not know what we will use as draught
power, as all our cattle are too weak," said Mrs Mavis Mambo who
lives near Ngomahuru Hospital. "Something urgent has to be done if
our cattle are going to survive."
The FMD virus is not harmful to people but is contagious and can be
spread from farm to farm and across one country to another on
clothing and shoes. It can also be spread by wind.
There are 7 types of the virus and there are vaccines for each of
them. But vaccination against one type of the virus does not protect
the animals from another type.
The Department of Veterinary Services last month suspended the
movement of livestock in Chivi and Gutu districts following the
outbreak of the disease. Chief animal health inspector for Masvingo
province Mr Ben Tigere said a critical shortage of vaccines was
hampering efforts to control the infection.
Masvingo province has about 850 000 cattle, raising fears that the
infection might affect the country's beef exports. In June 2003, the
Department also indefinitely suspended all public auctions of cattle
and banned their movement in the Midlands province following a severe
outbreak of the infection there; the province has an estimated cattle
herd of about 900 000.
The department also quarantined Aisleby Farm in Umguza, near
Bulawayo, following the outbreak of FMD.
All this calls for a holistic approach to solving the problem rather
than acting only after the infection spread. Urgent efforts are
needed to procure enough FMD vaccines to deal with the infection that
is threatening to engulf the whole country; otherwise the infection
will affect the coming planting season, as cattle will remain too
weak to be used as draught power.

[In southern Africa, the use of fencing and other means to strictly
control the movement of wildlife and livestock as well as judicious
application of vaccine has resulted in countries of the region being
able to access beef and other livestock markets in Europe and
elsewhere in the developed world. Zimbabwe seems to have lost the
ability to maintain this status and is seriously threatening the very
status of the entire region.
It is lamentable that the heroic efforts of the Zimbabwean Veterinary
Department to contain the spread of FMD there remain unsupported. As
indicated in several previous postings, without sufficient quantities
of the relevant vaccine and means to transport the vaccination teams,
this epizootic will continue unabated.
Further updated data on the status and control of FMD in Southern
Africa and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa are available online in
a recent review by W. Vosloo et al in Rev. sci. tech. Off. int.
