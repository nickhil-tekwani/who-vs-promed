A man in a white protective suit parked a dump truck at the edge of a dusty pit and unloaded a pile of pink carcasses. They tumbled to the ground just as a 2nd truck arrived with another batch.

The scene at a Hong Kong landfill this week was part of a government effort to kill and dispose of 6000 pigs from a slaughterhouse where one of them had been found to have African swine fever [ASF].

It was the latest turn in an outbreak that has decimated pig herds in the Chinese mainland and rapidly spread elsewhere in Asia in recent months, and which experts say shows no sign of stopping -- particularly since containing the disease is a challenge in a region where many producers are small-scale farmers.

And because China is the world's largest producer and consumer of pork, the mainland government's move to cull more than one million pigs is now being felt across a sprawling global industry that includes truckers, pork dealers and soybean feed farmers.

"The ripples of it will be felt everywhere," Dr. Dirk Pfeiffer, a veterinary epidemiologist at the City University of Hong Kong who studies the disease, said of the ASF outbreak.

The highly contagious virus, which affects pigs but not humans, has been found in hog farms around the world for years. But the current outbreak affects a region where pork is often the primary staple of local diets.

The outbreak was 1st reported in mainland China in August [2018]. Since then, the virus has spread to pig herds in every mainland Chinese province, as well as to Viet Nam, Cambodia and Mongolia.

Viet Nam, one of the world's largest pork producers, has culled nearly 90 000 pigs since February [2019], according to figures published last week by the United Nations food agency [The actual figures are much higher. Viet Nam government's official website says: "As of 12 May 2019, a total of 1.2 million pigs have been infected and destroyed (accounting for over 4% of the total pig population of the country)"; in Vietnamese, machine trans., at http://baochinhphu.vn/Tin-noi-bat/Pho-Thu-tuong-chu-tri-hoi-nghi-phong-chong-dich-ta-lon-chau-Phi/365729.vgp. Also cited in FAO's last weekly ASF/Asia report; see in commentary. - Mod.AS].

The country's prime minister, Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc, recently called for "drastic measures" to stop the virus from spreading and even enlisted the military in the effort. "We should combat the epidemic as if we are fighting against the enemy," Mr. Phuc was quoted as saying in March [2019] by the country's state-run news media.

Dr. Pfeiffer said that while the spread of the disease into Viet Nam was worrying, his primary concern was how Chinese authorities were handling the outbreak because the scale of that country's pork industry makes it the "Himalayas of pigs."

About 700 million hogs were slaughtered in China last year [2018], far more than in any other country. Analysts at Rabobank, a Dutch lender, predicted last month [April 2019] that China's total would fall by about 150 million to 200 million this year because of deaths from infection or culling.

China's tendency to hush up disease outbreaks has engendered widespread public distrust, and many farmers and livestock analysts say they assume the disease has infected more pigs, in more places, than officials have publicly acknowledged.

Chinese companies are now rolling out facial and voice recognition software on pig farms and other unproven ways to save the animals from disease. The government has also bought frozen pork to build up its strategic reserve.

Meanwhile, more than one billion pork lovers in China and neighboring countries are facing tightening supplies. In April [2019], a global meat price index rose by 3% compared with a month earlier, as demand for imported pork surged in Asia, particularly China, the UN food agency reported.

Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, confirmed its 1st case of ASF last week at the Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse, which gets its pigs from the Chinese mainland. Dr. Pfeiffer said that the facility gets about 4000 pigs a day from the Chinese mainland, and another 250 to 300 from local farmers.

Hong Kong authorities promptly cut hog imports from the mainland and ordered the culling of all 6000 of the Sheung Shui facility's pigs. They also closed down another major slaughterhouse and warned of short-term pork shortages.

At the Chun Yuen Street wet market in Hong Kong on Tuesday [14 May 2019], several meat vendors said that they had stopped selling pork in recent days -- partly because of scarce supplies, but also because they feared selling it could expose them to liabilities.

That left one shopper, Ms. Wong Wai-lai, 57, wondering what to cook for dinner in place of her usual pork-rib soup. "It seems like we have to opt for fish today," she said while scanning a few specimens that were displayed on ice. "But it's always better to be safe than sorry. Swine fever is no joke."

A total of 1 026 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

2. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: ASF virus was detected in a single sample from Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse (SSSH). The pig was from a farm in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province. The sample submitted on 2 May 2019 tested positive for ASF on 10 May 2019. Operations at SSSH have been suspended, and around 6000 pigs at the SSSH were destroyed, followed by cleansing and disinfection.

3. Mongolia: Since its 1st report on 15 Jan 2019, 11 outbreaks in 6 provinces and in Ulaanbaatar have been reported, involving 105 farms/households. More than 3115 pigs, more than 10% of the total pig population in Mongolia, have died/been destroyed due to the ASF outbreaks.

4. Viet Nam: Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) confirmed its ASF outbreaks on 19 Feb 2019, a total of 30 provinces/cities reported outbreaks, and more than 1 300 000 pigs have been culled. (Additional details, in particular in reference to the control measures undertaken, are available at http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/15/c_138061245.htm).

5. Cambodia: Since the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries confirmed its 1st ASF outbreak in Som Kaninh village, Som Thom commune, O Ya Dav District, Ratanakiri Province on 2 Apr 2019, more than 2400 pigs have died or been culled.

The said weekly FAO update further informs that FAO and the World Bank are to give a report at the G7 CVO meeting to be held in Paris on 24 May 2019, and that OIE and FAO are to discuss ASF at the 87th OIE General Session in OIE Paris on 28 May 2019, when this Technical Item is to be presented.

The said and additional information, including Table 1 "List of China's (32, including HK) provinces affected since 3 Aug 2018, for each presenting its last affected city and date of the last reported onset" and Table 2 "List of (30) affected provinces in Viet Nam by region reported since 19 Feb 2019," Viet Nam's map presenting the affected provinces, and more, is available at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/Situation_update.html.

The next FAO ASF/Asia update will be issued on 23 May 2019. - Mod.AS
