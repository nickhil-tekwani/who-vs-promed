Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP); Meeting
of 18-20 May 2010; Community referrals and related procedures
------------------------------------------
The Committee started a procedure for Pregsure BVD and associated
names (inactivated Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) type 1 virus) from
Pfizer Animal Health. The matter was notified to the Committee by
Germany under Article 78 of Directive 2001/82/EC, due to concerns
relating to animal safety.

"Pregsure," a vaccine against Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD), was
temporarily withdrawn from the German market by the producer, Pfizer
Animal Health, in Apr 2010. This was done following suspicions of a
link between cases of haemorrhagic diathesis in neonatal calves born
from cows that were vaccinated with the vaccine (see 20100409.1142).

As mentioned by the sender, in the June 2010 issue of the German
monthly farming paper "DLZ Primus Milchrind," Prof Ottmar Distl, head
of Hannover University's Institute for Animal Breeding and Genetics,
stated that farms with cases of neonatal haemorrhagic diathesis
should not use colostrum from their cattle, even if they have only
experienced one single calf affected. - Mod.AS]

[Bovine viral diarrhea virus is in the genus Pestivirus from the
family Flaviviridae. - Mod.LM]
