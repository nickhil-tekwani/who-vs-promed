SHIGELLOSIS LINKED TO DRINKING WATER; 68 PEOPLE LOGGED COMPLAINTS AFTER
GOODHUE COUNTY FAIR
ZUMBROTA, Minn. -- Minnesota state Health Department officials were cited
as saying that drinking water is to blame for a shigellosis outbreak last
month at the Goodhue County Fair. County health officials took complaints
from 68 people who became ill. Nine cases of shigellosis have been
confirmed and four people were hospitalized.
Public health nurse Vicki Iocco was cited as saying health officials traced
the bacteria to a water source in a rabbit barn and a 4-H building, and
that fecal material was found in water in both of the buildings, adding,
"It's not clear how the water was contaminated at this point."
