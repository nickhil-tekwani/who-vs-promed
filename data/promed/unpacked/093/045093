Two pigs have been sent home from the Ohio State Fair because they have the swine flu [influenza] virus. The state veterinarian discovered the sick hogs Thursday [2 Aug 2012].

The Ohio State Department of Agriculture has been closely monitoring the fair in Columbus because of a recent swine flu outbreak recently at the Butler County Fair in southwestern Ohio.

There was a similar recent outbreak at a fair in Indiana. The swine flu virus can be passed from pigs to humans, and vice versa.

The Columbus Dispatch reports that fair-goers are being urged to wash their hands after visiting livestock exhibits areas and before eating and drinking.

The Ohio Expo Commission moved additional hand-sanitation stations to the swine barn and reminded exhibitors to take extra hygiene measures. The fair runs through Sunday [5 Aug 2012].
