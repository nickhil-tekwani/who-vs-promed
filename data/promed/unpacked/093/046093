[Sheep pox has been regarded endemic in Israel for many years; the
local virus affects -- clinically -- sheep only (no cases in goats).
Mortality in adult animals is generally low (less than 5 percent) but
may reach high levels in offspring.

Since 2006, a new, imported vaccine has been introduced and
vaccination -- of sheep -- became compulsory; this led to a sharp
decrease in the number of outbreaks: 2006 - 26; 2007 - 9; 2008 - 4;
2009 - 0; 2010 - 0. A graph showing all outbreaks reported in Israel
between 1990 - 2009 is available on page 26 of Israel's Veterinary
Services and Animal Health (VSAH) annual 2009 report, available at
http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/401D0A6E-6FA9-41AD-B52E-130299EA5CC5/0/doch_vet_shnati_2009.pdf.
(though the report's applied language is Hebrew, the annual figures
will be readily deciphered).

"Hamerkaz" stands for "Center" in the Hebrew language. - Mod.AS]

[Below is a commentary from Mod.AS in last year's posting (see Sheep
pox & goat pox, ovine - Russia: (PR) 20101018.3775) describing the
clinical signs and geographic distribution.

Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats
characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles
(rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death.
Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of which can
infect sheep and goats. Although most of the strains examined cause
clinical disease in either sheep or goats, some strains have been
isolated that will cause a clinical disease in both species (e.g., in
Kenya).

Capripox is endemic in Africa north of the equator, the Middle East,
Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, parts of the
People's Republic of China and Bangladesh. The most recent outbreaks
occurred in Mongolia in 2008 and 2009, an isolated outbreak in Greece
in 2008, and in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in 2009. Goat pox has been
established in Viet Nam since 2005. The 1st goat pox outbreak in
Chinese Taipei occurred in 2008, and in 2010 the disease reoccurred
and was declared endemic. - Mod.AS]
