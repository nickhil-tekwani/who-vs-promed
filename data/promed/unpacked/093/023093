The potency of the rabbit-killing calicivirus in Tasmania may be boosted by
new scientific research. Calicivirus Program Tasmania coordinator Mick
Statham said yesterday the virus so far had yielded disappointing results
in temperate southeastern Australia.
Released in Tasmania last April, it had not lived up to expectations. When
first introduced it was hoped the virus would kill up to 95 per cent of
rabbits but the actual kill was estimated to be about 60 per cent.
Dr Statham said that to combat the disappointing results and to augment the
potency of the virus in temperate climates, scientists were embarking on a
national program to find out if the cooler states needed a new super-strain
or a new dose of the virus. Tasmanian experts also would be looking at ways
to make the virus more effective.
Poorer-than-expected results in southeastern Australia were accompanied by
great success in more arid regions.
Dr Statham said that despite the virus not living up to original
expectations in Tasmania, the results were reasonable. In just the past two
to three months the virus had spread through the Midlands. "When we were
originally spreading the virus in the target South Arm area we counted
about 100 rabbits a square kilometre," he said. Now it appears to be about
30 a square kilometre so we probably have reduced the population there by
about two-thirds." Dr Statham said it was harder to assess how the virus
had spread through the rest of the state.
"There may be a variety of reasons why we do not get the spread of the
virus you see in some other states," he said. "In Tasmania we do not get
the insect spread you see in some warmer climates. We also have predators
such as devils, cats and birds of prey feeding on dead rabbits, reducing
the possibility of spread once again as insects can't feed on them, but it
is still much of a mystery why the virus has not taken off as we expected.
Another theory to be investigated was that rabbits in temperate areas had
more food and produced more offspring, out-breeding the virus.
