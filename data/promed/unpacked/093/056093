Re: ProMED-mail Undiagnosed disease, fatal, bovine - Europe: RFI 20091003.3441
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Two recent "sea changes" in the Scottish beef industry have been
the recent bluetongue [BT] vaccination campaign (in its 1st year),
which was much more successful than that of England, and the increase
in BVD [bovine viral diarrhoea] vaccination over the last few years.
There are also one or 2 BVD control schemes, parts of which with
vaccination requirements.

In England, dairies may well vaccinate against both BT and BVD and
adhere to this vaccination schedule better than English beef farmers.
Interestingly in mainland Europe BVD vaccination has also started to
occur more frequently as has either field or vaccine exposure to
bluetongue.

2. There is now a definite and clear requirement for a veterinary
scientist experienced in indirect immunofluorescence (not ELISA) to
conduct experiments to rule in or rule out any involvement of these
vaccines in the present disease syndrome.

3. Particular attention would be paid to the use of controls and
dilution rates.

4. The aim would be to see if dams colostral IgG or IgM attached to
the calves bone marrow soon after first taking colostrum.

5. If this was found to be so, it would then be necessary to see which
types of antibody were attaching and if the titres in colostrum were
relevant. It may be that very high levels of one antibody (could even
be an antibody to an adjuvant) are relevant, or ratios between
antibodies. (On the epidemiological side it is relevant to find out
how close to calving vaccines have been given. Also in the UK there
are at least 3 licensed BVD vaccines and 3 BT vaccines. Thus at least
9 vaccine combinations are possible.)

6. Many of the reagents should be easily available for a whole series
of different but closely related indirect immunofluorescence
experiments. (I did earlier suggest colostrum should be stored in all
affected herds.) [see item 3 in ProMED-mail archive no. 20090329.1214.
- Mod.AS] Affected calf bone marrow, control calf bone marrow from
calves without 'calf bleeding syndrome', dams' colostrum, control
colostrum, dams' serum, control cow's serum, affected calves serum,
unaffected calves serum, rabbit anti bovine IgG, rabbit anti bovine
IgM, control rabbit serum, fluorescent guinea pig anti-rabbit IgG,
fluorescent guinea pig control serum would be a starting list.

7. Indirect immunofluorescence [IF] has the advantage at this stage in
an investigation in that one can be very severe on controls to rule
out false positives, assess background fluorescence, and one can also
find out exactly where in the cells or where in the intercellular
material reagents are attaching. These attachment patterns are
significant.

I have done some indirect IF work myself and no, sorry, I can't do the
work; it would be fascinating. Previous commitments. But this could
quickly clear up quite a few issues.

[Dr Brown's previous (28 Mar 2009) contribution included a
recommendation to collect, label, freeze and store 500 ml of the 1st
colostrum of all cows on affected farms, while stored serum from the
mother "would be a bonus."

In addition, he made the following comment, which seems to deserve a reminder:
"If BVD-vaccinated herds are involved, there may also be something new
to science. Antibodies derived from BVD vaccine and bluetongue
antibodies present in colostrum may fix together in individual cells
in calves of certain genetic make ups, thus provoking an autoimmune
response. This might take 2-3 weeks to appear clinically. The fact
that a herd is not vaccinated against BT does not mean it has not been
field challenged, and, therefore, if only one BVD vaccine is involved,
this would be worth following carefully, and the vaccine manufacturer
may take interest. The stored colostrum could be useful for following
up this line of enquiry.

Thus, a treatment, apart from doing nothing ([which is] reasonable) is
steroid (high dose, long acting, and so only one needle for 4-plus
days), antibiotic cover (high dose, long acting), and possibly a
single blood transfusion, probably not from the mother but from a cow,
which has not had a "bleeding" calf.

Interestingly, we recently treated a one-off "bleeding"
4-month-plus-old calf here with steroid, Vit K, and an antibiotic, and
it worked, but we may well be dealing with something different. The
blood picture showed poor bone marrow response to anemia of unknown
cause. Otherwise, this is still a mystery."

Our request for information about the presence -- or absence -- of the
syndrome in other European countries, in particular those applying the
said vaccines, is hereby repeated. - Mod.AS]
