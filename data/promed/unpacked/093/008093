Epidemiological comments: This is the 1st detection of _Leishmania_ in Iceland. The incident was reported to the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority on 14 Jan [2020]. The infected dog was imported from Spain in 2018. It has been used for breeding of 4 bitches. The vector for _Leishmania_ (sand flies) does not exist in the country, but due to the possibility of veneral and vertical transmission, restrictions regarding mating have been instructed for the infected and potentially infected dogs. Samples have been taken from 2 bitches that have aborted or shown other symptoms. Results from analyses of those samples are pending.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

["Leishmaniosis is a parasitic zoonotic disease caused by a protozoan of the genus _Leishmania_. It is an endemic disease in 98 countries including the Mediterranean basin, South America, Asia, Africa, and the United States.

"The microorganism present in the Mediterranean area and particularly in Spain is _Leishmania infantum_. In Spain, the main reservoir is the dog, although the parasite has been detected in other animals such as cats, lagomorphs, rodents, and birds." http://www.stopleishmania.org/leishmaniosis.php

"The prevalence of canine leishmaniosis in the Autonomous Community of Madrid and in most of the Spanish Autonomous Communities is around 7-8%, although there are some Spanish cities where this figure is far exceeded (Cordoba 25%, Malaga 35%, Barcelona 18%). Dogs are at permanent risk of contracting the disease. The proliferation of _Phlebotomus_ due to the climate change increases the number of infected dogs. In the Autonomous Community of Madrid, a surveillance and prevention program for canine leishmaniosis was stablished in 1983.

"The main transmission form is directly from sandfly to dog, although there are recent evidences describing vertical transmission (from bitches to puppies) in dogs and horizontal transmission through sexual contact." http://www.stopleishmania.org/leishmaniosis-dogs.php. - Mod.CRD
