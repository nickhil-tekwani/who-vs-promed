An investigation is underway in Manitowoc County to determine what may have caused 2 confirmed cases of _E. coli_. Results from a 3rd suspected case are expected later this week. Lab tests confirmed the cases reported in March 2013. The _E. coli_ strain has been identified by the Manitowoc County Health Department as O157:H7.

Nurse manager Amy Wergin says the people infected don't know each other, but the strain of _E. coli_ is the same.

"They shop at similar grocery stores, purchase their food at similar places, so it could potentially be linked there," said Wergin.

Health department officials say they don't know the exact origin of the _E. coli_, but they do say that it is unlikely it came from places like restaurants. They say if that were the case, there would be a lot more people sick.

"We will know as soon as there is a disease, because we are directly in the linkage, either through consumer complaints or because of physicians, or because of actual lab tests," said James Blaha, Manitowoc County Health Department health officer.

Health officials would not confirm the location of the _E. coli cases_. Wergin says the investigation continues.

"1st, people can figure out where they got it from so they don't get it again. And secondly, if there is some sort of contamination within the food chain, we want to be able to stop it," said Wergin.

[With only a few cases, it may not be possible to track down the source. In many circumstances, fresh produce, eaten uncooked as in a salad, tends to cause more cases, whereas cases due to undercooked (in a home setting) ground beef may be more sporadic.
