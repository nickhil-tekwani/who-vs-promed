PLANT VIRUS RNA IN GLACIAL ICE (02)

The report [ref. above] should be treated with healthy scepticism. Earlier
papers by the same authors might indicate that the source of ToMV was the
rinsing water for the plastic centrifuge tubes. Polar Biology is not well
known as a virological journal.

[I agree with Adrian Gibbs' comment. In my own comments on the story that
was posted, I indicated that this report needed to be confirmed. Whether
others will attempt to confirm the story remains to be seen; from the
description of the research in Polar Biology, it looks like it would be a
herculean task. - Mod.DH]
