The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating a fatal case of _Vibrio vulnificus_ infection involving an 80 year old man with chronic illness. The man developed fever and symptoms of vomiting, neck pain, and right facial swelling on 30 Sep 2012. He was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital the following day and was noted as having facial bruises and swelling around his right eye. His condition later deteriorated and he passed away on 2 Oct 2012. His blood specimen taken during admission cultured positive for _Vibrio vulnificus_. The CHP's investigation revealed that the man was injured by a crab on 30 Sep 2012.

The public is reminded to adopt the following measures to prevent _V. vulnificus_ infection:
- avoid exposure of open wounds or broken skin to seawater or salty water;
- wounds should be thoroughly cleaned and properly covered;
- wear thick rubber gloves when handling raw shellfish;
- cook seafood, especially shellfish (such as oysters, clams, and mussels) thoroughly; and
- for shellfish, boil until the shells open and avoid cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food with raw seafood.

Patients should seek medical advice promptly if they develop symptoms and signs of infection such as increasing redness, pain, and swelling.

[A discussion of the disease in humans can be found in ProMED-mail posting "Vibrio vulnificus, salt water exposure - USA (TX) 20070719.2317." There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
