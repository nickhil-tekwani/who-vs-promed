Ebolavirus is one of the most aggressive viruses known to date because it kills rapidly. The Liberia government on Tuesday [8 Apr 2014] in Monrovia said the number of people afflicted with the Ebola virus disease has risen to 18, of which 11 people have died.

The Liberian minister of health, Walter Gwenigale, decried the situation and warned Liberians to take the it seriously, saying it is no joke at all as the Ebola epidemic is aggressive. Mr Gwenigale said that the number of Ebola cases in the country had risen to the latest figure [18] from 14 last week.

He said 8 deaths were recorded in Foya, Lofa County, near Guinea, from where the virus entered the country. He also noted that the other 3 deaths took place in Montserrado County in the capital, Monrovia, one in Margibi County, and one in north eastern Nimba County, where a hunter was reported to have died of the disease. The minister said Ebola usually leaves little time for treatment to save a sick individual.

WHO and partners scale up the response to the Ebola outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
According to the latest figures, 157 people, including 101 deaths, have been infected with the Ebola virus disease in Guinea. As of today [9 Apr 2014], 66 cases have been confirmed by laboratory analysis -- 8 patients in Guinea have so far recovered.

To strengthen contact tracing in Conakry, the World Health Organization (WHO) organized an intensive training today for a 1st group of 70 trainees. They will go into the communities to follow up on specific persons who had close contacts with patients with a confirmed Ebola infection. Training for health workers on infection control has started yesterday [8 Apr 2014] in different departments of the Donka national teaching hospital [Conakry] and will also take place in other health facilities in coming days.

Simultaneously, WHO is setting up an operation centre for alert and response within the Guinean Ministry of Health (MoH) in order to centralize the coordination of all activities linked to detection, search, transportation, hospitalisation, and burial of suspect cases. WHO clinicians continue to support Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and MoH in providing clinical management at Donka isolation ward.

Spread across 6 districts of the country including Conakry, this Ebola outbreak represents a particular challenge that requires the mobilization of different resources from national and international partners to put in place the necessary response measures. WHO has more than 50 people on the ground supporting the Ministry of Health and other partners to provide clinical management of patients, contact tracing, disease surveillance, laboratory work, logistics, as well as information-sharing and social mobilization and communication.

New outbreak management software developed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is presently being updated with data from the field, and will soon be used as the primary database tool by all partners. The CDC software package Epi-Info aggregates various types of outbreak data into a single database that produces statistical and visual reports on the outbreak.

Raising awareness of the risk factors for infection and the protective measures that should be taken is the only way to stop transmission and subsequent deaths. Close unprotected physical contact with Ebola patients should be avoided and those who have died from the disease should be promptly and safely buried.

[5] Mapping tools

Mapping in a crisis: online army helps map Guinea's Ebola outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------------
Health workers responding to an Ebola outbreak in Guinea had no maps to go on, so they turned to the internet for help.

When doctors working for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) arrived in the West African nation of Guinea last month [March 2014] to combat an outbreak of the deadly Ebola haemorrhagic fever, they found themselves working in an information vacuum. Accurate maps are crucial to pinpointing the source of the Ebola virus and preventing it from spreading. But the only maps in Guinea were topographic charts -- useless for understanding population distribution. Desperate for information, they enlisted an online army to help. MSF asked a digital mapping organisation called Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to build them a map of Gueckedou, a city of around 250 000 people in southern Guinea, where the outbreak is concentrated.

As of 31 Mar 2014, online maps of Gueckedou were virtually non-existent, says Sylvie de Laborderie of cartONG, a mapping NGO that is working with MSF to coordinate the effort with HOT. "The map showed 2 roads maybe -- nothing, nothing." Within 12 hours of contacting the online group, Gueckedou's digital maps had exploded into life. Nearly 200 volunteers from around the world added 100 000 buildings based on satellite imagery of the area, including other nearby population centres. "It was amazing, incredible. I have no words to describe it. In less than 20 hours they mapped 3 cities," says de Laborderie.

Mathieu Soupart, who leads technical support for MSF operations, says his organisation started using the maps right away to pinpoint where infected people were coming from and work out how the virus, which had killed 95 people in Guinea when New Scientist went to press, is spreading. "Having very detailed maps with most of the buildings is very important, especially when working door to door, house by house," he says. The maps also let MSF chase down rumours of infection in surrounding hamlets, allowing them to find their way through unfamiliar terrain.

MSF now has up-to-date maps of the whole area. Workers are each given an A4 printout of a specific area to canvass door to door, surveying inhabitants and searching for signs of the disease. The pages can then be assembled into a larger map to provide the big picture.

Mikel Maron, co-founder of HOT, says the firm's work with the American Red Cross in response to typhoon Haiyan showed aid organisations the potential for digital mapping. De Laboradorie agrees. "After the typhoon in the Philippines we got very, very interested by GIS [geographic information system software] and maps in order to support their operation," she says. "The places that are among the most vulnerable to contagious disease outbreaks are also the least mapped," says Maron. "We have real potential to help decrease that vulnerability."

Information on each Ebola case is also being added to the maps built by HOT. While the new maps are available for anyone to use online via OpenStreetMaps (OSM), the case information won't be uploaded to the public OSM map of the city, due to its sensitive nature. But it will help MSF efforts to identify the outbreak's patient zero -- and hence where the Ebola outbreak originated.

The global nature of the mapping effort is stunning, says de Laborderie. "When you are going to sleep at the end of the day, another part of the world is mapping."

Mapping tools and the epidemiological software described above are crucial for rapid analysis of the huge amount of incoming data. - Mod.JW]
