Despite the much-publicized intense immunisation drive carried out in
15 districts, [Japanese encephalitis (JE)] virus is wreaking havoc in
the endemic pockets of Purvanchal. Nearly 324 patents suspected to be
suffering from JE [virus infection] have been admitted to the BRD
Medical College, Gorakhpur, and the number of casualties in the wards
has reached 76. Amidst rising concern among the local populace, the
authorities claim that only 6 have died due to JE [virus infection].

Talking to the Times of India (TOI) on Tuesday [22 Jul 2008] the
director, medical and health, Dr. I Srivastava, said that the
casualties have come down remarkably this time and barring the 6
victims, the rest of the deaths were caused by an acute encephalitis
syndrome (AES) which, he said, was different from JE.

A team of medical experts has been dispatched from Lucknow and a team
from Delhi is also [there], he assured, as he added there was nothing
to worry about this year [2008].

Dr. L.P. Rawat, additional director, health, Gorakhpur division, said
that since 1 Jan 2008 till Monday [21 Jul 2008], 324 patients of acute
encephalitis syndrome from Basti and Gorakhpur division were admitted
to Nehru Chkitsalaya in the medical college, and 71 among them died
during the treatment.

Dr. Rawat also said that out of the serum of 235 patients tested in
the virology lab Gorakhpur, JE [antibody? virus or virus sequences? -
Mod.TY] was found only in 11 samples.

The fine distinction between JE and AES has only added to the
confusion among the lay person. Dr. KR Mathur, head of department of
pathology and microbiology at the BRD Medical College claims that "in
2005, when the death toll had reached 2000, 68 percent were found to
be JE positive."

In 2006-2007, the number was reduced to 6 percent but incidence of
water-borne virus enteroviruses, especially Coxsackie [viruses], shot
up.

"This year the situation is entirely different," said Dr. Mathur. JE
positive cases are confined to 4 percent, but a new virus seems to
have hit the pocket..." he claimed.

And now, even as the government struggles to come to grips with the
situation that has set alarm bells ringing in the endemic area is
the realisation that the actual JE season will begin only in August.

This year [2008] the monsoon arrived early, says professor of
paediatrics Dr. KP Kushwaha. Talking to the TOI, he expressed
apprehension that ther JE attack could be severe when the paddy [rice]
crop gets ready and mosquitoes find their ideal breeding place in the
inundated fields by August and September.

[The classification of these encephalitis cases as acute encephalitis
syndrome is too nonspecific to determine which pathogenic agent might
be involved. This situation again underscores the need for timely
laboratory support to establish the cause of the illness. ProMED
would appreciate receiving additional information concerning this
outbreak.

The above newswire is vague in its discussion of the actual disease
processes). Given the limited descriptions, one can speculate that
they may be dealing with a variety of viruses here. The discussion of
acute encephalitis syndrome as different from JE is curious. One
wonders if they are referring to Nipah or Chandipura viruses..? In
addition to viruses, the acute encephalitis syndrome may be
attributible to a parasitic infection such as seen with cerebral
malaria, or even some bacterial infections such as meningitis.
Clearly more information would be helpful in trying to decipher what
is going on. - Mod MPP.]
