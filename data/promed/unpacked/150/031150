[There is a correction of this report: Influenza (29): WHO global update, Asia, America, Europe, corr. 20191105.6761372
In item [3] below, the article on US influenza activity incorrectly states that "4 pediatric flu deaths were reported to the CDC in the week ending 26 Oct 2019, for a total of 6 pediatric flu deaths in the 2019-20 season." However, all 4 of those deaths occurred in March of 2019, as part of the 2018-2019 flu season (https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/PedFluDeath.html). We apologize for reproducing the mistake in error. - Mod.UBA]

Update number 353 (based on data up to 13 Oct 2019)
---------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at interseasonal levels in most countries. However, influenza activity continued to increase across the countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
- In the Caribbean and tropical South American countries, influenza activity was low overall. In Central American countries, influenza activity increased in El Salvador and Nicaragua.
- In tropical Africa, increased influenza activity was reported from Western Africa.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity increased in Laos and the Philippines in recent weeks.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was low in most countries, although influenza B virus detections continued to be reported in Chile.

Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses continued to account for the majority of detections, although the proportion of influenza B viruses increased in recent weeks.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 103 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from [30 Sep 2019 to 13 Oct 2019] (data as of 25 Oct 2019 04:07:37 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 102 881 specimens during that time period. A total of 5005 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 3030 (60.5%) were typed as influenza A and 1975 (39.5%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 595 (35.6%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1076 (64.4%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 71 (14.1%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 433 (85.9%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2020 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on [23-26 Sep 2019] in Geneva, Switzerland. It was recommended that trivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/South Australia/34/2019 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Washington/02/2019-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. It was also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus.

The state's swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] death toll soared to 239 after 8 casualties were reported in the past 20 days. There has been a perceptible increase in the swine flu fatality rate this year [2019], as the state recorded 216 swine flu deaths during the same period last year [2018]. The state health department's latest report revealed that Pune recorded the maximum 52 deaths.

Experts said the swine flu virus transmission was likely to rise further as persistent rainfall led to a drop in temperature, providing a conducive atmosphere for the virus to grow and spread. "Some of the H1N1 casualties reported this month [October 2019] had actually occurred last month [September 2019]. But they were reported to the state's centralized system in October [2019]," a state health official said. The state recorded 2259 cases of swine flu this year [2019] so far.

Mumbai recorded 642 cases, followed by Nagpur (375), Nashik (328), Thane (129) and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits (173). The maximum swine flu casualties (52) were recorded within the PMC limits. Nagpur recorded 44 deaths, followed by Nashik (39) and Kolhapur (22). Mumbai recorded a total of 30 deaths.

"Assessment of patients who succumbed to swine flu-induced complications showed that delay in treatment was one of the main reasons for complications and deaths. We have told medical practitioners to administer oseltamivir to patients with comorbid conditions within 24 hours," Subhash Salunkhe, a senior public health expert, who is also head of the state's technical committee on communicable diseases, said.

Infectious diseases expert Sudhir Patsute, who is in charge of the PMC-run Naidu Hospital and a member of various state-run committees on swine flu, said, "Infected patients with underlying medical conditions are most at risk of developing complications."

As US flu activity slightly increases, 4 pediatric flu deaths were reported in the week ending [26 Oct 2019], according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [CDC's] most recent FluView report.

Five things to know:
1. Four pediatric flu deaths were reported to CDC in the week ending [26 Oct 2019] for a total of 6 pediatric flu deaths in the 2019-2020 season.
2. The percentage of outpatient visits for flulike illness was 1.9% for the week ending [26 Oct 2019], remaining below the national baseline of 2.4% but increasing from 1.7% at the end of last week.
3. Nationally, flu activity is similar to recent previous seasons at the same time, but Louisiana and Puerto Rico both continue to experience high levels of flulike illness.
4. Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia experienced low flu activity. The remaining states, except for Louisiana, experienced minimal activity.
5. CDC confirmed 141 positive respiratory specimens for influenza A and 287 positive specimens for influenza B in the week ending [26 Oct 2019]. The agency has confirmed 2130 positive specimens since [29 Sep 2019].

Influenza-associated mortality in hospital care: a retrospective cohort study of risk factors and impact of oseltamivir in an English teaching hospital, 2016 to 2017. Euro Surveill 2019;24:pii=1900087. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.44.1900087

Abstract
--------
Background: Evidence of an oseltamivir treatment effect on influenza A(H3N2) virus infections in hospitalised patients is incomplete.

Aims: This cohort study aimed to evaluate risk factors for death among PCR-confirmed hospitalised cases of seasonal influenza A(H3N2) of all ages and the impact of oseltamivir.

Methods: Participants included all 332 PCR-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) cases diagnosed between [30 Aug 2016] and [17 Mar 2017] in an English university teaching hospital. Oseltamivir treatment effect on odds of inpatient death was assessed by backward stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Results: The odds of death were reduced by two-thirds [odds ratio (OR), 0.32;  95% confidence interval (CI),  0.11-0.93] in inpatients treated with a standard course of oseltamivir 75  mg 2 times daily for 5  days compared with those untreated with oseltamivir, after adjustment for age, sex, current excess alcohol intake, receipt of 2016/17 seasonal influenza vaccine, serum haemoglobin and hospital vs community attribution of acquisition of influenza.

Conclusions: Oseltamivir treatment given according to National Institutes of Clinical Excellence (NICE); US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines was shown to be effective in reducing the odds of mortality in inpatients with PCR-confirmed seasonal influenza A(H3N2) after adjustment in a busy routine English hospital setting. Our results highlight the importance of hospitals complying with relevant guidelines for prompt seasonal influenza PCR testing and ensuring standard oseltamivir treatment to all PCR-confirmed cases of seasonal influenza.
