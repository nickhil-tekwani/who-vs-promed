Utah health authorities were investigating what triggered an _E. coli_ outbreak in a mostly-polygamous community on the Utah-Arizona border after the bacteria killed 2 children and sickened 4 others. Early indications suggest the E. coli may be linked to contaminated food or exposure to animals - not the town of Hildale's water supply, said David Heaton, spokesman for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department. He said it appears isolated to one neighborhood.

Officials believe the illness may have come from animal exposure or food poisoning, but the health department is also looking at the water supply, Heaton told CBS Salt Lake City station KUTV. Their biggest concern is to make sure the _E. coli_ doesn't spread, he said.

Heaton said he can't release the names or ages of the deceased children, or say if they are related, due to privacy concerns. He said they died in the past 2 weeks after getting hemolytic uremic syndrome, also known as HUS, which causes kidney damage.

E. coli is a bacterium that can cause diarrheal illness, said Dr David Blodgett, a Southwest Utah Public Health Department health officer.

"Some of the cases in this outbreak have been identified as the O157:H7 strain, characterized by bloody diarrhea and serious complications. Our thoughts and sympathies are with the families who have been affected," Blodgett said. About 5 to 10 percent of people diagnosed with _E. coli_ O157 infection develop a potentially life-threatening complication that can lead to kidney failure, according to the CDC.

Utah Department of Health spokeswoman Jenny Johnson said deaths from _E. coli_ are pretty rare with an average of only one person a year dying from the illness in Utah, a state of about 3 million people. There are 80 to 100 cases per year in Utah of a strain of _E. coli_ that have a toxin called Shiga that makes people sick, Johnson said.

The sister towns of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona, are home to a polygamous group known as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It is a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, which disavowed polygamy more than 100 years ago.

Disease-causing strains of _E. coli_ are typically found in human and animal waste.

[Now a total of 6 cases are reported. Since less than 10 percent of EHEC statistically develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, it is likely that more cases have occurred. Most of the deaths associated with HUS are associated with central nervous system complications such as seizures, mental status changes and stroke. - Mod.LL
