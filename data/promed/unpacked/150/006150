An additional event of a bluetongue-like disease has been observed during
the recent weeks in the dairy cattle herd of Kalya. It affected dozens of
cows and several calves. The main symptoms were erythema, congested
conjunctivae and hyperemia, nasal and lips redness, fever, redness and
edema of the corona, reduced milk production, and in some cases slight
diarrhea. Blood samples, sent to the Kimron Veterinary Institute, were
found PCR positive for bluetongue. The identification of the serotype is to
be carried out abroad, in anticipation of an early reply. In case this is
another BTV-8 case, this may have an impact upon the situation in several
other regions during the summer season. A BTV-8 vaccine is available in Europe.

As yet, no serotyping results of the BT virus isolated from the outbreak in
Kalya have been obtained. The clinical event occurred 2 months ago. The
serotyping is required in order to achieve timely decisions on vaccination;
vaccines may be acquired in Europe.

The outbreak of BTV-8 in Rosh Haniqra dairy cattle farm last autumn [2008]
is estimated to have caused losses of about 300 000 Israeli Shekels [about
USD 76 000].

The origin of the virus introduction into Israel is unknown; according to a
fresh ProMED-mail report from the reference laboratory in the UK, the BTV-8
in Rosh Haniqra is very similar or identical to the European strain.

["Hachaklait" is the country-wide Mutual Society for Clinical Veterinary
Services in Israel. It provides its services to nearly 90 per cent of
Israel's dairy cattle industry. As an integral part of this service, every
attending practitioner pays at least one weekly visit to each farm within
his/her practice and is available, free of additional charge, for visits in
emergency situations. The Chief Veterinarian of Hachaklait circulates a
weekly report to all practitioners and to a distribution list, including
professionals and stake-holders. The report is also available on the
Society's website.

Kalya (also called Nahal Kalya; an Israeli settlement), one of the dairy
operations served by "Hachaklait", is situated on the northern tip of the
Dead Sea, a few kms from the Jordanian border; see map at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?name=Na%E1%BA%96al%20Kalya,%20West%20Bank,%20Palestinian%20Territory&g=282602&v=31.767,35.5,5>.

Vaccination of Israel's dairy cattle, prior to the 2009 season with an
inactivated BTV-8 vaccine deserves consideration following the outbreak in
Rosh Haniqra (map in the OIE notification at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8148>)
independently of the serotyping of the Kalya outbreak.

Early serotyping of bluetongue and other orbiviruses (such as epizootic
haemorrhagic disease and equine encephalosis) is of high importance in
Israel in view of the susceptibility of Israel's hyper-intensive, record
milk-yielding dairy industry. Throughout decades, the Kimron Veterinary
Institute, Israel's national veterinary laboratory, possessed the capacity
of isolating, identifying, and serotyping bluetongue isolates. This
capacity was demonstrated when new BTV serotypes penetrated for the 1st
time (such as serotypes 2, 6, 10). Regaining this capacity deserves serious
consideration in particular since new orbiviruses seem to be emerging in
Israel and the region at a steadily increasing pace.

The serotyping results of the Kalya samples, sent to Pirbright on 11 Jun
2009, are anticipated soon. - Mod.AS]
