Turkey has been hit by a seasonal flu, with many people hospitalized due to influenza A caused by the H3N2 virus, according to reports.

The pediatric emergency services in Istanbul hospitals have been inundated by parents in the past few days, as children have been affected more than adults. Fever, coughs, headaches and nasal congestion are the most typical signs of the flu.

Doctor Fulya Gurkan, who works in a private hospital in Bursa province, said almost 80 per cent of flu cases had the H3N2 virus this year [2013-2014 season?]. She said this year's flu was different from swine flu, which was also seen in Turkey and spread with the H1N1 flu, according to Cihan news agency.

The H3N2 virus can be fatal as it can lead to other lung diseases such as pneumonia, said Gurkan, adding that antibiotics mostly do not work in such cases. "Antibiotics have no influence in the treatment. Antiviral treatment must start within the 1st 48 hours. If any bacterial infection is added to the flu then doctors might start antibiotic treatment," she said.

[In contrast to North America, influenza A(H3N2) virus predominates in Northern Europe (see EuroFlu Weekly Electronic Bulletin. Week 52: 23/12/2013-29/12/2013, 3 Jan 2014, issue no. 511 at http://www.euroflu.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi). It is currently the main virus circulating in Turkey.
