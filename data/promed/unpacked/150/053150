Botulism, wound, drug-related - UK (England) not yet archived

Date: Thu, 18 May 2000 00:21:57 -0500
From: Wilsnack, Richard <wilsnack@badlands.nodak.edu>

Given that many of the victims in Scotland may have died after
intramuscular injections, the statement that "tests for infection have so
far proved negative" did not make clear whether the investigators in
Scotland had ruled out any risks from _Clostridium botulinum_. Wound
botulism has been observed more frequently recently in the Western US,
among injectors of Mexican "black tar" heroin; however, it has also been
reported this year among IV drug users in Switzerland.
Some recent references on this emergent problem among IV drug users:
1. Passaro DJ, Werner SB, McGee J, MacKenzie WR, & Vugia DJ, "Wound
botulism associated with black tar heroin among injecting drug users,"
JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 279: 11 (March 18, 1998),
859-863.

black tar heroin," ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE, 4: 8 (August 1997), 805-809.

wound botulism. A report," ERVENARZT, 71: 2 (February 2000), 130-133.

[A similar point was made in an earlier posting. Dr Ahmed told me that they
were revisiting the samples already taken to check for clostridial
infections. Until the Glasgow authorities release their findings on the
dead and living patients, we are in the dark. - Mod.MHJ
