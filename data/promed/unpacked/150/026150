17 students from Govt Dental College down with Hepatitis A
----------------------------------------------------------
Around 17 students staying at the Government Dental College Hostel at
CST [Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus have been suffering from hepatitis
A [virus infection] in the last few days, due to contaminated water
being supplied to the building. The college administration has put up
notices at various places and has advised the students to leave the
hostel and go home for the next few days.

Dr Gajanan Tirpe, a 3rd year dental student said that he started
suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting about 10 days ago. He went to
the nearby St. George's Hospital for treatment. "They did various
tests on me and told me that I was suffering from hepatitis A [virus
infection] that happens due to contaminated water," he said.

In the next few days, some more students started suffering from the
same symptoms and many of them were admitted to the hospital for
treatment. "It was at this point that we realised that there was an
outbreak of hepatitis A in the hostel and it was affecting a large
number of students," Dr Tirpe said.

The administration was immediately informed about the situation. They
told the students that they will have to leave the hostel until they
take some emergency steps. Students who have houses in the city and
nearby areas vacated the hostel, which now wears a deserted look.
Even the college canteen had to been closed for several days, and was
opened only on Monday [5 Apr 2010].

When asked about the problem, Dr M G Pawar, dean of Government Dental
College admitted that there have been some cases of hepatitis A in
the hostel in the last few days. "We are trying to clean up the water
storage tank that is located on the terrace and also making efforts
to locate the source of contamination," he said.

Meanwhile, students said that not enough is being done by the
administration to ensure that they get clean drinking water even on a
regular basis. "There are not enough water filters available in the
hostel, even though there are more than 200 students staying there on
a regular basis," one student said.

It was only after the outbreak of hepatitis that the college
authorities have woken up and are trying to install more water
filters in the building. "There was another water filter located on
the 1st floor, but this has been out of order for a long time and no
effort was made to repair this," a student said.

A senior doctor from the college revealed that the outbreak of this
disease has also resulted in some of the exams being postponed
indefinitely. "There were some internal exams to be held in the 1st
week of April, but this will be done only after the issue is sorted
out," he pointed out. The college dean assured that he will take all
steps to ensure that students do not fall sick due to any kind of
water contamination.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus.
The virus is spread by faecal-oral transmission. The disease is
closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal
hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not
cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause
debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in
epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences.
Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with
sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. Casual contact
among people does not spread the virus. In developing countries, and
regions where sanitary conditions are variable, children escape
infection in early childhood. Paradoxically improved economic and
sanitary conditions may lead to higher disease rates, as infections
occur in older age groups.

The dependence of the Mumbai Medical College on filtration of water
supplies from a storage tank within the building suggests
inadequacies in the general supply of clean water in Mumbai.
