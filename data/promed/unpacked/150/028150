We wish to thank the moderator and Dr Marcus for their comments. We also wish to provide the following clarification:

It deserves emphasis that the absence of a history of honey ingestion does not exclude the possibility of infant botulism (IB). In fact, the vast majority of USA IB cases have never ingested honey. Nonetheless, it remains true that honey is the one identified, avoidable source of _Clostridium botulinum_ spores and hence should not be fed to infants.

Most patients who contract infant botulism probably do so by inhaling and swallowing airborne _C. botulinum_ spores which are common in dust and soils. In Argentina, _C. botulinum_ spores were more prevalent in bulk chamomile than in retail tea bags (Moderator's ref. 1). In the USA, there are no reports of _C. botulinum_ being isolated from chamomile.
