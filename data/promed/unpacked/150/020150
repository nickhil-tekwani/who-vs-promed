Joint epidemiological investigation linking Newcastle disease in England
and France
-----------------------------------------------------
On 15 Jul 2005, the UK confirmed an outbreak of Newcastle disease (ND) in
pheasants on a premises in Surrey. Initial investigations identified 2
possible sources of the infection. The birds had been imported from France,
and so it was possible that they had 1st become infected there. The 2nd
possibility was that the pheasants had been infected once they had arrived
in England from contact with wild birds. It is known that wild birds can
carry the virus responsible for ND.
The UK contacted the French authorities who immediately began a thorough
investigation. There was a rapid exchange of information concerning the
movement of birds between France and the infected premise in England. The
EU's TRACES notification system provided information on the movement of
birds between France and the UK. The French authorities identified a number
of farms that had supplied birds to the infected farm. They undertook
active surveillance and sampling which has now allowed them to conclude by
blood sampling that birds on one farm have been exposed to the ND virus in
the Loire Atlantique "Departement" of France. Although virus isolation
results are not yet available, the French authorities have taken decisive
action to control the disease and have reported the incident to both the EU
Members States and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) today [19
Jul 2005].
The Loire Atlantique farm concerned is a large game bird farm keeping
pheasants and partridges. The source of infection for this farm has yet to
be identified. There is a lake close to the farm where migratory birds are
found. That is the most likely source of infection. There have been no
consignments to or from the farm since 1 Jun 2005, except the one
consignment of pheasants sent to England on 22 Jun 2005.
Full control measures, as required by EU law, have been taken by the UK and
French authorities. Action has been taken to cull the affected birds.
Although any outbreak of ND is unwelcome and causes financial loss to our
poultry industries, this is a good example of close cooperation between the
veterinary authorities in the 2 countries. The rapid exchange of
information has allowed the source of infection to be identified quickly.
Collaboration between the authorities and diagnostic laboratories will
continue to confirm the link between the 2 premises.
This statement is issued jointly by the chief veterinary officer of DEFRA
and the French chief veterinary officer: "All countries are at constant
risk of outbreaks of ND due to the reservoir of infection that exists in
wild birds. The industries already take precautions including good
Biosecurity and vaccination to minimize the risk of disease. However,
outbreaks will occur, and when they do, it is important that all concerned,
officials and industry, cooperate and act decisively to contain and control
the disease. This investigation is a good example of such cooperation
between Member States which has quickly resulted in identification of the
linked infected premises.
However, investigations in both countries must continue, as further cases
could occur linked to the 2 current premises. Officials will actively trace
movements of birds and people and carry out surveillance around the known
cases. Keepers of poultry and game birds should remain vigilant. They
should report any suspicion of disease, maintain high standards of
Biosecurity and consult their veterinary advisers about vaccination."
