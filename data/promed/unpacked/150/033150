CDC is collaborating with 22 state health departments in an ongoing investigation of an outbreak of human _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- infections associated with exposure to rodents sold as food for pet reptiles and amphibians (i.e., feeder rodents). This outbreak strain also was implicated in a 2009 outbreak in the UK and a 2010 outbreak in the USA, both linked to frozen feeder rodents from a single USA supplier, resulting in recalls (1,2).

During 29 Aug 2011– 2 Feb 2012, a total of 46 cases of human _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- infection were reported in 22 states. The median patient age was 11 years (range: less than 1–69 years); 37 percent were aged 5 years old or less, and 52 percent were male. Of the 27 patients interviewed, 6 (22 percent) reported hospitalization, 20 (74 percent) reported reptile or amphibian exposures, and 15 (56 percent) reported feeder rodent exposure. For 12 patients who recalled the types of rodent contacted, 5 (42 percent) reported exposure to live rodents, 4 (33 percent) to frozen rodents, and 3 (25 percent) to both live and frozen rodents. 7 (58 percent) patients reported exposure to mice, 2 (17 percent) to rats, 2 (17 percent) to both mice and rats, and 1 (8 percent) was unsure. No patients reported exposure to rodents purchased from the same pet store.

Frozen mice specimens from two North Carolina pet stores where 2 patients purchased feeder rodents yielded the outbreak strain. Tracing the source of these mice has been difficult for investigators because of complex breeder and supplier networks and inadequate records. However, 2 breeders supplying pet stores from which patients had purchased rodents had received mice from the company implicated in the 2009 and 2010 outbreaks. Given the wide distribution of illnesses, rodent suppliers, and pet stores, the outbreak strain might now be endemic in feeder rodents.

The fact that 37 percent of patients were aged 5 years or less supports recommendations that young children avoid exposure to reptiles or amphibians, including in the home (3). Owners of reptiles, amphibians, or other animals that are fed rodents should be aware of the risk for salmonellosis from the animals and live and frozen feeder rodents. Safe handling instructions for all of these animals should be provided at the point of sale.

[The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5], 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5, and 12 (the group B antigens). Paccagnella [author of the 2005 book "Naming Salmonella"]
pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another. As an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. The outbreak organism here, however, is monophasic. Echeita and colleagues (1) have found that this monophasic strain appears to be such due to the absence of the _fljB_ gene, which is involved in the H antigen switching mechanism. According to Paccagnella, around 1903 Smith and Reagh reported on the different behavior of the flagellar and somatic antigens of salmonella strains. Their work was mostly ignored until Weil and Felix, working on _Proteus_ cultures, noted 2 forms, the swarming form called the H form (_mit Hauch_, in English: "with breath") and the non-swarming form, called the O form (_ohne Hauch_, in English: "without breath"). The H form contained both O and H antigens (correctly termed the OH form). These parallels were transposed to the salmonella antigens.

If O antiserum is added to a culture, motility is preserved, whereas if H antiserum is added the culture does not move. Therefore, H antigen was involved with swarming in the agar plate (breathing might have been used to imply the ability to move). (Salmonellae, of course, do not swarm on certain agar plates like _Proteus_ bacteria do.)

In addition to infections related to rodents, foodborne outbreaks related to 4,5, 12:i:- salmonellae have been reported including one in New York City reported in 2002 (2). Additional information about this monophasic organism, which may be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, can be found in references 3-5.
