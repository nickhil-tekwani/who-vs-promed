Brighton mumps outbreak will 'get worse'
----------------------------------------
A top doctor has warned a mumps outbreak is likely to get worse
during the summer holidays. Thousands of holidaymakers and
daytrippers are expected to visit Brighton and Hove as the city's
tourism industry prepares for its busiest time of the year.

The city's director of public health, Tom Scanlon, said it was "more
than likely" the number of mumps cases would go up during the next 8
weeks. He said: "The illness is mainly affecting young people in
their 20s and there are going to be large numbers visiting the city
and going out and socialising. "Unlike measles, which normally
affects schoolchildren and would be likely to show a fall in numbers
in the summer because of the holidays, I would expect to see an
increase when it comes to mumps."

There have been 112 confirmed cases across Sussex [county] so far
this year and numbers are expected to soon pass the 139 recorded for
the whole of 2009. The worst-hit area is Brighton and Hove, which has
had 52 cases so far, almost double the number in 2009. A total of 39
people have been affected in East Sussex, just 3 short of the 42 in
2009. West Sussex has had 21 patients struck down so far, which is
lower than the 70 the year before. However in 2009, there was a large
outbreak of cases at Chichester College [in West sussex], which
skewed the numbers. Cases are affecting both young adults and
teenagers.

The rise in cases has sparked renewed calls for people to make sure
they are vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
vaccine. The take-up rate for the 1st of 2 recommended MMR jabs in
Brighton and Hove is currently 82 percent but the percentage having
two doses is 69 percent. This is well below the 90 percent the World
Health Organisation says needs to be vaccinated to protect a
community. Take-up rates are higher in East and West Sussex but there
is still room for improvement.

Dr Scanlon said: "It certainly seems as if the numbers of mumps cases
are actually spreading around Sussex and not just Brighton and Hove
and that is concerning. "This is a potentially very serious disease
and I would urge all those eligible to get vaccinated as soon as
possible." Those affected are mainly young adults. This may be
because the MMR vaccine was not available when they were small.
Others may not have had the jab [injection] because of concerns about
research published in the late 1990s, which suggested a link with
autism. This [research] has since been discredited. In most cases
mumps is mild but it can cause serious complications, particularly
for men, including sterility, an inflammation of the pancreas,
deafness and viral meningitis.
