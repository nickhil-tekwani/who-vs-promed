On 27 Mar 2022 the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI), subtype H5N1, in a poultry flock in southern Ontario.

To control any potential spread of the disease, the CFIA has placed the premises under quarantine and is establishing movement control measures and recommending enhanced biosecurity for other farms within the area.

AI is spreading in wild bird populations across the globe and presents a significant national concern as birds migrate to Canada. The CFIA continues to remind anyone with poultry or other susceptible birds to practice good biosecurity habits to protect them from infectious animal diseases.

Animal health officials confirmed Saturday afternoon [26 Mar 2022] that a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza has been detected in 2 Minnesota flocks, making it the 14th state since the start of 2022 to detect outbreaks.

The virus, also known as the bird flu, does not pose an immediate threat to the public, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since the start of 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed avian flu flock outbreaks in the Carolinas, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Virginia and Wisconsin.

According to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, the highly contagious H5N1 strain was confirmed Friday [25 Mar 2022] in poultry flocks in Mower and Meeker counties by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa, KARE [https://bit.ly/3IwxbOk] reported.

"Poultry producers and backyard flock owners need to be on alert and contact their veterinarian immediately if they see any changes in their flocks," Dr. Dale Lauer, the board's poultry program director, said in a prepared statement.

"Everyone in poultry facilities needs to follow the site's biosecurity protocols every time to prevent the spread of disease," Lauer added.

Friday's [25 Mar 2022] H5N1 diagnoses mark the 1st time since 2015 bird flu has been reported in Minnesota, WCCO reported.

According to the TV station, a commercial turkey flock in Meeker County reported signs of mortality and depression, while a backyard mixed flock of chickens, ducks and geese in Mower County reported increased mortality.

"Our best hope is that this will simply fly right over us, especially if the Canadian weather cooperates and those migratory birds move on up and over us and don't stop and rest," University of Minnesota Extension Educator Abby Schuft told KARE in a prior interview.

A 2015 U.S. bird flu outbreak led to more than 50 million chickens and turkeys being killed, mostly in Minnesota and Iowa, the TV station reported.

Although human cases of the avian virus are rare, the CDC confirmed the overlap does occur on rare occasions when enough of the virus gets into an individual's eyes, nose or mouth. Humans cannot, however, contract the disease from poultry or eggs which are properly handled and cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit [74 deg C], the USDA said.

According to the CDC, birds contract the flu when they come into contact with the "saliva, nasal secretions or feces" of an infected bird. The flu is considered to be "very contagious among birds" and has the potential to kill certain domesticated species like chickens and turkeys, CBS News reported.

The bird flu virus that decimated poultry flocks in Minnesota 7 years ago [2015] has returned, with state authorities confirming Saturday [26 Mar 2022] they have detected cases in 2 flocks.

The virus was found in a commercial turkey flock in Meeker County and in a backyard flock with a mix of chickens, ducks and geese in Mower County, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health [MBAH].

The H5N1 virus, while highly contagious among birds, poses a low risk for the public or food safety, according to the Centers for Disease Control. No human cases have been detected in the United States.

But Minnesota is the country's largest turkey producer, and news of the outbreak has poultry farmers across the state on edge. They fear a repeat of the 2015 outbreak, when the virus spread over to 100 sites across 23 counties, resulting in the loss of approximately 9 million birds and $650 million in damages, according to state figures.

Dr. Jill Nezworski, a veterinarian who is on the board of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association, said while turkey farmers were "disheartened" by news of the new outbreak, there was also hope that biosecurity measures taken by the industry in the aftermath of the 2015 crisis would help reduce the impact.

She urged all farmers and owners of backyard flocks to do their part to help prevent the spread of the virus.

"This virus is an indiscriminate killer affecting all sizes of farms, from the handful of chickens in a family's backyard to our largest commercial operations. We all need to take the necessary steps to prevent this disease from spreading," Nezworski said in a press conference Saturday [26 Mar 2022].

MBAH executive director Dr. Beth Thompson said the agency and local governments in areas with dense poultry populations had also learned from the 2015 crisis.

"We have a really robust emergency response plan in place because of the lessons learned from the previous experience. We have an incident management team that has already been stood up," Thompson said.

Since 2015, backyard flocks have become more common in Minnesota and across the country with cities and counties passing laws to permit them. Tom Peterson, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, said the state had "cast a wide net" to inform backyard growers of the outbreak and the steps they can take to help contain it.

"The messages I'm getting today from those people having those smaller flocks, they really want to protect them. So they're taking those steps to cover them, limit their exposure to wild birds. And I think they care as much about the birds as a large facility. And so they'll be taking those steps that they can," he said.

The MBAH is urging the owners of flocks of all sizes to review the state's recommended biosecurity measures. Farmers who see possible signs of infection in their flocks, such as a drop in water consumption or an increase in deaths, should immediately contact a veterinarian.

Nezworski also urged the public to show empathy to any poultry farmers they know.

"Biosecurity takes a lot of effort from our farmers. Please give them a break when you interact with them out in the community. Their livelihood is on the line and they're pretty stressed out right now," she said.

Iowa agriculture officials said Saturday [26 Mar 2022] they have confirmed another case of bird flu in a flock of commercial pullet chickens.

The outbreak in Franklin County is the 7th such outbreak found in Iowa this month [March 2022], according to a news release from the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship. The department said the latest case affects about 250 000 birds.

An outbreak in Buena Vista County was found on Wednesday [23 Mar 2022] and will require the killing of nearly 54 000 turkeys. It's the 3rd case of avian influenza in the county, following a [6 Mar 2022] case leading to the killing of nearly 50 000 turkeys and an infection found [17 Mar 2022] resulting in the killing of 5.3 million egg-laying hens. [These cases in Buena Vista County were previously reported in the ProMED post Avian influenza (76): Americas (USA) poultry, HPAI H5N1- 20220326.8702236. - Mod.TG]

Iowa has had one other commercial egg-laying chicken farm affected in Taylor County, which involved 915 000 birds. Two other Iowa cases involved backyard birds. [The Taylor County case was previously reported in the ProMED post Avian influenza (68): Americas (USA) mixed flocks, HPAI: 20220316.8702021. - Mod.TG]

Farms found with the virus must kill and dispose of their flocks because the virus is highly contagious and fatal to domestic birds.

North Dakota officials have discovered bird flu in Kidder County.

The state's 1st confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry since 2015 was found in a non-commercial, backyard chicken flock in Kidder County. The flock was depopulated, and the premises have been quarantined to prevent the spread of the disease.

"It's highly deadly, but it's especially deadly to domestic poultry and turkeys, and so it can be maintained in waterfowl, but it also occasionally gets into those domestic poultry production operations, and it's pretty devastating to those operations," said Charlie Bahnson, wildlife veterinarian for the ND Game and Fish.

According to Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring, North Dakota raises about a million commercial birds and many backyard birds yearly. Avian influenza affects wild birds as well and can be transmitted by contact with infected birds or by the ingestion of infected food and water. Earlier this month [March 2022], South Dakota euthanized 85 000 birds following an outbreak there.

[If possible, keep your flocks inside to protect them from co-mingling with wild birds. And remember you can transport this virus on boots, hands, or even your coveralls. Be sure you are in clean gear before entering your birdhouses, and also blow your nose before entering a poultry house.

Biosecurity of your flock is hugely important in protecting them. It is not just a word, but an action to protect your flocks.

Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies they are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Consequently, please be on alert for the least sign of a bird not feeling well or not eating. Early detection can help limit losses. - Mod.TG
