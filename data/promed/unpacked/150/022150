[1] Cholera - West & Central Africa

A fierce cholera epidemic is spreading through the coastal slums of West Africa, killing hundreds and sickening many more in one of the worst regional outbreaks in years, health experts said. Cholera, transmitted through contact with contaminated feces, was made worse in 2012 by an exceptionally rainy season that flooded the sprawling shantytowns in Freetown and Conakry, the capitals of Sierra Leone and neighboring Guinea.

In both countries, some 2/3 of the population lack toilets and defecate in the open, a potentially lethal threat in the rainy season because of contamination of the water supply. Doctors Without Borders said there had been nearly twice as many cholera cases so far in 2012 as there were in the same period in 2007 in Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Already, about 13 000 people suffering from the disease's often-fatal symptoms -- diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration -- have been treated in those 2 countries, and 250 to 300 have died, Doctors Without Borders said.

In Sierra Leone, the government last week [week of 13 Aug 2012] declared the cholera outbreak a national emergency, while aid workers in Guinea said the peak of the outbreak was not likely to have been reached. Both countries have been wracked by years of civil and political unrest -- with Sierra Leone still recovering from a decade of bloody civil war that drove thousands from rural areas into the city's slums, and Guinea emerging from a half-century of often-brutal dictatorship.

Rains have already contributed to cholera deaths in the landlocked nations of Mali and Niger as well, health officials said.

There have been more than 11 600 cholera cases in Sierra Leone since January 2012, at least 216 of them fatal, according to the country's health minister, Zainab Bangura. In Guinea, there have been 80 deaths out of 2700 cases so far. More than 1000 new cases a week are being recorded in Freetown, health officials said.

In the 14 countries of West and Central Africa, there have been 40 799 cholera cases in 2012, and 846 deaths, with more than half the reported cases originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo. UNICEF said those figures were comparable to the regional totals for 2011, when there were more than 105 000 cases and nearly 3000 deaths. Whereas the 2011 epidemic was focused on the Lake Chad area of Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad, and Niger, in 2012 it is concentrated on the coast.

[2] Cholera - Sierra Leone
Date: Wed 22 Aug 2012

Since the beginning of 2012, Sierra Leone has recorded 11 653 cases of cholera, with 216 deaths (case fatality rate of 1.9 percent). The rate of new cases has accelerated rapidly since the beginning of August 2012: since then, 5706 cases have been recorded, and 2 new districts, Bonthe and Kono, have been affected by the epidemic. 10 of the country's 13 districts are now registering cases and this spread emphasizes the need to rapidly scale up the response. The 2 most heavily affected districts are Western Area and Tonkolili.

WHO is supporting Sierra Leone in the areas of epidemiology, social mobilization and surveillance. WHO has deployed 2 epidemiologists, and 3 cholera experts from Zimbabwe to support coordination, public information, social mobilization, case management and infection control.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Sierra Leone.

An outbreak of cholera in Guinea has killed 60 people since February 2012 and is showing no signs of letting up, the country's health ministry said Thu 23 Aug 2012.

Officials have registered 2054 cases, with the capital Conakry and the southwestern city of Forecariah worst affected. 13 people have died in Conakry and 23 in Forecariah.

Sierra Leone, Mali, and Niger have also been hard hit, with high levels of malnourishment as a result of a drought exacerbating the problem.

The number of cholera cases in Mpulungu has risen to 74 from 68 but no more deaths have been recorded. 1 person had previously died from the deadly water-borne disease.

The Ministry of Health has managed to deliver medical supplies to Mpulungu, while all cholera patients have been isolated to prevent the spread of the disease.

Ministry of Health spokesperson Kamoto Mbewe confirmed the development in an interview yesterday, 22 Aug 2012.

He said Medical Stores has delivered enough medical supplies for cholera treatment and chlorine for disinfecting drinking water. Dr Mbewe said Ministry of Health staff have also been dispatched to Mpulungu to boost health service delivery in the district and help in disinfecting houses and toilets.
