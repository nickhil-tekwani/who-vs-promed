A major outbreak of gastroenteritis in Reunion Island in 2012: First Identification of G12 Rotavirus on the Island. Authors: Caillere N, Vilain P, Brottet E, Kaplon J, Ambert-Balay K, Polycarpe D, Filleul L.

Background
----------
Between August and November 2012 a severe outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred on Reunion Island affecting more than 50 000 cases, particularly young children. Virological analyses showed that the virus responsible for this epidemic was rotavirus. Genotyping of stool samples indicated circulation of rotavirus type G3P[8] but also G12P[8], highlighting the risk of global emergence of this genotype in the coming years.

On Reunion Island, a French overseas administrated territory located in the southwestern Indian Ocean, gastroenteritis outbreaks are usually observed during the austral winter, between the months of August and November. While outbreaks of gastroenteritis had been of moderate severity on the island between 2008 and 2011, an intense epidemic occurred in 2012. Monitoring has been in place for several years involving many professionals and coordinated by the Indian Ocean Regional Office (Cellule de l'InVS en region Ocean Indien: Cire OI) of the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance. This system allowed the detection in mid-August 2012 of an unusual increase in gastroenteritis cases that exceeded seasonal averages and made it possible to inform the public health authorities and the population in a reactive way.

Reunion Island is located in the southwestern Indian Ocean 5900 miles from France and 500 miles from Madagascar, with a population of 830 000 inhabitants in 2012. The population is younger than in mainland France. In 2010, 41 percent of the population was younger than 25 years, and only 11 percent were older than 60 years. Medical facilities are similar to those in France, and there are more than 890 general practitioners and more than 80 pediatricians distributed throughout the island, as well as 4 hospitals and 6 emergency departments.

Gastroenteritis surveillance on Reunion Island is based on different complementary systems:
A syndromic surveillance system is based on all emergency departments (ED) on the island (Organisation de la surveillance coordonnee des urgences (OSCOUR) network). Data are collected daily directly from patients' computerised medical files that are filled in during medical consultations at ED [1-3].

A network of sentinel general practitioners of Reunion Island reports every week the numbers of consultations for acute diarrhoea [1,5]. A case of acute diarrhoea is defined as a patient having more than 3 liquid stools per day during the past 15 days and motivating consultation.

Three sentinel hospital laboratories report to the Cire OI the monthly percentage of samples positive for rotavirus, adenovirus and norovirus to ensure virological surveillance of viral gastroenteritis. In addition, a selection of rotavirus-positive samples was sent, as part of this outbreak investigation in 2012, by the laboratories of the hospitals of Saint-Denis and Saint-Pierre to the National Reference Centre for Enteric Viruses in order to determine the G and P genotypes of rotavirus strains. Genotyping was performed by RT-PCR according to the EuroRotaNet protocol [8-14] and confirmed by sequencing the partial VP7 and VP4 coding genes.

A surveillance of deaths possibly related to gastroenteritis is achieved via monitoring of death certificates received by the Health Agency of the Indian Ocean (Agence de Sante Ocean Indien; ARS OI).

In 2012, an increase in gastroenteritis cases on Reunion Island was detected in week 33 (week starting 13 Aug 2012) by the OSCOUR network (Figure 1). During that same week, the percentage of consultations for acute diarrhoea reported by sentinel practitioners was about 2.1 percent, exceeding the seasonal average of 1.6 percent. Analysis of the data by age showed that children 5 years old and younger were most affected throughout the epidemic period. In fact, 73 percent of ED visits for gastroenteritis were observed among children of this age.

Over the entire outbreak period from week 35 to week 44, nearly 1600 ED visits for gastroenteritis were recorded, and it was estimated that more than 53 500 general practitioner consultations for acute diarrhoea took place on the whole island. Among the ED visits for gastroenteritis, 74 percent were concerning children aged 5 years and younger; 56 percent of them were boys.

The virological surveillance rapidly revealed high rates of samples positive for rotavirus. Retrospective analysis of weekly data showed an increase in this rate at the end of July 2012; the rate exceeded more than 30 percent in week 33 (week starting 13 Aug 2013). The peak was reached in week 36 (1st week of September 2012), with a value of 44 percent. This rate was maintained at a level greater than 35 percent before declining gradually after week 41.

Percentages of samples positive for adenovirus and norovirus were lower (7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, from July to October 2012), suggesting that the outbreak of gastroenteritis was mainly due to the circulation of rotavirus on the island. In December 2012, genotyping of 20 rotavirus-positive samples, randomly selected, was carried out by the National Reference Centre for Enteric Viruses. Four of them were genotype G12P[8], one was a co-infection of genotypes G12, G1 and G3 associated with P, and the 15 others were G3P[8] strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial VP7 coding gene revealed that the G12[8] strains from Reunion Island clustered in lineage III.

During the whole outbreak period, 6 death certificates mentioning gastroenteritis as one of the potential causes of death were identified. Three of them involved children younger than 2 years, and the other 3 were individuals older than 70 years. One child and one elderly person died of dehydration; the other 2 children had underlying medical conditions, and the other 2 elderly people were suffering from comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension.

The surveillance based on networks from different health providers on Reunion Island highlighted an outbreak of gastroenteritis of unusual intensity, which lasted about 10 weeks, extending from late August to early November 2012. This outbreak was characterised by intense circulation of rotavirus and a high proportion of young cases, as well as by its severity, reflected in the occurrence of several deaths. This underlines the importance of not neglecting this risk when such epidemics occur.

This study reports for the 1st time the occurrence of the G and P genotypes of rotavirus strains on Reunion Island and revealed circulation of rotavirus genotype G12 at a significant level (5/20), although the high activity of rotavirus observed on the island does not seem to be the result of a high prevalence of this emerging genotype only. The G12 strains from Reunion Island clustered in lineage III, as previously observed for G12 strains from other European countries and worldwide. According to the National Reference Centre for Enteric Viruses, G12 genotypes circulated with a low prevalence of 3.5 percent during the previous season in mainland France (data not shown), but their emergence as the most prevalent rotavirus genotypes has been recently demonstrated in several regions of the world such as Nepal [15], Spain (Basque Country) [16], Argentina (Tucuman, Catamarca and Rio Gallegos) [17] and Nigeria [18], and we can assume that this genotype could emerge globally in the coming years. The impact of rotavirus G12 is not documented in these countries except in the Spanish study, where it is claimed that the impact of the rotavirus G12 epidemic in the Basque Country was high, with the rate of hospitalisation similar to previous seasons in which rotavirus G1 or G9 were dominant [16].

Efficacy trials of the 2 licensed rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline and RotaTeq, Merck) focused on the rotavirus G genotypes most prevalent across the world, i.e. G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9, and data on their efficacy against rotavirus G12 are very limited. In a recent study, Rotarix vaccine demonstrated efficacy against severe gastroenteritis caused by G12 rotavirus [19]. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that knowledge about vaccine efficacy against the G12 genotype is limited and there is a need for further study. However, in our study conducted in Reunion Island, the G12 genotype was associated with P[8]. Since the P[8] genotype is present in both licensed vaccines, these vaccines should be effective against these G12P[8] strains.

[This report describes an unusually well-documented account of a severe outbreak of gastroenteritis on the Island of Reunion in 2012. This study reports for the 1st time the occurrence of the G and P genotypes of rotavirus strains on Reunion Island and revealed circulation of an emergent rotavirus genotype G12 at a significant level, although the severity of the outbreak does not seem to relate to the presence of this genotype alone. Further detailed analyses will be necessary to understand the epidemiology of rotaviruses-associated gastroenteritis and the efficacy of the deployment of the currently available vaccines.
