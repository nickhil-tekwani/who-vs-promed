The pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, China, continues to attract attention, and the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission and the World Health Organization have issued another announcement recently.

On 11 Jan 2020, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, together with a number of research institutions, announced the genetic sequencing of one of the cases of Wuhan's unknown pneumonia infection. Subsequently, the World Health Organization [WHO] issued an announcement saying that China shared the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus on 12 Jan 2020; this is of great significance for other countries to develop targeted tests.

According to a Wuhan official report of 11 Jan 2020, the 1st death occurred in the pneumonia epidemic. The man purchased goods from the South China seafood market all year round. He was admitted to the hospital due to respiratory failure and severe pneumonia. He also suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease. After treatment, he suffered from multiple illnesses on the evening of 9 Jan 2020 and died of respiratory failure.

Earlier, the China Business Daily quoted the Wuhan Municipal Market Supervision and Administration Bureau as saying that there had been many merchants selling tiger frogs, snakes, hedgehogs, and other animals in the South China seafood market [in Wuhan] during the outbreak. On their part the merchants indicated that game sold on the market included pheasants and snakes.

So far, Wuhan has reported a total of 41 cases of pneumonitis associated with the novel coronavirus infection, 6 of whom have been discharged from hospital, 7 of them are in critical care, and 1 of them died. The remaining patients are in stable condition. All patients received treatment under isolation at designated medical institutions in Wuhan. A total of 763 close contacts have been tracked, 46 medical observations have been lifted, and 717 people are still under medical observation. Among the close contacts, no related disease cases were found.

Xu Shuchang, chair professor of the Department of Respiratory Diseases of the Chinese University of Hong Kong School of Medicine, pointed out to the media that SARS patients were generally hospitalized for about 3 weeks in 2003. This time, the early discharge of Wuhan's patients may be seen as a "good sign", indicating that this infectious disease may be milder than SARS.

[Within the world's animal realm, coronavirus and coronavirus-like infections have been described in swine, cattle, horses, cats, dogs, rats, birds, bats, rabbits, ferrets, minks, and various wildlife species such as palm civets, hedgehogs (ref 1), and spotted hyena, although many coronavirus infections are subclinical or asymptomatic.

As indicated by the Chinese authorities and by WHO, the evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan. The market was closed. So far, no evidence of the animal reservoir has become available. This has, so far, remained a pending hypothesis. It may be assumed that animals from the said market have been sampled and are undergoing testing for potential zoonotic pathogens, in particular the human-infecting novel coronavirus. On top of the above mentioned species, local bats deserve to be tested as well. These animals are known to be regularly found in markets in China, which makes direct transmission of pathogens, such as viruses, from bats to humans likely (ref 2).

Information on investigations addressing the animal-related aspects of the event will be appreciated.

The SARS epidemic (caused by a Co-V) of 2002-2003 started at a Chinese live animal market. The source of the virus seems to have been a palm civet (_Paguma_ sp.), which are sold as food at the local market in Guangdong, but further research showed that the reservoir species were horse-shoe bats (_Rhinolophus_ sp.). So if the reservoir species of a given pathogen is not sold in a particular market, other species may act as intermediary hosts. - Mod.PMB
