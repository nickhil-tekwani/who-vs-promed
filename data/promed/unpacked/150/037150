[The patient] could have been dead in days. The 70-year-old Dunedoo pub owner caught a deadly infection from the mice plaguing NSW [New South Wales], leaving him in hospital with acute kidney failure, liver failure and a leaky heart valve.

[The mouse plague this news article apparently is referring to regards the loss of farm crops due to increasing numbers of mice, which have devastated eastern Australia, from northern parts of Queensland down to South Australia, including New South Wales (see map at https://au.news.yahoo.com/map-reveals-horrifying-extent-of-nightmare-mouse-plague-124402178.html). - Mod.ML]

Leptospirosis is caused by _Leptospira_ bacteria, which [are] found in urine from infected animals, including rats, mice, cattle, pigs and dogs. The bacteria can enter the body through skin cuts or abrasions or through the lining of the mouth, nose, and eyes by exposure to water, soil or mud contaminated with the urine from infected animals.

"I couldn't walk, I'd sweat all night, my kidneys and liver packed it in...it was the sickest I'd ever felt in my life, I wouldn't wish it on anybody," [the patient] told The Daily Telegraph. "All it takes is to have (mice) scurrying around in a shed, grain silo, or a home, they pee everywhere, and you touch it somehow...it knocked me off my feet for weeks. Everybody's doing their bit and battling hard in the bush, we're making sure houses and shops are clean, our guests are OK, but people need to be careful."

In NSW there has been a 700% increase in leptospirosis cases, with 42 confirmed cases since the start of 2021, compared to just 6 last year. Queensland is even worse off, reporting 78 cases of leptospirosis this year, compared with only 41 cases at the same time last year [2020].

Symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches, chills, vomiting and red eyes and can develop about 14 days after becoming infected. "Symptoms can be similar to the flu so often it can be difficult to recognise and can be mistaken for other diseases," Professor Keith McNeil, a spokesman for Queensland Health, said. "Serious disease such as meningitis, kidney failure, bleeding and respiratory complications can develop from leptospirosis infection if it's not treated promptly, so it's important to see your doctor immediately if you suspect you have had exposure to contaminated water, soil or mud, and develop these symptoms within a week or 2. While leptospirosis is treatable with antibiotics, early diagnosis is still the key."

Agriculture workers are most at risk, but people also need to be careful about drinking or swimming in creeks, rivers or lakes contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Waters affected by heavy rain or flooding are especially risky.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Mice, as well as rats, can carry _Leptospira_ in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401/#B12).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar specific. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease (such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever). Canecutter's disease apparently got its name from leptospirosis that occurred among mainly immigrant canecutters in Queensland, Australia in the 1930s; infected canefield rats, present in large numbers during the wet summers of the early 1930s, spread the disease through their urine (see http://libcom.org/history/1934-queensland-canecutters-strike).

Please see Dr Jan Clement's comments in a recent ProMED post (Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) concerning the outbreak of leptospirosis in Queensland, Australia that is also occurring at the same time as the "mouse plague" devastating crops in eastern Australia. He reminds us that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis. The potential for misdiagnosis will not be resolved until routine laboratory tests are done to differentiate them. - Mod.ML
