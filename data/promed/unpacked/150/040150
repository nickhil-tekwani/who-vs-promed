The camel market is one of the largest in the region, with prices at times reaching astronomical figures that exceed millions, and with their own festivals that spread to the rest of the region, but the spread of MERS has deflated camel owners' dreams.

The latest coronavirus crisis and consecutive statements of officials have confused camel owners who have started to wonder whether camels will be like birds when the bird flu spread all over the world. Owners wonder whether camels will be destroyed and burned at the end of the day, especially in light of news about the stopping of the Um Rqaiba festival.

Last week, owners held a meeting in Riyadh to follow up on emerging news in the corona[virus] and camel battle, and called on officials to present proof about the link between coronavirus and camels before taking any action on this issue. The latest outbreak of [MERS] coronavirus in Riyadh, which has the largest number of camels in the kingdom, led to a ban on selling camels as sacrifices during Eid Al-Adha, upon the decision of the Grand Mufti.

Owners in various parts of the kingdom called for the continuation of their annual festival; however, they are still waiting for an official decision that removes all doubts or that reveals a link between the animals and the disease.

Camel prices, especially those prepared for slaughter, have fallen by 50 percent according to camel markets.

Mohammad Al-Minai, an owner in Riyadh, stated that owners are ready to cooperate with authorities to fight the virus that threatens the community, but they haven't received any request from the ministry to test their camels. Owners also demand clear proof that links the virus with camels. He pointed out that through previous dealings with the Ministry of Agriculture, he believes that preparations are weak and that there is an inability to provide such studies. Secretary General of the Saudi Society for Studying Camels Dr. Saeed Basmail said results announced by the Ministry of Agriculture confirm that there is no accurate study that connects camels to corona[virus].

King Saudi University announced the results of a study that was conducted recently, and Basmail said those who did the study were not specialized in the fields of either the virus or camels. He said the main researcher is a member of the faculty in the Zoology Department. Despite the fact the study was published in a scientific journal, he claims the study was not carried out with the appropriate methodology.

[There is a still-accumulating body of evidence that the dromedary camel is a host species for MERS-CoV and that camels play an important role in its transmission to humans, though the infection in camels causes only slight clinical signs or (probably, in most cases) remains sub-clinical.

As an initial response to the MERS outbreak, Saudi Arabia recommended in 2013 and 2014 that persons with conditions placing them at risk of infection or severe outcomes of MERS should postpone their participation in the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Since the suspicions of camel-human transmission have not been ruled out, and in view of the fact that no vaccine for camels or prophylactic therapy in humans are available, the Saudi authorities have intensified the measures addressing exposure of humans to potentially infected/infectious camels. This decision may be seen as an application of the "precautionary principle," a kind of "safety 1st" approach to deal with scientific uncertainty. The precautionary principle was 1st applied to the field of environmental safety, stating that, in the face of uncertain risk and incomplete data, policy-makers should err on the side of restraint. The corollary of the principle states the prominence of health over all other considerations, especially economic. Risk-assessment may be helpful to justify the application of the precautionary principle approach. In case the Saudi decision has been based upon a risk-assessment, its publication is anticipated.

An ad hoc expert group convened by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) concluded in August 2014 that MERS-CoV in camels did not meet the criteria for inclusion as an OIE listed disease, but, because of its public health implications and zoonotic potential, infection in animals must be reported to the OIE as an emerging disease (see at 20140818.2700879).

So far, 4 countries, namely Qatar, Oman, Kuwait ("MERS-CoV") and Iran ("Infection with coronavirus in camels"), have reported to the OIE about the identification of the disease in dromedary camels within their respective boundaries. No such report has been submitted by Saudi Arabia.

OIE's Q&A on MERS-CoV (updated on August 2014) is available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/update-august-2014-questions-answers-on-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov/. - Mod.AS
