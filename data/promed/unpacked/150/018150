The squirrel pox virus, one of the major factors behind the decline
of the once-common red squirrel, has struck in Instal, Merseyside,
just a few miles from a National Trust red squirrel reserve. Vets
identified the disease from an animal found dead in a back garden. [See map at:

Grey squirrels can carry the virus without being affected and are
blamed for spreading it to red squirrels, which have no immunity to
the disease. "If this thing gets hold of the red squirrel
population, then it will kill them -- and kill them very quickly",
said Steve White, conservation officer at the Lancashire Wildlife
Trust. "Our only hope is to get in and get rid of the grey squirrels
as quickly as possible", he added.

[Threats to the survival of red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_) in
their remaining strongholds in Scotland and northern England include
disease and loss of suitable habitat. Their decline during recent
years may have been the result of deaths caused by infection with a
parapoxvirus related to orf virus.
Orf (Contagious ecthyma) virus is a universally spread disease,
prevalent in all sheep-raising countries, which causes proliferative
lesions on the skin of sheep, goats and humans. The orf virus is an
epitheliotropic [skin-infecting] double-stranded DNA poxvirus of the
genus _Parapoxvirus_ (PPV).
According to studies undertaken by the Moredun Research Institute,
Scotland, in red and grey squirrels, 61 percent of apparently healthy
grey squirrels have been exposed to the squirrelpoxvirus. In
contrast, only 3 percent of red squirrels were found to have antibody
to the virus, with 75 percent of these animals showing clinical signs
of squirrelpoxvirus-associated disease. In addition, an apparent
correlation was found between the geographical distribution of grey
squirrels with antibody to the virus and the locations where
squirrelpoxvirus disease is known or thought to have occurred.
These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the virus
causes little or no disease in the grey squirrels (_Sciurus
carolinensis_) introduced from America, which serve as its reservoir,
while being highly pathogenic for the reds. Contact between the 2
species seems to expose the red squirrel to this lethal agent to
which it is extremely susceptible.

and the Identification of Virulence Genes" by Colin McInnes at the

[See image at:
<http://www.visitcumbria.com/pics/squirrelpox1.jpg>. The lesions in
humans are usually small skin lesions that can be confused with
cutaneous anthrax, but serious eye damage can occur. However, I
could not find any record of humans catching the virus from
squirrels, only from infected sheep, goats, deer and reindeer. - Mod.JW]
