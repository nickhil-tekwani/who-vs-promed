Penguins die in epidemic
-------------------
The most famous symbol of the Falkland Islands, the waiter-like gentoo
penguin, has been hit by an unidentified malaise which has killed thousands
and left many partially paralysed. Health authorities in the South Atlantic
islands are dealing daily with reports of the black-and-white birds being
washed ashore dead, or incapable of either swimming or parading the
beach. The condition, which has also affected the related magellanic
penguin species, has yet to be diagnosed by scientists and vets.
Concern is growing on the islands. Its gentoo flock is the largest in the
world at 115 000 birds, but it is also vulnerable to epidemic because of
its concentration in one small place. "We are talking about 40 percent of
the global population being here on the islands," said a spokesman for
Falklands Conservation, which is leading the hunt for clues about the
condition.
Last year, the British government spent GBP 25 000 on a gentoo health
project after reports from RAF pilots that the birds appeared to fall over
backwards after low-flying jets had roared past.
The theory about the much more serious epidemic of deaths and paralysis is
that a population explosion in microscopic, toxic sea plants has poisoned
penguins feeding on fish. Gentoos, the world's fastest-swimming birds, may
also have ingested the plankton.
Falklands Conservation said that coastal monitors had reported toxic
plankton concentrations, known as "red tides", because the millions of
pinkish creatures appear to turn patches of the sea red. The spokesman
said: "The tiny plants, known as dinoflagellates, bloom under certain
conditions to dangerous levels. Recently, a red tide algal bloom has led
to the closure of several shell fisheries along the Patagonian coast. We've
got researchers taking seawater samples, which will either confirm or rule
out a red tide as a possible cause."
Red tides also poison small fish, which may in turn be eaten by larger
species, which then become the prey of penguins. "When that happens, the
fish can build up their own toxins which can prove fatal to a predator,
such a penguin," added the spokesman.
Last year's gentoo study by the RAF appeared to clear the species of
suffering from lethal nervous stress in areas used for low flying.
Scientists watched as helicopters made repeated sorties over penguin
colonies in South Georgia, and reported that none of the stiff,
ramrod-straight birds keeled over.

[Penguins may well be sensitive to some change in the environment, red
tide, or perhaps some malady affecting the fish they consume. It is
certainly a matter of concern. - Mod.TG]
