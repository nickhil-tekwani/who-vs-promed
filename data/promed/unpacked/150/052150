Mystery Virus Kills 6 in the north of Gabon
-------------------------------------------
A total of 6 [7 according to WHO people have died of a mystery illness in
a part of Gabon where the deadly Ebola virus killed at least 66 people in
1996, the country's health minister said on Wednesday. Troops were sent to
the affected district in the north, and officials appealed for calm from
people terrified that it could be Ebola fever, whose victims bleed to
death, and for which there is no known cure. Health Minister Faustin
Boukoubi told Reuters in Libreville that the virus had struck the village
of Mekambo. "There are at least 6 dead and the situation is getting worse,"
he said, without giving any more details.

Reports of the deaths, near the site of the Ebola outbreak 5 years ago, and
the lack of an official explanation have set people on edge in the country
of 1.2 million people on central Africa's Atlantic coast. Ebola virus is
passed on through contact with body fluids and begins with aches and fever
similar to flu symptoms. Only in the last stages, when the virus eats
through the victim's veins and arteries, causing massive internal
hemorrhaging and blood to pour out of every orifice, is it clear that Ebola
virus has struck. There is no vaccine and no cure and up to 70 percent of
victims die within days. The most recent major outbreak of Ebola killed
more than 170 people in Uganda last year.
