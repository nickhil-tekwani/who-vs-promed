The Arkansas Department of Health confirmed [Mon 30 Oct 2018] that 52 people who were treated recently at Arkansas Cancer Institute have tested positive for a previously unknown [bacterium].

Three people who tested positive for the infection have died, though it's unknown whether their deaths were caused by the bacteria or other illness, such as the cancer for which they were originally being treated. More than 100 others identified as being at risk have been screened and results are pending, Arkansas state epidemiologist Dr Dirk Haselow said. "We expect these numbers to rise above 52, but how much more, we don't know," Haselow said.

The outbreak connected to the Pine Bluff treatment center was discovered among people who have ports, which are implanted devices that allow access to the bloodstream to administer medication and help with blood draws. The infections had thrived in the ports, which are typically implanted in a vein in the chest, according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center website.

Early tests of the [bacterium] -- nicknamed FVL-2018-32 -- have not shown it to be easily passed from person to person, and currently researchers do not believe that it is dangerous for people with healthy immune systems.

"I think it's really important for the public to understand that this is not a general public risk," Haselow said. "Further, we do not believe that this risk continues among those who are newly seen at [Arkansas Cancer Institute]."

In a phone interview [Mon 29 Oct 2018], Arkansas Cancer Institute administrator Michael Legate said that the treatment center had notified health authorities, including Jefferson Regional Medical Center, the state health department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after observing that some patients were getting sick.

The problem was traced to a saline flush process for ports that had been used for 27 years without incident, Legate said. Though he said the specific source of the contamination is being investigated, the process has been discontinued.

Haselow said that in investigating the outbreak, the Arkansas Department of Health had noted areas where the treatment center was "vulnerable to infection," using an analogy to explain why this may have happened now. "You can speed all your life and never be in an accident, but then the 1st time you get in an accident, you recognize that speeding might not have been a great idea. ... It went wrong at least once," he said.

The list of potentially affected people comprises those who had their port accessed at the facility between [22 Mar and 11 Sep 2018]. The treatment center has reached everyone identified as having been at risk for infection, Legate said, and most have been treated.

"The main takeaway is that this is not communicable, and there's no new cases, no new exposure," he said.

Haselow said although he had not seen a situation exactly like this one in Arkansas, it's not unheard of for there to be clusters of infections associated with surgeries or procedures, and that similar infections sometimes happen in patient ports.

Many of the patients have had their ports removed, and people who tested positive for the bacteria will undergo a 2-week course of antibiotics, Haselow said. They'll then be observed for 2 weeks and re-tested to make sure the infection has not returned.

No one has been fully cleared, but 5 people have undergone their 2nd round of testing and are waiting for those results.

Arkansas Cancer Institute opened in 1991 and treats several types of cancer. In a news release, it said this is the 1st time there has been an outbreak of this kind at the facility.

"We are thankful for the sake of our patients and our Pine Bluff community that this infection does not spread from person to person and will not cause infection to the public. ... Nevertheless, we are dismayed and saddened by the turn of events," the release said. "This has been a moment of reflection and introspection for all of us at the clinic."

The State Health Department says a newly discovered [bacterium] has infected dozens of cancer patients with a common link, they all received treatments at the Arkansas Cancer Institute (ACI).

The epidemiologist at the [Arkansas] State Health Department (ADH) explained that the [bacterium] is so new, doctors don't know exactly what it does; in fact, symptoms are still being sorted through according to ADH.

"About 3 months ago we were informed of a cluster of unusual infections in patients from cancer institute."

Arkansas Department of Health's Dr Dirk Haselow talks about a letter he says 155 patients at Arkansas Cancer Institute in Pine Bluff received last month [September 2018].

"These lines weren't necessarily placed by the cancer institute, the common factor is that they are being treated at the cancer institute," says Dr Haselow.

The letter reads in part, patients who had ports accessed at ACI between [22 Mar and 11 Sep 2018] are considered at risk for a known [bacterium] but as of last week Dr Haselow says the CDC notified them it's not a known [bacterium].

Read the Arkansas Cancer Institute's full statement here.

"This is an infection that no one has experience with. We have engaged experts in infectious disease at UAMS [University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences] as well as experts at CDC," Dr Haselow.

Dr. Haselow explains symptoms aren't clear. "We believe we have identified the worst of this and we're in sort of the clean up phase," he says.

ADH and ACI in a statement both agree 52 patients contacted the bacteria. One that Dr Haselow says the CDC's given a temporary name to calling it FVL-2018-32.

"So we don't believe this is a risk to the public. We don't believe there's any ongoing risk to patients newly seen at the ACI." He says symptoms aren't 100 percent clear. "This infection is occurring in people who most of them have cancer and have cancer chemotherapy ports," Dr Haselow says.

ACI first wrote us a statement [that] reads in part, 52 patients with positive screens have been treated or cleared or are in treatment with an expected full recovery. State Health Department says 3 of those 52 have died.

"We know that things have gone wrong in the development of their flushes. They have created their own flushes which [were supposed] to be sterile and they were not sterile," according to Dr Haselow.

ADH makes it clear, those 3 cancer patients did not die as a proven result of the bacteria. ACI has sent an additional statement confirming the 3 deaths and saying the 49 other patients are expected to make a recovery.

Here is Arkansas Cancer Institute's 2nd statement:

"Good Afternoon Price,

Thank you for reporting. As we discussed over the phone, there were 52 cases that tested positive and 49 of those patients are expected to make a full recovery. 3 have died, but at this time is it unknown if those deaths were specifically caused by this outbreak and not one of the other reasons that very sick cancer patients die from.

The difference between the 155 patients reported to you from the ADH and our number is that we excluded patients that did not have a port (5) and those that had already died, from reasons not specifically related at this time to the outbreak (13).

I really hope that helps, please reach out to me with any further questions. I'll assist however I can.

Thank you,
Michael Legate, MHSA/Administrator/Arkansas Cancer Institute"

The health department says it does not believe any new patients will be infected and the antibiotics appear to be working.

[Cancer treatment frequently requires access to the bloodstream on an ongoing basis for administration of fluids, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, blood transfusions, and antibiotics, which requires an indwelling catheter or port that has been tunneled under the skin and then inserted into a large, central vein. There are several different types:
- Peripherally inserted central catheter (or PICC line) in the arm. Several inches of the catheter are outside the skin;
- Hickman catheter, that exits under the collarbone or in the neck. Several inches of the Hickman catheter are also outside the skin.
- Port-a-cath, in which a "port" at the end of the catheter is completely buried under the skin of chest. A needle is inserted through the skin into the port to draw blood or give fluids or medication. The news reports above say that the patients had "ports" indicating that the type of central venous catheter was likely a port-a-cath.

These indwelling, tunneled central venous catheters are at risk for clots. The central catheter must be flushed frequently with either heparin or saline solution to keep it clear of blood and prevent clotting.

The catheters are also at risk for infection. For example:
- the lumen of the catheter could be colonized (the blood culture obtained from the catheter is positive, but the percutaneous blood sample is negative);
- the bloodstream may be infected (the blood culture obtained from the catheter and the percutaneous blood sample are positive for the same organism);
- the cutaneous and subcutaneous tract through which the catheter passes could be infected; and
- secondary infective endocarditis and metastatic infection may occur.
However, we are not told what types of microbial involvement these patients had.

The news reports above say that 52 patients with indwelling central venous access catheters undergoing cancer chemotherapy at single medical center developed an infection due to the same bacterium not previously known to be a pathogen; 3 of the patients died. The bacterium was named by the CDC "FVL-2018-32", and it has been "traced to a saline flush process for ports," "accessed at the facility between [22 Mar and 11 Sep 2018], which implies that the saline flush used in all the patients was possibly contaminated by the same organism or the equipment (such as syringes) used to flush the catheters was possibly contaminated by this organism.

Pine Bluff, Arkansas, with a population of about 50 000 residents, is a city about 45 miles south of Little Rock, the state capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Bluff,_Arkansas); a map showing the location of Pine Bluff can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Little+Rock,+AR/Pine+Bluff,+AR.

More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
