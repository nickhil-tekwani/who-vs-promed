The family of a 3-year-old girl of Fairview Township in York County hopes to raise awareness of the symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is rare in Pennsylvania and whose early symptoms can easily be mistaken for other illnesses. A delayed diagnoses can prove devastating, because it's critical to begin treating it with antimicrobials within the 1st 4 days.

She died on 17 Aug 2014, a day after she turned 3. Her custodial father said she must have come in contact with the disease locally because the family hadn't recently traveled.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is carried by dog ticks, which also bite humans. Pennsylvania typically registers only about 24 suspected or confirmed cases per year. It is much more common in states including North Carolina and Tennessee. Although it causes severe illness, it is fatal in only about 3 percent of cases.

The main symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever include fever, headache, abdominal pain, muscle pain, fatigue and vomiting. People often get a pink rash that might begin on the hands, wrists and ankles and spread toward the center of the body.

[It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. In states such as Pennsylvania, where the disease is less endemic than the Middle Atlantic states, it is particularly important to think of this infection.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common vector for this infection, can be seen at http://bit.ly/1lkwxId.
