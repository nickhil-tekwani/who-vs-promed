Re: ProMED Syphilis - Japan: (HS) increasing cases, RFI 20220404.8702405
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We would like to respond to the RFI regarding the syphilis situation in Japan, based on official national surveillance data.

As in many other high-income countries, Japan has been seeing an increase in notifications of syphilis since 2010 (https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tef01.gif). From around 2010 to 2013, much of this increase was attributed to male cases, and among them, mostly MSM [men who have sex with men].

However, since around 2014, the continued increase has been attributed more to heterosexual transmission, and since 2015, the reported number of heterosexual cases among men surpassed that of MSM cases, and notifications among women also steadily increased (https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tf04.gif; https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Fulltext/2018/03000/Rapid_Increase_in_Reports_of_Syphilis_Associated.1.aspx [see comment below]). Unfortunately, congenital syphilis cases have also increased during this period (https://www.publish.csiro.au/sh/SH21004).

Detailed syphilis information (based on the national surveillance data) through 2018 or 2019 is communicated in English at https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-vol41-e/865-iasr/9542-479te.html. In addition, the latest quarterly update on syphilis is available at https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/syphilis-m/syphilis-trend.html (while the text is in Japanese, the key labels and notes for the figures and tables are provided in English). Although in Japanese, an update through week 47 of 2021 on the key trends and distributions is also provided at https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/syphilis-m-3/syphilis-idwrc/10826-idwrc-2147.html

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of syphilis notifications has continued to increase, with 2021 counts surpassing those of 2018 (which was the highest record since the 1970s). In the latest report (quarter 1 of 2022: https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/epi/syphilis/2022q1/syphilis2022q1.pdf), it can be clearly seen that the increase is nationwide (Fig 1, Fig 2, and Table 1), not limited to Hiroshima Prefecture (with Tokyo contributing the greatest number of cases and also showing a rising trend). In addition, the recent increase has been notable in men who have sex with women (MSW) and women (Fig 5), with the vast majority being primary and secondary syphilis cases (see Fig 4, which provides the latest distribution stratified by MSM, MSW, and women: https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/epi/syphilis/2022q1/syphilis2022q1.pdf). Lastly, Table 5 shows the number and percentage of cases by commercial sex work (recent provision or utilization of commercial sex), indicating a consistent and sizable proportion of male cases reporting its use and female cases reporting its provision. While these data are not specific to Hiroshima, as the increase has been nationwide, we believe these data help clarify the situation in Japan and address the information being requested. Public health authorities are responding to the situation with enhanced information dissemination and reminders regarding syphilis prevention.

We hope the ProMED readership finds this official information from Japan useful and informative.

[ProMED thanks Dr Yuzo Arima for a detailed description of the epidemiology of syphilis in Japan, based on official national surveillance data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

Abstract
--------
"Background
In Japan, syphilis reports have recently increased rapidly. However, unlike other developed countries where men who have sex with men (MSM) were associated with the rise, the increase in Japan has been attributed more to men who have sex with women (MSW) and women who have sex with men (WSM). We report on this increase based on surveillance data.

"Methods
Syphilis is a notifiable disease requiring all laboratory-confirmed cases to be reported; stage and sex of the sex partner(s) suspected as the infection source are also reported. Focusing on primary and secondary (P&S) cases, we describe the temporal, demographic, and geographic distributions of reported cases in 2012 through 2016.

"Results
A total of 7040 (64.0%) of 10 997 cases were P&S; the annual rate of increase was greatest for P&S and the proportion of P&S increased over time. Among P&S cases (1609 MSM, 2768 MSW, and 1323 WSM), MSW and WSM each surpassed MSM cases in 2016. Men were older with a wider age distribution (median, 37 years; interquartile range, 28-46 years) relative to women (median, 26 years; interquartile range, 21-34 years). Among women, 20- to 24-year-olds consistently had the highest reporting rate, reaching 9.0 per 100,000 in 2016. Congenital syphilis reports increased from 0.4 in 2012 to 1.4 per 100,000 live births in 2016. Although Tokyo prefecture had the highest reporting rate (3.98 per 100 000 person-years), the proportionate contribution from Tokyo decreased in 2016.

"Conclusions
Reports on P&S syphilis increased yearly among MSW and WSM. Young women seem to be at particular risk, and with increased reports of congenital syphilis, syphilis prevention and control is currently a public health priority in Japan."
