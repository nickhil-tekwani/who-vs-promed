Outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections linked to pet hedgehogs
-----------------------------------------------------------
CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections linked to contact with pet hedgehogs.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 22 Sep 2020, a total of 32 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium have been reported from 17 states.

Illnesses started on dates from 12 Apr 2020 to 11 Aug 2020. Ill people range in age from less than 1 to 61 years, with a median age of 10 years. 56 percent are female. Of 27 people with information available, 5 (19%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

WGS analysis of 19 bacterial isolates from ill people did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) of one isolate also showed no resistance.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
In interviews, people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of 23 people interviewed, 16 (70%) reported contact with hedgehogs before becoming ill. Ill people reported buying hedgehogs from various sources, including pet stores, breeders, and online stores. The outbreak strain making people sick was identified in samples collected from a hedgehog from the home of an ill person in New York. A single, common source of hedgehogs has not been identified.

This outbreak strain is the same as outbreak strains linked to hedgehogs in 2012 and in 2019.

Regardless of where hedgehogs are purchased, these animals can carry _Salmonella_ that can make people sick. Hedgehog owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their pet.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.

[A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are 17 species of hedgehog in 5 genera found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. A number of outbreaks of human salmonellosis have been linked to contact with these animals. - Mod.LL
