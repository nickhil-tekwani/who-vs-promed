From: Stephen Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

The following background information on Bolivian hemorrhagic fever was
extracted from GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com>:
Agent: VIRUS - (RNA - Arenaviridae) Machupo virus
Reservoir: rodent (_Calomys callosus_)
Vector: none
Vehicle: food, water, direct patient contact
Incubation Period: 5d - 19d
- Clinical Hints: Fever, myalgia, petechiae, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,
relative bradycardia, adenopathy, neurological symptoms; most often
encountered in agricultural workers during spring and summer. Note that
Bolivian hemorrhagic fever [BHF is clinically similar to Argentine
hemorrhagic fever [AHF; however, neurological signs are more common in
AHF, while hemorrhagic diatheses are more common in BHF.
Diagnostic Tests: Viral culture (blood, urine, pharynx); serology
Typical Therapy: Strict isolation; specific immune plasma; suggest
ribavirin 2.0 g i.v., then 1.0 g i.v. Q6h X 4d, then 0.5 g Q8h X 6d
Disease Distribution: [only Bolivia
Notes:
- Bolivian hemorrhagic fever is most common during April to July in the upper
savanna region of eastern Bolivia (Beni).
- Principal exposure occurs through rodents (_Calomys callosus_) which
enter homes in this region. Nosocomial and man-to-man spread have been
documented.
- Over 500 cases were registered (18% fatal) during an epidemic in 1964. A
nosocomial outbreak was reported from Cochabamba in 1971, with subsequent
outbreaks in Magdalena and San Joaquin until 1975.
- No cases were reported during 1976 to 1992. A fatal case was reported in
San Ramon in 1993; 10 cases (7 fatal) from El Beni in 1994; 3 cases
(nonfatal) in 1996 - all in El Beni; 8 in 1999 (5 in Santa Cruz and 3 in
Tarija).

[That Machupo virus has no vector depends on one's definition of "vector".
One could certainly consider the rodent host of this virus as a vector.
Otherwise, we appreciate the background information from Steve Berger. -
