Anthrax, cattle - USA (California) 20011031.2686
Date: 1 Nov 2001
From: James Case <jtcase@ucdavis.edu>

We wish to correct information in the recent posting [Anthrax, cattle - USA
(California) 20011031.2686 concerning anthrax in California cattle. Some
of the information in the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper article
misrepresents the event. It was stated that "the disease was misdiagnosed
by a private veterinarian first summoned to the ranch, and he performed 2
necropsies at the scene -- an ill-advised practice when dealing with
anthrax, because it brings people into direct contact with diseased tissue,
experts say."
The veterinarian in responding to the sudden death of a group of cattle in
a remote rural location did not observe hemorrhage from any body orifices,
a sign often associated with anthrax. In performing the field necropsies,
enlarged spleens were not observed. It is to the veterinarian's credit that
appropriate tissues were submitted to the diagnostic laboratory, which
allowed for a complete diagnostic workup for toxic and infectious causes.
With the extremely dry range conditions in California, deep burial with
lime treatment was considered to be the best option.

[Let this be a lesson. The textbook description of finding blood
extravasating from the body orifices is, in our experience, the exception
rather than the rule. What does seem to apply is rapid bloating and an
absence of rigor mortis. This event also points up the need for
veterinarians in areas that have had endemic anthrax to have access to
rapid cow-side tests to preempt the need for necropsies and the delays
inherent in waiting for laboratory results. Maybe the events on the East
Coast will make this a reality. Of course, some countries' vets are still
able to fix & stain blood smears, but that is no longer the case in the
USA. - Mod.MHJ
