[The posting, African swine fever - Mozambique (Maputo), contained a
typographical error that I regret. I appreciate Dr. Pereira calling the
oversight to my attention. - Mod.TG.
The following sentence was contained in the posting:
Between 1992 and 1994 Maputo province had a reduction of the population of
pigs of 71.2%. In 1992 there were a total of 26,798 in 1993:14,878 and in
1994:428,720. More than 62% of the pig farmers lost all their animals.
That sentence should read:
Between 1992 and 1994 Maputo Province had a reduction of the population of
pigs of 71.2 percent. In 1992 there were a total of 26,798, in 1993: 14,
878, and in 1994: 4, 287. More than 62 percent of the pig farmers lost all
of thier animals.
