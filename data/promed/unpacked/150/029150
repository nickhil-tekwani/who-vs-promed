HAND, FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - VIET NAM (HO CHI MINH CITY)

Since the beginning of this month [September 2007], more than 170
infants have been hospitalized every week with hand, foot and mouth
disease, 30 percent of them with serious complications, the Ho Chi
Minh (HCM) City Health Department reports.
Dr. Tran Thi Thuy, of the infectious diseases ward at Children's
Hospital II in Ho Chi Minh city, says more than half of the ward's
213 infants have the disease, and a dozen of them are suffering from
brain complications. Since hand, foot and mouth develops rapidly, 2
infants have died before they could be taken to the emergency unit.
The disease is also ravaging Children's Hospital I. Dr. Truong Huu
Khanh, head of the hospital's infectious disease unit, says the
number of hand, foot and mouth patients has risen 5-fold since August
[2007]. What worries him most is that the disease has broken out much
earlier than in previous years, when it peaked in March or November.
Dr. Le Truong Giang, Deputy Director of the HCMC Health Department,
is urging the authorities to take urgent action to contain and
eliminate hand, foot and mouth, above all by sanitizing every school
and classroom.
The disease is caused [predominantly] by Coxsackie and Entero 71
viruses [i.e. Human coxsackievirus A16 and Human enterovirus 71,
according to ICTV nomenclature - Mod.CP], which lurk in toys and
food, so parents should pay careful attention to their children's
food and surroundings. Moreover, doctors are advising parents to seek
medical help if their child has a fever and especially if they notice
blisters on the hands and feet and ulcers in the mouth.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of
infants and children, most frequently affecting children under 10
years of age and infants. It is a human disease unrelated to the
foot-and-mouth disease affecting ruminants and other animals. HFMD is
characterised by fever and vesicles in the mouth and on distal
extremities. Complications are uncommon in most outbreaks, in
contrast to the current outbreak in Viet Nam. Pictures of typical
HFMD lesions can be viewed at
<http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000965.htm>.
HFMD is moderately contagious. Infection is spread from person to
person by direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva,
fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. A child is
most contagious during the 1st week of the illness. Individual cases
and outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide, more frequently in summer and
early autumn.
A variety of enteric picornaviruses have been associated with HFMD in
the past, the most frequently observed being Human coxsackievirus A16
and Human enterovirus 71. Currently, outbreaks of relatively mild
HFMD in India and Malaysia have been reported in ProMED-mail within
the past few days (see references below). In the recent past, serious
outbreaks of HFMD & encephalitis attributable to human enterovirus 71
have been reported in some Southeast Asian countries (Malaysia, 1997;
Taiwan, 1998). -- see ProMED refs. below. - Mod.CP]
