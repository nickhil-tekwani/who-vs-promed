There is concern KwaZulu-Natal could find itself dealing with a very
serious outbreak of African horse sickness [AHS] this year [2009].
The disease has killed 12 horses in the province since [1 Jan 2009].
The affected areas include Newcastle, Dundee and Wartburg.

The African Horse Sickness [AHS] Trust says it is concerned because
it's too early in the year for such an outbreak. Spokesperson Douglas
Welsh says they fear the disease could claim more than 1000 horses
this year [2009]. "The sad part is that it's not selective about what
horses it kills. It gets into a population of horses, and even the
really well protected and good horses can die from it. And so when we
have an early outbreak like this this year [2009], we want people to
be cognizant of the fact that it could be a bad year for AHS, and
they must put in the protective measures like vaccination and fly
repellent into the stables as soon as possible, because we're
probably going to have a bad outbreak this year."

[AHS is endemic in South Africa's subtropical north, the virus moving
a variable distance down to non-endemic areas in the temperate south
each season. The distance moved depends on climatic factors favoring
the vector and the immune status of the population. Export of horses
to Europe is allowed from a defined, disease-free area in the Western
Cape. For the "free," "surveillance," and "protection" zones there,
see map at <http://www.oie.int/eng/maps/ZAF0402.pdf>.

To view the location of Kwazulu-Natal province, on the eastern side
of South Africa, see map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/?action=selmap&country=257_0_4&language=1>.

Though AHS is not directly contagious, viraemic horses may introduce
the virus into receptive areas during the vector's activity season,
infecting the local _Culicoides_ population and, subsequently, local
equines. This emphasizes the importance of full compliance to the
applied animal movement restrictions, particularly during the
late-summer and autumn months.

AHS is known to be transmitted in South Africa by at least 2
_Culicoides_ species, namely _C. imicola_ and _C. bolitinos_. _C.
imicola_ is the most common species, but in general prefers warmer,
lower altitudes. This species breeds in saturated or wet soils
containing a high level of organic material.

_C. bolitinos_ is a member of the Imicola complex. Its breeding
habitat is the dung of cattle, buffalo and wildebeest, which provides
a stable and constant breeding microclimate for larval development.
Hence, _C. bolitinos_ is more abundant than _C. imicola_ in areas
with lower average temperatures, including cooler, mountainous
regions. This was the case in 2003 in the Drakensberg mountains at an
altitude above 1500 metres, where many owners did not vaccinate, and
the disease had not been reported for at least 50 years (see 20030318.0675).

Confirmation (or otherwise) of the current, media-derived information
on AHS in Kwazulu-Natal and details of laboratory tests, in
particular the serotype involved, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
