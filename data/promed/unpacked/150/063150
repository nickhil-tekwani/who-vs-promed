----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The analysis intends to give an overview of the SBV situation after one year (reporting period from 1 Aug 2011 till 31 Jul 2012) together with an update of newly affected herds.

All affected countries have reported the number of confirmed herds following viral detection by PCR, virus neutralisation test or serological confirmation. An increased number of test results is based on serological detection of SBV antibodies and this can only be used as evidence of infection but provide no information on clinical disease or occurrence of new cases. No new cases were reported from Spain or Belgium.

In August 2012, 294 herds were reported with AHS [arthrogryposis hydranencephaly syndrome] symptoms in cattle. In September and October [2012] the number of herds with AHS symptoms decreased however acute cases in adults (adult animals where clinical signs were observed and SBV diagnosis confirmed) were reported in August, September, and October [2012]. It is important to note that the number of countries reporting acute adult cases is limited and it is likely that adult cases are not diagnosed considering the transitory and non specific nature of the clinical signs observed. An increase of the number of AHS cases is likely to occur in the coming months resulting of infection of previously unexposed animals in the susceptible period of gestation. The temporal analysis was performed for SBV confirmed herd reports. It can be seen that the SBV has continued to circulate within Europe with newly affected herds being reported in October 2012.

At the time of publication of the last EFSA epidemiological update in May [2012], 8 member states (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom) had reported confirmed cases of SBV. During the summer [2012] SBV confirmed cases were reported in new countries, including Denmark, Finland, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland, and in new regions in France, United Kingdom, and Germany. Other epidemiology reporting services indicate that SBV has also been detected in Austria and Ireland. [Recently, Norway has been added to the list. - Mod.AS]. SBV is continuing to spread to new areas of Europe, and it is likely that new SBV cases will be observed in Southern and Eastern regions of Europe in 2013.

The data available only allow a between herd impact assessment based upon the comparison between SBV confirmed herds and the total number of herds in each affected region by species. For all affected countries, the number of SBV confirmed herds is low compared with the total number of herds. The maximum proportion of confirmed sheep herds per region is 6.6 percent and 4 percent for cattle herds. Nevertheless, these comparisons should be interpreted cautiously since under-reporting or lack of confirmation may affect the ratio. No information is available to assess within herd impact.

Schmallenberg virus: 1st case isolated in Sardinia
--------------------------------------------------
The 1st case of the new ruminant pathogen Schmallenberg virus (SBV), initially isolated in 2011 in Germany, has been reported in Sardinia. The confirmation of the outbreak came from the Reference Centre for Exotic Diseases (CESME) of Teramo, where laboratory tests were applied on samples sent by the Istituto Zooprofilattico of Sardinia (Animal Health Institute; IZS). The initial clinical and anatomopathological investigations were carried out in a sheep flock in Tertenia in Ogliastra [province].

The IZS has been contacted by the attending veterinarian who observed some cases of abortion in sheep and foeti malformations. Suspicion of SBV was raised, the local and regional health authorities alerted.

Following the confirmation of SBV, some protective measures, prescribed by health protocols, have been undertaken, including entomological surveillance. Ongoing monitoring for bluetongue (BT; similarly transmitted by _Culicoides_), on the other hand, had already demonstrated wide BT dissemination in Ogliastra, favored by high temperatures at the end of November [see ProMED-mail posting 20121026.1367567].

SBV was isolated for the 1st time in the late summer of 2011 in the German town of the same name, in North Rhine-Westphalia, from which it derived its name. Although some symptoms of SBV are similar and comparable to those of other diseases, the analysis of the genome has established that it is a new disease, the presence of which, after its 1st identification, was confirmed in most European countries, including Italy, Denmark, and Belgium. In our Peninsula, the 1st case was registered in February 2012 in the Province of Treviso, followed by new episodes totalling 9 confirmed outbreaks.

The probability of SBV transmission from animals to humans is extremely low, if at all.

[The same province (Ogliastra, south east Sardinia) had reportedly been affected by BTV-1 earlier, in October 2012, with clinical disease in susceptible sheep (see ProMED-mail post 20121026.1367567). Since then, the disease has been reported in additional sheep flocks in south Sardinia. Their number, as of 6 Nov 2012 reached 14 confirmed outbreaks. A map, showing all outbreaks at that date, is available at http://www.izs-sardegna.it/foto_news/MappaBT.jpg.

With the addition of Sardinia, the SBV territories already occupy vast parts of Europe; the situation in the remaining parts remains to be uncovered by serological surveillance or by the appearance of malformed offspring in ruminants during the coming months, provided that such affected offspring be reported. - Mod.AS

---------------------------------------
On 16 May 2012, a herd of 75 dairy cows in southwestern France (Pyrenees-Atlantiques) had hyperthermia and decreased milk production. Of 18 cows tested by the Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire (Maisons-Alfort, France), 9 were positive for SBV by PCR (cycle threshold [Ct] range 17-36.5) and negative for SBV by ELISA (IDVet, Montpellier, France), 1 was positive by PCR and ELISA, and 8 were negative by PCR and ELISA.

On 23 May 2012, a week after the 1st samples were collected, all cows tested were positive by ELISA and only 1/18 cows were positive by RT-PCR. On 29 Jun 2012, all 18 cows tested were negative by RT-PCR. Detection of SBV-neutralizing antibodies by virus neutralization assay in serum samples obtained on 23 May 2012 confirmed SBV ELISA results and showed that a commercial IgG ELISA is suitable for detection of acute cases of SBV.

Viremia, as measured by RT-PCR, occurs during the 1st 5 days after acute infection. Antibody response against SBV, as measured by ELISA, is detected during or after the 1st 10 days after experimental infection (C Sailleau et al., unpub. data). Accordingly, serologic and molecular data showed that acute SBV infection occurred in cattle in southwestern France in May 2012, suggesting that SBV overwintered or was reintroduced. Moreover, in July 2012, another case of acute SBV infection was identified in Finistere (Brittany). A cow with hyperthermia and diarrhea was SBV positive by RT-PCR (Ct 31) and negative by ELISA, which indicated a recent SBV infection.

Three blood samples (each 170 microL) from RT-PCR-positive cows (Ct range 15-21) (1 from the Finistere and 2 from Pyrenees-Atlantiques) were injected into 3 adult IFNAR-/-mice. 70 microL of each sample was injected intraperitoneally and 100 microL was injected into the neck scruff of the same mice. After 4 days, the mice showed no clinical signs and their weights were unchanged. Blood samples were collected and tested for SBV by RT-PCR. All mice were positive for SBV RNA (Ct range 15-21). These data showed that blood samples from cows contained virus RNA and confirmed that SBV reemerged in 2012.

On 25 Jul 2012, SBV infection was identified in a cow in Jura Canton in the northwestern, French-speaking region of Switzerland (Romandie). A serologic study conducted in the United Kingdom showed that several cattle and sheep seroconverted for SBV in 2012. However, our data show that SBV survived the winter, when midge numbers decreased. The precise mechanisms of SBV overwintering are not known and need to be explored.

The consequences of SBV recirculation should be investigated, particularly in pregnant cows, ewes, and goats. The 2 SBV-positive farms described in this report are located in a previously SBV-free area (Finistere-Brittany) or an area in which the infection rate was low (Pyrenees-Atlantiques) in the winter of 2011-2012, during which seroprevalence for most herds was probably weak (C Sailleau et al, unpub. data). Therefore, reemergence of cases of congenital forms of SBV infection in France and others areas of Europe can be expected.

SBV seems to have already spread within vast parts of Europe from the Atlantic and North Sea to the Mediterranean, including most of France's territory. Its distribution seems to have followed the footsteps of another arbovirus of ruminants, namely BTV-8, which is probably carried and spread by the same or very similar vector fauna (_Culicoides_ species). Though no smoking gun could have been discovered, it has been assumed that BTV-8 was initially introduced into northern Europe (the Germany/Netherlands/Belgium junction), most likely by airplane(s) with infected insect vectors, probably from Africa. The SBV route of introduction and dynamics of further spread may have been similar, but are more complex to decipher since the infection remains mostly sub-clinical, its effects becoming visible only if and when abortions and/or malformations come to light and are reported. As the French authors rightly indicate, the precise mechanisms of SBV overwintering are not known and need to be explored. - Mod.AS
