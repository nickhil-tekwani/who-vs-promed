[1] USA: CDC update

Update
------
As of [8 Oct 2014], CDC has verified reports of 17 cases in 12 states that meet our case definition below. We are working with healthcare professionals and state and local officials to investigate all of these cases.

We are also in the process of verifying dozens of additional reports. These investigations take time and are in the early stages. Therefore, the number of cases will likely increase as we update these numbers weekly on Wednesday, but the increase will not necessarily reflect changes in occurrence of cases in real time.

Case definition
---------------
Persons who meet the case definition should be reported to state and local health departments.

To be considered a case, a patient must meet ALL 4 of the following criteria:
- patient 21 years of age or younger,
- acute onset of focal limb weakness,
- on or after [1 Aug 2014], AND
- an MRI showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter

At the Hospital for Sick Children [in Toronto, where] 6 children are currently suffering from muscle weakness linked to respiratory illness, one has tested positive for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), one has tested positive for rhinovirus, and 2 are still awaiting test results, SickKids associate pediatrician-in-chief Dr Jeremy Friedman said in a news conference Wednesday afternoon [8 Oct 2014]. The other 2 children tested negative for EV-D68. All are under 10.

SickKids Hospital has had 7 confirmed cases of EV-D68 in the last few weeks. The enigmatic respiratory virus has been infecting children across North America since early August [2014], sending thousands of kids to hospital.

The US Centers for Disease Control has alerted doctors to be on the lookout for polio-like symptoms in children diagnosed with enterovirus D68. The disease has recently been linked to polio-like symptoms, such as paralysis.

Friedman would not be drawn on details about the 6 patients at SickKids or the severity of their muscle weakness.

The EV-D68 outbreak appeared to be on a downward trend in Toronto now, he said. "As far as the D68 issue goes, it seems to us in the last week or 2 there are less children being seen with respiratory problems."

Two young patients in [British Columbia] have also suffered paralysis linked to EV-D68, with one on a breathing machine in hospital for more than a month.

At least 4 children in the United States have died after contracting EV-D68.

[From the CDC report above, there is confirmation that currently 17 cases from 12 states in the USA meet the case definition stated. There is also mention that there have been "dozens" of additional reports received that are currently under investigation. Hence, the 29 cases in the USA that have been reported through news media and posted in previous ProMED-mail reports (see below) represent just a portion of the cases currently under investigation. It is very early in the identification of this recently described polio-like illness and as the CDC update says, one should expect increasing numbers as more suspected cases are evaluated and confirmed.

The status of the investigation into similar cases in Canada is still pending. According the media report there are now 6 cases meeting the case definition at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. Previously there had been reports of 2 cases from the same hospital. Presumably the 6 cases of polio-like illness mentioned in the report above include the 2 previously mentioned cases. Laboratory results mentioned above include one EV-D68 infection, and one rhinovirus infection. This increase in 4 cases in Ontario brings the total number of cases in Canada reported in ProMED-mail updates to 17.

We await further information on results of investigations as they become available. More information from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
