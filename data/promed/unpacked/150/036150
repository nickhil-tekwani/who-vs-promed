Press Releases

Update III on atypical pneumonia cases in Singapore [Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)]
--------------------------
The World Health Organisation has revised the name of this disease to
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS is an atypical pneumonia for
which the cause has not yet been determined.

Four new patients with SARS have been admitted since the MOH Press Release
yesterday. As at 16 March 2003, we have a total of 20 patients of SARS.
Other than the initial three cases, there are an additional 17 patients who
have been admitted to hospital. All these have been in close contact with
patients of SARS. Ten are family members and friends, and seven are
hospital staff who had attended to the patients when they were first
admitted to the hospitals. All these patients are stable. Patients are
being isolated and the hospital staff have been informed to observe
enhanced infection control procedures when attending to suspected cases.

The Ministry advises you to seek immediate medical attention if you have:
- Fever (>38 C) and respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of
breath or breathing difficulty;
AND
- have travelled to Hong Kong, Hanoi or Guangdong province in China, within
2 weeks of onset of the symptoms;
OR
- are a close contact of persons diagnosed with SARS. (Close contact means
having cared for, having lived with, or having had direct contact with
respiratory secretions and body fluids of a person with SARS)

As a precautionary measure, the Ministry strongly advises you to avoid
travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the time
being, unless absolutely necessary.

Update re Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Toronto Experience
------
There are now 6 probable and 2 suspect adult cases of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) of unknown etiology in the Greater Toronto Area
(GTA). (See Health Canada's preliminary definitions of probable and
suspect cases at the end of this report.)

The first 6 cases involved 6 adults in one family (composed of 7 adults and
3 children) who have been admitted to hospitals in the GTA with
probable/suspect SARS. The index case and her husband had traveled to Hong
Kong 13 Feb 2003 to 23 Feb 2003. She had respiratory symptoms upon her
return to Toronto and died at home on 5 Mar 2003. Four of her adult
children/children-in-law (3 of whom lived with her) and her husband
ultimately developed symptoms and were diagnosed with
probable(4)/suspect(1) SARS. None of the 3 young children in the family
have shown signs of SARS although one (5 months old) has been admitted to
hospital for observation. This child was noted to have a rash described as
erythema multiforme minor after exposure to probable cases in his family
noted by his family doctor on 6 Mar 2003 but which resolved by 10 Mar
2003. Two probable cases from this family have died. One probable case
from this family is requiring mechanical ventilation but is stable. The
remaining probable/suspect cases from this family are stable on medical wards.

The seventh case involves the family physician who assessed at least one
probable and one suspect case from this family. She has also been
diagnosed with suspect SARS and has been admitted to a medical ward and is
currently stable. She saw these patients on 6 Mar 2003 for approximately
45 minutes and on 9 Mar 2003 she developed a temperature of 40 C (104 F)
which has persisted to date (16 Mar 2003). On 14 Mar 2003, she developed
a dry non-productive cough with adventitious sounds in the left lower lobe
but has had a normal chest x-ray.

The eighth case has been diagnosed on 16 Mar 2003 with probable SARS. He
is not related to the first 6 cases and is the first non-Asian case in
Toronto. For the first 2 weeks of Mar 2003, he was traveling in Southeast
Asia (including Hong Kong on 10 Mar 2003). He developed symptoms on 12
Mar 2003 with pleuritic chest pain, sore throat and light headedness that
developed into productive cough with hemoptysis [coughing up blood] and
shortness of breath on 14 Mar 2003. He was assessed and noted to have a
temperature of 40 C (104 F) on 15 Mar 2003 and is requiring 40 percent
oxygen by mask. Pulmonary embolism has been ruled out.

Clinical specimens from all cases, including autopsy specimens from one of
the probable cases that died have been sent to local, regional, and
national laboratories for diagnostic testing. Initial results have
revealed no etiology. Histological examination of lung from one of the
deceased patients was compatible with adult respiratory distress syndrome.

Description of the Toronto SARS Cases:

In 3 probable cases where there was a defined exposure, the estimated
incubation period ranged from 2-5 days. In all 8 cases, the initial
symptoms were primarily fever and malaise. Some, but not all also had
headache and myalgias [muscle pains]. While respiratory symptoms were
common to all cases (primarily dry cough and shortness of breath), it is
worth noting that respiratory symptoms occurred later in the illness in
some patients. At presentation to hospital, most have been febrile, short
of breath and hypoxic. However, some have not had a fever in
hospital. Several patients have had gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea.
The chest x-ray abnormalities have been subtle initially, and despite
respiratory symptoms, some have had normal chest x-rays. As illness
progressed, most developed bilateral and symmetrical pulmonary
infiltrates. Total white blood cell counts have been slightly abnormal and
4 patients have been lymphopenic [low number of lymphocytes]. Most
patients have had some elevation in transaminases (AST/ALT/GGT 1- 3x upper
limit of normal) [these are indicative of liver abnormalities -
Mod.MPP]. Three patients have had elevations in creatine kinase [this is
indicative of muscle cell damage - Mod.MPP].

Addendum:

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
Case Definitions (Recommended by Health Canada as of 16 Mar 2003)

Suspect Case:

A person presenting with a history of:
- Fever (over 38 degrees Celsius)
AND
- One or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath,
difficulty breathing
AND
One or more of the following:
- Close contact* with a probable case
- Recent history of travel (within 10 days) to Asia, especially in areas
reporting cases of SARS (see below)

*Close contact means having cared for, lived with or had face-to-face
(within 1 metre) contact with, or having had direct contact with
respiratory secretions and/or body fluids of a person with SARS.

Probable Case:
A person meeting the suspect case definition together with severe
progressive respiratory illness suggestive of atypical pneumonia or acute
respiratory distress syndrome with no known cause.
OR
A person with an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death,
with an autopsy examination demonstrating the pathology of acute
respiratory distress syndrome with no known cause.

Comments:
- In addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, SARS may be associated
with other symptoms including: headache, myalgia, loss of appetite,
malaise, confusion, rash and diarrhea.
- Severe respiratory illness may be characterized by decreased oxygen
saturation requiring oxygen support including ventilation. Chest X-ray
abnormalities may or may not be present.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update
----------------------
As of 15 March 2003, reports of over 150 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS), an atypical pneumonia of unknown aetiology, have been
received by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 26 Feb 2003. WHO is
co-ordinating the international investigation of this outbreak and is
working closely with health authorities in the affected countries to
provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support as required.

SARS was first recognised on 26 Feb 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam. The causative
agent has yet to be identified. The main symptoms and signs include high
fever (greater than 38 degrees C), cough, shortness of breath or breathing
difficulties. A proportion of patients with SARS develop severe pneumonia;
some of whom have needed ventilator support. As of 15 Mar 2003, 4 deaths
have been reported.

As of 15 Mar 2003 the majority of cases have occurred in people who have
had very close contact with other cases and over 90 percent of cases have
occurred in health care workers.

The mode of transmission and the causative agent have yet to be determined.
Aerosol and/or droplet spread is possible as is transmission from body
fluids. Respiratory isolation, strict respiratory and mucosal barrier
nursing are recommended for cases. Cases should be treated as clinically
indicated. (see below for further details).

- Hospital Infection Control Guidance
- Management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)

An epidemic of atypical pneumonia had previously been reported by the
Chinese government starting in November 2002 in Guangdong Province. This
epidemic is reported to be under control.

Hanoi, Viet Nam

On 26 Feb 2003, a man (index case) was admitted to hospital in Hanoi with a
high fever, dry cough, myalgia and mild sore throat. Over the next 4 days
he developed increasing breathing difficulties, severe thrombocytopenia,
and signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and required ventilator
support. Despite intensive therapy he died on 13 Mar 2003 after being
transferred to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.

On 5 Mar 2003, seven health care workers who had cared for the index case
also became ill (high fever, myalgia, headache and less often sore throat).
The onset of illness ranged from 4 to 7 days after admission of the index case.

As of 15 Mar 2003, 43 cases have been reported in Viet Nam. At least 5 of
these patients are currently requiring ventilator support. Two deaths have
occurred. With the exception of one case (the son of a health care worker)
all cases to date have had direct contact with the hospital where the index
case had first received treatment.

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China

Influenza A(H5N1) reported in February

On 12 Mar 2003, 20 health care workers developed influenza-like symptoms
(high fever, headache and lower respiratory symptoms). Since then the
number of reported cases has increased daily.

As of 15 Mar 2003, over 100 reported cases have been hospitalised, at least
2 of whom are receiving ventilatory support. One death (index case from
Viet Nam) has been reported.

Singapore

On 13 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health in Singapore reported three cases of
SARS in people who had recently returned to Singapore after travelling to
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.

As of 15 Mar 2003, 13 additional cases have been reported. All 13 of these
cases have had very close contact with one or more of the initial three cases.

All 16 cases are reported to be in a stable condition and are being cared
for in isolation.

Thailand

As of 15 March 2003, one imported case has been reported in Thailand. The
case (a health care worker) travelled to Thailand on the 11 Mar 2003 from
Hanoi, Viet Nam. The case is known to have had close contact with the Hanoi
index case and to have been unwell on arrival in Thailand. The case was
immediately isolated on arrival in Thailand and reported to be in a stable
condition and is being cared for in isolation. There is no evidence of
transmission of SARS in Thailand.

Canada

As of 15 Mar 2003, 7 cases have been reported in Canada; 2 of whom have
died. The cases have occurred in 2 separate extended family clusters. In
both clusters at least one member of the family had travelled to Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region of China within a week of developing symptoms.

Philippines and Indonesia

Unconfirmed reports of a single case in the Philippines to date. However
one close contact of the Hanoi index case is under observation in an
isolation facility. This person is reported to be well.

Unconfirmed reports of a single case in Indonesia were received on the 15
Mar 2003. However further reports have confirmed that this person does not
fulfill the case definition. As of 16 Mar 2003, there are therefore no
reported cases in Indonesia.

New York, USA  Frankfurt, Germany

On 15 Mar 2003, a health care worker from Singapore who was visiting New
York boarded a flight from New York to Frankfurt. The health care worker
was known to be unwell and to have had recent close contact with a reported
case of SARS in Singapore. German health authorities were notified and the
health care worker was transferred to an isolation unit in Frankfurt as
soon as the flight landed. There is no evidence of transmission in Germany.

Laboratory Investigation

Various specimens have been collected from cases and post-mortum
examinations. A wide range of laboratory tests have been conducted to date
but no agent has been definitively identified. Laboratory investigations
are continuing.

International Response

WHO is assisting affected countries in responding to the various outbreaks.
Extensive epidemiological and clinical investigation are ongoing in all
affected countries.

WHO/ Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network team of epidemiologists,
case management, infection control experts and laboratory experts is
assisting the Vietnamese health authorities. The following organisations
are contributing personnel and materials to the Hanoi team:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States
Centre of International Health, Australia
Epicentre
Institut National de Veille Sanitaire, France
Institut Pasteur, France and Viet Nam
Médecins Sans Frontières
National Health Service, Department of Health, United Kingdom
Robert Koch Institute, Germany
Central Field Epidemiology Group Smittskyddsinstitutet (SMI), Sweden
Bilateral assistance has also been mobilised from France and Japan. WHO is
providing epidemiological support to health authorities in Hong Kong.

Travel Advice

There is presently no recommendations to restrict travel to any
destination. However, guidance has been issued by WHO and is available.
World Health Organization issues emergency travel advisory

Further Information

Throughout this outbreak, WHO plans to update its web site on a daily basis.

The illness, which carries flu-like symptoms, has killed 9 people, 7 in
Asia and 2 in North America. Its rapid spread in southeast Asia in recent
weeks caused a rare worldwide health alert to be issued on Saturday.

Health officials say it may be several more days before they are able to
identify the disease. However, they said several of its features suggest it
is caused by a virus, which can often be difficult to pinpoint quickly
using standard lab tests.

"Certainly influenza is on the minds of many people," said Dr. David
Heymann, communicable diseases chief for the World Health Organization.

Lab tests have ruled out some varieties of flu as well as some viruses that
cause hemorrhagic fever. However, many other possibilities remain, Heymann
said.

Those include "a new strain of influenza" or such exotic diseases as the
closely related Hendra and Nipah viruses both newly recognized, causing
flu-like symptoms and capable of being spread from animals to people.

Experts discounted the possibility that terrorism is the source and believe
it almost certainly is a contagious infection that spreads most easily from
victims to their doctors, nurses and families through coughing, sneezing
and other contact with nasal fluids. "Nothing about that pattern suggests
bioterrorism," said Dr. Julie Gerberding, head of the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

Officials said they are encouraged that some recent victims seem to be
recovering, although they are unsure whether that is because of the many
antibiotic and antiviral drugs they have been given or simply the natural
course of the disease. Heymann said 3 or 4 patients had stabilized enough
to be moved out of intensive care Sunday in Hanoi, Vietnam, although all
still had breathing problems.

The illness is being called "severe acute respiratory syndrome," or SARS.
The incubation period appears to be 3 to 7 days. It often begins with a
high fever and other flu-like symptoms, such as headache and sore throat.
Victims typically develop coughs, pneumonia, shortness of breath and other
breathing difficulties. Death results from respiratory failure.

The WHO estimates that perhaps 500 people in all have been sickened if an
earlier outbreak that peaked last month in Guangdong province in China
turns out to be part of the same disease, as they suspect it is.

Ninety percent of the most recent cases have been in health care workers.

The CDC prepared cards that were being given to travelers arriving from
Hanoi, Hong Kong or Guangdong province in China, warning they may have been
exposed. It recommended they see a doctor if they get a fever accompanied
by a cough or difficulty breathing over the next week.

Investigators suspect a virus is involved, because victims do not seem to
respond well to standard antibiotics, which kill only bacteria, and because
their white blood counts drop. That typically happens with viral infections
but not bacterial ones.

Tests so far have ruled out the H5N1 bird flu, which has popped up
occasionally in China [see ProMED-mail posting below] and which many fear
could be catastrophic if it spread widely among humans.

No cases have been confirmed in the United States, but Gerberding said the
CDC is checking out a few calls. The North American fatalities were a woman
and her son who died in Toronto after visiting Hong Kong.

A 32-year-old physician from Singapore suspected of having the disease was
taken off an airliner during a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany, on Saturday
after being in New York City for a medical conference. He was held in
quarantine, along with his mother, who had a fever, and his wife, who
remained healthy. However, on Sunday, the man's physician, Dr.
Hanns-Reinhardt Brodt, said he was uncertain the case was SARS; he was
treating him for ordinary pneumonia.

Also on Sunday, the WHO released a report from the China Ministry of Health
on the Guangdong outbreak, which said "the epidemic situation has been
controlled and the patients are being cured one by one."

In that outbreak, the Chinese said, most victims were young adults, and the
disease apparently was spread similarly to SARS. The outbreak peaked
between 3 Feb 2003 and 14 Feb 2003 in Guangzhou City and has since
decreased markedly.

The Chinese said 7 percent of patients required breathing tubes, but most
eventually got better, especially if they were not also infected with
bacteria. The disease seemed to weaken as it passed from person to person.

A Slovene woman might suffers from atypical pneumonia
-----------------
LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) - A Slovene woman, who came from Vietnam 10 days
ago, could suffer from a mysterious form of pneumonia that hit parts of
Asia recently, but her state is relatively good, the health minister, Dusan
Keber, said late Sunday.

Keber told national television that the woman, who came on a flight via
Paris, had "symptoms similar to those found in the cases recorded so far"
of the mystery disease that has claimed at least 9 lives so far. "There is
a high probability" that she suffers from the atypical pneumonia that has
sickened 150 people and caused four deaths in recent days, mainly in China,
Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam, Keber said.

Lab tests carried out on the unidentified woman "ruled out all other known
forms of pneumonia," Keber said. She was put under quarantine within the
Ljubljana clinic. People who were in contact with her are under medical
observation and were advised to stay home, Keber said. Asked about the
woman's health, Keber said she was "relatively fine."

This weekend, a 32-doctor was quarantined at a Frankfurt hospital and is
believed to be the first in Europe to be afflicted with the disease. If
confirmed, the Slovene woman would be the second case in Europe.

Known as acute respiratory syndrome, the disease has been declared a
"worldwide health threat" in a rare emergency warning by the World Health
Organization.

Experts are unsure if the cases are caused by bacteria or a virus and also
don't know whether any or all were caused by the same strain of disease.
Patients deteriorate quickly after initially coming down with simple
flu-like symptoms, doctors say.

Keber said doctors will keep examining the woman and a crisis headquarters
has been set up at the clinic.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Pablo Nart <p.nart@virgin.net>, Joe Shea
<josephshea@attbi.com>, Rashid Chotani <rchotani@jhsph.edu> for submitting
information on this unfolding outbreak.

The etiology of this outbreaks remains unknown. As information becomes
available, ProMED-mail will post the information. As mentioned in
yesterday's posting, we are trying to synthesize all information currently
available, and are attempting to avoid dissemination of rumors and
unfounded speculations, yet at the same time keep our readers informed on
current lines of thought.

In the above reports we have included official reports from
Ministries/Departments of Health, the WHO and 2 newswire reports of newly
suspected cases - one in Slovenia (reported by the Minister of Health) and
another case in Ontario Canada with a history of contact with the original
cases. Again as mentioned yesterday, we are in the early stages of
investigation of this outbreak of SARS, and therefore the numbers of
suspected cases will vary from report to report, with case numbers both
increasing and decreasing, especially as we are still in the influenza
season in the Northern Hemisphere so that febrile respiratory illness is
not an uncommon event. An example of this fluctuation is the now ruled out
report of a suspected case in Indonesia (see report [3] Worldwide update -
WHO).

We are very curious to learn more about the outbreak in Guangdong China as
information becomes available. ProMED-mail covered this outbreak in
February 2003 (see references below). The etiology of the outbreak in
Guangdong was not definitively identified, as only 2 of the serious cases
were reported to have had _chlamydia pneumoniae_ isolated as the
presumptive diagnosis for their unusual respiratory illness. If that
outbreak is shown to be related to this current outbreak of SARS, the
information in the newswire mentioning that 7 percent of cases (it is
unclear if the 7 percent is of all hospitalized cases or all cases) had
respiratory distress severe enough to require artificial ventilation is
somewhat more comforting than current speculations on SARS. The additional
curiosity is the last statement in the newswire "The disease seemed to
weaken as it passed from person to person." Might this suggest that humans
are not the natural host of this organism and attenuation of the organism
occurs with successive passage in humans???? (at the risk of an unfounded
speculation....) - Mod.MPP]
