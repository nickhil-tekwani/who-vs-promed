[1] Variant emergence
Date: Sun 1 Aug 2021

An analysis by British academics, published by the UK Government's official scientific advisory group, says that they believe it is "almost certain" that a SARS-Cov-2 variant will emerge that "leads to current vaccine failure". The analysis has not been peer-reviewed, the early research is theoretical, and does not provide any proof that such a variant is in circulation now. Documents like it are released "as pre-print publications that have provided the government with rapid evidence during an emergency". The paper is dated [Mon 26 Jul 2021], and was published by the British government on [Fri 30 Jul 2021].

The scientists write that because eradication of the virus is "unlikely", they have "high confidence" that variants will continue to emerge. They say it is "almost certain" that there will be "a gradual or punctuated accumulation of antigenic variation that eventually leads to current vaccine failure". They recommend that authorities continue to reduce virus transmission as much as possible to reduce the chance of a new, vaccine-resistant variant. They also recommend that research focus on new vaccines that not only prevent hospital admission and disease, but also "induce high and durable levels of mucosal immunity".

The goal, they say, should be "to reduce infection of and transmission from vaccinated individuals," and to "reduce the possibility of variant selection in vaccinated individuals." Research is already under way at several companies that make the COVID-19 vaccines to address new variants. The views were expressed in a paper "by group of academics on scenarios for the longer term evolution of SARS-CoV-2", and discussed and published by the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).

They write that some variants that have emerged over the past few months "show a reduced susceptibility to vaccine-acquired immunity, though none appears to escape entirely". But they caution that these variants emerged "before vaccination was widespread", and that "as vaccines become more widespread, the transmission advantage gained by a virus that can evade vaccine-acquired immunity will increase".

This is an issue that SAGE has warned about before. In minutes from its [7 Jul 2021] meeting, SAGE scientists wrote that "the combination of high prevalence and high levels of vaccination creates the conditions in which an immune escape variant is most likely to emerge". It said at the time that "the likelihood of this happening is unknown, but such a variant would present a significant risk both in the UK and internationally".

[2] Vaccine breakthrough Infections
Date: Fri 16 Jul 2021

ref: Magalis BR, Mavian C, Tagliamonte M, et al. SARS-CoV-2 infection of BNT162b2(mRNA)-vaccinated individuals is not restricted to variants of concern or high-risk exposure environments. medRxiv 2021.05.19.21257237; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257237

Abstract
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) has raised questions regarding the extent of protection of currently implemented vaccines. A total of 10 "vaccination breakthrough" infections were identified in Alachua County, Florida, among individuals fully vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine as a result of social or household transmission. Of them, 8 individuals presented mild symptoms in the absence of infection with other common respiratory viruses, confirmed using viral genetic sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were successfully generated for 5 of the vaccine breakthroughs and 399 individuals in the surrounding area and were included for reference-based phylogenetic investigation.

These 5 individuals were characterized by infection with both VOCs and low-frequency variants present within the surrounding population. Mutations, in the Spike glycoprotein, were consistent with their respective circulating lineages. However, we detected an additional mutation in Spike's N-terminal domain of a B.1.1.7 strain, present at low-frequency (around 1%) in the unvaccinated population, potentially affecting protein's stability and functionality. The findings highlight the critical need for continued testing and monitoring of infection among individuals regardless of vaccination status.

Discussion
A recent study in Israel reported that vaccinated individuals were disproportionally infected with VOCs relative to the unvaccinated population. Whereas we cannot exclude the impact of prevalence of VOCs within the Florida population on their rate of breakthrough, the findings of our study, collectively with [the mentioned publication], indicate limited protection of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (and potentially others) against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. It is important to note that none of the breakthrough individuals in this study was hospitalized, corroborating the vaccine's 100% efficacy against severe disease.

While these individuals presented with only mild symptoms (or no symptoms at all), the number of vaccine breakthrough cases might be expected to be under-reported. Hence, if we assume at least a minority of test-positive vaccinated individuals harbor infectious virus, the potential for hidden reservoirs within the global populations is increased. Hidden reservoirs in asymptomatic or mild symptomatic individuals, as has been proposed, pose a particular threat to early recognition of mutations of potential concern, such as the L18F mutation described herein, particularly once vaccination is more widespread. Moreover, given the effectiveness of the vaccine in limiting symptom presentation, vaccinated individuals may engage more frequently in social activities, increasing the risk of exposure.

Continued testing and case management, assessing contacts and exposure, for vaccinated individuals is thus encouraged and will be forthcoming in determining whether the vaccine is protective against ongoing evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2. This strategy is particularly important in the face of relaxed guidelines regarding masked protection and social distancing for vaccinated individuals, declared by the CDC as of May [2021].

[In the past 24 hours, 14 countries including India (40 784), Indonesia (37 284), Iran (32 511), UK (24 381), Russia (22 804), USA (21 768), Turkey (20 890), Brazil (20 503), France (19 600), Mexico (18 809), Thailand (18 027), Malaysia (17 150), Bangladesh (14 844), and Japan (12 230), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 7479 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 30 Jul 2021 to late 31 Jul 2021). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 52 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 5 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 16.18%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 52.5% increase in daily reported cases and a 29.8% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 198.92 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.24 million reported deaths - Mod.UBA]
