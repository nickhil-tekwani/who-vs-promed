Russia: anthrax in livestock and humans
---------------------------------------
There have been 11 cases of anthrax reported in East Siberia, and the
patients hospitalized in recent weeks.

Government officials claim the disease was initially found in some horses
and cattle in the area. Two horses have been reported dead through anthrax.

re: anthrax outbreak in Eastern Siberia?
----------------------------------------
I received the report from the Russian News information agency, referring
to a 43 year old lady who was charged with selling 200 kilos of horse meat
infected with the anthrax virus. She was arraigned on 21 Nov [2008] and the
case came up on 27 Dec [2008]. She will be sentenced next week and could
face up to 2 years in prison.

We are connected with the Russian owners of Argentine Beef Packers, who
alerted us to the situation.

I hope this information is useful to you.

[We are presently chasing down domestic reports of this event. If any
readers know anything about it, it would be appreciated if you would share
the information.

While anthrax outbreaks are not unknown in Eastern Siberia they are seldom
reported. Winter outbreaks can occur in grazing animals but the commonest
cause by far is contaminated livestock feed, sometimes stored forage/hay. -
