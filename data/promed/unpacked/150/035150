Saga Prefecture announced on [13 May 2022] that food poisoning caused by the parasite anisakis occurred due to the assortment of sashimi provided at the sushi restaurant "Janome Sushi" in Saga City. The store was ordered to suspend business for one day on the same day.

According to the Prefectural Health Division, a man in his 60s from Taku City ate a sashimi platter of sea bream, amberjack, flounder, mackerel, squid, and tuna at the store, and about 6 hours later, at around 1:00 a.m. on [10 May 2022], he had symptoms of sore throat and abdominal pain. It was determined that it was the cause of food poisoning because it coincides with the incubation period for anisakis.

There have been 2 cases of food poisoning in the prefecture this year [2022]. There were 12 cases in 2020 and 5 cases in 2009.

[_Anisakis_ spp. are nematode (worm) parasites found in saltwater fish worldwide, from the tropics to the arctic. For a general description including the life cycle see https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/anisakiasis/index.html, https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/anisakiasis/biology.html.

In the fish the larvae live around the intestines and when the fish die the larvae migrate to the muscles. To prevent that, the fish must be cleaned of internal organs as soon as possible after being caught. If that does not happen, the larvae can be ingested when consuming raw fish as in sushi and sashimi. In humans, the symptoms may cause intestinal discomfort, diarrhoea, and increased eosinophil count. - Mod.EP
