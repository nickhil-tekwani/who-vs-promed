Q&A: What now for a devastated industry?
----------------------------------------
1. Will there be more culls?
The confirmation of foot and mouth disease [FMD] on a 2nd farm in
Egham means Defra must now establish if any other animals came into
contact with the pigs and cattle on the 2nd farm. If they did, they
are likely to be culled as a precaution.
2. How did the animals become infected?
The virus in the new outbreak is the same as that which caused last
month's [August 2007] outbreak near Pirbright, 10 miles away from
Egham. The question now is how it got there. The most likely theories
are that it was carried on the wheels of vehicles, or that sheep or
wild deer carried the virus.
3. Could this be another leak from the Pirbright laboratories?
The August FMD outbreak was blamed on a leak from a cracked drainage
pipe at the Government's Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright.
That pipe has now been repaired and thorough checks put in place [See
also item 3]. But water from the original leak could have reached
Egham by now. .
4. Could it be sabotage?
There is no reason to believe at this stage that it was the work of a
saboteur, who would have been more likely to target pigs, not cattle,
as pigs are far more infectious once they contract FMD.
5. Could it have spread elsewhere?
It is possible that mud or straw from infected farms had been picked
up on vehicles and carried to almost anywhere before the new outbreak
was discovered, which is why a nationwide ban on livestock movements
is so essential.
6. What happens to the animals that were due to be sold at market?
For now, they must stay where they are. The government may well
decide to allow animals a "safe" distance from Surrey to be taken
directly to abattoirs, but if the ban stays in place for many weeks,
animals that are no longer of any value will have to be culled on their farms.
7. When will the ban on livestock movements be lifted?
Farmers in Scotland and Wales can already take livestock directly to
abattoirs. No decision has been taken on whether a similar move will
be made in England. Local bans will last at least a month.

Infected cows 'harboured virus for 2 weeks'
---------------------------------------------
A farmer who missed the symptoms of FMD in his cattle is thought to
be the most likely reason for the resurgence of the virus in Surrey.
[The type of cattle involved and their relevant husbandry have not
been disclosed. Generally, lactating dairy cows -- milked at least
twice daily -- are more likely to be detected than beef cattle,
particularly if grazing and not approached often. One of the 1st
clear signs of disease in dairy cattle is the sharp drop in milk
production. Beef cattle may manifest minimal clinical symptoms,
probably detectable by the professional eye but not by laymen and
from distance. - Mod.AS]
The Times has learnt that 50 cattle culled on Thursday [13 Sep 2007]
on suspicion of carrying the virus at Stroude Farm, Virginia Water,
may have been harbouring the disease for 10 to 14 days.
Unaware of this, Government vets allowed the animal movement ban that
was brought in after the August [2007] outbreak to be lifted last
week [3-7 Sep 2007] and declared the country "disease-free."
Dealers, agents and hauliers caught up in the livestock crisis and
unable to export or transport animals are planning a demonstration
outside the Pirbright scientific research centre. They are furious at
the lapse in biosecurity at the site that allowed the virus to
escape. They are not eligible for compensation for their losses.
Farmers elsewhere in England are angry about the latest lockdown on
their farms when Wales and Scotland have approved licences to send
animals to slaughter. South Wales is closer to Surrey than Northumberland.
Debby Reynolds, the Government's chief vet, is expected to approve
similar movements from farm to abattoir this weekend -- though only
outside the protection and surveillance zones. It may take a few more
days before licences are approved to allow farmers to move animals
for the next breeding season.
Stroude Farm was confirmed yesterday [14 Sep 2007] as the 2nd case in
the new wave of the disease. Test results on 800 pigs kept indoors on
the farm have not been released yet. Initially there was concern that
disease in these pigs might trigger a need for further slaughter on
adjacent farms and the use of vaccination to halt further spread. But
experts now believe that even if tests show that the pigs were
incubating the disease the risk of them releasing virus into the
environment in a way that could contaminate other farms is very low.
Old disease lesions were identified on the cattle owned by Ernie
Ward, a farmer in his seventies.* There was no one available for
comment at the Ward home. Mr. Ward is known to have followed
precautions and was extremely concerned about the disease in the
county. [* For DEFRA's 60-page manual "Foot and mouth disease: ageing
of lesions", updated January 2005, see
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/ageing-lesions.pdf>.
- Mod.AS]
In August [2007], he told his local news-sheet The Villager: "We have
about 50 cows and rely on them to earn a living. We are just keeping
our fingers crossed and hoping that it gets sorted out quickly. We
are not too far away from the surveillance boundary and are just
hoping it is not extended any further in our direction. All we can do
is follow the precautions and wait."
Government vets are still trying to find out how Mr. Ward's cattle
became infected with the disease and they are busy monitoring all
movements from his farm to see if there are any connections with the
August outbreak. The possibility of an illegal animal movement from
the surveillance zone in Surrey is being investigated.
Work is also continuing to see if the virus was spread in water from
a stream near the Pirbright centre, which feeds into the River Wey.
This river is next to fields at Milton Park Farm in nearby Ripley,
where cattle were confirmed to have the disease on Wednesday [12 Sep 2007].
The possibility that the virus was spread at the Royal Egham Show
over the August Bank Holiday weekend is now considered less plausible.
Gordon Brown had a meeting with farmers at the National Farmers'
Union office in London yesterday to hear the concerns of those caught
up in the new outbreak.
The Government is also working hard to restore export trade to the EU
from areas outside the controlled zones, but this outbreak must 1st
be brought under control and all disease eradicated.

[Detection of FMD-suspected animals is a professional undertaking.
During an outbreak, frequent visits of veterinarians to farms around
infected areas will probably enable early detection of disease. The
discontinued activity of many district veterinary investigation
centres in the UK, an unfortunate process which took place during the
80's, had devastative effect upon this vital surveillance system.
This has been demonstrated during several animal-health events since,
culminating during the 2001 FMD epizootic. Putting the blame on the
farmer -- whatever his/her age may be -- seems to this moderator
unfair. - Mod.AS]
