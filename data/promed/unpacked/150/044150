A total of 18 new cases of yellow fever [YF] have been registered in East and West Darfur by Thursday night, 22 Nov [2012], different sources informed Radio Dabanga. One of the victims has reportedly passed away.

East Darfur
-----------
The Governor of East Darfur, Abu Baker Hussein, announced the emergence of 4 new cases of yellow fever in the state on Thursday [22 Nov 2012]. Hussein said that according to the ministry of health, one of the infected victims recently died.

He explained that although the population has access to vaccines against the disease, there are not enough doses for everyone.

West Darfur
---------
On the same day, sources told Radio Dabanga that 14 people were infected with the disease in Mornei, West Darfur. They revealed that the hospital allocated extra wings to receive the 'large influx' of yellow fever patients.

A source from Mornei camp feared the disease might spread even further among residents, explaining that 260 people have been infected so far.

He revealed that the hospital in Mornei only has one doctor to treat all the cases of yellow fever and demanded that the displaced be transferred to El-Geneina for treatment, the state's capital.

[There are 2 statements in the report above that raise significant concerns: first, that there is not an adequate supply of the vaccine, and second, that cases are occurring in the Mornei refugee camp where the density of susceptible individuals is high, facilitating YF virus transmission. One hopes that the national and international groups that have just begun to carry out the vaccination campaign can deal quickly with these situations.
