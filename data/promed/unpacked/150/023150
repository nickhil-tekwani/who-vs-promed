[These last 2 outbreaks occurred in June 2015, and according to the report, were both resolved in July 2015. Comments in the epidemiological section of the report state that "All cases and some susceptible animals were destroyed and vaccination was introduced for all districts besides disinfection of the farms." However, this statement is not fully consistent with the quantitative information which indicates that there were 2791 cases and of these 2565 were destroyed.

Based on information published in the media during August, https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/viral-disease-threatens-livestock-al-ahsa-074652994.html, the outbreaks, which occurred in June 2015, would be different than the outbreak reported in August 2015 and posted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150804.3556416. See Mod.AS's comments in the same report.

It would be of interest to officially get information for this August event, and on whether or not there were other outbreaks detected. - Mod.CRD
