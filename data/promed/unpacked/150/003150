Health workers try to halt Iraq measles outbreak
------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of health workers are in Iraq's Anbar province to vaccinate 200
000 children against measles in a bid to contain an outbreak which has
already struck 100 children, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on
Tuesday [11 Mar 2008].

The 10 day campaign, which began on Sunday [9 Mar 2008], aims to protect
children against the highly-contagious disease which can cause
complications including blindness, encephalitis (a brain infection), and
pneumonia, it said. "Nearly 600 vaccinators are taking part in the
house-to-house drive and they are determined to reach every child under age
5 who missed routine vaccinations," WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a
news briefing in Geneva.

Fighting and insecurity in the past 3 years have isolated the western
province from the rest of the country, eroding its routine health services
and leading to a serious drop in vaccine coverage, according to the United
Nations health agency. Only one in 4 infants in Anbar had received the
measles vaccine at the end of 2007, it said.

The vaccination, which costs about 33 US cents per dose including the
syringe, will also offer protection against 2 other childhood diseases,
mumps, and rubella. The campaign, being carried out by the health ministry,
WHO and UNICEF, is being funded by the European Commission.
