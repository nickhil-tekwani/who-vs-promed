ANTHRAX, BOVINE - CANADA (MANITOBA)

During the week of 13 Jul 2009, anthrax was detected in 3 cattle
herds in southeastern Manitoba, in the RM [rural municipality] of
Franklin. One unvaccinated herd has lost a total of 16 cattle.
Another cattle herd that was vaccinated for anthrax has had one
animal die. The 3rd unvaccinated cattle herd also has had one death.
Overland flooding has occurred in this area in the spring which may
have allowed anthrax spores to be available to livestock grazing on
pasture.

Anthrax is a reportable disease in Canada. Producers must immediately
report any sudden deaths in their herds to their private
veterinarian, who in turn must notify the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA). When anthrax was diagnosed, the CFIA staff quarantined
the infected premises, ensured proper disposal of carcasses and
contaminated materials. CFIA provided vaccine to the remaining
susceptible livestock.

Canadian Food Inspection Agency staff have been using the US Navy
anthrax kits as part of a research trial on these kits for
presumptive diagnosis of anthrax in the field. The province of
Manitoba has been supporting CFIA by arranging a local producer
meeting and providing PCR testing at the Manitoba Veterinary Lab. For
confirmation of anthrax, samples are sent to the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency Lethbridge lab. The affected premises are located
in an area where anthrax has occurred in 2000 and 2006. In 2006,
there was a total of 22 positive premises and 148 livestock
mortalities in southeastern Manitoba. Anthrax vaccination in
livestock herds has been encouraged in the area.

The CFIA may pay producers an indemnity from CAD 100 to 500 [USD
92.25 to 461.31] for sheep, goats, swine, horses, cervids, bison and
cattle once it has confirmed that an animal has died of anthrax and
proper disposal and disinfection has occurred. This payment is
intended to encourage producers to report signs of the disease at the
earliest possible moment and to make sure that diseased animals pose
minimal risks to the environment, other animals and humans.

For updates on anthrax investigations in Canada, more information can
be found at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency website:

[Our thanks to Lynn for this report. Anthrax in vaccinated herds not
unusually involves animals acquired after the herd vaccination.
Another cause for apparent vaccine failure is in dairy herds with
cases of mastitis. Animals receiving antibiotics because of clinical
mastitis when vaccinated will nullify the live Sterne vaccine. We are
awaiting confirmation from Lethbridge of a possible 4th outbreak in
the same general area.

Franklin in southeast Manitoba is in the Roseau river drainage and a
continuation of counties at high risk in northwest Minnesota and
northeast North Dakota. There was severe flooding in this region at
the end of the winter and as a result anthrax was forecast as of
being a high risk this summer. There was extensive regional publicity
to encourage farmers and ranchers to get their stock vaccinated
before being puit out onto the summer grazing.

If you visit the CFIA website you will see that there was an outbreak
in early June 2009 in RM King George, Saskatchewan, involving one
herd southwest of Saskatoon and in an area afflicted in 2006. This
was reported on ProMED 20090630.2369. - Mod.MHJ
