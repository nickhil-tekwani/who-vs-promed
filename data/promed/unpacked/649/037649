As the cholera outbreak continues to cause concern in various quarters, Brunei's health chief
yesterday expressed confidence that the problem will be over before the upcoming SEA [South-
East Asian Games. Brunei is to host the 20th SEA Games this August. "As of Tuesday, 77 people
have been infected by cholera and only one is still undergoing treatment at the hospital," Dr Haji
Latif, [the Director of Medical and Health Services said. [He indicated that so far they are yet to
determine any specific area seriously infected by cholera and also the cause of the outbreak. "The
reports we have received so far showed that the cholera epidemic is not limited to one specific
area.
Reports showed that the cholera outbreak occurred in several places and kampongs, about 90 per
cent of them from the Brunei-Muara District... Many of them were infected after eating out or
after having eaten take-away food." Dr Haji Latif [said the first two cases came from [a school in
Bandar and soon after, 33 other students from the same school were also infected by cholera.
He also said 42 other persons were [subsequently infected and most of them got the disease after
eating out. He revealed [that so far 19 food outlets have already been closed while 7 of them have
reopened after they complied with hygiene and health requirements.

The death toll from a three-month-old cholera epidemic in isolated northeastern Cambodia has
reached 110, health officials said Friday. "In the last two weeks at least 10 more people have died
which brings the total toll to around 110," a health ministry official said.
The epidemic has struck the impoverished provinces of Ratanakiri and Stung Treng, populated
mainly by hill-tribe minority groups and recent returnees from refugee camps in Thailand, with
poor access to health facilities. However aid workers were cautious on whether the epidemic had
peaked. Together with the British NGO Health Unlimited and the Cambodian Red Cross, the IFRC
[International Federation of Red Cross & Red Crescent Societies is at the center of the
emergency response, and reports that seven of Ratanakiri's nine districts remain at high risk from
the disease.

The Department of Health [DOH confirmed today (Saturday) one case of cholera involving a 62-
year-old man. He is now in Prince Margaret Hospital and in stable condition. As the patient had
travelled outside Hong Kong during the incubation period, the case was classified an imported one.
He was suspected to have contracted the disease through the consumption of seafood not properly
cooked. In the meantime, his 16-year-old daughter also developed symptoms of cholera and was
listed as a suspected case. She was reported to have consumed seafood brought back by her father.
