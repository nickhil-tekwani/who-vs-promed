A 2nd anthrax case in 2006 has been confirmed in a South Dakota cattle
herd. State Veterinarian Sam Holland says the disease was recently detected
in Lincoln County, where 3 cows were lost in a herd of 51 unvaccinated cattle.
Doctor Holland says it's important to quickly quarantine herds when anthrax
is confirmed.
An earlier anthrax outbreak was found in a Hyde County cattle herd that had
not been vaccinated.
Anthrax spores can survive indefinitely in contaminated soil, and Holland
urges farmers and ranchers to vaccinate their cattle. More than 500 cattle,
bison and deer died from anthrax in 18 South Dakota counties during 2005.

[Anthrax spores can survive for long periods, but they are not immortal. In
acid soils it is merely for 14-18 months. In very limited studies we have
done they may die off in friendly soils at about 30 percent per year. On
the other hand Peter Turnbull found a positive cattle grave site in south
Dorset, UK, which had sufficient spores at the surface to kill some steers
60 years after the anthrax cow had been buried. This is probably an
exception, as otherwise we would have to vaccinate every cow everywhere
each year because of past outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ]

This farm is in an adjacent county but very close and actually "downstream"
in terms of watershed to farms experiencing anthrax in 1993. - Sam
NEWS RELEASE - ANTHRAX UPDATE, 15 Aug 2006
----------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed for the 2nd time in 2006 in South Dakota, with
the most recent case occurring in Lincoln County. Three beef cows were lost
in the herd of 51 unvaccinated animals.
Anthrax is a very serious quarantinable disease because it can cause the
rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time. Often animals
are found dead with no illness detected. Strict enforcement of quarantine
and proper burning and burying of carcasses suspected to have died from
Anthrax is important to prevent further soil contamination with the
bacterial spore.
Producers should consult their veterinarian and vaccinate their livestock
if deemed appropriate. "It would make good sense to continue to vaccinate
cattle and other livestock in the area for the next several years," states
Dr. Sam Holland, State Veterinarian.
Dr. Holland reports that Anthrax spores survive in contaminated soil
indefinitely, and that much of South Dakota has the potential of
experiencing an outbreak.
Significant climate changes such as drought, floods, and winds can expose
Anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Alkaline soils, high humidity and high
temperatures present conditions for the Anthrax spores to vegetate and
become infectious to grazing livestock.

[Whether _B. anthracis_ can meaningfully multiply in soil is a matter of
some controversy, whatever has been achieved in sterile laboratory
experiments. Minette & Dhanda in 1944 showed that while it could multiply
in sterile soil, given enough nutrients, it could not compete with other
soil bacteria. A proof of field multiplication would be to find an old
positive grave and check the genetic characteristics of recoveries over 1
meter apart. If no multiplication had occurred, the separate isolates
should be genetically identical; if mildly different, multiplication might
be assumed. If they were very different it would be evidence of the
original source being feed contamination. Over time spores will "lose"
their plasmids -- this can happen in 5-7 years -- and therefore plasmid
loss is just an indicator of time. Many thanks to Sam for the prompt
forwarding of his news release. - Mod.MHJ]
