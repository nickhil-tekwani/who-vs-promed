HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME UPDATE 2005 - AMERICAS (04)

[The CDC web-site

identifies hantaviruses in the New World as follows. North America:
Hantaviruses in the New World are associated with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS). Sigmodontine rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HPS
and are found throughout the Americas. Sin Nombre virus, carried by
_Peromyscus maniculatus_, is the predominant cause of HPS in the United
States and Canada. Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal
viruses also cause HPS and are found in eastern Canada and the eastern and
southeastern United States. In South and Central America, hantaviruses that
have been identified as causing HPS are Andes virus in Argentina and Chile;
Andes-like viruses, including Oran, Lechiguanas, and Hu39694 in Argentina;
Laguna Negra virus in Bolivia and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in Argentina;
Juquitiba virus in Brazil; and Choclo virus in Panama. Numerous other
hantaviruses have been identified but have not been linked to human
disease. - Mod.CP]

2 Hantavirus Patients from Southern Colorado Treated In New Mexico
-----------------------------------------------
The University of New Mexico Hospital is treating 2 more hantavirus
patients, bringing the total to 6 this year [2005]. A 61-year-old woman was
admitted on Sun 5 Jun 2005, and a 62-year-old woman was admitted on Wed 8
Jun 2005. Both of the women from southern Colorado were in critical
condition on Thu 9 Jun 2005, hospital spokesman Sam Giammo said. The
patients were put on a machine that oxygenates the blood and helps pump it
through the body, making up for the infection weakening the lungs and
heart. Giammo said the woman who was admitted earlier has been taken off
the machine.
Colorado isn't showing any particular "hot spot" for hantavirus cases,
according to Paul Ettestad, New Mexico's public health veterinarian. New
Mexico hasn't reported a hantavirus case this year [2005], but experts have
warned that the wet weather of winter and early spring could mean higher
populations of mice this year. Some experts have speculated that Colorado's
moisture showed up earlier than New Mexico's, and that this year's growth
of hantavirus cases to the north could be a preview of what might hit New
Mexico next year.
Hantavirus is passed to humans when they inhale particles of dried urine or
feces from infected rodents, especially deer mice. The problem most often
occurs when people enter buildings, such as cabins or sheds, that have been
closed for a while and have been infested by mice. The illness is marked by
fever, headache and muscle ache, possibly with chills, nausea and vomiting,
and progresses rapidly to severe difficulty in breathing and, in some
cases, death. Symptoms develop one to 6 weeks after exposure.
The disease was 1st identified in the Four Corners area in 1993, when 18
people got sick and 10 died. The outbreak led to the identification of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. New Mexico has recorded a total of 63 cases
of hantavirus. 27 of those cases have been fatal, according to numbers
released by the state in December 2004.

Case Information: HPS Case Count and Descriptive Statistics
-----------------------------------------------
Through Tue 3 May 2005, a total of 387 cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS) have been reported in the United States [rising to 389 with
the inclusion of the 2 Colorado cases]. The case count started when the
disease was 1st recognized in May 1993. 36 percent of all reported cases
have resulted in death. Of persons ill with HPS, 62 percent have been male,
38 percent female. The mean age of confirmed case patients is 38 years
(range: 10 to 83 years).
HPS can strike anyone; however, whites currently account for 78 percent of
all cases. American Indians account for about 19 percent of cases, African
Americans for 2 percent of cases, and Asians for one percent of cases.
About 13 percent of HPS cases have been reported among Hispanics (ethnicity
considered separately from race).
The temporal distribution of cases since 1992 shows a major peak that
corresponds to the outbreak that occurred in June and July of 1993 in the
Four Corners area (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah), where the
disease was 1st recognized. The distribution reflects a spring-summer
seasonality for identified cases, although cases occur throughout the year.
Cases have been reported in 30 states, including most of the western half
of the country and some eastern states as well. Over half of the confirmed
cases have been reported from areas outside the Four Corners area. About
3/4ths of patients with HPS have been residents of rural areas.

for temporal distribution of cases in the USA since 1st identification of
the disease. - Mods.CP/MPP]
Cases of HPS have also been reported in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada,
Chile, Panama, Paraguay, and Uruguay, making this syndrome a pan-American
zoonosis. For more information on hantavirus in these areas, see "Hantavirus
in South and Central America"
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/argtina.htm>).

is as follows:
