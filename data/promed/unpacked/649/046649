The number of people infected by the West Nile virus in Greece has risen to 10, the National Public Health Organization (NPHO) announced on Thursday [25 Jul 2019].

According to NPHO, 5 cases were recorded in only the past 5 days, while the 1st confirmed case was in late June [2019]. There [have been] no deaths linked to the virus so far.

It noted that the patients were all over 50 years old. The cases were reported in areas of northern Greece, while the Attika region was just added to the list.

The virus is reported to use wild birds as a main reservoir and was passed to humans via mosquito, rather than from or between infected humans.

Greek experts advised the public to take precautions against mosquitoes. The higher risk group that may exhibit more symptoms [includes] elderly people, patients with a suppressed immune system, and those with chronic illness.

In 2018, a record of 316 people were infected by the virus in the country, resulting in 50 fatal cases.

[The West Nile virus activity is on the rise with a number of cases reported from Greece and also from Romania and Italy. Keeping in view the high number of cases detected in 2018, continued viral, animal and entomological surveillance can help in planning and implementation of preventive and control measures. - Mod.UBA
