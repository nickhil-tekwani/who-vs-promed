The district veterinary department has sprung into action following reports that anthrax had claimed the lives of 4 sheep and one goat in Warangal's Chapala Banda village. As an immediate precaution, they have launched measures to stop the spread of the bacterial disease, although veterinarians have said that this was a common infection in livestock.

[S], a resident of Chapala Banda village in Duggondi mandal, said that he had purchased 5 sheep and one goat from an Anantapur trader at the local fair (santha), and on 26 Oct [2021], all 6 died. Veterinary doctors collected the samples and sent them to National Center for Laboratory Animal Sciences, Hyderabad, which confirmed that they had succumbed to anthrax.

Dr M. Balakrishan, joint director, district veterinary and animal husbandry, Warangal, said, "We immediately procured 9000 doses of vaccination against anthrax from Bengaluru and administered them on all goats and sheep in the 5 km [3.1 mi] radius. There were a total of 7800 goats and sheep in the mandal's 5 villages."

He said, "This bacterial disease is common in Rayalaseema, Nellore, and border regions of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka."

[While the veterinary department had 4 sheep and one goat, this report quotes the animals' owner as losing 5 sheep and one goat. Probably the difference is just that 4 dead sheep reached the diagnostic lab, and the index primary death was forgotten, the carcass unavailable. I doubt that all 6 animals were incubating anthrax. More likely, the index case died, and the others gathered around the carcass, licking up the extravasated blood that's common when livestock are killed by this disease. What is missing is any information as to the farm(s) of origin and how these market animals were at risk of a _Bacillus anthracis_ infection. While anthrax is claimed to be common, it is clearly under-recorded.
