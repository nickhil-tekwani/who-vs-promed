On a recent morning in Venezuela's southern jungle state of Bolivar, [AS], her 2 sons, one daughter-in-law, and a granddaughter lined up in front of a shabby community health center in the hope of receiving treatment for malaria. All 5 of them are afflicted by the mosquitoborne disease, which is rapidly spreading through Venezuela as an economic meltdown strips the country of medicine and doctors.

"We don't know if this is a curse, but the entire area is awash in malaria," said [AS], 56, suffering her 2nd bout of the illness in the last 3 months and relying on palliative herbal teas because she has not found regular drugs. The family was waiting with some 500 others under the scorching sun in the hope of receiving treatment.

Unsanitary conditions in Bolivar are thought to have led to a recent flare-up in malaria, a life-threatening disease that had been largely brought under control in Venezuela in the 1990s. The outbreak was likely initially caused by illegal mining. The miners cut down rainforests and often work in pools of stagnant water, which favors the spread of mosquitoes and malaria.

In data released earlier this year [2017], government statistics showed there were 240 613 cases of malaria last year [2016], up 76 per cent compared with 2015, with most in Bolivar. The government did not respond to a request for comment on the malaria outbreak.

On a visit to Bolivar in early November [2017], the vice minister for health, Moira Tovar, said the outbreak in the state would be controlled within 3 months. She said that 32 people had died during just one week in late October [2017]. "What are (these deaths) due to? They're due to people who are infected and who know about the illness but don't visit health centers on time. Instead they wait for the condition to worsen before seeking attention," she said.

The government has not given an overall death toll. But health activists and doctor groups estimate that around 200 people have died from malaria over the last year [2016] nationwide, and fear the illness is starting to afflict populated urban centers. "The mines have a high proportion of young adults, but their kids and pregnant partners are in the cities, and that's a bigger problem: the entire family is at risk of falling ill," said doctor and former health minister Jose Felix Oletta.

The regional arm of the World Health Organization last month [October 2017] announced the arrival of over one million anti-malarial pills, which doctors deem insufficient. Patients must visit their nearest health center up to 4 times to complete treatment in what officials say is an attempt to avoid feeding the black market for drugs.

Still, in Venezuela's shortages-hit economy, there is a black market for nearly everything. "In the mines they offer you pills for a gram and a half of gold," said a 28 year old cook in an illegal gold mine.

Others have turned to brewing bark from cinchona trees, which was popular during the colonial era for its antiseptic properties. "We're going to die because there is no treatment," said homemaker [YF], 29. Suffering from malaria, her 9 year old son sat on the floor in a health center because the waiting room was full.

[Malaria has surged in Venezuela over the few years. The key information here is that government statistics reported 240 613 cases of malaria in 2016, up 76 per cent compared with 2015, with most in Bolivar. Bolivar is the center of unorganized gold mining which leave plenty of breeding sites.

ProMED-mail also reported drug shortage in 2016 (Malaria - Venezuela (02): drug shortage. Archive Number: 20160906.4469225). The drug shortage is illustrated by this report describing how people boil bark from cinchona trees (the original source of quinine) to get some kind of treatment. This is a desperate measure with the extract not being standardized and with no knowledge of the quinine content.
