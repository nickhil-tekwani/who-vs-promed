[With reference to the 23 Mar 2001 posting entitled "Foot & mouth disease,
virus identification (02) 20010323.0577, we strongly object to the
second-to-last paragraph and the footnote alleging that the outbreak of FMD
in the UK originated from South Africa. These are unsubstantiated rumors to
which we have also formally objected to the Ministry of Agriculture
Fisheries and Food (who were not responsible for the rumors and have
reacted in a very responsible and scientific way to our objections).
We were also in the unfortunate situation in September 2000 to experience
an outbreak of FMD Virus Type O caused by swill obtained from a ship from
the East and fed to pigs. Before this incident South Africa was zoned free
from FMD without vaccination. It was the first time this virus was ever
diagnosed in South Africa. The last clinical case of the disease was
diagnosed on 23 Oct 2000. The outbreak has been well contained within the
original 15 km area of infection. South Africa has on its own immediately
stopped all exports from the risk area, KwaZulu-Natal Province. It is also
wrong to assume that foot and mouth disease is endemic to South Africa. The
disease in South Africa is only endemic within the Kruger National Park
bordering Mozambique and Zimbawe. Only the SAT FMD viruses are present in
carrier African buffalo.

Comment after the article from the Daily Telegraph: [There is a rumour that
the UK epidemic might have had its origins in South Africa. - Mod.MHJ This
is probably based on the 3 Mar 2001 issue of the Veterinary Record, pp
258-259: "Outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype O in the UK
caused by a pandemic strain" by Nick J Knowles, Alan R Samuel, Paul R
Davis, R Paul Kitching, and Alex I Donaldson (all of the Institute for
Animal Health (IAH), Pirbright Laboratory, Surrey).
The IAH had isolated and characterized the virus within days of the first
case reports. They compared gene sequences and in an "unrooted
neighbor-joining tree" figure, made clear that the closest homologue of the
UK isolate of the Pan Asia strain is the South African isolate [from the
September 2000 outbreak. It is quite difficult to access back issues of
the Vet Rec online. Reprints may be available from NJ Knowles
(<nick.knowles@bbsrc.ac.uk>).

[From the Veterinary Record article the difference between the South
African and Essex FMDv isolates is of the order of 0.2%. Otherwise the
nearest (at about 0.6% difference) is the virus responsible for the
Japanese outbreak in 2000. As the South African isolate would have come
from one of the earliest diagnosed outbreaks, a difference of this order
may be explained, if one outbreak was derived directly from the other, [by
time difference and genetic drift. On the other hand, the 2 viruses might
have had a common origin elsewhere. Dr Brueckner clearly insists that all
Pan Asian infected animals in KwaZulu-Natal Province were slaughtered in
late October 2000. The South African experience and the following report
show that there is an active undocumented international trade in meat and
meat products. - Mod.MHJ

Foot and mouth -- Smuggled meat blamed for epidemic
---------------------------------------------------
Smuggled meat served in a Chinese restaurant is being investigated as the
most likely source of the foot and mouth epidemic. Infected meat, probably
imported illegally from the Far East, went to [an unnamed restaurant in
the north east and the waste ended up in pigswill fed to pigs at
Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland, Nick Brown [minister of agriculture
will tell members of parliament [MPs today [27 Mar.
An official report on the source of the outbreak, to be published today [27
Mar, also finds that the spread of the disease was so marked because it
lay undetected in sheep for 2-3 weeks before the first case was spotted,
when pigs from Ronnie Waugh's farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall were taken to an
Essex abattoir for slaughter. The report was being highlighted by the
government yesterday as it struggled to show that it was gaining a grip on
the epidemic. The mass burial of animals began, with about 7500 sheep
tipped into a giant trench dug by the army in Cumbria.
Mr Brown will tell MPs that the epidemic would not have started had
pigswill been heated to 100 degrees Celsius, which would have killed the
virus. Fewer than 100 farmers are now licensed to use pigswill. It is fed
to only about 80 000 pigs [1.5 per cent of the industry and a ban on it
will be heralded in a separate official report today. A senior government
source said: "There is no place for it in modern farming".
The report on the spread of the disease also finds that the fact that it
was carried by sheep was the crucial difference [from the 1967 outbreak,
[meaning that the disease turned up in several areas. A government aide
said: "A sheep can easily cover 1000 miles a week as it passes from trader
to trader". Mr Brown will say that in future farmers must keep stock for 21
days for disease control purposes before moving them, on a ruling that
already applies to pigs.
The Times has been told that officials in the north east were alerted to
possible illegal activity after a container of illegal meat, clearly
labelled for a Chinese restaurant, was found concealed inside a load of
household goods after confirmation of the first cases of foot and mouth.
Officials are convinced that they are on the trail of a meat smuggling
operation that could have been going on for months and are urgently
verifying how waste food from Chinese restaurants was used as pigswill.
Northumberland County Council officials are meanwhile checking links
between Mr Waugh and a father and son, Andrew and Kenneth Clement of West
Craig Lea Farm, Roddymoor, Crook, County Durham, who collected 50 bins a
day of waste food from local schools, restaurants, and the local police
training college and passed it to swill processors. Mr Waugh is believed to
have received some of this waste, which is understood to have been boiled
by a third party. Andrew Clement was fined GBP 400 2 weeks ago for failing
to keep feeding records and for taking unprocessed food back to the farm.
Kenneth Clement was fined GBP 200 plus costs for the untreated food.
During their case at Bishop Auckland magistrates' court, Don McFall, the
defence lawyer, said there was nothing to suggest a link between the
offences and the outbreak. Mr Waugh maintained last night that he had used
the proper heat treatment on all his supplies before feeding them to his
pigs. He said: "I was still getting feed from Andrew Clement right up until
the day before MAFF inspectors told me my animals had the disease. He told
me he got the swill from restaurants and colleges in Newcastle. I would
boil it to the required temperature of 93.3 degrees and would continue to
boil it at that temperature for 4 hours before feeding it to the pigs as
recommended in guidelines."
