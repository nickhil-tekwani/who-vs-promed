Sigatoka affects banana production
----------------------------------
Black Sigatoka is one of the serious problems affecting the banana
sector of El Carmen [Manabi province]. An alarm was issued by Luciano
Marquinez, president of the national federation of banana producers
(FENAPROPE).

He said that 95 per cent of the total production is affected by this
disease which has begun to build up strength since April [2011]. El
Carmen is the largest banana producer at the national level but
performance has declined since the arrival of the fungus. Because of
the condition of the fruit, the decrease is almost 50 per cent.

Marquinez said he has talked to the Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock, Aquaculture and Fisheries (MAGAP) to spray, but the
topographical situation makes it difficult. Another request is that
farmers should do manual controls on their farms every week cutting
damaged leaves. However, this is hard work and unprofitable, and the
60 000 hectares [about 148 000 acres] could not be fully covered.

When asked about technical assistance, he replied, "We do not have
it. A technical banana unit has been created, but we only have a coach
who cannot be everywhere to control the disease," he said.

[Black sigatoka (BS; also called black leaf streak) is caused by the
fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species of
_Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of
bananas and plantains. It is present in parts of the Americas, China,
South East Asia, and parts of Africa. Several outbreaks in Australia
have been successfully eradicated. Infection occurs on the youngest
leaves of the plant during and immediately after unfurling. Older
leaves are not readily infected.

BS causes destruction of leaf tissue, which affects the
photosynthetic capabilities and therefore general vigour of the plant.
It can reduce yields by 50 per cent or more. Fruit produced on
diseased plants can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment and
cause further losses. It is spread by water, wind, and contaminated
materials (including suckers for planting). Disease management
includes phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, frequent
applications of fungicides, and cultural practices, but the high costs
of these measures make them essentially unavailable to smallholder
farmers.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS).
Symptoms of both diseases are similar, but YS is regarded as less
serious because it affects mainly on older leaves and so causes less
damage to photosynthetic tissue. Also, there are more crop cultivars
with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS. Wind borne spores may
spread both diseases over long distances and they continue to spread
in the Americas and Caribbean.
