Pig sample tests positive for human [influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009
virus infection]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department (AFCD) confirmed today (10 Dec 2009] that a nasal swab
sample taken at a local pig farm on 26 Nov 2009 was tested positive
for human swine influenza (pandemic influenza A H1N1) virus.

The pig farm is located in Kam Tin, Yuen Long, with around 1200 pigs
being raised on it. All pigs on the farm were found clinically
healthy during AFCD recent inspections. The farm's owner and farm
workers have no clinical signs of influenza. AFCD has informed the
Centre for Health Protection for necessary follow up action.

"As a precautionary measure, AFCD has stopped the farm to send the
batch of some 100 pigs, which contains the pig that tested positive
for A (H1N1) virus for slaughtering. AFCD has started collecting more
samples from pigs on this farm and all results are negative so far.
We will continue to monitor the farm closely," the spokesman said.

AFCD has collected samples from all local pig farms and they have
tested negative so far.

Other places have reported cases of [human influenza pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus infection] detected in pigs. Given the epidemiology of the
virus, its occurrence around the world, and the presence of many
confirmed human cases in Hong Kong, it is not unexpected that the
pandemic strain A (H1N1 ) virus has been found on a local pig farm.

AFCD will continue to regularly inspect and monitor the health
condition of pigs on local pig farms. Any pig with clinical signs of
swine influenza will be carefully examined and samples will be taken
for diagnosis.

"We have contacted local pig farmers and reminded them to stay
vigilant, strictly implement biosecurity measures and maintain good
farm and personal hygiene. Any abnormality in farms should be
reported to AFCD immediately. Pig farm owners and their workers
should seek medical attention if they feel unwell."

Advisory letter and health advice on the prevention of human
[influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] will be distributed
to farmers during inspections.

"The Government will launch the human (H1N1) influenza vaccination
programme on 21 Dec 2009. Those involved in pig farming and
slaughtering trade are among the target groups. We encourage them to
receive the vaccination as soon as possible," the spokesman said.

The spokesman said that the World Health Organisation, World
Organisation for Animal Health, and Codex Alimentarius Commission had
already stated that pork and pork products, which were handled
properly and thoroughly cooked were not a source of human swine
influenza infection. Human [influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus] is
killed under a temperature of 70 deg C [158 deg F] or above. It is
safe for the public to eat pork and pork products that are handled
properly and cooked thoroughly.

Heilongjiang Province, by National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory in the routine inspection before slaughtering."

The other focus involved dogs; the comments on the affected
population were: "2 [positive samples] were discovered among 52
samples, which were taken from clinical pets in Animal Hospital of
China Agriculture University."

The notification included the following epidemiological comments:
"All viruses were found during routine surveillance or inspection
according to the guidelines of Ministry of Agriculture and no other
