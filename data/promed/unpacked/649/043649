The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday [9 Jul 2009] the
strain of _E. coli_ [O157:H7] found in a sample of raw cookie dough
collected at a Nestle USA manufacturing plant does not match the
strain that has been linked to a 30-state outbreak, and they aren't
sure how the dough was contaminated. The FDA and the CDC have been
investigating whether the cookie dough was the source of the _E.
coli_ outbreak which has sickened at least 69 people in about 30 states.

In Jue 2009, Nestle voluntarily recalled all Toll House refrigerated
cookie dough products made at its Danville, Virginia, factory after
the FDA told Nestle it suspected consumers may have been exposed to
_E. coli_ bacteria after eating the dough raw.

On 29 Jun 2009, the FDA confirmed evidence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in a
retained production sample of 16.5 oz. Nestle Toll House refrigerated
chocolate chip cookie dough bar. But on Thursday [9 Jul 2009], FDA
spokesman Mike Herndon said tests on the dough, which came from an
unopened package, show the strains of _E. coli_ don't match the
strain linked to the outbreak. That could mean the dough may have
been contaminated with multiple strains. But neither the FDA nor
Nestle has discovered a probable source.

The FDA is working with the Glendale, California-based unit of
Switzerland-based Nestle SA on the investigation, which Herndon said
was ongoing. Nestle said that during federal investigators' visit to
the Danville plant, which lasted more than a week, the inspection
didn't turn up a connection to _E. coli_.

Nestle said inspectors observed that a gate valve used on a hopper
for dry ingredients required a smoother and more polished surface to
allow for easier cleaning. The FDA also noted condensation dripping
from a refrigeration pipe onto a large metal spatula used to scrape
cookie dough from the mixer. Both of the items were corrected, the
company said.

Nestle said more than 1000 tests have been performed at the Danville
facility, with the company dismantling its production lines for
thorough inspection, testing equipment and ingredients, and reviewing
its quality and food safety procedures.
