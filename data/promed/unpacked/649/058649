The Department of Health (DOH) on [Sat 5 Sep 2015], confirmed that monkeys held captive in an unnamed facility in the country have the Ebola Reston virus (RESTV).

In a press statement, Health Secretary Janette Garin said the virus can be transmitted by the monkeys to humans "without resulting in illness." The threat posed to healthy adults ranges from "low to none".

There are many types of [ebolavirus]. There is a type whose effect on animals is severe but does not affect humans. This is a possible case of Ebola Reston. This is the mildest and kindest type of Ebola for humans.

The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) already sent samples from the monkeys to Japan and Australia for confirmatory tests.

Garin described the facility as a "research lab and a breeding facility" for monkeys that is "not that open to the public."

There are currently 301 monkeys in the facility, some of which tested positive for ERV. Garin said there was an outbreak of measles in the facility a few weeks ago "which probably pulled down the resistance of many of the monkeys."

"The immediate action now is to quarantine the area, to prevent movement while we study the cause of the virus on the monkeys," Bureau of Animal Industry Director Rubina Cresencio said in a mix of English and Filipino.

To ensure the safety of 25 personnel in the unnamed facility, Garin said blood samples were collected from employees and were sent to the RITM for "ERV [RESTV] antibodies using ELISA or enzyme immunosorbent assay."

The results were negative.

The DOH will continue monitoring the health status of the staff employed in the same facility. The department also provided them with personal protective equipment.

Garin assured the public there is no need to panic. "I think the misinformation happened, the fear came from the fact that testing [was] being done at RITM. So most of the people think that when it's RITM, they do tests on people. But testing for Ebola [Reston], RITM has the equipment and the capacity," she said in a mix of English and Filipino.

The Philippines is said to be the only known geographic source of the only Ebola virus strain that does not cause disease in humans.

The 1st outbreak was detected in 1989 among laboratory monkeys in the USA. The source was traced to a Philippine exporter that shipped [unsuspected] infected monkeys to Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Texas.

[The genus _Ebolavirus_ was discovered in 1976, and so far includes 5 species, namely Zaire virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Tai Forest virus (TAFV) [also known as Cote d'Ivoire virus (CIEBOV)], Bundibugyo virus (BDOV), and Reston virus (RESTV). RESTV is the only one of those not associated with disease in humans, but it can cause illness in non-human primates and swine. These are the accepted abbreviations -- see Kuhn et al.
