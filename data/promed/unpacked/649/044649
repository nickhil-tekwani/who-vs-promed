Notice to Readers: Use of Onsite Technologies for Rapidly Assessing
Environmental _Bacillus anthracis_ Contamination on Surfaces in Buildings
------------------------------------------------
Environmental sampling to ascertain the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_
spores in buildings is an important tool for assessing risk for exposure.
Similar to diagnostic testing, culture with positive identification of _B.
anthracis_ (CDC culture method) is the confirmatory test. Laboratory-based
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for detecting genetic material of
_B. anthracis_ can be used in preliminary assessments and as adjuncts to
microbiologic methods. Although these tests are consistent with culture
results, PCR methods are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration,
and results should not be the basis for clinical decisions.

Rapid-assay devices that can provide results within minutes are used for
onsite detection of environmental contamination. Some of these devices are
PCR-based assays, and others are immune-based assays for _B. anthracis_.
CDC has not obtained validation data for rapid-assay devices. A recent CDC
evaluation of _B. anthracis_ contamination at the Brentwood postal facility
in the District of Columbia included use of one onsite PCR-based device and
CDC culture method. Of 107 samples analyzed using CDC culture method and
the PCR-based device, 95 (89%) were negative by both methods. Of 6 samples
identified as positive by CDC culture method, 2 were positive using the
PCR-based device. Of 8 samples identified as positive by the PCR-based
device, 2 were positive by CDC culture method. Although these results
indicate a poor agreement between results from the onsite PCR-based device
and CDC culture method, this assessment was not intended as a formal
validation test because of limited capacity to implement adequate
quality-control measures and the small number of _B. anthracis_ positive
samples.

The apparently poor agreement of the onsite PCR-based device could be
attributed to several factors such as the concentration of spores on
contaminated surfaces, sample collection and preparation procedures, sample
splitting, and the methods used for moving the sample from collection
material. Furthermore, PCR- or immune-based tests do not distinguish viable
from nonviable spores and can produce positive scores for samples that
culture methods would define as negative. As a result, these methods are
not useful for evaluating the success of disinfection techniques that do
not remove nonviable spores.

Public health officials are urged to understand the limitations of onsite,
rapid technologies for _B. anthracis_ before using them for public health
decision making. Until validation testing is complete and guidelines for
effective use are developed, PCR- or immune-based assay results for _B.
anthracis_ should not be used alone, but should be confirmed with samples
analyzed by culture methods to make public health decisions.

Background Noise?
-----------------
Now that things have calmed down a bit, I would be interested in opinions re:

1) Any info on the background rate of anthrax exposure. Given the ubiquity
of the organism worldwide, it would be useful to survey folks in, say,
Manitoba, Nebraska, and several other areas. Currently every positive swab
is considered "evidence" -- might not some of them be "natural background
noise?"

2) Years ago when I was a resident, finding Gram positive rods was usually
dismissed as a contaminant, "Oh, it's just some diphtheroids!" I wonder if
we haven't blamed culture negative sepsis (pneumococcal, or whatever) in
the past when actually there is a low "natural" rate of anthrax?

[Taking these points in turn: [1 Unless we are considering
occupational/industrial exposure from contaminated wools/hair/hides one
should not come across any _B. anthracis_ spores. Soil contamination is
very constricted even when considering buried hides at abandoned tanneries
or in areas with endemic livestock or wildlife anthrax. And in urban
environments there would not be any. The exceptions are rare indeed. [2 As
to "contaminants" in clinical samples, the reality of that I must leave to
my informed physician colleagues. How many cases of unsuspected human
anthrax will turn up is a matter for study. I suspect it will be very few
if any in regions where the disease is not known to be in livestock.
