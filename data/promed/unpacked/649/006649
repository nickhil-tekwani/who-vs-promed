INFECTION SPREAD TO DEVELOPED COUNTRIES BENEFICIAL?

From: "Peter English" <peter@fam-english.demon.co.uk>

Is it too fanciful (for ProMED) to speculate that the spread to the
"developed world" of diseases mainly associated with the "third world"
(flaviviruses, malaria, HIV...) might be a "good thing" in the long run, if
it means that the countries who can afford to look (for), identify and
implement cost-effective solutions are given an incentive to do so?

[Does anybody wish to take Peter up on this? HIV doesnÂ´t look to me like a
good augury for this thesis; it has resulted in the production of remedies
too expensive to use in the Third World. - Mod.JW]
