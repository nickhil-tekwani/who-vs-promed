Dear Colleagues,

For decades, researchers have been warning that human incursions into previously undeveloped areas significantly increase the threat from emerging diseases. Some tie the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa to the growing population of humans living and hunting on the edge of forested areas and consuming "bush meat" from infected animals. Similar dynamics may be at work in the increasing prevalence of "monkey malaria" in Malaysia and other Southeast Asia countries.

Research presented earlier this month at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) Meeting [2-6 Nov 2014] reported that the majority of malaria hospitalizations in Malaysia are now caused by a monkey-borne parasite once rarely seen in humans. In Malaysian Borneo in 2013, 68 percent of patients with malaria had been sickened by _Plasmodium knowlesi_, a virulent strain typically found in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaque monkeys. Increasingly associated with malaria deaths, this parasite caused severe malaria in Borneo at a rate 3 times that of the more common _P. falciparum_ parasite. In some remote areas of Malaysia, the researchers say _P. knowlesi_ causes all indigenous malaria cases. As the number of cases continues to increase, they warn human-to-human transmission by mosquitoes becomes increasingly possible.

Our understanding of emerging infectious diseases and their drivers -- our knowledge of how to prevent diseases and how to treat them when they strike -- evolves constantly. Keeping abreast of these changes is a daunting task. ProMED-mail makes it easier. ProMED is here to keep you informed of outbreaks when and where they happen. ProMED puts the news in context. Its analysis helps you understand what it means for you and your work, you and your world. ProMED supports a global network so that you get the news you need. To make sure ProMED is there when you need it, we need your help. Please donate to ProMED now at http://www.isid.org/donate/netathon2014F.shtml

A country with broad ecological diversity, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre reported that about 14 percent of Malaysia's animals and 23 percent of its plants exist in no other country. But Malaysia is also under intense development: it had the world's highest rate of forest loss between 2000 and 2012, losing more than 14 percent of its forest cover, an area larger than Denmark. The loss of forest means that ever more humans are living in close proximity to the wild macaques that have served as a reservoir for _P. knowlesi_. Deforestation and the introduction a new species (_Homo sapiens_) is the likely explanation for the growing number of monkey malaria infections in humans.

ProMED keeps subscribers up to date with the evolution and transformation of emerging diseases. It's the only source that you can rely on to keep you up to date on outbreak reports with uncensored, unfettered reporting. No other source of information covers the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal, and crop plant diseases so thoroughly. No other source covers the topic of infectious diseases so broadly, deeply, and internationally. To keep ProMED-mail uncensored, unfettered, and free, we need your help.

Finding solutions to the many challenges posed by malaria has always been difficult. The possible transition of monkey malaria from a zoonotic disease to one that passes from human to human adds to the complexity and will require substantial input of data, knowledge, and expertise from an international community of informed human and veterinary providers, public health experts, researchers, and scientists. This is our community. Please help ProMED keep the information flowing.
