Kenya: Rift Valley fever reported in Nairobi
-----------------------------------------------
Two cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF), a deadly viral disease that
broke out in northeastern Kenya in December 2006, have been reported
in the capital, Nairobi, despite assurances by health officials on
Wed 25 Jan 2007 that the disease had been contained.
Kariuki Njenga, a virologist and Laboratory Director for the United
States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Kenya and the Kenya
Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), described the 2 as "spot cases"
transferred from other parts of the country and said they did not
represent an escalation. "One was a journalist returning on Sunday
[21 Jan 2007] from an assignment in the Northeastern Province, while
the other was that of a man who had traveled to the city from
Kirinyaga [where the outbreak has also been reported]," he added.
Since the disease broke out, at least 220 cases, including 82 deaths,
have been reported in Northeastern and Coast provinces; a UN agency
said KEMRI had confirmed 56 of the cases, including 12 deaths.
The epicenters of the outbreak were the northeastern districts of
Garissa and Ijara, where the disease has also killed hundreds of
livestock, mostly goats, sheep and cattle. Coast Province, Wajir and
Tana River districts have also been affected, and local media reports
on Wed 25 Jan 2007 said the disease had spread to Kirinyaga and
Maragwa districts, which are close to Nairobi.
A Kenyan government ban on the sale and slaughter of livestock in
Northeastern Province, imposed in December 2006, has not been lifted.
"There is no pressure, and the Kenyan government is going to cope
should the disease spread beyond expectations," he said. "What I can
confirm now is that RVF is under control in Kenya."
The RVF virus is spread to humans from livestock via the _Aedes_
mosquito, which breeds rapidly during floods. Northeastern Province,
inhabited by nomadic herdsmen, was hit by devastating floods between
October and December 2006. The disease can also be transmitted
through contact with infected animal material such as blood or other
body fluids or organs. Consumption of milk, a staple for many
shepherds, is also a possible risk. Symptoms include bleeding through
the nose and mouth and liver failure.
The Ministry of Health has been working together with KEMRI and the
CDC to curb the spread of the disease. Njenga said Ministry officials
had managed to keep the RVF virus from spreading to other parts of
Kenya and to other countries in the region. He said health officials
were working around the clock to inform the public on how best to
keep the virus at bay. "We are working together and have increased
surveillance throughout the country, especially in livestock areas,"
Njenga said. He added that KEMRI and the CDC were analyzing samples
received from various parts of the country. No cases have been
confirmed in Ethiopia, although one spot [sporadic] case was reported
in Somalia," he said. "Spot cases are not uncommon in areas where RVF
is endemic, and the positive case in Somalia is one such example; it
does not represent an escalation of new cases.
Continued public education is the best tool available in the fight
against RVF," Njenga said. "We must teach the people how to handle
animal products, especially raw meat, carefully; to avoid consuming
uncooked meat; and use treated mosquito nets."
Northeastern Province was previously hit by an outbreak of RVF in
1997 after heavy flooding caused by the El Nino weather pattern. The
disease was 1st identified in Kenya in 1931. A 1st sign of it is
spontaneous abortions in sheep, goats and cattle.

Kenya: Rift Valley fever death toll rises to 148
-----------------------------------------------
53 more people have died in Kenya in the last week after an outbreak
of Rift Valley fever, bringing the death toll to 148, a government
spokesman said on Thu 25 Jan 2007. The contagious disease, which 1st
hit parts of Kenya's Northeastern and Coast provinces in mid-December
[2006], has now spread to the east African country's Central, Eastern
and Rift Valley provinces. Kenya has recorded 108 new human
infections since last week.
The disease, which is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites or
frequent contact with contaminated animals, causes victims to abort,
vomit blood or bleed to death. "We have spent over 100 million Kenya
shillings (USD 1.42 million) so far to provide the necessary
medicine. We have vaccinated 2 million cows and quarantined them. We
are also distributing mosquito nets," Kenya government spokesman
Alfred Mutua told a news conference.
He denied media reports that one case had been detected in Kenya's
capital, saying an infected person from one of the affected areas had
been admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital. "There are new cases in
Kitui central constituency, Kajiado and Kirinyaga," Mutua said.
Health officials at the Kenyan Dadaab refugee camp, a densely
populated camp near the border with Somalia, said last week 29 cases,
including 5 deaths, had been reported.
The Kenya government said last week it had spent 100 million Kenya
shillings (USD 1.42 million) to provide medical care and asked
Kenyans to avoid contact with animals, use mosquito nets and exercise
basic hygiene. The World Health Organization has said a dilapidated
infrastructure in the worst-hit areas would make treatment difficult
and feared the disease would spread quickly. A similar outbreak in
1997-1998 killed hundreds of people in Kenya.

[The preceding report from Kenya reported 2 cases of Rift Valley
fever in Nairobi, both considered to have originated elsewhere.
Clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]
[Vectors: Rift Valley fever virus can be spread by at least 31
mosquito species, and moreover has been isolated from 2 tick species,
including _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_ in Kenya, but mosquitoes
remain the most important arthropod vectors.
In Kenya isolations of the virus have been made from _Aedes
dalzieli_, _Ae. durbanensis_, _-Ae. mcintoshi_ (formerly called_ Ae.
lineatopennis_), _Culex antennatus_, _Cx. theileri_, _Cx.
zombaensis_, _Cx. rubinotus_, _Anopheles christyi_ and _An.
pharoensis_. At a guess the most important vectors in Kenya could
_Ae. mcintoshi_ and _Cx. antennatus_, both being common mosquitoes
that bite humans and which breed in pools and marshy areas
especially those having grassy vegetation. Adults of _Ae. mcintoshi_
bite mainly during the daytime, while those of _Cx. antennatus_ bite
mainly in the evenings and at night and therefore insecticide treated
bednets could offer considerable protection, although if biting was
experienced early in the evenings before people had gone to bed they
would be exposed to transmission. But what is needed is the
identification of the species transmitting Rift Valley fever so that
most appropriate actions can be taken to reduce transmission.
Also _Ae. circumluteolus_ a common mosquito in Kenya is a known
vector of Rift Valley fever virus in both Uganda and South Africa,
but I am unsure whether it is a proven vector in Kenya. Mod. MS]
