- Brazil (Sao Paulo State). 11 Jun 2011. The number of dengue cases
registered in the 1st 5 months of the year [2011] in Sao Paulo state
fell by 69.8 per cent in relation to the same period of 2010.
Specialists attribute the decline to the fact that the predominant
virus in this year's [2011] epidemic was [dengue virus] serotype 1,
the same type encountered in the summer of last year. Because of this,
a large portion of the population has immunity against it. Between
January - May of this year [2011], during this period, the state
Secretariat of Health registered 55 100 dengue cases and 21 deaths. In
2010, during the same period, there were 182 700 cases registered with
183 deaths.
