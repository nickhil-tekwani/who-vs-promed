The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) provides more details about the discovery of _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) in vine tomatoes in Westland [South Holland province]. The infection was found in a 2.8 hectare [6.9 acre] greenhouse, where 8% of the plants showed symptoms. The tomatoes also ripened more slowly.

Contamination with _Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV) has also been found in the crop. The symptoms may also be from the PepMV virus or from a mixed infection of both viruses. The source of the infection is unknown. A tracing study is being conducted to identify the potential source of the outbreak. In addition, a 2nd infection is now suspected, also in Westland.

This investigation is still in full swing. The NVWA holds consultations with representatives of the sector and information meetings are organized for growers. The Netherlands has informed the European Commission. Strict hygiene measures are imposed on the company to prevent further spread. The company must submit a plan of action for this for approval, the NVWA monitors compliance.

[ToBRFV
-------
_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was identified as a new member of genus _Tobamovirus_ after a new disease of tomatoes occurred in Jordan in 2015. Since then, it is also being reported from other regions and was shown to affect also capsicum crops. The virus has been added to the EPPO (European Plant Protection Organisation) quarantine alert list.

ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar, but may include chlorosis, mottling, and crinkling (rugosis) on leaves; necrotic spots on petioles and calyces; mottling, spots, and rugosis on fruit, making them unmarketable. On capsicum, leaf symptoms are similar, fruits may be deformed with yellow mottling or green stripes. Almost 100 percent incidence was reported for some outbreaks in tomato, but not every fruit on an infected plant may show symptoms. The Tm-22 resistance gene used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses (such as _Tomato mosaic virus_, TMV) does not appear to be effective against ToBRFV.

ToBRFV (like many tobamoviruses) is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means, contaminated equipment, as well as with plants or other materials. Recently, bumblebees which are used widely as commercial pollinators have been shown to be effective vectors of ToBRFV (see link below). Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weeds are likely reservoir hosts. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation and control of virus reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial. Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (for example, ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560).

PepMV
-----
_Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV, genus _Potexvirus_) was first identified on pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) in South America. It is spreading in the Americas and Europe and has also been reported from a few locations in Asia and Africa. PepMV can also infect potato and aubergine, but serious symptoms appear to occur only in tomato. Symptoms may include blotches and scarification on fruit, as well as mottling, distortion, and necrosis on leaves and young shoots. The virus can cause significant economic losses, especially in glasshouse tomatoes, due mainly to reduction of fruit quality. PepMV has been added to the EPPO A2 quarantine list.

PepMV spreads very rapidly and is highly contagious. Specific insect vectors have not been identified. The virus is transmitted by mechanical means (including contaminated tools, human and insect activities, plant-to-plant contact), grafting, and with infected plant material (including insufficiently cleaned seed batches containing contaminated plant debris). True seed transmission (that is, via the embryo rather than the seed coat) is uncommon in potexviruses and appears unlikely for PepMV, but more studies are needed. Disease management is usually focused on phytosanitation and use of certified clean seed and tomato explants.

Different strains of the virus exist for pepino and tomato. Coinfections have earlier been reported with _Potato virus S_ (genus _Carlavirus_) and _Tomato torrado virus_ (genus _Torradovirus_), association with the newly identified ToBRFV is reported for the 1st time above. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of these interactions with other viruses on crop damage.
