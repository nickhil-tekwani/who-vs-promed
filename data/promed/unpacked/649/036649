The commander of the northern military region, Brig. Raul Dique, a
high-ranking Mozambican Defence Force officer, has denounced the violation
of the country's territorial waters off the coast of the northern province
of Cabo Delgado by Tanzanian fishermen.
In an interview, he told the country's news agency that "Tanzanian citizens
enter Mozambican territorial waters, where they use explosives to catch
fish." "These situations have been detected along the Cabo Delgado coast,"
he said, adding that lack of resources "does not allow measures to be taken
against these violators of our maritime border." He explained that the
fishermen come in small boats, in broad daylight, knowing that there is no
maritime control in the country.
The ministry of agriculture and fisheries recently announced that, as from
1999, maritime control by satellite will come into use in Mozambique. This
project also includes the acquisition of a number of boats, to patrol the
2,500 km of Mozambican coastline.
Defence Minister Aguiar Mazula, however, believes that maritime control is
his ministry's job, "because we are aware that there are armed ships and
fishermen who operate in our territorial waters."
Cabo Delgado authorities believe that the use of explosive devices for
fishing caused the deaths of at least 49 people who consumed poisoned fish
in that province in November.

[Obviously a number of games are in play in Mozambique involving power, and
thus presumably funding, in relation to coastal fisheries, human health,
and defence. We have still to get confirmation as to the chemicals used, if
any. Also if Tanzanians were bombing Mozambique waters would they be
selling the fish in Mozambique or back in Tanzania. Similarly, is it
'Tanzanians' who are doing all the fell deeds? - Mod.MHJ
