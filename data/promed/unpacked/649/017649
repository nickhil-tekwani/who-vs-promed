[This is the 1st report of avian influenza infection in Guangxi
province. The infection with H5N1 virus was confirmed by the central
government laboratory. As with many other previously reported cases
of H5N1 infection in humans, the identification of a human case
pre-dated the official identification of H5N1 outbreaks among the
poultry in the geographic area of transmission of the viral infection
to a human case.
