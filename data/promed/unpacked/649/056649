A novel Orthobunyavirus-Infection in German cattle
--------------------------------------------------
Since August 2011 farmers and veterinarians in North Rhine-Westphalia
(Germany) and The Netherlands have reported clinical disease in cattle
and suspected a new introduction of Bluetongue disease. The main
clinical signs were fever and a significant drop of milk yield for
several days, in some cases also diarrhea and abortions. Samples were
submitted to the German national reference laboratory for bluetongue
disease at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Insel Riems.

Diagnostic analyses excluded BTV, FMDV, BVDV, BHV-1, MCFV or exotic
viruses like EHDV, Rift Valley fever virus or bovine ephemeral fever
virus.

Therefore, 3 pooled samples from a farm with acute signs of the
disease (fever greater than 40 C and milk drop of less than 50
percent) were investigated using metagenomic analysis with a Genome
Sequencer FLX instrument (ROCHE). The analysis yielded 6 sequence
fragments with homology to the L and the M segments of viruses from
the genus Orthobunyavirus. Further metagenomic analyses led to the
detection of sequences homologous to Orthobunyavirus S segment. The
sequences were related to genomic sequences of Shamonda-, Aino-, and
Akabane-virus, viruses which are mainly transmitted by Culicoides
spp.

The virus was provisionally named as "Schmallenberg-virus," according
to the location where the samples originated.

The investigation of about 100 samples from farms where the disease
was reported with a newly developed real-time RT-PCR targeting the L
segment demonstrated 9 positive animals in 4 different farms. Several
samples exhibited Cp values below 30.

At this moment, it can be stated that genomic sequences of a novel
Orthobunyavirus were detected in cattle in Germany. However, no causal
relationship between this virus and the observed clinical disease has
been established yet. Further investigations are ongoing including PCR
analysis of more samples, development of a serological assay, animal
experiments as well as attempts on virus isolation.

[At this stage the interesting findings of the FLI scientists deserve
to be regarded as preliminary; as stated, it remains to be further
investigated to find out if the syndrome in dairy cattle, reported
from north-west Germany and eastern Netherlands (see archived 20111115.3371), is directly or indirectly related to the (provisional
name) "Schmallenberg virus," which has yet to be isolated.

The 3 viruses indicated by the authors as most related to the newly
demonstrated virus are Shamonda-, Aino- and Akabane-virus, all
belonging to the Simbu group of the genus Orthobunyavirus, family
Bunyaviridae. This group is composed of 25 arthropod-born (Arbo)
viruses transmitted by mosquitoes and Culicoides biting midges. Simbu
group viruses have been isolated from hematophagous insects, fowls,
and mammals in Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America.

Several viruses of this group have been reported to cause diseases in
humans or domestic animals. The Oropouche virus is a causative agent
of human febrile illness in Central and South Americas. The Akabane
virus (AKAV) and Aino virus (AINOV) are known as the causative agents
of fetal deformity syndrome, accompanied by stillbirths and premature
births, in ruminants. Large outbreaks of such syndromes have been
reported from Australia, Japan, Israel and from other countries in
Asia and Africa. They do not appear to cause clinical signs, other
than abortions, in adult animals. The 3rd mentioned virus, Shamonda
virus, was isolated from Culicoides in Nigeria in the 1960s an in
south Japan in 2004; its disease-related significance in any animal or
human is yet to be elucidated (ref 1).

It took 15 years before the Akabane virus, initially isolated from
arthropods in Japan in 1960 to remain dormant in the virus collection
until 1974, was demonstrated to be, in fact, the causative agent of
the large outbreaks of Arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome, which
had been observed for decades in Australia and Japan. It is expected
that the profile of the new virus in Germany (and elsewhere in
Europe?!) be revealed soon -- whether related to the current disease
entity or not.

We are grateful to the FLI team for their firsthand, important
information and wish them early further success.
