EHV-1 Confirmed in DuPage County, Illinois
------------------------------------------
The Illinois Department of Agriculture has reported that several horses tested positive for neurologic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) late last month [January 2016].

"On 28 Jan 2016, the Bureau of Animal Health and Welfare received notification of laboratory confirmation of EHV-1 (neuropathogenic form) infection in horses being boarded at a private stable in DuPage County," the department said in a statement. "The stable has been placed under quarantine by state animal health officials. The source of the exposure is unknown. At the time of notification, 8 horses were affected with 2 being subsequently euthanized."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

New Mexico EHV Update: 28 Horses Test Positive
----------------------------------------------
The number of horses that have tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) at Sunland Park racetrack, in New Mexico, continues to rise, while officials in Arizona report that one horse euthanized after developing neurologic signs was confirmed positive for the virus.

In a [30 Jan 2016] update, the New Mexico Livestock Board reported that 28 horses have now tested positive for EHV-1 on nasal swab and/or whole blood testing.

"These horses are from 17 different barns within Sunland Park racetrack; at present, horses in surrounding areas have tested negative," the board's statement said. "Of these 28, 4 horses have been euthanized for progressive neurologic signs. No movement of horses is being allowed in or out of Sunland Park."

Meanwhile, official in Arizona also released an update on [30 Jan 2016] via the Equine Disease Communication Center on the potential EHV-1 cases at Turf Paradise racetrack.

"Three horses came out of Sunland in New Mexico prior to a quarantine being initiated on the track," the statement said. "These 3 horses had limited exposure to other horses prior to being moved into an isolation pen. Subsequently one horse did develop clinical neurologic signs and was put down. A necropsy was performed at University of Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Lab and samples submitted for testing."

That horse tested positive for the neurologic form of EHV-1, the statement said.

"Currently the track is under quarantine and will continue with racing yet no horses are allowed on or off the track other than those currently there. As of [30 Jan 2016], there are no new cases and the other 2 horses in isolation are not showing any signs of disease."

[For information on this disease, readers are encouraged to read my moderator comment in ProMED-mail post 20160124.3960827.

This is a very serious disease. It should not be taken lightly that this area is under quarantine.

Hopefully, someone at both of these locations is taking the temperature of these horses at least twice a day and recording it to determine whether it changes from one day to the next -- without depending on their memory. A slight rise in body temperature may be the earliest indication of this disease. - Mod.TG
