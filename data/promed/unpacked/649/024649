Yellow rust hits crops
----------------------
An airborne disease from across the border [with Pakistan] has hit
the standing wheat crop badly in all 15 border villages in this
district [Jammu]. Yellow rust disease, as the agricultural scientists
call it, has damaged the entire wheat and mustard crops on over 6000
acres [2428 ha]. Farmers have suffered huge losses. The government
has not assured them of any help so far.

This disease has rendered the plant yellow. The growth of the crop
has stopped. Even cobs developing in home gardens have been rendered
useless. Only yellow powder falls when the cobs are inspected.
"Yellow rust first hit the crops across the border. It is an airborne
fungus disease and fungicide could be used to check the disease,
though only in initial stages," said RR Jaat, Sher-e-Kashmir
University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology.

"All pesticides have proved ineffective as the effect of the disease
is growing by the day. Now, the plants are drying and even cattle are
not eating the crop," revealed Saudagar Singh of Dugh Channi village.
His wheat crop on 45 acres [18.2 ha] has been completely damaged. The
farmers have given up all hope. Santokh Singh of Chamyal village,
whose crop has been damaged, said "Village elders have told us that
such a thing has happened for the 1st time in our village."

Ashwani Kaul, sub-divisional agriculture officer, said as per reports
reaching his office the situation was grim. "We have tried our best
to help the farmers. We are in touch with the scientists also."

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereal crops is caused by
the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes
yellow leaf stripes, stunting of plants, and reduces grain production
with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some barley
varieties, triticale, and a number of grass species. Spores are wind
dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and
volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for
the next cropping season. New pathogen strains with increased
virulence have been reported in recent years from wheat growing areas
in Europe, North America, and Australia. Disease management includes
the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control
of volunteer wheat.

However, the cereal stripe rust fungus does not affect mustard
(_Brassica_ species), as is suggested in the item above, and the
damage on this crop must be due to a different pathogen. There are a
number of fungal pathogens affecting mustard, including white rust
caused by _Albugo candida_, and it is possible that this may be
causing the problem reported here. This fungus can affect most
species of the brassica family including cabbages and oilseed rape.
Symptoms on mustard include white blisters on lower and faint yellow
spots on upper leaf surfaces (which may have led to confusion with
the yellow rust on wheat crops in this region of India). During
flowering, deformities of the inflorescence develop ('stagheads') as
a result of systemic infection. Disease management includes cultural
and phytosanitary practices as well as fungicides.
