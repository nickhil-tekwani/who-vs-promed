As a field zoologist, I agree that the rate of exposure of mammal
collectors to bat bites, faeces, urine, aerosols, etc is very great. And
the disregard for exceptional -or even normal - precautions is also very
great. Particularly if compared with occasional contacts of people with
roosting bats in old houses or on trees.
A long time ago I suggested that it would be interesting to compare
antibodies in professionals who have a close contact with bats (and with
street-dogs) with samples from individuals living in rabies-free places. It
might enlighten us on the question of immunity to rabies.

[As one would not expect to find rabies antibodies in unvaccinated humans,
I doubt that a control group would be necessary. In fact we are unaware of
any documented subclinical exposures in unvaccinated individuals; however
titres have been noted in mongoose in Grenada with the seroprevalence
cycling in opposition to the numbers of rabid mongoose picked up on that
island. Thanks to a potential anamnestic response one might well expect
vaccinated and later exposed individuals to demonstrate titres well in
excess of those noted in unexposed vaccinated individuals. Unless anyone
has any hard evidence to offer on this subject of professional bat &
stray-dog handlers, this thread is cut. - Mod.MHJ
