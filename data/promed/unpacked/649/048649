The California State Department of Public Health on Friday [10 Jan 2014] confirmed that 7 people under the age of 65 have died from the H1N1 virus, also known as "swine flu." California health officials said they will continue to investigate 28 more deaths to see whether H1N1 was the cause.

Last month [December 2013], Texas health officials announced that 8 people were admitted to Conroe Regional Medical Center for influenza-like symptoms, and 4 had died. Officials there confirmed that 2 of the living patients have the H1N1 virus.

The Texas State Department of Health also conducts a weekly surveillance of the influenza virus, tracking mortality in pediatrics. As of Thursday [9 Jan 2013], the death toll for children has reached 5, and there are 1254 lab-tested positive cases of an influenza virus this week alone.

The H1N1 strain is the same virus that brought about the 2009 pandemic that mainly affected children, pregnant women, and the elderly. But it seems that this year [2014], mostly young, healthy adults (under age 65) are being infected and in some cases, fatally so.

It is known so far that in one California case, a 30-year-old man from Coachella Valley died this week. The Riverside County health officials are looking into whether he had a flu vaccine or whether there were other complications that could have attributed to his death.

February and March are peak times for flu season in many parts of the country, and experts expect the number of flu cases to rise. Health authorities say it is not too late to get a flu vaccine, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu shot.

"Some people wrongly believe that it is too far into the flu season," Dr. Cameron Kaiser, a Riverside County's public health officer told the LA Times. "That is not the case. There is still time, and the vaccine is readily available."

Dallas County Health and Human Services confirms Friday [10 Jan 2014] that 9 more flu-related deaths have been reported.

Prior to the latest news, the county had recorded 17 flu-related deaths. That total now stands at 26. Dallas County's latest report covers flu cases reported since mid-September [2013]. Patient information has not yet been released.

The Texas Department of State Health Services on Thursday [9 Jan 2014] unveiled a 30-second public service announcement featuring Texas First Lady Anita Perry urging people to get flu shots. This year's [2014] vaccine includes protection against H1N1, commonly known as swine flu.

Earlier in the day on Friday [10 Jan 2014], a flu-related death was confirmed in Denton County. Meanwhile, the death of a Fort Worth code compliance officer is being investigated as possibly flu-related.

Barnes Jewish Hospital now reports 9 flu deaths, but it's the young age and good health of the victims that really has them so concerned.

We always hear how the very young and the very old are the most at risk, and that is true, but Barnes Jewish Hospital has seen victims of the flu as young as their 20's.

About 35 people severely sick from the flu have been treated in the Barnes Jewish ICU; 9 people have died. Those victims range in age from their mid-20's to mid-60's.

Washington University Infectious Disease Doctor Steven Lawrence says Barnes Jewish began to see a sharp up-tick in flu cases about mid-December [2013].

Lawrence says it's not exactly the overall number of flu cases that's alarming, but the severity of the illnesses, the number of deaths, and the ages impacted.

"It's because of the nature of the H1N1 virus that we're seeing, very similar to 2009, it also can cause really severe disease in people that are relatively young and healthy. We're seeing some adults that are young adults, middle aged adults, without a lot of chronic health problems; some are getting very sick from it, Lawrence said."

Barnes-Jewish sees about a dozen new cases a day. We checked with SLU and Mercy hospitals. They have no confirmed deaths.

Lawrence urges people to get the flu shot; most of the patients who ended up here did not get one, and Lawrence says it is effective against H1N1.

Takashita E, Ejima M, Itoh R, Miura M, Ohnishi A, Nishimura H, Odagiri T, Tashiro M. A community cluster of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus exhibiting cross-resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir in Japan, November to December 2013.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Six influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were detected in Sapporo, Japan between November and December 2013. All 6 viruses possessed an H275Y substitution in the neuraminidase protein, which confers cross-resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir. No epidemiological link among the 6 cases could be identified; none of them had received neuraminidase inhibitors before specimen collection. The haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the 6 viruses were closely related to one another, suggesting clonal spread of a single resistant virus.

[The increasing numbers of deaths from these A(H1N1) virus infections is of concern. Mod.CP stated that, at this stage, it is difficult to estimate the validity of the assumption that the H1N1 seasonal influenza virus now in circulation in North America (but not elsewhere) is associated with more severe disease than in the previous year. The report from St. Louis suggests that it is, or is at least more severe than they observe usually.
