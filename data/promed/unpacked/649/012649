Cattle developed signs of rabies
--------------------------------
A quarantine has been imposed in the Kolosovskiy Region [district] of
the Omsk Oblast [province]. Transportation of meat into or out of the
region was banned after 4 cows died as a result of rabies virus
infection and 24 people who had been in contact with these animals are
being kept under medical observation.

The local TV channel has reported that all nearby farms in the
Kolosovskiy Region are also under quarantine. Nina Onishenko, a
veterinarian, stated that a suspected rabid cow had been identified
after examination of the herd. There was some suspicion at first that
this cow had been poisoned, and it was kept in isolation. Subsequently
this cow died and several others developed signs of rabies. People who
had been in contact with these animals were immunised as a
precautionary measure. The entire herd has now received rabies
vaccination and the pasture has been disinfected.

[The source of the infection, presumably contact with wild animals, is
not identified in this report. Further information would be appreciated.

The Omsk Oblast is located in the southern part of the West Siberian
Plain midway along the Irtysh River. It is a rolling plain with
elevations of 100-140 m (328-460 ft); ridged uplands (crests) are
typical of the southern half of the region, while broad expanses of
swamp are characteristic of the north.
