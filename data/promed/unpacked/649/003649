A deer-killing viral infection has been found for the 1st time in a deer in Washington state, according to the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

The deer was part of a herd east of Goldendale in Klickitat County, which shares a county line with Benton County.

Fish and Wildlife has been receiving reports of dead fawns from early July through August [2017]. Samples were collected and sent to Washington State University's Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, where the virus called adenovirus hemorrhagic disease was confirmed.

The disease, often referred to as AHD, can be deadly to deer, particularly fawns.

It does not pose a risk to people who eat meat from the animals, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. It also does not pose a risk to livestock or pets.

The disease previously has been reported in Oregon, including an outbreak earlier this year [2017] across the Columbia River from Klickitat County near The Dalles.

"This disease is common enough in California and other western states that we've likely had it before but just haven't been able to document it," said Kristin Mansfield, veterinarian for the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

It 1st was identified in deer in California in 1994.

Signs of infected deer include open-mouth breathing, drooling or foaming from the mouth, diarrhea, weakness and ulcers and abscesses in the mouth and throat, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.

It was confirmed in Oregon in 2001, and in 2002 an estimated 400 deer died from the virus in the Crooked River Ranch area of Central Oregon and near the town of Sisters, Ore.

The disease spreads in deer through direct contact, with symptoms or death usually happening in less than a week. There is no cure.

Transmission is more likely if many deer are present.

"For that reason we ask people not to concentrate deer by providing feed or water for them," said Stefanie Bergh, a Fish and Wildlife district biologist. "That is the best way we can help minimize the spread of this disease."

Although there are no known cases of humans getting sick from the virus, Oregon officials recommend wearing rubber gloves when handling carcasses and thoroughly cooking meat from animals in areas where the virus is present.

People in the Goldendale area who find dead deer or see deer with symptoms should report the animals to the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife at 360-696-6211.

[AHD is caused by an adenovirus. EHD (epizootic hemorrhagic disease) is caused by an orbivirus. They are different.

This particular adenovirus, capable of infecting both wild and captive cervids, was 1st recognized in California deer in around 1994. The virus is closely related to bovine adenovirus-3, but the biologic properties of the 2 viruses are clearly distinct, and it does not cause disease in other animals than deer.

Clinical signs of this disease in deer may be confused with some signs of pneumonia or even with bluetongue. Acutely, these signs may present themselves as diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, and open mouth breathing, and even drooling, which could lead to disease spread at feeding stations. These may progress to weakness, and the body cavity may fill with fluids. If this happens, death may occur within 3-5 days of initial exposure. If not, the animals may develop a chronic condition and present with abscesses and ulcers throughout the mouth and throat.

This disease killed several thousand animals in California and has killed more than 400 cervids in Oregon so far.

This virus seems to spread easily by direct animal-to-animal contact or contact with body fluids. The disease may be airborne, especially in dense or crowded populations, such as around feeders or water stations put out by people who enjoy watching the deer.

Hence, the public is being encouraged to cease feeding and watering wild deer to avoid tight groupings and crowding that may spread the disease. Likewise, proper disposal of deceased deer may be important. Please call the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife for specific recommendations regarding disposal of dead animals in your area. - Mod.TG
