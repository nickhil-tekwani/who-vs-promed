From: Simon Green <simgreen@robin.no>

The text of the pre-Green Paper review can be viewed by following the link
from the QUAFF web page at <http://www.robin.no/~simgreen> ,or directly on
the Passports for Pets page at:
<http://freespace.virgin.net/passports.forpets/greenpaper.html>
[The first site contains information on import regulations for the UK. It
is a good enough "surfing" site that you can quickly link to information on
not only import regulations from other European (and non European)
countries. A real nugget snatched from the surf is Stu MacDiarmid's case
study/risk assessment of importing rabies to New Zealand, which is a very
early example of the genre. We will see decision making concerning animal
and public health increasingly influenced by the results of quantitative
risk analysis. The second site is also informative but, like the former,
for those who really want in depth coverage of this question. -Mod. PC
