The recent plague case diagnosed in Georgia serves as a reminder that physicians throughout the country should be alert for the possibility of plague occurring in travelers coming from the western USA. In addition to the Georgia case, a 13-year-old girl died from plague in South Carolina in 1983 and a couple were hospitalized with plague in New York in 2002. All of these people resided in Santa Fe, New Mexico and informed the treating physician that they had the symptoms of plague. The death occurred because the potential diagnosis of plague was discounted by the physician. There is a high degree of awareness of the symptoms of plague among residents of northern New Mexico due to educational efforts by the state health department. However, travelers to the West and residents of other states are probably much less likely to recognize the symptoms of plague. Rapid diagnosis and treatment with effective antimicrobials is essential to survival. State health departments can arrange for diagnostic testing and provide recommendations for treatment.

An alternative explanation for a case of plague in someone who had not traveled to an endemic area would be exposure to someone who developed pneumonic plague after traveling to such an area. In that situation, the secondary case(s) would also have pneumonic plague.

[ProMED thanks our colleagues Dr. Lenoir and Dr. Hull for their comments. Certainly pneumonic plague can be acquired in a non-endemic area from another person who has pneumonic plague where the infection was acquired in an endemic area. Clearly, as well, a comprehensive travel history can be needed to suspect plague as well as a variety of infectious diseases including malaria, leishmaniasis and coccidioidomycosis. - Mod.LL]
