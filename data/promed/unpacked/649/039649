After a severe illness sends dozens of students home sick, attendance is back to normal today [29 Sep 2014] at Durand schools. More than 100 total students in the district were reported absent last week [week of 22 Sep 2014]. With Durand's football team being hardest hit by the illness. Right now there are 19 confirmed cases [now 21 - Mod.LL] of campylobacteriosis; all are members of the football team.

Now, Pepin County Health officials are trying to figure out how the spread started and where. The district and health department say things are looking up. It's homecoming week at the Durand High School and District Administrator, Greg Doverspike says the celebration is well needed after the events of last week [week of 22 Sep 2014]. "I was in the hall this morning [29 Sep 2014] before school, and it seemed like some of the kids had smiles back on faces," says Doverspike. "They're just kind of relieved to return to a normal week."

After last week's worries, he says the students' concerns this week are much more light hearted. Doverspike says, "They're worried about dress up days, and decorating halls, and floats, and all the other fun activities that go a long with Homecoming."

But the investigation into what caused the outbreak of campylobacteriosis within the district is still ongoing. Heidi Stewart, with the Pepin County Health Department said "Over 50 interviews have been completed of members of the football team, people around the football team, coaches staff and other people." However, Stewart says it does appear the number of kids getting ill is tapering off. "The students who were ill, are feeling better and returning. We're happy to say that things in town and at school seem to be returning to normal," Stewart says.

Doverspike says the district is keeping tabs on the football team. Friday's [3 Oct 2014] game is on, for now, it will make a decision on that later this week.

Stewart says other districts shouldn't worry about their players contracting the illness, because it is very hard to spread.

[Although it is stated that all the culture-positive cases are members of the high school football team, it is not clear how many of the ill but not cultured -- or not culture positive -- are also members of the team.
