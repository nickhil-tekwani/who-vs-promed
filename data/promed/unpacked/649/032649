About 300 Auckland buildings may be affected by a major outbreak of the potentially fatal legionnaires' disease. The outbreak has prompted urgent calls for building owners, mostly within the CBD [Central Business District], to overhaul mechanical ventilation systems that include cooling towers.

In the last 6 weeks, 9 cases of legionnaires' disease have been recorded in the [Auckland] region. A typical 6-week period would see one or 2 cases notified. The disease is a form of pneumonia that can be life threatening for some. The condition of the 9 people with the disease is not known. Symptoms can include headache, diarrhoea, dry cough, drowsiness, and delirium. It is treated with antibiotics, but most people who contract the disease are hospitalised.

"This is an urgent matter concerning the health of our population," said Dr Simon Baker, medical officer of health with the Auckland Regional Public Health Service [ARPHS]. Auckland Council has set up a rapid response team who are calling building owners to ensure they shock-dose treat their cooling systems.

The council has also called water treatment companies who have already treated some buildings today [3 Apr 2012]. Business owners and managers of buildings that contain an air conditioning tower or an industrial process that uses water to generate aerosols are being urged to immediately arrange shock-dosing of the systems. Baker said building managers had a responsibility to carry out the work, which means using a biocide to eliminate the _Legionella_ bacteria.

Concerned members of the public and building owners can get more information on the council's central building information line on (09) 353 9358. Those who have concerns about their health should contact their GP.

Ten people have needed hospital treatment during a major outbreak of the potentially fatal legionnaires' disease in Auckland. The disease, which typically has one or 2 cases notified in a 6 week-period, is a form of pneumonia that can be life-threatening for people with weakened immune systems.

Of the 10 who contracted the disease 4 were admitted to North Shore Hospital. 2 were discharged over the weekend [31 Mar-1 Apr 2012], while the other 2 remain in serious but stable conditions. Middlemore Hospital confirmed 3 patients with legionnaires' had been hospitalised there over the past 6 weeks, but they had all been discharged. One person was treated at Auckland City Hospital. It is unclear where the remaining 2 cases were treated.

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service [ARPHS] confirmed all 10 patients with the disease contracted it from a water source, which may include air conditioning systems in buildings. There have been previous outbreaks of the disease from contaminated potting mix, but that is not thought to be a source of the Auckland outbreak.

Business owners and managers of buildings that contain an air conditioning tower or an industrial process that uses water to generate aerosols are being urged to immediately arrange shock-dosing of the systems. It is believed around 300 buildings across the city may be affected. "This is an urgent matter concerning the health of our population," said Dr Simon Baker, medical officer of health with the ARPHS. Auckland Council has set up a rapid response team who are calling building owners to ensure they treat their cooling systems. The council has also called water treatment companies, which have already treated some buildings today. Baker said building managers had a responsibility to carry out the work, which means using a biocide to eliminate the _Legionella_ bacteria.

More information is available via the council's central building information line on 09 353 9358. Those who have concerns about their health should contact their GP.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram negative bacillus of the genus _Legionella_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the disease; more than 70 per cent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 per cent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 per cent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8; available at http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf).

Legionnaires' disease is acquired by inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Usually a building's contaminated water system is incriminated as the source. _Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing systems and in cooling towers. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in groceries, fountains, and car washing facilities, as well as cooling towers.

However, in Australia and New Zealand, legionnaires' disease has been associated with gardening and exposure to potting mix and compost; in these countries _L. longbeachae_ has been commonly found in potting mix, compost, and soil, and cultured from the respiratory specimens of patients with sporadic community-acquired pneumonia.

ProMED-mail reported 2 outbreaks of legionellosis in 2011 in New Zealand, one in Marlborough and the other in Canterbury, both on the South Island (Legionellosis - New Zealand (03): (MA) 20110530.1658, Legionellosis - New Zealand (02): (MA) 20110525.1586, and Legionellosis - New Zealand: (CA) potting soil, alert 20110116.0189). The outbreak in Marlborough was attributed to aerosolization of _Legionella_ from a cooling tower and the outbreak in Canterbury was attributed to aerosolization of _Legionella_ from potting mix and compost.

The 10 cases of Legionnaires' disease in the current outbreak are said to have occurred across the Auckland region in the past 6 weeks (see http://www.examiner.com/infectious-disease-in-national/auckland-public-health-issues-legionella-health-warning). The 2nd article above says that the patients were believed to have contracted the disease from a water source, not contaminated potting mix, without specifying why. No mention is made of the _Legionella_ species involved in this outbreak or if a common genotype is involved.

The 1st article above says that remediation efforts are being concentrated on "mechanical ventilation systems that include cooling towers" in the Auckland Central Business District. However, no mention is made of any linkage of the cases to the Central Business District, nor is any linkage to cooling towers mentioned.

The Auckland Region is on the North Island; it is one of the 16 regions of New Zealand, with a population of almost 1.5 million (one third of the nation's residents) in 2011, and is the country's largest urban area, which encompasses the Auckland metropolitan area, smaller towns, rural areas, and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Region). The Auckland Central Business District is densely built-up, with high-rise buildings mainly used for commercial and retail uses, although there are residential high-density buildings and a population of about 40 000 residents (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_CBD).
