Epidemic syndromes due to Zika virus
------------------------------------
The cases are reported in the Society, Marquesas and Tuamotu Islands since week 41 [7-13 Oct 2013]. The number of cases is currently estimated at about 400, but the investigation is still ongoing. The islands affected are: Tahiti, Moorea, Raiatea, Tahaa, Bora Bora, Nuku Hiva and Arutua.

The signs are in initially a descending facial rash with itchy, urticarial or morbilliform lesions on limbs, accompanied inconsistently moderate fever, conjunctival hyperemia, arthralgia, myalgia, gastrointestinal disorders and distal edema. The duration of signs is [usually] 5-7 days, and the progression is self-limiting. [However, debilitating arthralgia may continue for many weeks or months. - Mod.TY]

[Zika virus infections have appeared again in Pacific islands. There was a major outbreak of Zika virus infections on Yap and nearby islands of the Federated Republic of Micronesia in 2007. The vector mosquito of this flavivirus virus was not determined. It would be interesting to know if the mosquito vectors of Zika virus in the outbreak above have been determined.

ProMED thanks Dr. Mallet for calling this report to our attention.
