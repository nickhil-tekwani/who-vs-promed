[1] Kazakhstan: increases allocation to fight Ebola

The government of Kazakhstan has decided to increase 6-fold its contribution to fighting the [Ebola] epidemic, the Central Asian country's foreign ministry announced Fri [26 Dec 2014]. Astana is to provide USD 300 000 to the African Union's special project to fight Ebola in addition to an earlier transfer of USD 50 000 to the UN Ebola Trust Fund, the ministry said.

Kazakhstan has been an AU [African Union] observer-state since 2013. Earlier this month [December 2014], Kazakhstan reaffirmed its commitment to aid the global drive to control the Ebola epidemic during a meeting between Kazakh foreign minister Erlan Idrissov and US secretary of state John Kerry in Washington.

Although Kazakhstan is Ebola-free and has no direct air links with West Africa, Kazakh health authorities have put in place a plan of action as a precautionary measure that includes special health services at airports and the screening of suspected patients...

Doctors, healthcare workers to help combat Ebola outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------
Myanmar is planning to send doctors and healthcare staff to Ebola-hit West African countries, said deputy director general Dr Soe Lwin Nyein from the Department of Health. The Ministry of Health is selecting the doctors and healthcare staff for that mission. According to Soe Lwin Nyein, the medical staff will be sent to Liberia and Sierra Leone where the Ebola outbreak is the highest and both countries are urgently in need of 5000 healthcare workers and nearly 700 doctors. Other Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries are also planning to send healthcare workers to West Africa...

[3] PAHO readies region for Ebola

PAHO readies region for potential importation of Ebola
------------------------------------------------------
The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) says it is preparing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean for potential importations of the Ebola virus from West Africa. PAHO said that it is doing so, even though the USA is the only country in the Americas, including the Caribbean, which has to date registered cases of the virus. "Given that the possibility of an imported case in Latin America or the Caribbean cannot be discarded, PAHO has been working with its member countries to ensure they can respond rapidly and effectively if such a case appears," the statement said. To date, PAHO said teams of experts and partner organisations have travelled to some 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to provide technical support as needed for Ebola preparedness efforts. It said Cuban health-care workers have received training before travelling to West Africa to help with the Ebola response there.

PAHO said it has trained medical and nursing professionals in the epidemiology of the virus and in case detection and management. It said proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is the most important measure for preventing transmission to health workers assigned to care for Ebola patients...

Participants in the exercise are expected to train others in their own countries, said PAHO, adding that experts in laboratory diagnosis and management of biological risks were convened to analyse procedure for safe management of Ebola and suspected Ebola samples and to define protocols for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring...

[4] What Ebola has taught us
Date: Fri 26 Dec 2014
Source: Chicago Tribune [edited]
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-ebola-nih-cdc-who-sierra-leone-nigeria-osterholm-edit-1229-jm-20141226-story.html?dssReturn&z=12203


Ebola still ravages parts of West Africa, but the trajectory of the disease is leveling off, even falling in some places. Nigeria has declared itself Ebola-free. Infections in hard-hit Liberia are reported to be declining; some treatment facilities now boast of a welcome sight: empty beds. But in Sierra Leone, cases continue to climb, though not at the frightening exponential rate of weeks ago. Overall, the worldwide Ebola death toll in this epidemic stands at more than 7500 out of close to 20 000 reported cases.

[In the US], no new cases have been confirmed for weeks. Hospitals and the public health system haven't yet been tested by large numbers of Ebola patients. Most of the handful of those who were treated have recovered, a testament to effective medical intervention against a disease with no proven cure or vaccine.

Time to run up the "Ebola Mission Accomplished!" banner? Not yet
----------------------------------------------------------------
"In many ways we're still in the fog of war, in understanding what is happening over there," University of Minnesota infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm tells us. He says the early estimates of up to 10 000 new cases a week were "out of whack." But, no matter what the numbers say, "we're still not close to bringing it under control." The US is building new hospital facilities in West Africa, but Osterholm warns that there has been a decline in the number of health care workers trekking there to help local officials battle the virus. "You can have all the beds in the world, but if you don't have workers, you're not going to get much improvement." That's one lesson Ebola teaches.

Others: We've learned how the virus can be slowed and defeated:
- catch it early [that is, diagnose it early. - Mod.SH];
- treat it aggressively;
- track contacts;
- isolate patients;
- publicize your success stories;
- safely bury your dead.

Nigerian officials stifled an Ebola outbreak by quickly training health care workers on how to manage the disease and what to tell people, and by preparing the country for what to expect, Time magazine reports. Nigeria's leaders declared an emergency as soon as the country had its 1st confirmed case, triggering an aggressive program to trace all people who had contact with infected patients. That's the best way to squelch a burgeoning epidemic. Nigeria also tamped down panic by drawing attention to the cases of people who had been successfully treated and released from hospitals. That encouraged people to get treatment, not to hide from doctors and aid workers. Is Nigeria standing down? No. The health system is "ready to jump into action at all levels," Dr Faisal Shuaib of the country's Ebola Emergency Operation Center, tells Time. "There is no alternative to preparedness."

The race to find effective Ebola drugs is now in full swing. That quest was stymied for years for lack of financial incentives: not enough patients, not enough demand to justify huge investments by pharmaceutical researchers. The same is true for an Ebola vaccine. National Institutes of Health researchers said recently that a possible Ebola virus vaccine appears to be safe in preliminary testing. A clinical study should proceed as planned, early in 2015. "A vaccine will be critical to putting this virus out once and for all," Osterholm says. Ebola research that was meandering along, or had been shelved entirely, is now front and center. It needs to stay there.

World Health Organization [WHO] officials acknowledged recently that they won't achieve their ambitious year-end goal of isolating and treating all patients and safely burying the dead. The organization is doubling the number of experts to help assist community workers. Good. The US -- the world -- can't lose a sense of urgency in the effort to defeat Ebola...

Even in light of the overall decrease in case load and diminishing media attention, it is important that the global community not drop its vigilance in fighting Ebola, and governments not halt financial and logistical support to control this disease at its source in West Africa. - Mod.LK
