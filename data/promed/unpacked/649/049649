Salmonella outbreak linked to raw milk sold in Midway [Utah]
------------------------------------------------------------
A recent rash of salmonellosis has been linked to raw milk purchased at Heber Valley Milk in Midway in Wasatch County, Utah, health officials said on Tuesday 30 Aug 2016. Officials are investigating 9 cases of people sickened by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Saintpaul. All drank raw milk from Heber Valley Milk, according to Utah Department of Health spokeswoman Becky Ward.

A raw milk sample collected at the dairy by a Utah Department of Agriculture and Food inspector tested positive for _S._ Saintpaul last week, Ward said. The dairy has been allowed to resume sales after the most recent testing showed no signs of salmonella.

Utah Department of Health epidemiologist Cindy Burnett said the outbreak "doesn't signify any problem at the dairy. The problem is raw milk," Burnett said.

Public health officials have long warned people not to drink raw milk, which has not been pasteurized. Officials say there is no easy way for consumers to know whether the milk contains disease-causing bacteria. But Burnett said people have shown increasing interest in less-processed foods that are "closer to the farm", such as raw milk. "We just want to remind the public that in this case, raw milk is not a healthier alternative and pasteurization was put in place for a very good reason," Burnett said.

Since 2009, health officials have documented 30 outbreaks associated with raw milk sold at Utah dairies. In this recent cluster of cases, the patients range in age from 15 to 78 years old and became ill between 20 Mar 2016 and 14 Aug 2016, according to Ward. She said 2 people were hospitalized, but both have recovered.

[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), listeria (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ spp, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ spp, _Yersinia_ spp, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.

The following (http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/08/study-finds-amazing-bacterial-diversity-in-californias-raw-milk/) is a recent report involving the bacterial diversity of raw milk (interestingly the classical Enterobacteriaceae such as _E. coli_, salmonella and campylobacter were not found):

Researchers at the University of California-Davis report that samples of raw cow's milk shipped by tanker truck for processing show "amazing bacterial diversity" which varies by season. Their findings were reported [23 Aug 2016] in mBio, the online, open-access journal of the American Society of Microbiology. The researchers sampled and analyzed raw cow's milk from 899 tanker trucks as they arrived at 2 dairy processors in California's San Joaquin Valley during spring, summer and fall. The samples were analyzed using gene sequencing. This collection included 229 tankers filled in the fall of 2013 and another 264 and 406 tankers filled in the spring and summer of 2014, respectively. The larger set of samples collected in the summer included milk collected from 2 sampling dates a week apart.

"The level of bacterial diversity that we discovered in these shipments of raw milk was amazing," said lead author and microbiologist Maria Marco, an associate professor in the UC-Davis Department of Food Science and Technology. "More than half of the bacterial groups identified represented less than 1 percent of the total microbial content." She said the broad mix of bacteria could be due to raw milk's high nutrient content, as well as the many potential sources of bacteria associated with dairies. These include bacteria from the cows' skin, feed, bedding and aerosols, and from human handlers and the equipment and containers used to collect, store and transport the raw milk.

Raw milk is known to harbor diverse strains of bacteria that strongly influence shelf life, sensory qualities and safety of fluid milk, as well as that of fermented dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. While pasteurization of raw milk kills microbes which can cause disease in humans, not all bacteria and their associated enzymes are eliminated in the process. The remaining bacteria can still cause spoilage and quality defects in dairy foods.

Researchers found that a "core community" of microbes remains constant throughout the seasons and across farms where the milk is collected. This core community represented 29 different bacterial groups and included high proportions of streptococcus and staphylococcus, as well as Clostridiales, bacteria frequently associated with dairy cattle. The study revealed that milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions of Actinobacteria (such as actinomyces and streptomyces), one of the largest known groups of bacteria. The group includes some pathogens.

Researchers also found that the bacterial composition of raw milk stored in silos at processing plants was distinct from that of the tanker trucks. One group of silos contained microbial populations similar in makeup to the milk from the tanker trucks, while the other group of silos had distinctly different microbial populations dominated by acinetobacter and lactococcus bacteria.

"This finding demonstrates how the built environment in food-processing plants can have significant but still unpredictable impacts on the microbial quality of foods," Marco said.

Identification of these raw milk microbes and their abundance should help dairy processors develop new and more effective sanitation procedures and process controls to make sure the milk and resulting dairy foods are safe and of consistently high quality, according to the report." - Mod.LL
