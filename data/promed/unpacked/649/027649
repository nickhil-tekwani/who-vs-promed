The number of cases of _Clostridium difficile_ infection reported by
hospitals across the state has increased by more than 26 per cent in
the 1st 6 months of this year [2011].

The significant rise in cases of the potentially life-threatening
healthcare-associated infection is being closely monitored, according
to Dr Fidelma Fitzpatrick, consultant microbiologist and the Health
Service Executive's clinical leader for healthcare-associated
infections.

Some 1013 cases of the infection, which can spread rapidly in
hospitals, were reported to the national Health Protection
Surveillance Centre between January and June this year [2011] compared
to 801 cases over the same period in 2010. Last year's [2010] figures
represented a falling trend, down from 1090 cases in the 1st half of
2009, but this trend has now been reversed.

Dr Fitzpatrick said she believed the rise in infections this year
[2011] was partly due to the use of a more sensitive test to detect
the bug [_Clostridium difficile_], following new European guidelines.
"Most labs have changed their testing to a more sensitive test," she
said.

She added there could also be a real increase in cases of infection,
but there had been no reports of more outbreaks of _C. difficile_, or
it could also be that the strains of the bug were changing. "But it's
certainly something we have to watch and, as with any bug, we have to
be vigilant and ask questions," she said.

Asked whether there was a possibility cases of the bug were
increasing due to cutbacks at hospitals over the past year, Dr
Fitzpatrick said hand washing and using antibiotics properly -- which
were important steps in preventing the bug and its spread -- did not
cost money. "Keeping people safe has to be all of our priorities, and
it is."

[_Clostridium difficile_-associated disease (CDAD) is a spectrum of
potentially fatal illnesses that includes diarrhea, pseudomembranous
colitis, and toxic megacolon. _Clostridium difficile_ is the most
common cause of bacterial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in
hospitalized patients, and antimicrobial drug therapy is the most
important risk factor associated with the acquisition of _C.
difficile_.

Recent outbreaks of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased
severity, high relapse rate, and significant mortality, have been
related to the emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain
in North America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain, which
hyper-produces toxins A and B, is referred to as North American
pulsed-field type 1 and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027.
Ribotype 027 has been previously reported from Ireland (ProMED-mail
post Clostridium difficile, ribotype 027, 2005-2006 - UK (England),
Ireland 20070427.1377).

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities
involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized
patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection
control measures, including prompt patient isolation of patients with
_C. difficile_-positive diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms
are not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene
and control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents
(http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF).
