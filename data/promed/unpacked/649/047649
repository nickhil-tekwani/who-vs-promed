Following the emergence of yellow fever cases in the town of Goz Beida in Chad, a vaccination campaign against the disease was launched in the close by Djabal camp for Sudanese refugees in the east of the country.

Djabal's health official Adam Hassan told Radio Dabanga the campaign was launched on Thursday [21 Feb 2013] and it will last for 4 days and target 17 375 residents.

He added the vaccines are provided by Medecins Sans Frontieres and urged Djabal's population to "rush" to vaccination centers.

The town of Goz Beida is located about 2 kilometers [slightly more than one mile] from Djabal camp.

[The yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign in Chad has been initiated on 22 Feb 2013 as planned. It is in response to the occurrence of 2 yellow fever virus infections in eastern Chad in Goz Beida and Guereda districts in December 2012. These cases were doubtless spill-over from the YF outbreak in Darfur, Sudan.

There are several Sudanese refugee camps in Chad due to the violence in the Darfur states. It is highly likely that there is a certain amount of movement across the Chad/Darfur porous border. The above report does not indicate if there have been additional YF cases beyond those 2 reported in December 2012.

One hopes that a brief 4 day vaccination campaign is sufficient to provide the coverage indicated. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about the vaccination campaign and any additional cases that might occur.
