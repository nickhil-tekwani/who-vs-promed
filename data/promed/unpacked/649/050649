Occurrence of stem-pitting strains of citrus tristeza virus in Croatia

Citrus is grown in Croatia (about 1500 ha of citrus groves) on the
Dalmatian Coast and Islands between 42 and 43 deg 30 min N. The major
species, _Citrus unshiu_ Marc. (Satsuma mandarin), is grafted on trifoliate
rootstock. The presence of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) in Satsumas in the
Neretva Valley Region was previously reported (1).
During the course of a biomolecular characterization of isolates from
Croatia, 15 budsticks were collected from field-infected, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) positive sources during the autumn of 2003 near
Kastela, Split, Metkovic (Neretva Valley), and on the island of Vis.
Isolates were propagated by graft transmission to Madam Vinous sweet orange
(SwO) and maintained in an insect-proof greenhouse at 21 to 33 deg C. 8
months later, the bark of terminal twigs was peeled off, and the wood was
examined for the occurrence of pits.
Typical tristeza stem-pitting (SP) was observed in 4 isolates originating
from cvs. Fukumoto navel, Washington navel, and Ichimaru Satsuma and C.
wilsonii. The bark from the infected sources was analyzed using
immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with
primers CTV1 and CTV10 (2), targeting the whole coat protein (CP) gene. The
PCR products of the expected size (669 nucleotides) were obtained and TA
cloned (pGEM-T Easy Vector; Promega, Madison, WI) in _Escherichia coli_
cells. 32 clones harboring the CTV CP gene were sequenced.
2 of the SP isolates contained 4 genomic variants that differed an average
of 2.0 per cent from the severe SwO SP strains SY568 and Nuaga (3) from
California and Japan, respectively. The other 2 SP isolates contained four
variants that differed as little as 1.6 per cent from the severe SwO SP
from India, CTV-Puna, and CTV-Bangalore (4). The net average distance
between these 2 clusters of sequences is 5.2 per cent. One sequence from
each of the 4 SP isolates was deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. AY791841
to AY791844).
These findings were confirmed by direct observation of SP symptoms in a
Satsuma orchard in the Neretva Valley during the spring of 2004. No other
conspicuous symptoms that could be attributed to CTV were observed in the
field. Most Satsumas were introduced to the Neretva Region from Japan
between 1964 and 1984.
Together with the fact that the related Nuaga strain was also isolated from
Satsumas in Japan (3), our results suggest that SwO SP strains were
introduced into Croatia at the same time and have been spreading for
several decades. It has been generally believed that this kind of CTV
strains either do not exist in the Mediterranean basin or, when found (such
as, in Spain), are immediately eradicated. The findings reported here
suggest that the epidemiological scenario for the Mediterranean Basin
requires revision.

[Citrus tristeza virus is the most economically important virus problem
affecting citrus worldwide, causing death and decline of trees on sour
orange rootstocks and a debilitating stem-pitting disease in limes,
grapefruit, and sweet oranges. It affects trees on all rootstocks and
reduces yield. About 25 million trees on sour orange are at risk from CTV
decline. _T. citricida_, brown citrus aphid (BrCA), is one of the world's
most serious pests of citrus because of its efficient transmission of CTV.
Disease management involves removal of declining trees on sour orange and
replacement with trees budded on a tolerant rootstock is recommended when a
tree is no longer economically viable; suppression and eradication of
severe, stem-pitting CTV strains. Other measures include implementation of
mild strain cross-protection; and introduction of virus resistance into
desirable citrus varieties. Immunity to CTV present in _Poncirus
trifoliata_ has been transferred into sweet orange type plants suitable for
use as breeding parents by conventional plant breeding techniques.
