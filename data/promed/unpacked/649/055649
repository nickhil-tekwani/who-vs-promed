The parvovirus, feline panleukopenia virus, might be a good possibility. It
has been around much longer than canine parvo and is known to affect the big
cats. There are very good vaccines available for this.

Thanks for posting "Tiger Mortality, zoo - China" on Pro/AH. However, I
think the way it was posted may be confusing to readers.
I just got a call from someone at the Univ. of Alberta letting me know
he might have an article that would be useful in solving this 'mystery',
he thought I was the one working on this situation (I'm not).
It's not clear from the post that all I did was take a report in the
published media and then added a couple of quick questions to stir the
imagination.
I guess I intended that this news item become available to the listserve
and if anyone knew anything to help, they could post that to the list as
well, and maybe someone actually working on the case in China would get
the information.
I have no idea who is working on the case, or to whom information should
be sent. I told the fellow who called to please post any information he
may have.

[Let us hope that we can get a response from China - we have a number of
Chinese members - and clarification as to the reality of this "outbreak" and
what was the final result. Although presently a "soft" report, it does
remind us that zoo animals can be at special risk. MHJ]
