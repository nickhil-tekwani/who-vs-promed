The RSPCA says hundreds of dogs at the Townsville shelter in north
Queensland have been put down after an outbreak of parvovirus.

RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says 200 dogs have been destroyed, and
many more animals have been surrendered. He says pet owners need to
make sure their animals have been immunised to avoid the spread of
disease in the region. "Since the beginning of the year [2010], there
have been over 200 that have had to be put to sleep," he said. "That
includes up to 50 puppies that have come in contact with the
parvovirus. So that's another message to people to please, please
make sure that your animals are inoculated."

He says Townsville is one of the busiest shelters in the state and
that there is no sign of the pressure easing. "There's no doubt about
that and sadly I guess for all the wrong reasons," he said. "But
having said that, there have been well over 340 animals re-homed out
at Townsville, which is terrific, but it has been very, very busy and
sadly for all the wrong reasons."

[Canine parvovirus (CPV) disease emerged as a fatal infectious
condition in the 1970s and within a few months had spread around the
world. Caused by canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), the original
antigenic type was joined by an antigenic variant, CPV-2a, in the
early 1980s. A 2nd variant, CPV-2b, appeared soon after, and CPV-2a
and CPV-2b quickly replaced the original CPV-2 strain throughout the
canine population worldwide. Recently, a new strain, CPV-2c, has been
reported in a number of countries in Europe (UK, Italy, Germany and
Spain), Asia (Viet Nam) and South America (Uruguay). Currently in
Australia, CPV-2a remains the predominant strain type.

Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent CPV. Sanitation around
the household and dog areas is also important for preventing
parvovirus. However, other precautions should be followed, such as
not going to dog parks or social gatherings where your dog may
contact the virus in the environment.

CPV-2 is highly contagious and is spread by direct dog-to-dog contact
and contact with contaminated feces (stool), environments or people.
The virus can also contaminate kennel surfaces, food and water bowls,
collars and leashes, and the hands and clothing of people who handle
infected dogs. It is resistant to heat, cold, humidity, and drying,
and can survive in the environment for long periods of time. Even
trace amounts of feces containing parvovirus may serve as
environmental reservoirs of the virus and infect other dogs that come
into the infected environment. CPV-2 is readily transmitted from
place to place on the hair or feet of dogs or via contaminated cages,
shoes, or other objects.

All dogs are at risk, but puppies less than 4 months old and dogs
that have not been vaccinated against canine parvovirus are at
increased risk of becoming infected and ill.

Dogs infected with the CPV-2 virus that are ill are often said to
have "parvo." CPV-2 infection causes lethargy; loss of appetite;
fever; vomiting; and severe, often bloody, diarrhea. Vomiting and
diarrhea can cause rapid dehydration, and most deaths from parvovirus
occur within 48 to 72 hours following the onset of clinical signs. If
your puppy or dog show any of these signs, you should contact your
veterinarian immediately.

CPV-2 infection is often suspected based on the dog's history,
physical examination, and laboratory tests. Fecal testing can confirm
the diagnosis.

No specific drug is available that will kill the virus in infected
dogs, and treatment is intended to support the dog's body systems
until the dog's immune system can fight off the viral infection.
Treatment should be started immediately and consists primarily of
efforts to combat dehydration by replacing electrolyte and fluid
losses, controlling vomiting and diarrhea, and preventing secondary
infections. Sick dogs should be kept warm and receive good nursing
care. When a dog develops parvo, treatment can be very expensive, and
the dog may die despite aggressive treatment. Early recognition and
aggressive treatment are very important in successful outcomes.

Since CPV-2 is highly contagious, isolation of infected dogs is
necessary to minimize spread of infection. Proper cleaning and
disinfection of contaminated kennels and other areas where infected
dogs are (or have been) housed is essential to control the spread of
parvovirus. The virus is not easily killed, so consult your
veterinarian for specific guidance on cleaning and disinfecting
agents. Common household bleach at a 1:30 solution will kill the
virus on surfaces without organic material.

I am uncertain how large the Townville shelter is, but the article
indicates this has been going on since the beginning of the year
(2010). Is it not possible to clean the shelter and the people and
institute some biosecurity measures, even such things as isolation
wards and foot baths to try and control this disease within the
shelter?
