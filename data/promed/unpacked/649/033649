We reported in a Letter to the Editor years ago, that viable vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) was detected in liquid nitrogen (LN) within a 240
liter LN refrigerator (Science vol 191. 24, 1976). Broken glass ampules
containing VSV in storage canes, prompted the investigation. At that
time, plastic vials for virus storage in LN were not widely available and
some leaked from the screw cap. We reported elsewhere that VSV appeared to
be uniformly dispersed through out the LN in the refrigerator and not
limited to a single area. Finally, we purposefully added VSV to 250 ml of
LN and evaporated it to dryness. This did not significantly diminish virus
infectivity as measured by plaque assay.
Later, I had an occasion to talk with people at Ft. Detrick who carried out
some additional studies. I urged that they be published, but they were
not. As best as I can recall, bacteriophage were added to LN and it was
evaporated to dryness in a laboratory. Petri dishes, seeded with an assay
organism, were opened and placed at various distances from the contaminated
LN source. Phage were detected throughout the room with
minutes (if memory serves).
It is reasonable to assume that organisms survive long exposure to LN and
that LN vapor may also carry infectious agents.
