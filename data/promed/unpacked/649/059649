Two new cases of chronic wasting disease in captive white-tailed deer have been reported, a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department [TPWD] official said.

There have now been 7 cases of the fatal disease reported in Texas. The infected deer were found in Lavaca County, TPWD wildlife director Clayton Wolf said.

Wolf said biopsies show signs of the deadly disease but the findings still need to be confirmed by a lab in Iowa.

The KSAT 12 Defenders are working to verify which facility between San Antonio and Houston housed the affected deer.

Monday [16 Nov 2015] on KSAT 12 News at 5, the Defenders return to Texas Mountain Ranch to continue looking into the impact chronic wasting disease is having on the multi-billion dollar deer business in Texas.

[While the initial tests are positive, a true confirmed positive must come the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. While they generally turn them around quickly, it will still be several days for this to be confirmed.

More updates on these 2 animals will likely not be far behind this article.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) has established a surveillance on hunter-killed animals this hunting season. Hunters in Texas should check with the county they are hunting in or with the TPWD to see if surveillance is in the county you are hunting in. - Mod.TG
