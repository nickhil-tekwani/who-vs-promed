The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is warning the public not
to consume the mussels, described below, because they may contain
diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) biotoxin. The affected mussels
were harvested by Island Sea Farms Inc. from the harvest location
"Area: BC 13, Sub Area: 15" or "BC 13-15" between 19 Jul 2011 and 2
Aug 2011.

The following mussels are affected by this alert:
- Saltspring Island Mussels Aquacultured Edulis Mussels 5 lbs (2.27
kg) - All lots up to and including Lot No. 289; all harvest dates up
to and including 2 Aug 2011;
- Albion Fisheries Ltd Mussel N/Shell Saltspring Isl 5lbs - All
harvest dates up to and including 4 Aug 2011;
- Pacific Rim Shellfish Corp Mussels or Gallo Mussels - Various
weights. All harvest dates up to and including 31 Jul 2011;
- Albion/SSI Mussels - Various weights - Ship dates of 20 Jul 2011 to
4 Aug 2011 inclusive;
- B & C Food Mussels - Various weights - Processing dates of 20 Jul
2011 to 4 Aug 2011 inclusive.

Retailers and restaurants are advised to check the tags or labels on
mussel packages or with their supplier to determine whether they have
the affected product.

Consumers, who have purchased raw mussels from retailers between 19
Jul 2011 and 6 Aug 2011 inclusive should check with their retailer to
determine whether they have the affected product.

This product has been distributed in British Columbia, Alberta,
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. However, it may have been
distributed in other provinces and territories.

There have been reported illnesses associated with the consumption of
these mussels.

The CFIA is collaborating with its partners, Vancouver Coastal Health
(VCH), Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA), British Columbia
Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), and Health Canada to investigate
these illnesses. This investigation is ongoing.

Food contaminated with diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) biotoxin
may not look or smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with
this biotoxin may cause diarrheal shellfish poisoning, a foodborne
illness. Diarrheal shellfish poisoning can cause diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal cramps and chills.

The Canadian harvester and distributors are voluntarily recalling the
affected product from the marketplace. The CFIA is monitoring the
effectiveness of the recall.

[Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP), a toxin-associated illness
associated with okadaic acid production in dinoflagellates, which can
be associated with mussels, seems to be the diagnosis here. Diarrhea
is the most commonly reported symptom (92 percent), closely followed
by nausea (80 percent) and vomiting (79 percent), with onset 30
minutes to 12 hours from ingestion. - Mod.LL]
