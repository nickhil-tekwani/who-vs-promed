[The following commentary addresses 3 issues related to the Algerian FMD epizootic.

1. Geographical spread
The virus has already spread throughout the northern half of Algeria all the way from the eastern provinces, bordering Tunisia, as far west as Oran and Sidi Bel Abbes, approaching the western border with Morocco.

2. Stamping out
According to Algeria's reports to the OIE, stamping out has been applied in all 418 outbreaks reported since the start of the event (reportedly on 23 Jul 2014), involving an accumulated total of 6452 cattle, 1572 sheep, and 200 goats. It deserves to be mentioned that, according to media reports, the culling is performed by transportation of all ruminants from the foci, infected and contact animals, to slaughterhouses where they are slaughtered, some selected organs/offal destroyed, while the bone-in meat is released for human consumption. Confirmation or otherwise of said procedure is requested. In case confirmed, such a procedure deserves to be critically reviewed. Unless performed under extremely severe sanitary conditions from farm to slaughterhouse to retail shops, it might possibly increase the risk of virus spread instead of limiting it.

2. Sheep and goats
According to the following accumulated, updated statistics, as published in WAHID's archive, Algeria has reported since the start of the event, clinical FMD in cattle only; not a single case in sheep and goats. On the other hand, Tunisia has reported the disease in cattle, sheep, and goats:

Algeria (last updated 9 Sep 2014)
---------------------------------
[Outbreak summary:
Total outbreaks = 418 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 7027 / 2711 / 162 / 413 / 6452
Sheep / 1572 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1572
Goats / 200 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 200

Tunisia (last updated 27 Aug 2014)
----------------------------------
Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 124 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 2143 / 389 / 0 / 0 / 12
Sheep / 5146 / 509 / 0 / 0 / 1
Goats / 560 / 49 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep & goats / 764 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 0

The morbidity rates (percentages, on affected farms) in Algeria are: cattle 38.5, sheep 0.00 and goats 0.00 while in Tunisia, respectively, 18.2, 9.9 and 8.7. Since the causative agent, FMD virus strain 'O/ME-SA/Ind-2001' has been genotyped and found to be homologous in the 2 counties, the apparent absence of disease in small ruminants in Algeria is rather puzzling. It becomes even more puzzling when noting that, during 2013 (last available data), Algeria's 31 483 680 sheep and goats were not vaccinated at all against FMD ("0 coverage"), while Tunisia's 8 129 980 sheep and goats were, at least partially, vaccinated (3 731 517 doses applied, 46 percent coverage).

Unless a plausible explanation becomes available, it must be assumed that the said virus is currently circulating within Algeria's small ruminant population, at least at the same rate it did/does in Tunisia, but remained unnoticed or not reported in Algeria. - Mod.AS]

[2] Morocco: preventive vaccination
Date: Tue 9 Sep 2014

http://www.lematin.ma/express/2014/vaccination-contre-la-fievre-aphteuse-bovine_la-premiere-phase-de-la-campagne-atteint-84--de-l-objectif/208658.html


The vaccination of cattle against foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], launched by the National Office for the Safety of Food Products (ONSSA) on 18 Aug 2014, has covered during its 1st phase, 842 000 cattle heads, a rate of 84 percent of the expected objective (about 1 million cattle). The campaign has been completed in border provinces (east) and will be continued in the provinces the access to which is more difficult, until the end of this week, said a press release from ONSSA. These achievements are the result of cooperative efforts of the various stakeholders, including local authorities, representatives of the farmers, mandated veterinarians, and ONSSA veterinary services.

The 2nd phase of the campaign, to be launched from 22 Sep 2014 in other parts of the country, will include the vaccination of about 1.7 million cattle heads. "The health of the national herd is good and no cases of FMD have been recorded," says the agency.

The ONSSA is a public institution created by law no 25-08, with legal powers and financial autonomy, exercised on behalf of the State, responsible for the protection of consumer health and preserving the health of animals and plants.

[Morocco's cattle population (OIE's 2013 data) is 3 172 984 strong; their density per province is presented in OIE's map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/resource/maps/tmp/54108303_2b00_0.png.

Morocco's sheep population (2013) is 19 956 385; goats, 6 235 861. The current report does not mention vaccination of small ruminants. Such vaccination might be desirable, at least along the eastern border.

Morocco discontinued FMD vaccination several years ago; the current vaccination is thus primary, in fully susceptible animals. For solid protection, booster vaccinations might be considered.

Additional information on the vaccination campaign in Morocco is available in the commentary to ProMED-mail posting 20140830.2733767.
