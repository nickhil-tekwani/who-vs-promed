Summary
Since early January 2010, Berlin has been experiencing a measles
outbreak with 62 cases as of 31 Mar 2010. The index case acquired the
infection in India. In recent years, measles incidence in Berlin has
been lower than the German average, and vaccination coverage in school
children has increased since 2001. However, this outbreak involves
schools and kindergartens with low vaccination coverage and parents
with critical attitudes towards vaccination, which makes the
implementation of public health interventions challenging.

Background
Since the implementation of the new national Protection Against
Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz; IfSG) in Germany in 2001,
clinically suspected measles cases as well as laboratory confirmation
for measles have to be reported to the District Health Offices [1].
The District Health Office evaluates the information according to the
case definition for measles [2] and enters case-based data into the
electronic reporting system. Since 2001, the number of measles cases
and the annual measles incidences in Berlin have been low compared
with the national average. The highest annual number of measles cases
in Berlin was reported in 2006 (n=57). The annual incidences ranged
from 0.06 to 1.51 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in Berlin compared
with 0.15 and 7.32 per 100 000 country-wide (data tabulated in the
original text) [3]. The measles vaccination coverage in children at
school entrance examination has increased significantly during the
past years. In 2001, 91.2 percent of childr!
en presented with at least one measles vaccination at school entry,
and only 24.0 percent had 2 vaccinations [4]. In 2008, 95.2 percent
were vaccinated once and 88.2 percent twice against measles [5]. In
the neighbouring Federal State of Brandenburg the vaccination coverage
is significantly higher: 93.4 percent of children had 2 measles
vaccinations at school entry in 2008 [6]. Despite these efforts, a
measles outbreak with so far 62 cases was observed in Berlin between
early January and 31 Mar 2010.

Outbreak description
The index case of this outbreak, a secondary school student from
Berlin, was diagnosed on 5 Jan 2010. The patient was not vaccinated
against measles, and the medical history pointed to travel-related
acquisition of the infection, since he had travelled to India at the
end of 2009. The diagnosis was laboratory-confirmed on 14 Jan 2010,
and the result was reported to the responsible District Health Office
on 15 Jan 2010. Since samples of the index case were not available,
PCR was performed at the National Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps
and Rubella at the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) on a sample of a
related case diagnosed on 19 Jan 2010. This analysis confirmed measles
virus genotype D8 (MVs/Berlin.DEU/03.10), which is identical to
viruses endemic in India (MVs/Imphal.IND/19.09) and therefore
supported introduction from the Indian subcontinent. To date,
genotyping revealed measles virus genotype D8 in 13 cases. However,
genotyping is not yet completed for all cases. There is!
evidence that some of the measles cases currently observed in Berlin
are not linked to the outbreak. These infections might be concurrently
imported from other regions (e.g. Bulgaria, South Africa).
Epidemiological and laboratory investigations are ongoing to clarify
the situation thoroughly.

As of week 12, 2010, the total number of cases has reached 62. So far,
the outbreak has affected 52 residents living in 4 of the 12 Districts
of Berlin and 10 residents of the surrounding Federal State of
Brandenburg [The number of cases per week related to the outbreak is
shown in a Figure in the original text. - Mod.CP]. The index patient
is attending a private school (Waldorf-Schule; anthroposophic
education). The proportion of students vaccinated against measles in
this school is estimated to be significantly below 70 percent. Parents
sending their children to Waldorf schools and kindergartens are known
for their critical attitudes towards vaccinations in general and
especially with regards to measles vaccination. Thus, the outbreak
spread mainly among unvaccinated children and adolescents attending
Waldorf institutions (schools and kindergartens in 2 districts) and
their siblings. In addition, children and adolescents attending public
schools and kindergartens were expose!
d and infected via direct contacts with Waldorf students and their
families. None of the reported cases had been vaccinated against
measles before being exposed during this outbreak (some children
received an active post- exposure vaccination). All measles cases
resident in Brandenburg were students attending schools in Berlin or
unvaccinated siblings of such students. No measles transmission was
observed in schools and kindergartens in this Federal State. The mean
age of the cases was 10.5 years (range: 1-18 years). To date, there
have not been any reports of hospitalisations or complications due to
measles infections in connection with this outbreak.

Public health intervention and challenges
After diagnosis of the index case in early January 2010, the
responsible District Health Offices implemented public health
interventions according to the Protection Against Infection Act to
interrupt the spread of measles. The measures included: (1) Temporary
exclusion of students and teachers without measles vaccination or
naturally acquired immunity from schools with confirmed measles cases;
(2) Offering measles vaccination for unvaccinated students and
teachers in affected schools (vaccinations in collaboration with
private practitioners); (3) Equivalent measures in kindergartens with
measles cases; (4) Active detection of contacts and exposed persons;
(5) Sampling of clinical material from measles patients to confirm
diagnosis and perform genotyping at the National Reference Centre for
Measles, Mumps and Rubella; (6) Recommendation of temporary
restrictions of private contacts with unprotected persons and of any
public activities in groups for patients and their unvaccinat!
ed family members; (7) Public health information to increase regional
clinicians' alertness regarding measles in their area; (8) Enhanced
communication with educational institutions and parents with critical
attitudes towards vaccination of the children.

These measures showed some success. The peak of the outbreak was seen
in the week 5, 2010 (n=17), with decreasing case numbers in the
following weeks. However, only few of the offered measles vaccinations
were accepted (numbers are currently not available because the exposed
unvaccinated children were sent to private practitioners for measles
vaccinations). Four students developed measles after receiving a post-
exposure measles vaccination (vaccination 4-5 days after the last
contact). This observation underlines the importance to apply active
vaccination earlier after exposure (preferably within 3 days after 1st
exposure); furthermore, passive vaccination with the specific
immunoglobulin should be considered for effective individual
post-exposure measles prevention. After the initial peak, the outbreak
continued to spread on a relatively low level, and the 1st case in a
district not directly neighbouring the district of residence of the
index case occurred at the end of week!
11. Currently, most concern is directed towards a Waldorf
kindergarten in a neighbouring district with a measles vaccination
coverage of less than 60 percent.

In early February 2010, parents whose children were affected by the
temporary school exclusion filed an action against the respective
District Health Office at the Berlin Administration Court. The claim
argued that the health authority's decision impeded the unvaccinated
children's rights to visit school and to acquire immunity against
measles through natural infection. Measles was claimed to be a
harmless infection in children without severe complications and
possible long-term disabilities. The specific vaccination against
measles was perceived to be inefficient and dangerous. However, in
mid-February 2010, the Berlin Administrative Court decided to dismiss
the claim and declared that the measures taken by the public health
authorities had been adequate to contain the outbreak. However,
further claims are pending at the Berlin High Administrative Court.

For now, parents must be aware that their unvaccinated children can
acquire the infection while travelling in regions with endemic measles
or ongoing measles outbreaks. Physicians should be encouraged to focus
on parents with unvaccinated children and strongly recommend active
measles vaccination before travelling.

Conclusion
We give a preliminary overview of a measles outbreak in Berlin. There
is epidemiological and laboratory-confirmed evidence that the index
case acquired the infection when travelling in India. The outbreak
affected unvaccinated children and adolescents whose parents are known
to have critical attitudes towards measles vaccination. Although
vaccination coverage in Berlin has increased significantly in general,
measles transmission chains can still be established in schools and
kindergartens with high proportions of unvaccinated children. Public
health authorities were extremely challenged in this situation because
the measures taken according to infectious disease protection
legislation were not generally accepted by the parents. Thus, measles
could be re-introduced and continue to spread on a low level within
the unvaccinated parts of the population in Berlin for a not clearly
foreseeable time.

[Outbreaks of measles centered on anthroposophic communities in
European countries have been recorded previously. Anthroposophy, based
on the writings of the social philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925),
combines human development with an investigation of the divine spark
found in all of nature. The movement has influenced education
(Waldorf/Steiner schools) and medicine. Anthroposophical practitioners
emphasize nature-based therapies that support the body's innate
healing wisdom. Antibiotics, fever-reducing agents, and vaccinations
are used at an individual's discretion only.

Although vaccination coverage in Berlin has increased significantly in
general, as the above report indicates measles transmission chains can
still be established in schools and kindergartens with high
proportions of unvaccinated children. The observation that some
children vaccinated post-exposure contracted disease underlines the
importance of administering vaccine as early after exposure as
possible (within 3 days after 1st exposure).

Major epidemics of measles in Europe have generally been associated
with measles virus genotypes D4, D6, and B3. However, as in the
current outbreak, some D8 genotype cases have been considered to be
the result of introductions from India (see: Measles, anthroposophic
community - The Netherlands (02): (Hague) 20080802.2370).

2006) can be found in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record, No.
