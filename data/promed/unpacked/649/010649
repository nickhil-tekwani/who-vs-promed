Here is latest information on Pilchard deaths in Australia
[from Dr Gardner Murray, Australian Chief Veterinary Officer
PILCHARD DEATHS
Extent of mortalities
---------------------
As of 23 November, pilchard mortalities have extended to 55 kilometres west
of Eucla, Western Australia, and have reached Port Phillip Bay, Victoria.
Both small and large pilchards are dying, the main size classes affected
are 6-10 cm and 13-18 cm.
Closure of pilchard fisheries
-----------------------------
Fisheries Victoria have made an arrangement with commercial pilchard
fishers to implement a voluntary closure of the Victorian pilchard fishery
until an official Fisheries Notice can be issued.
The South Australian pilchard fishery reopened at midnight 20 November with
the abatement of deaths in South Australian waters. Schools of apparently
healthy pilchards are being observed widely.
Pathology
---------
Staff from CSIRO's Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong
are working with researchers from laboratories in Western Australia, South
Australia and Victoria to determine the cause of death.
At this stage scientists have identified a herpes virus from pilchard
samples. The herpesvirus observed in the gills of affected pilchards has
been purified at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. Genetic analysis
has commenced to determine if the virus is the same as that observed in the
1995 pilchard mortality events. In addition, comparisons will be made with
other herpesviruses.
Although scientists have identified a herpesvirus from pilchard samples,
there is no evidence that the virus has caused the pilchard mortalities.
Herpesvirus is relatively common, having been found in insects, reptiles,
and amphibia as well as in virtually every species of bird or mammal that
has been investigated. Herpesvirus also causes a range of diseases in
humans.
This work forms part of a collaborative research program being coordinated
by the Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases (CCEAD), which
comprises the State/Territory Directors of Fisheries, Chief Veterinary
Officers from the Commonwealth, States and Territories and the Chief of
CSIRO Animal Health.
A Joint Pilchard Scientific Working Group, chaired by the Director of
Fisheries South Australia, Dr Gary Morgan, has been established to advise
the CCEAD. The group has developed a plan on matters such as surveillance,
diagnosis and research needs. The plan, to be submitted to the CCEAD, will
allow a coordinated approach to dealing with the situation.
The CCEAD plans to meet next week to reassess the situation and consider
the recommendations from its Joint Pilchard Scientific Working Group.
