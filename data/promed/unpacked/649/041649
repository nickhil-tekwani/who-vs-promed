["Maedi" is Icelandic for labored breathing; "Visna" means paralysis
and wasting, and refers to the progressive CNS degeneration in
affected animals. Maedi-visna was first described in Iceland in the
1950s by Bjorn Sigurdsson.
It is a progressive infection of sheep worldwide, with the exception
of Australia and New Zealand. Other forms of this disease are often
referred to as Ovine Progressive Pneumonia. Maedi/Visna has incubation
time of roughly 2 years, closely related to Caprine
Arthritis-Encephalitis in goats and is the prototypical lentivirus. -
