The 619 area code for San Diego presently extends all the way up that remote
desert area and it has made no sense to us for years. Ridgecrest California
is over 250 miles from San Diego, almost half the distance from there to San
Francisco, in an area generally passed through only by people on their way
to Death Valley where they don't usually take their dogs. It is a small
town among smaller, largely abandoned mining towns. It has nothing to do
with San Diego and that's the serious misinformation I'm trying to correct.
We will be happy to issue a traveler's warning for anyone planning to pass
through the Ridgecrest area, but for now we have asked members of our large
dog-related internet group to refrain from forwarding the message because it
is misleading.

There was a strain of distemper that was unusual in the North Bay Area --
above San Francisco -- in 1996 and 1997 that was killing foxes and raccoons.
Wild life rehabilitaters were very vocal about it. I am sorry I do not have
more information than that, though Wild Care in San Rafeal CA would. I only
know because I saw 3 foxes brought into a city Animal Shelter where I
volunteered and we were advised to euthanize [them] immediately and sanitize
diligently.

not immediately ascribe wildlife deaths to an unusually virulent strain,
unless challenge or PCR tests have been run. - MHJ]
