Measles case in Airlie Beach prompts QH alert
---------------------------------------------
Queensland Health (QH) is warning Whitsundays residents and recent
visitors to the area to be on the look out for the symptoms of
measles after a case of the infectious disease was confirmed in an
Airlie Beach tourist.

Tropical Regional Services medical officer Dr Steven Donohue said a
male tourist had the highly-contagious disease while visiting the
Whitsundays from 30 Jan to 4 Feb 2010.

"Although the patient didn't get measles in Australia, he would have
been highly infectious while in the Airlie Beach region," Dr Donohue
said. "We're concerned about the possibility of the measles virus
spreading into the local community and elsewhere in Queensland due to
the large number of travellers and visitors to the area.

"The patient took part in a range of activities in and around Airlie
Beach, and public health officers have been identifying those who may
have been exposed so appropriate advice can be given. Queensland
Health will continue to actively investigate all cases and take steps
to prevent further transmission."

Measles is extremely contagious and is spread in tiny droplets
through coughing and spluttering. The virus can last for several
hours in the environment. Measles can be very distressing for those
affected, and complications can include pneumonia and encephalitis
(inflammation of the brain). It can be a severe illness even in
otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults.

The initial symptoms are: fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough,
sore red eyes, and a widespread blotchy red rash. Dr Donohue said
symptoms usually start around 10 days after contact with an infected
person. "Now is the time for people to be aware of any signs of
infection," Dr Donohue said. "Anyone travelling or living in the
Whitsundays who develops a fever, cough, runny nose and eyes, or a
blotchy red rash in the next few weeks should seek advice from their
GP. However, it's important to call the practice to say they could
have measles, and ask to be seen away from the waiting room to avoid
spreading the disease to others."

Medicos fear measles timebomb
---------------
Queensland could be on the cusp of a deadly measles outbreak on a
scale not seen in 50 years.

Queensland Health issued an alert for parts of the state's north
yesterday after it was revealed a French tourist infected with the
disease had spent nearly a week in contact with locals and other
travellers in the Whitsundays.

The man, who was only diagnosed last week after leaving Queensland
for Melbourne, contracted the illness overseas and experts say it is
almost certain he passed it on to others while in Queensland.

Measles is among the most highly contagious disease in the world and
can cause serious complications and even death.

Queensland Health's tropical regional services medical officer Dr
Steven Donohue said it was so highly infectious, a population
immunity rate of 95 per cent was needed to stave off a major outbreak.

"Currently only about 90 per cent of people in Queensland have been
immunised against it," he told brisbanetimes.com.au yesterday.

"That is a pretty big opening. We are on the edge of a situation
where, if vaccination rates drop even just a little bit, it could
lead to a very serious outbreak here.

"Measles is not a trivial disease by any means. People can develop
pneumonia. About one in 1000 will get encephalitis (brain swelling)
that can lead to permanent brain damage.

"It can kill you. It is a very serious illness."

Like the recent explosion of whooping cough cases in Queensland,
experts fear complacency about immunisation against once-common
diseases is creating a timebomb scenario.

The widespread belief that medical science had eradicated whooping
cough, also known as pertussis, was blamed for the nationwide
tripling of cases last year and the sunshine state recording its
worst outbreak in four years. Three infants died.

Figures released last month reveal childhood vaccination rates for
diseases such as diptheria, tetanus and polio have hit a seven-year
low, with only about 83 per cent of four year olds immunised
nationally, well below the 90 per cent target.

Whether a decision by respected medical journal The Lancet last week
to formally retract a now de-bunked study linking immunisation to
autism will have any positive influence on vaccination rates may be
too early to tell.

Before the introduction of an effective vaccination program in 1965,
almost all Queensland children contracted measles, and deaths were
not uncommon, Dr Donohue said.

Once infected, a person becomes immune to measles for the rest of
their life, meaning most people over the age of 43 are not at risk of
falling ill.

Today, most Australians are immunised against measles through the
combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) which is
administered at 12 months of age and again at four.

But Dr Donohue said the 10 per cent of young people who had not been
immunised - either for ethical reasons or by oversight - were ripe
for an outbreak.

Young medicos might also be unprepared to deal with - or even
recognise - it in the early stages, he said.

"With the introduction of the vaccine program, it has become very
rare in Australia, in fact it has practically been wiped out - so
much so that some young doctors have never even seen it," he said.

"We have to constantly remind them about what to look for.

"When we do see outbreaks, they are almost always imported (from
overseas) and the real risk is among those young people who have not
been immunised."

Measles is spread via droplets passed by coughing, spluttering or sneezing.

It can remain active in the environment for several hours after it
has left the body, increasing the chance of infection.

It attacks the immune system and can be fatal in those with an
existing illnesses or people who are malnourished.

Measles can also cause foetal deformities in pregnant women, however
not at the rate of a disease such as rubella, also known as German measles.

Dr Donohue said about a dozen cases were reported in Queensland each
year, and up to 100 nationally, but health authorities knew they
needed to act swiftly to contain it.

"Although it has been eliminated from Australia, we really have to
jump on it when cases do occur and keeping infected people away from
others is really important," he said.

Queensland Health officers are now retracing the steps of the
infected French tourist - who stayed at Airlie Beach between [30 Jan
and 4 Feb 2010] - in an effort to limit the risk of an outbreak.

Dr Donohue said he would be "very surprised" if the man had not
passed on the disease while in Queensland.

"He was very active while he was at Airlie Beach and he had a large
number of contacts with people on tours and at airports, etcetera.

"We would be surprised if there wasn't some infection somewhere along
the line."

Queensland Health is urging anyone who was at Airlie Beach between
[31 Jan and 4 Feb 2010] and is displaying symptoms of fever,
lethargy, a runny nose, moist cough, sore, red eyes, and a blotchy
red rash to contact a GP [general practician] by telephone, rather
than attend a clinic, where they could expose others.

Dr Donohue said anyone who had not been immunised against measles, or
was unsure of their vaccination history to ask their doctor for a
booster injection, which is free.

[In the previous posting (see Measles - Australia: (QL) alert, RFI
20100210.0463), there were several press reports announcing a measles
alert. Two were from Queensland, one was from Northern Territory
(Darwin). No country of origin was given in the reports of the case
in Queensland, whereas the alert from Darwin mentioned the individual
had arrived in Darwin on a flight coming from Ho Chi Minh City
(HCMC), Viet Nam. In the 2nd newswire in this current posting, there
is mention that the case in Queensland is in a French national. It
is still unclear if this French national is the same individual who
reportedly arrived in Darwin from Viet Nam. (From the dates
mentioned, it is highly likely that the alerts are referring to the
same individual). It is likely that passengers on the same flight
(or flights -- HCMC to Darwin, Darwin to Sydney) could have been
infected and there is risk that measles infection could be
transmitted elsewhere in Australia. Information on the route of entry
of the measles virus-infected tourist is relevant and would be
welcomed. It is surprising that this information has not been
disseminated so far.
