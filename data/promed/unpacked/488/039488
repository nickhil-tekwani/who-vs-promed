COVID: Oxford trial to test efficacy of mix of vaccines for individuals
Scientists aim to establish level of immunity in trial of 820 people, giving some a substitute vaccine at 2nd appointment
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Volunteers are being sought for a world-first trial to establish the efficacy of giving people a first dose of one vaccine and a second dose of a different vaccine. The trial, which is being run by Oxford University and is funded by the government's vaccine taskforce, has been described by ministers as "hugely important". It will recruit 820 people over the age of 50 who have not yet had a vaccine, to receive a first dose of either the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine or the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Some people will then get an alternative vaccine at a second appointment within 12 weeks, and others will get the same vaccine again.

Public Health England's Green Book on vaccinations already tells the NHS that in exceptional circumstances if people arrive for their 2nd dose and the vaccine they originally had is not available, they can be given a different one. Scientists want to know whether protection from mixing vaccines is the same, reduced, or even better, compared with adhering to the same vaccine throughout.

With the steady supply of vaccines always in question, the researchers said the information they collect would be useful not only for the UK but for the whole world. There is also the possibility that giving an individual 2 different vaccines in a row might give greater protection against the more infectious COVID variants that have emerged in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil.

"If we do show that these vaccines can be used interchangeably in the same schedule, this will greatly increase the flexibility of vaccine delivery and could provide clues as to how to increase the breadth of protection against new virus strains," said Matthew Snape, an associate professor in paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford, and the chief investigator in the trial. At a briefing, Snape said there was evidence from mice studies that combining an adenoviral vector vaccine, such as the Oxford jab, with an mRNA vaccine, such as Pfizer/BioNTech's, could generate a better response. Both vaccines -- and the Novovax and Janssen vaccines, which are likely to be added to the trial if approved -- target the spike protein of the virus. "For that reason, I think we do anticipate that will generate a good immune response with these combinations, but we have to test it first, we have to see," he said.

Volunteers, who will be recruited through the NHS vaccine research volunteer website, will have blood taken to measure the buildup of antibodies after vaccination against the virus. Some will have their second dose after 4 weeks' time, and some after a 12-week interval, to provide more data on the government policy of widening the dosage gap.

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England and the senior responsible officer for the study, said: "Given the inevitable challenges of immunising large numbers of the population against COVID-19 and potential global supply constraints, there are definite advantages to having data that could support a more flexible immunisation programme, if needed and if approved by the medicines regulator. It is also even possible that by combining vaccines the immune response could be enhanced, giving even higher antibody levels that last longer. Unless this is evaluated in a clinical trial, we just won't know. This study will give us greater insight into how we can use vaccines to stay on top of this nasty disease."

Nadhim Zahawi, the minister for COVID-19 vaccine deployment, called it "a hugely important clinical trial that will provide us with more vital evidence on the safety of these vaccines when used in different ways". He said mixing vaccines would not be recommended outside the study "until researchers and the regulator are absolutely confident the approach is safe and effective".

[Note that antibodies and T-cells are being measured in the combined vaccine protocol, but protection will not be assessed as that would entail a much larger study. In the BioRxiv study cited below, the cellular immune response after a heterologous regimen was found to be dominated by cytotoxic T cells and Th1+ CD4 T cells. This may lead to a longer lasting immune response. - Mod.LK]

Could mixing COVID vaccines boost immune response?
--------------------------------------------------
Combining different coronavirus shots could speed immunization campaigns -- and even boost immune response.

Most coronavirus vaccines are given as 2 injections: an initial 'prime' dose followed by a 'boost' to stimulate the immune system's memory cells and amplify the immune response. The clinical trial will test participants' immune responses to receiving 1 shot of a coronavirus vaccine produced by Oxford and drug firm AstraZeneca -- which uses a harmless virus to carry a key coronavirus gene into cells -- and 1 shot of the vaccine produced by drug company Pfizer, which uses RNA instructions to trigger an immune response. The trial, which is run by investigators at the University of Oxford, aims to begin enrolment on [4 Feb 2021].

How COVID unlocked the power of RNA vaccines
--------------------------------------------
Vaccine developers often combine 2 vaccines to combat the same pathogen, and researchers are keen to deploy the strategy -- known as a heterologous prime-boost -- against the coronavirus. A heterologous prime-boost combination was approved last year [2020] by European regulators to protect against Ebola, and experimental HIV vaccines often rely on the strategy, says Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. But it has yet to be tested using vaccines against COVID-19, which are typically given as a repeat injection of the same vaccine.

The ability to mix-and-match vaccines could make vaccination programmes more flexible: it would speed up the process and reduce the impact of any supply-chain disruptions. "It really makes the implementation much more simple," said Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at Public Health England, at a press briefing on [3 Feb 2020].

Oxford has said that it will also trial combinations of its COVID-19 vaccine with the Russian coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, which uses harmless viruses to shuttle components of the coronavirus into cells. Sputnik V, which this week was shown to have greater than 90% efficacy against COVID-19, is itself a heterologous prime-boost vaccine, consisting of different viral components in the first and second doses.

T-cell focus
------------
Some researchers also think that combining 2 vaccines could strengthen immune responses by harnessing the best features of each. That would be particularly desirable now that vaccine developers are combating coronavirus variants that seem to be partially resistant to certain immune responses, says Barouch. "It's possible that responses might be better than what either vaccine can achieve on its own," Barouch says. "But that remains to be proven experimentally for COVID-19."

T cells could be key to boosting immune response. RNA vaccines have generated powerful antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. But they have not proved to be as good as the AstraZeneca and Oxford vaccine at stimulating a class of T cells called CD8+ T cells, says Zhou Xing, an immunologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. These cells can strengthen an immune response by identifying and destroying cells infected with the virus.

Animal studies suggest that a strengthened immune response is possible: in a preprint published on bioRxiv on 29 Jan 2021 [Spencer AJ et al; see abstract below] researchers reported that a combination of an RNA coronavirus vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine roused CD8+ T cells in mice better than either vaccine alone.

Viral vectors
-------------
Other combinations could yield similar results. Immunologist Jae-Hwan Nam of the Catholic University of Korea in Bucheon is particularly keen to see trials of AstraZeneca's vaccine together with a protein-based vaccine made by Novavax in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Protein vaccines provoke immune responses similar to RNA vaccines, he says, and Novavax's vaccine might easier to make and distribute than the RNA vaccines. [N.B. The Novavax vaccine named "NVX-CoV2373 contains a full-length, prefusion spike protein made using Novavax' recombinant nanoparticle technology and [a] proprietary saponin-based Matrix-M (TM) adjuvant. The purified protein is encoded by the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and is produced in insect cells."; https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-initiation-prevent-19-pivotal-phase-3-efficacy]. Unlike the RNA vaccines, Sputnik V works by combining 2 vaccines that each tuck the DNA encoding a crucial coronavirus protein, called spike, into a harmless virus. The virus enters human cells, where the DNA is expressed. The immune system then mounts a response to the spike protein.

But if the same virus is used in subsequent shots, an immune response against the harmless virus itself could dampen the response to spike. Sputnik V addresses this problem by using 2 different shuttling viruses, one in each shot. AstraZeneca's vaccine uses only one, making the heterologous prime-boost studies with Pfizer's vaccine and Sputnik V particularly attractive.

If all goes well, the results from the trial arm testing the 4-week regimen should be available by June [2021], in time to inform the United Kingdom's ongoing vaccination campaign, says Matthew Snape, a paediatrician at the University of Oxford and the trial's chief investigator. Snape says that the team hopes to add further vaccines to its study as they become available. Combination studies are possible thanks to the rapid development of multiple vaccine options against the coronavirus, says Xing. "We are in a strong position to go after the best immunologically considered strategies," he says.

"Abstract
---------
"Several vaccines have demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 mediated disease, yet there is limited data on the immune response induced by heterologous vaccination regimens using alternate vaccine modalities. Here, we present a detailed description of the immune response, in mice, following vaccination with a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine and an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that antibody responses are higher in 2-dose heterologous vaccination regimens than single dose regimens, with high titre neutralising antibodies induced. Importantly, the cellular immune response after a heterologous regimen is dominated by cytotoxic T cells and Th1+ CD4 T cells which is superior to the response induced in homologous vaccination regimens in mice."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
To date, uncertainty remains about how long the protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 persists and reports of suspected reinfection began to be described in recovered patients months after the 1st episode. [1] Viral evolution may favor reinfections, and the recently described spike mutations, particularly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the UK, South Africa, and most recently in Brazil, have raised concern on their potential impact in infectivity, immune escape and reinfection. [2,3,4] We report a case of reinfection from distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages presenting the E484K mutation in Brazil, a variant associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies. [5,6,7]

----
A 45 year old female healthcare executive, resident in Salvador, Bahia state, Northeast Brazil, with no comorbidities, presenting symptoms of viral infection on 2 occasions ([26 May 2020 and 26 Oct 2020]). In the 1st episode, the patient presented diarrhea, myalgia, asthenia, and odynophagia for approximately 7 days. She used 40 mg prednisone for 5 days and returned to activities 21 days later without sequelae or complaints.

In the 2nd episode, symptomatically more severe, the patient presented headache, malaise, diarrhea, cough, and sore throat that evolved to myalgia and respiratory distress, ageusia, muscle fatigue, insomnia, mild dyspnea on exertion, and shortness of breath.

Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by multiplex real-time PCR Allplex (TM) SARS-CoV-2 assay (Seegene Inc, Seoul, Korea). On both occasions, results of RT-PCR tests targeting 3 genes (N, E, and RdR) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure1A). Cycle threshold values (Cts) of N, E, and RdRp targets were 25, 26, and 27 in the 1st episode and 21, 12, and 17 in the 2nd episode. In the 2nd episode the patient presented a high viral load, presumed by the low Cts detected. 4 weeks after testing positive by RT-PCR in the 2nd episode, an IgG test against S1 protein by chemiluminescence (VITROS (R) Ortho Clinical Diagnostic, New Jersey, United States), was performed and showed a positive result (index value: 2.15 on [23 Nov 2020]).

Sequencing was then conducted by PGM Ion Torrent (Life Technologies, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 1 405 009 mapped reads for sample A and 2 570 182 reads for sample B were obtained, resulting in a sequencing mean depth greater than 1000X for both samples and a coverage greater than 99%.

We further assessed the distinct viral origin of the 2 infections by phylogenetic inference. To do so, we combine our 2 new isolates (EPI_ISL_756293 and EPI_ISL_756294) with all Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) up to [14 Jan 2021]. Only genomes greater than 29 000 bp and less than 1% of ambiguities were retrieved (n=1164). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT [8] and submitted to IQ-TREE for maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis. [9] We inferred time-scaled trees by using TreeTime. [10]

Phylogenetic analysis, of the 2 newly whole genome sequences compared with contemporaneous sequences from Brazil (Supplementary Table 1), clearly demonstrated that the 2 COVID-19 episodes, separated by a 147-day interval, were indeed caused by different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, confirming reinfection (Figure 1B). In the 1st episode, the lineage B.1.1.33 was detected, whereas lineage P.2 (an alias for B.1.1.28.2) was detected in the 2nd infection (Figure 1 panel B), according to the Pangolin lineage classification (pangoLEARNversion 2021-01-11). Further, we identified several mutations distinguishing the 2 genomes (Figure 1C), 3 of them in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. In the 1st infection, the retrieved genome presented the S:G1219C, while in the 2nd infection, S:E484K and S:V1176F were observed.

The reinfection case here described, aligns with another reinfection case recently described in Brazil that also documented a 1st infection with the B.1.1.33 lineage followed by a 2nd one with the P.2 lineage (https://virological.org/t/spike-e484k-mutation-in-the-first-sars-cov-2-reinfection-case-confirmed-in-brazil-2020/584). The E484K mutation, located in the viral RBD, has been emerging independently in several SARS-CoV-2 variants and its monitoring is of pivotal importance in the current stage of the pandemic. At least, 3 main lineages harbor E484K: a) B.1.351, first identified in South Africa and widespread worldwide [3] (https://virological.org/t/tracking-the-international-spread-of-sars-cov-2-lineages-b-1-1-7-and-b-1-351-501y-v2/592); b) P.1, recently described in Manaus, Brazil, and harboring a constellation of new mutations (including the N501Y) (https://virological.org/t/genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-manaus-preliminary-findings/586); c) P.2, also described in Brazil [4] and already detected in UK, USA, Canada, and Argentina (https://cov-lineages.org/lineages.html). This case reporting [of] a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with a E484K variant corroborates in vitro and in silico studies that estimated the potential of lineages carrying this mutation to escape from neutralizing antibodies, [6,7] and also highlights the importance of genomic surveillance to detect and monitor the emergence of new viral linages with possible implications in public health policies and immunization strategies.

A 5 month interval between infections has been reported in the past. At present, all eyes are on the key newly identified variants to see if the theoretical concern re immune escape turns out to be a reality. Reinfections with other clades have been documented. Piri and colleagues did a systematic review of the PubMed database looking at reported reinfection rates, identifying 1128 case reports of reinfection as of November 2020. They identified a recurrence rate between 2.3% and 21.4% in cohort studies. 97.3% of reinfections were of decreased or same severity as the 1st infection and 2.6% were more severe. The mean time interval between infections was 20 days (1-98 days) leaving open an interpretation of possible persistent infections rather than reinfections.

Abu-Raddad and colleagues reviewed records on 133 266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, of whom 243 (0.18%) had at least one repeat positive PCR 45 days or longer after the 1st positive PCR. Of the 243 cases, 54 (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection with a median time between events of 64.5 days (45-129). They used PCR cycle threshold differences between the 2 samples as a means of classifying a 2nd event as highly probable reinfection and viral genome sequencing was performed on 23 of the 54 highly probable reinfection cases. None of the 1st or reinfection events resulted in severe disease.

The question remains, Will the reinfection rate appearing to increase in areas associated with circulation of these variants be a more frequent event, signaling the need for booster vaccinations with a vaccine containing antigen from the mutated viruses?

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (123 433), Brazil (58 349), Spain (29 960), and France (23 448) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 16 003 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 3 Feb 2021 to late 4 Feb 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain, France, UK (20 634), Russia (16 714), Italy (13 656), Germany (13 047), India (12 410), Mexico (12 153), and Indonesia (11 434). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 5 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 14.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 18.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.1% decrease in reported deaths (having reported 5058 deaths in the past 24 hours).

Impression: The global daily reported cases over 500 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 105.4 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.29 million reported deaths. With the addition of the Czech Republic, there are now 20 countries with cumulative case totals above 1 million. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.MPP]
