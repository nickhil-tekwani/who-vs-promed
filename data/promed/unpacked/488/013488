Nearly 200 people across the United Kingdom are part of a _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to pork scratching products. There have been 179 reported cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Infantis since September 2020, according to the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. Public Health England said 56% of cases are male, and ages range from 0-91 years old with a median of 53. Almost 2/3 of those sick have been reported since June 2021.

No deaths are linked to the outbreak, but 1/3 of the confirmed cases who completed case interviews have been hospitalized with _Salmonella_ infections. There are 154 sick people from all 9 regions of England, 14 patients in Wales, 10 in Scotland, and 1 in Northern Ireland.

Tayto Group Limited has recalled some Mr. Porky, Jay's, and The Real Pork Crackling Co. products because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. Items have "best before" dates up to and including 19 Feb 2022. A full list of affected products and pack sizes can be found at https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/alert/fsa-prin-47-2021. All products manufactured since February [2021] at one factory linked to the outbreak have been recalled and withdrawn from sale. Production was voluntarily halted at this plant once a possible link was identified earlier this month [August 2021].

Tayto Group is a British-owned crisp and snack manufacturer, producing over 5.5 million packs a day across 7 UK sites.

Tina Potter, head of incidents at the Food Standards Agency, said the authority was advising consumers not to eat any of the affected products and to return them to the place of purchase for a refund.

"The food business involved has voluntarily suspended its production to put additional controls in place to improve the safety of their products, and they have decided on a voluntary basis to withdraw and recall all of the products within shelf-life produced at this site," she said.

Dr. Lesley Larkin, surveillance lead for gastrointestinal pathogens unit at Public Health England, said a link was established between patients based on analysis of data from whole-genome sequencing and epidemiological investigations.

"Together with Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, we have been investigating an outbreak of over 170 cases of _Salmonella_ Infantis that have occurred across the UK," she said. "These investigations, together with those carried out by local authorities, have indicated the source of infection is pork scratchings produced by a single company in the UK. The Food Standards Agency has acted on these findings to mitigate any further risk to public health from the contaminated food."

The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) in Hong Kong urged the public not to consume 2 kinds of snack from the brand Mr. Porky imported from the UK by Jenzet Limited as they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. A CFS spokesman said: "The CFS received a notification from the British authorities through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) that the products may be contaminated by _Salmonella_. The Food Standards Agency and the Public Health England are conducting an investigation, and the concerned products are being recalled."

[Readers who are "muggles" to different snacks made from the skin of pigs may need to be educated about the differences in pork snacks.

"In simple terms, the difference between pork scratchings, crackling, and rinds typically comes from the way they are cooked:

"- Pork scratchings are cooked once and are the hardest of these 3.
- Pork crackling is cooked twice. The 2nd cook lightens the edge of the pork, which puffs it a little, resulting in more flavour with less tooth-shattering crunch.
- Pork rind is also cooked twice but at a higher temperature, resulting in a lighter, fluffier snack that's full of flavour. Pork crunch is a British term for the same snack."

Given that these products are cooked, the contamination with _Salmonella_ likely occurred after the cooking process. - Mod.LL
