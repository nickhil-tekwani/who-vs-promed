The Bureau of Animal Health has announced on the French Ministry of
Agriculture's website dated 27 Oct 2008 that the confirmation of a
case of bluetongue BTV-1 in the Department of Finistere has caused a
modification of the regulated zones of Finistere and Morbihan.

This order of 27 Oct 2008 comes into full effect on 28 Oct 2008.

The list of the actual regulated communes will only show the communes
in the (new) regulated zones.

21 614 cases of BTV-8 during 2008 have been due to viral circulation in 2008.

3340 cases of BTV-1 during 2008 have been due to viral circulation in
2008. 68 BTV-1 and BTV-8 cases were recorded within the same herds.

15 696 cases of BTV-8 were declared in 2007 (3 of BTV-1).

6020 cases of BTV-8 during the 1st 6 months of 2008 (and 6 of BTV-1)
have been due to viral circulation in 2007.

[The hundreds-of-kms leap of BTV-1 from southwestern France to
Brittany in the northwest is puzzling, similar to the recent leap of
BTV-8 in Spain to Andalusia in the south. In both cases, movements of
infected animals are the most likely source of infection, though
other routes are not excluded. For the location of the newly infected
zone in France, see the map at the above URL; the newly declared
BTV-1/ BTV-8 zone in Finistere and Morbihan is colored yellow.

Hopefully, the further spread of BTV-1 in a northerly direction will
be slowed and eventually stopped by the approaching colder months.

An updated EU map of the BTV restriction zones in Europe (as of 29
Oct 2008) is available at
