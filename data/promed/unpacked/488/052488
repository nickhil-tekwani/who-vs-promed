Turkey reports bird flu outbreak near Armenian border
-----------------------------------------------
Turkey has reported an outbreak of avian influenza in chickens, less
than a month after declaring its territory free of the virus, and
said it had culled 359 birds as a precautionary measure.
In a statement released late on Tuesday [27 Dec 2005], the
Agriculture Ministry said it had imposed quarantine in the affected
area of Igdir, near Turkey's far eastern border with Armenia, after
detecting a strain of the bird flu virus in dead chickens. The strain
has been identified as the H5 type, but authorities are conducting
further tests to establish whether it is the deadly H5N1 strain that
has killed some 70 people in Asia since 2003 and forced the slaughter
of millions of birds. It said it had sent samples to the World Health
Organization and the European Union for more tests.
"All necessary measures have been taken, with close coordination
between central and local units," the ministry statement said. "As
the necessary quarantine measures were undertaken before the
identification (of bird flu), there is no cause for concern for human
health or for our country's meat and egg trade," the ministry said.
Igdir is a remote rural area where farming and animal husbandry are
the main means of livelihood. But poultry are mostly raised by people
for their own consumption.
An outbreak of bird flu in October 2005 in more densely populated
northwest Turkey triggered the culling of more than 10 000 birds.
That outbreak was identified as the deadly H5N1 strain. Most of
Europe imposed a ban on imports of Turkish live birds which was
subsequently eased.
The Agriculture Ministry announced on 9 Dec 2005 that it had
successfully eliminated bird flu in western Turkey. But experts say
Turkey will remain vulnerable to further outbreaks, because it lies
on the flight path of migratory birds, which are widely thought to
help spread the virus. The ministry said it believed migratory birds
may have brought the virus to Igdir from the Caucasus region.

[The results of laboratory testing of the samples, reportedly already
sent to the international reference centers, are soon expected.
The following information, received at the OIE headquarters in Paris
on 27 Dec 2005 from Dr. Nihat Pakdil, General Director of Protection
and Control, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Ankara, is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/Messages/051228TUR.htm>:
Avian influenza due to virus subtype H5 was reported in 4 backyard
flocks in the village of Kopruler, Aralik, Igdir province. The
outbreak is located 7 km from Armenia, 15 km from Iran, and 40 km
from the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan.
Date of confirmation of the event: 26 Dec 2005 (virus isolation).
Date of start of the event: 15 Dec 2005.
Number of susceptible animals in the outbreak: 1559 poultry
(chickens, geese, turkeys and ducks).
Number of cases: 1200.
Number of deaths: 1200.
Number of animals destroyed: 359.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: under investigation.
Control measures undertaken:
- Stamping out policy. All carcasses were buried with lime in 3 pits
dug in situ.
- Quarantine.
- Movement control inside the country.
- Disinfection of infected premises/establishments.
- National and Local Disease Control Centers were activated.
- Protection and surveillance zones were established.
- Clinical surveillance has been continuing.
- Biosecurity measures have been increased.
- Public awareness is being raised and training sessions are being conducted.
Other details/comments:
- There are no poultry flocks within the 3-km-radius zone.
- Igdir province is situated in the eastern part of Turkey. The
region is one of the main routes of migratory birds passing through
Anatolia. - Mod.AS]

Chicken dung used to feed fish may help spread bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu may be spread by using chicken dung as food in fish farms, a
practice now routine in Asia, according to the world's leading bird
conservation organization.
Fertilizing fish ponds with poultry feces, which can dramatically
improve fish growth, may set up major new reservoirs of avian
influenza infection if the chickens providing the manure are infected
themselves, according to BirdLife International, the Cambridge-based
umbrella body for bird protection groups in 100 countries.
The suggestion, which has echoes of the BSE outbreak in Britain -- in
which cattle were infected by their food -- puts a question mark over
a technique firmly backed by the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) as a primary means of providing protein for
mushrooming populations in developing countries.
Known as integrated livestock-fish farming, the technique involves
transferring the wastes from raising pigs, ducks or chickens directly
to fish farms. At the right dosage, the nutrients in the manure give
an enormous boost to the growth of plankton in the ponds, which are
the main food of fish such as carp and tilapia.
BirdLife International is now calling for an investigation into the
possibility that thousands of manure-fed ponds across Asia may be the
means by which the new potentially deadly strain of avian influenza,
H5N1, is being spread. BirdLife points out that outbreaks of H5N1
have occurred this year [2005] at locations in China, Romania and
Croatia where there are fish farms.
The Chinese outbreak of H5N1 in May [2005], which mainly involved
bar-headed geese, took place at Qinghai Lake, a location where the
FAO helped establish an integrated livestock fish farm in the early
1990s, BirdLife said. "This outbreak helped lead to the widespread
media speculation about wild birds spreading H5N1," said Richard
Thomas from BirdLife. "We pointed out that bar-headed geese migrate
from India, where H5N1 has never occurred, and migrate early, so they
must have contracted the disease locally, at Qinghai."
Although no mention has been made of the possible links between
manure-fed ponds and influenza in the recent alarm over bird flu, the
issue has been raised before, and the FAO, although actively
promoting the technique, is well aware of the threat. Its 2003
report, Integrated Livestock Fish Farming Systems, noted: "Recently,
livestock and fish have been implicated in the irregular occurrence
of influenza pandemics; the global impacts on public health of
promoting livestock and fish integration are huge if these claims are
substantiated."
In fact, the FAO may have been aware for very much longer that some
scientists think there is a risk. The 2003 report includes a
reference to a paper published in the journal Nature in 1988. This
paper, by Christoph Scholtissek from the University of Giessen in
Germany and Ernest Naylor from the University of Bangor in Wales, was
titled Fish Farming and Influenza Pandemics. It said that bringing
together fish farms with farm livestock "may well be the creation of
a considerable human health hazard."
However, the FAO has continued to promote integrated livestock fish
farming actively throughout the ensuing period.
BirdLife's director Dr. Michael Rands said: "We are not aware that
people have confirmed that that is a likely cause, but people have
suggested it. If it's a possibility, and if it presents a serious
human health risk, it certainly ought to be researched, and if it has
been researched, the research should be out there for us all to see."

[Poultry excreta may include pathogenic organisms, medicinal drugs,
and toxins (for example, botulism). Any international trade in
unprocessed poultry manure is, to the best of this moderator's
knowledge, not sanctioned by any country. Unprocessed poultry manure
and litter are regarded a potential vehicle for the spread of various
infectious (as well as non-infectious) agents, avian influenza
certainly included. There are strict legal restrictions on its exit
from quarantined or suspected premises, for any use, in most if not
all countries. This is valid not only for recycling to animals, but
also for other uses, such as field fertilizer (see a Maryland example
in 20040309.0665).
Various countries have banned -- or significantly restricted -- the
recycling of poultry excreta to food animals and, in particular, to
ruminants.
For the Policy Document of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on the
feeding of poultry manure to cattle, see
<http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:nIYh8sepyDoJ:www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/feebet/quelnew/pd002e.shtml+Canada+poultry+manure&hl=en&start=4&ie=UTF-8>;
the FDA's "Statement about allowing chicken manure to be put into
cattle feed" can be seen at
<http://www.ehso.com/ehshome/FoodSafety/chickenmanurefda.htm>.
While the practice described by BirdLife International may indeed be
involved in the spread of H5N1, provided the liter is derived from
infected premises, it seems unlikely that such a product would be
transported to far destinations. However, uncontrolled, unrestricted
use may be involved in environmental contamination, exposing wild
avians to infection, with the possible subsequent long distance
spread of the virus by them.
Additional investigations into the possible role of wild birds in the
spread of the H5N1 virus are needed. - Mod.AS]
