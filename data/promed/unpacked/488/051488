Fiji: Measles Outbreak and Response; Feb to May 2006
----------------------------------------------------
In September 2005, the 37 countries and areas of
the World Health Organization (WHO) Western
Pacific Region (WPR) established a goal to
eliminate measles in the region by 2012. After
multiple outbreaks in 1996 and 1997, measles
supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in
1997 and 1998 resulted in apparent interruption
of measles transmission in WPR. Since then,
importations have resulted in limited outbreaks
in French Polynesia and Guam, a large outbreak in
the Marshall Islands in 2003, and an outbreak in
Fiji during Feb to May 2006. This report
describes the epidemiologic findings, public
health response, and potential causes of the 2006
outbreak that produced 132 measles cases in Fiji
(2006 estimated population: 832 432), the most
populous country in the South Pacific.
Background
----------
To achieve and sustain measles elimination and
prevent importation-associated outbreaks, the WPR
office of WHO recommends that countries achieve
and maintain vaccination coverage of greater than
95 percent with 2 doses of measles vaccine in
every district. The WPR office further recommends
that countries ensure measles surveillance that
1) detects one or more suspected measles cases
per 100 000 population per year in more than 80
percent of districts, 2) tests serum samples from
more than 80 percent of persons with suspected
measles, and 3) obtains a viral isolate from
every chain of measles transmission (1).
Fiji's Expanded Program on Immunization
introduced measles vaccine in 1982 as a single
dose for children aged 9 months. From 1982 to
1998, reported routine measles vaccination
coverage increased from 20 to 80 percent. Measles
SIAs were conducted in 1998, targeting children
aged 9 months to 14 years and achieving an
administrative vaccination coverage rate* of 85
percent, and in 2001, targeting children aged 9
months to 5 years and achieving an administrative
coverage of 86 percent.
In 2003, Fiji introduced a 2-dose schedule for
measles-rubella vaccine, with doses administered
at ages 1 year and 6 years, the latter at school
entry. An SIA with measles-rubella vaccine
targeting children aged 6 to 11 years was
conducted during 2003 to 2004; administrative
vaccination coverage was not reported. During
2001 to 2004, routine vaccination coverage with
one dose of measles-rubella vaccine averaged 83
percent annually. Findings from a 2005 survey of
children aged 12 to 23 months indicated
nationwide vaccination coverage of 80 percent
with 1 dose of measles-rubella vaccine, although
pockets of lower coverage were identified.
Before 2006, the last laboratory-confirmed
measles outbreak in Fiji occurred during Sep 1997
to Apr 1998, when 955 measles cases were
reported, of which 86 percent were in children
aged less than15 years. Since late 1998, Fiji had
been considered measles-free. Isolated clinical
measles cases had been reported, and rubella, but
not measles, had been confirmed by laboratory
testing.
Outbreak
--------
On 17 Feb 2006, the Ministry of Health (MOH) in
Fiji received a report of 3 infants, with rash
onsets on Feb 8 and 11, who had been admitted to
a divisional hospital because of suspected
measles and pneumonia. The 3 infants lived near
the international airport at Nadi in the Western
Division. On 23 Feb 2006, measles was confirmed
by serologic testing for the presence of
anti-measles virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) at the
national laboratory in Fiji and verified on Feb
28 by the WHO Measles Regional Reference
Laboratory at the Victorian Infectious Diseases
Reference Laboratory in Australia, where an
isolate was identified as measles genotype H1.
During the period 17 Feb to 9 Jun 2006, a total
of 132 suspected measles cases were reported to
MOH, including 22 that were laboratory-confirmed
(anti-measles virus IgM-positive) (illustrated by
a histogram in the original text). Among the 132
measles patients, 119 (90 percent) resided in the
Western Division and 13 (10 percent) in the
Central and Eastern divisions. Within the Western
Division, one subdivision had 58 (44 percent) of
the measles cases. Routine vaccination coverage
with 1 dose of measles-rubella vaccine in this
subdivision had been reported as 49 percent in
2004 and 68 percent in 2005. A total of 76 (58
percent) patients were aged less than 5 years;
the highest incidence (378 cases per 100 000
population) was among children aged 6 to 11
months (supplemented by tabulated data in the
original text). Thirty-one (23 percent) patients
required hospitalization; no deaths were
reported. For 41 children aged 12 to 59 months
for whom MOH could obtain detailed case
investigation data, 12 (29 percent) had received
1 dose of measles-rubella vaccine, 10 (24
percent) had not been vaccinated, and 19 (46
percent) had unknown vaccination status. As of
August 8, no additional laboratory-confirmed
measles cases had been reported with rash onset
after 21 May 2006.
Outbreak Control Measures
------------------------
Enhanced surveillance
----------------------
Reporting of acute fever and rash cases was
intensified in Fiji's 21-hospital sentinel
surveillance network, initially created for acute
flaccid paralysis surveillance as part of the
global poliomyelitis eradication initiative.
Daily telephone calls were made to all sentinel
hospitals for reports on new patients. Illnesses
with rash and fever were confirmed as measles if
they met the WHO measles clinical case
definition.� To encourage case reporting, the
national coordinator of the Expanded Program on
Immunization provided daily surveillance
summaries by e-mail and fax to all hospitals,
selected health centers, and partner agencies.
Case management
----------------
Triage and measles treatment recommendations,
based on WHO Integrated Management of Childhood
Illnesses guidelines (2), were distributed to all
health facilities and health workers to ensure
that suspected measles cases were managed
appropriately and to prevent measles virus
transmission in health-care facilities. Vitamin
A, a key part of WHO case-management guidelines
to reduce measles morbidity and mortality, was
distributed in capsules to all hospitals and
health centers in late March.
Social mobilization
--------------------
A multiphase social mobilization and
communication plan was developed using WHO's
Communication-for-Behavioral-Impact approach (3),
to prompt individual and family action. The
initial phase, "Beware," informed the public
about the measles outbreak and promoted reporting
of suspected cases. The 2nd phase, "Vaccinate,"
promoted an immunization campaign, prompting
parents and guardians to bring children in the
targeted age group to vaccination sites made
visible by large banners. Activities included
distribution of 60 000 fact sheets to schools and
community and religious organizations,
announcements on television and radio, and
advertisements in cinemas and newspapers.
Outbreak-response immunization (ORI)
-------------------------------------
To protect children in the age groups accounting
for greater than 60 percent of cases and most at
risk for severe outcomes, 91 595 children aged 6
months to less than 6 years were targeted with
measles-rubella vaccine during the period 20 Mar
to 3 May 2006. A goal of greater than 95 percent
vaccination coverage was set for all
administrative levels. Plans at the subdivisional
level were developed for budget estimates and
distribution of bundled vaccine and
injection-safety items.� Campaign training
workshops, including classes on vaccination
safety, were conducted for health-care workers
throughout the country. Vaccination-coverage
rates with measles-rubella vaccine were reported
twice weekly from all vaccination sites to
promptly identify areas needing external
assistance. Rapid vaccination-coverage
monitoring, using a 20-household convenience
sample format, was conducted in urban and other
areas at risk for measles. If two or more homes
contained unvaccinated children, the area was
targeted for repeat vaccinations. Of 32 areas
surveyed, 12 (38 percent) required follow-up.
MOH subsequently reported that 89 747 (98
percent) of targeted children had received
measles-rubella vaccine as of 24 May 2006. Among
20 Fijian subdivisions, 2 had reported coverage
less than 95 percent: Suva (91 percent) in the
Central Division and Macuata (90 percent) in the
Northern Division. No serious adverse events from
vaccination were reported.

MMWR Editorial Note
--------------------
The measles outbreak in Fiji described in this
report, like the 2003 outbreak in the Marshall
Islands, underscores that absence of measles
virus transmission should not create a false
sense of security and that high population
immunity is essential to preventing future
outbreaks (4). As an island, Fiji's isolation
from countries where measles is endemic, combined
with its small population, likely contributed to
the lack of reported measles cases from late 1998
through 2005 (5,6). Low routine vaccination
coverage, combined with persistent pockets of
susceptible adolescents and adults despite
previous SIAs and outbreaks, might have left the
country vulnerable to an outbreak via importation.
Achieving greater than 95 percent population
immunity (i.e., through high vaccination coverage
with 2 doses of measles vaccine) will halt
measles transmission within a population (7). In
Fiji, the high incidence of measles in a single
subdivision with historically low routine measles
vaccination coverage and the occurrence of
measles in all age groups highlight the
importance of monitoring measles vaccination
coverage at subnational levels and in older age
groups (i.e., aged greater than 15 years) to
ensure that pockets of measles susceptibility do
not develop.
The first identified cases of measles in this
outbreak were in children already hospitalized
with pneumonia. Because recognition of measles
might decrease after measles virus transmission
has been interrupted for long periods, national
programs should remind clinicians to be vigilant
and to report suspected cases, particularly in
areas of low vaccination coverage. To increase
sensitivity and timeliness of surveillance,
primary-care facilities and outpatient
departments might be included as reporting sites,
and community-based informants used to report
suspected measles cases.
The findings in this report are subject to at
least 3 limitations. First, surveillance was
conducted through sentinel site reporting and, as
a result, all suspected measles cases might not
have been reported. Second, not all suspected
measles cases were laboratory-confirmed;
therefore, some suspected cases might have had
etiologies other than measles. Finally, the
estimated vaccination coverage achieved in the
ORI was based on administrative data. Because
uncertainties often exist regarding the
denominator used to calculate administrative
coverage, these data generally are less reliable
than survey-based coverage estimates.
Targeting children aged 6 months to less than 6
years during the ORI was important because this
group accounted for greater than 60 percent of
cases and was more vulnerable to severe measles
outcomes. The Fijian MOH rapidly achieved high
vaccination coverage with measles vaccine. At the
same time, a sharp decrease in reported cases
among all age groups occurred. The effectiveness
of the ORI is greater when the intervention
occurs early in the course of an outbreak (8). In
Fiji, the campaign began 6 weeks after the 1st
case was reported; 8 weeks later, the last case
was reported. The commitment by MOH and its
partners to reach greater than 95 percent of
targeted children was essential to interrupting
measles virus transmission and preventing spread
of the measles virus to other vulnerable Pacific
Islands.
