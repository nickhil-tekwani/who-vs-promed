Ontario: 5 Horses Confirmed West Nile Virus-positive
-------------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 12 Sep 2002, West Nile virus (WNV) has been diagnosed in 5 horses
by positive immunohistochemistry at the Animal Health Laboratory,
University of Guelph. One of these has been confirmed by PCR, the other 4
are pending. 2 other suspect cases have been diagnosed by IgM capture ELISA
(one horse was euthanised, the other has recovered). The 7 cases to date
have all been diagnosed since 28 Aug 2002 and are from various locations in
southern Ontario from the Toronto area westward.
Obtaining accurate case numbers for Ontario is problematic. Since WNV is
not a reportable disease, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is not
offering diagnostic testing on equine submissions, nor are they compiling
statistics on equine cases. PCR confirmatory testing is being done through
the Manitoba provincial diagnostic laboratory. Serology is being sent out
to Cornell through the Animal Health Laboratory in Guelph, although some
veterinarians are sending sera directly to Cornell or Michigan State. In
these cases, results are not reported directly to Ontario Ministry of
Agriculture and Food and are not included in the statistics. There have
been many reports of suspected cases, based on clinical signs or single
serology test results. However, unless they are accompanied by valid
diagnostic test results to distinguish them from other causes of neurologic
disease (e.g. rabies, eastern equine encephalitis), they do not meet the
case definition for official reporting.
