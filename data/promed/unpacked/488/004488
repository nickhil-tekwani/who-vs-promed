Pig disease feared to claim 1st fatality
----------------------------------------
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), commonly dubbed
blue-ear disease, is suspected as the culprit behind the death of a
man in the central province of Quang Ngai on Monday [24 May 2010].

Nguyen Xuan Men, deputy director of the provincial Department of
Health confirmed with the online newspaper Vnexpress that the young
man was suspected to be the 1st to succumb to the deadly pig disease
that is spreading to pig herds in the north. According to Men, the
young man suffered from diarrhea, high fever, convulsion, and skin
hemorrhage after eating fresh pig blood pudding. He was not
hospitalized in time and lost consciousness.

The man, who was transferred to the Central Hospital of Hue from
Quang Ngai, died on Monday. Health workers immediately disinfected
where he was living and examined people who had been in contact with
the deceased. Health workers said the virus of PRRS has a particular
affinity for macrophages particularly those found in the lung.
Macrophages are part of the body defenses. Those present in the lung
are called alveolar macrophages. They ingest and remove invading
bacteria and viruses but not in the case of the PRRS virus. Instead,
the virus multiplies inside them producing more viruses and kills the
macrophages.

Once it has entered a herd PRRS virus tends to remain present and
active indefinitely. The fatality rate is at 7 percent; thus, it can
do harm if patients are not timely hospitalized.

The National Department of Health reported that no new blue ear
disease outbreaks were reported in recent days. However, the epidemic
remained active in 15 provinces nationwide, mostly in northern
provinces including Hanoi. Since April this year, 4 positive [human?]
cases of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome have been
detected.

[Initially reported by Viet Nam to the OIE as starting in March 2007,
PRRS was declared endemic in February 2008. Some investigators are of
the opinion that it had been circulating in the region since 1999
(for more detailed information, see: Porcine reprod. & resp. syndrome
- Viet Nam 20100414.1206).

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterised
by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets
and growing pigs. The disease is caused by porcine reproductive and
respiratory disease (PRRS) virus, a virus classified as a member of
the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_.
The primary target cell of the virus is the alveolar macrophage of
the pig. 2 major antigenic types of the virus exist, the European and
the American type.

The virus is primarily transmitted via infected pigs but also by
faeces, urine, semen and fomites. PRRS virus infection occurs in most
major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive
failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal mummification,
abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die
soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections.
Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually
complicated by secondary infections. No other species are known to be
naturally infected with PRRSV. Virological diagnosis of PRRS virus
infection is difficult. For further information readers are referred
to chapter 2.8.7 in the O.i.E. Manual
(<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf>).

There are no previous records of human cases of PPR virus infection
at least to this moderator's knowledge. Indeed none of the viruses
classified in the family _Arteriviridae_ are known to be natural
human pathogens. Therefore this Vietnamese report must regarded with
caution in the absence of confirmatory laboratory diagnosis.
Nonetheless the nature of the exposure (consumption of amounts of
fresh (uncooked?) pig blood is exceptional. Furthermore the outcome
of infection in pigs is in general less dramatic than that described
in the case of this unfortunate man.

Confirmatory diagnosis is awaited. If this report is authenticated it
is a very serious development in view of the global occurrence of the
PRRS in pigs and the genetic lability of the virus. - Mod.CP]
