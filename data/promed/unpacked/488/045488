INFLUENZA - NEW ZEALAND
=======================
[In reply to the query about reports of influenza in Australia and
New Zealand, "Influenza - Australia: RFI" and "Influenza -
Australia (2)":]
NZCDC who are responsible for influenza surveillance in New Zealand are not
yet on Promed. I have checked with Dave Featherstone - influenza virologist
at NZCDC and he tells me the influenza A and B cases reported to WHO
represented the tail end of our influenza season. Most of these late cases
were in October although there were also cases in November. It is not
unusual for cases to occur in spring in New Zealand.
