Transmission of A(H1N1)2009 virus from human to birds
-----------------------------------------------------
I am sending you a second report about genetic study of 1st transmission of
A(H1N1)2009 virus from human to birds.

On 23 Aug [2009] the Institute of Public Health (Chile) communicated to
ProMED-mail the 1st isolation of an [influenza] A(H1N1) swine virus in
turkeys.

The finding was done by the Chilean farming agency SAG and the confirmation
and genetic studies are being done in our Institution (national reference
laboratory).

On that occasion we communicated the genetic and antigenic characteristics
of the hemmaglutinin (HA) gene of the turkey's virus in this outbreak (the
virus showed 99.5 to 98.9 per cent similarity to the
[Influenza]A/California/4/2009 reference strain and 100 per cent similarity
with the strains circulating in Chile).

Now, we are reporting the neuraminidase genetic sequencing studies. In this
gene the turkey strain was shown to be 99.7 per cent similar to the
pandemic strains circulating in Chile in human cases, and to have 99.5 per
cent similarity to the reference strain A/California/4/2009, 80.5 per cent
to 86.5 per cent similarity to avian influenza A virus strains (H1N1, H5N1,
H6N1, H7N1) and 83.6 to 92 per cent similarity to swine influenza virus
strains (H1N1) isolated in different countries during years 2000 to 2009.
At the end of this week we will report the results of complete genome.

Transmission of A(H1N1)2009 virus from human to birds
-----------------------------------------------------
Final report about genetic study of 1st transmission of A(H1N1)2009 virus
from human to birds.

On 23 Aug 2009 the Institute of Public Health (Chile) communicated to
ProMED-mail the 1st isolation of a A(H1N1) swine virus in turkeys. The
finding was done by the Chilean farming agency SAG and the confirmation and
genetic studies are being done in our Institution (national reference
laboratory). On that occasion we communicated the genetic and antigenic
characteristics of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of the turkey's
virus in this outbreak. Now, we are reporting the total genome genetic
sequencing studies (nucleotides):

1. The gene that encodes for hemagglutinin (HA) was shown to be 99.5 per
cent similar to the A/California/4/2009 reference strain and 100 per cent
similar to the strains circulating in Chile in patients.
2. The gene that encodes for neuraminidase (NA) was shown to be 99.5 per
cent similar to the A/California/4/2009 reference strain and 99.7 per cent
similar to the strains circulating in Chile in patients.
3. The gene that encodes for a subunit of polymerase (PB1) was shown to be
99.8 per cent similar to the A/California/4/2009 reference strain and 99.9
per cent similar to the strains circulating in Chile in patients.
4. The gene that encodes for a subunit of polymerase (PB2) was shown to be
99.8 per cent similar to the A/California/4/2009 reference strain and 99.8
per cent similar to the strains circulating in Chile in patients.
5. The gene that encodes for a subunit of polymerase (PA) was shown to be
99.7 per cent similar to the A/California/4/2009 reference strain and 99.9
per cent similar to the strains circulating in Chile in patients.
6. The gene that encodes for the nucleoprotein (NP) was shown to be 99.5
per cent similar to the A/California/4/2009 reference strain and 99.7 per
cent similar to the strains circulating in Chile in patients.
7. The gene that encodes for the non-structural proteins ((NS) was shown to
be 99.8 per cent similar to the A/California/4/2009 reference strain and
99.8 per cent similar to the strains circulating in Chile in patients.
8. The gene that encodes for the matrix proteins (M) was shown to be 99.8
per cent similar to the A/California/4/2009 reference strain and 99.7 per
cent similar to the strains circulating in Chile in patients.

The conclusion of the genetic sequencing studies is that the influenza
virus (H1N1) isolated from turkey corresponds to a variant of the influenza
A(H1N1)2009 virus that has been circulating in Chilean people.

I think that now we are facing a new scenario where the chances of the
influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus passing to birds is not just a possibility but
a reality.

This forces us to think some new strategies in order to diminish the risk
of co-infection in birds of avian influenza virus and A(H1N1)2009 human
virus. The replication of both viruses in the same host could mix existing
genetic information (reassortment) and produce a new virus that has most of
the genes of the human virus, but a hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase from
an avian influenza A virus (drift). This new virus might be able to infect
humans and spread from person to person and his surface proteins never been
in contact with human immunology system.

Some strategies to evaluate are:
--------------------------------
1. Review the established priorities for use the new A(H1N1)2009 vaccine.
In my opinion under this new scenario would be a world priority to
vaccinate in 1st term the whole population in countries in which actually
there is presence of the avian influenza virus (some African and south
Asian countries). The vaccine is the best tool to cut the transmission of
the virus among humans and therefore the chance of infecting birds.

2. The laboratory surveillance should also be intensified in these
countries: for avian influenza virus in birds and farm workers and for
A(H1N1)2009 virus in general population and farm workers. This strategy
forces us to train the local laboratories and give them the equipment
required for a local laboratory surveillance and confirmation.

3. Educational campaigns should be made in these countries for all public,
especially to bird's farm workers and small home business. Attention must
be provided to universal precaution to avoid infections from birds or to
infect birds during work. The workers should be trained in keeping alert
about bird's behavior changes. We must keep in mind that the human strain
A(H1N1)2009 seem to have mild symptoms in birds (at least in turkeys).
These decisions imply to postpone actual interest of countries to use the
available vaccine to redirect the benefit to some low income countries. So
we are talking about vaccine that should be provided free of charge for the
majority of this countries. Of course I think that it represents an
inversion for the rest of the world. (keep in mind that the lethality of
avian influenza is close to 50 per cent) and a matter of justice for people
in major risk.

H1N1 flu in turkeys may spread
------------------------------
The detection of an H1N1 virus in turkeys in Chile raises concern that
poultry farms elsewhere in the world could also become infected with the
pandemic flu virus currently circulating in humans, the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said today.

Chilean authorities reported on 20 Aug 2009 that the pandemic H1N1/2009
virus was present in turkeys in 2 farms near the seaport of Valparaiso,
Chile. The flu strain found in the poultry flocks is identical to the
H1N1/2009 pandemic strain currently circulating among human populations
around the world.

No threat to humans
-------------------
"However, the discovery of the virus in turkeys does not pose any immediate
threat to human health and turkey meat can still be sold commercially
following veterinary inspection and hygienic processing. The reaction of
the Chilean authorities to the discovery of H1N1 in turkeys, namely prompt
reporting to international organizations, establishing a temporary
quarantine, and the decision to allow infected birds to recover rather than
culling them is scientifically sound," said FAO's interim chief veterinary
officer, Juan Lubroth. Once the sick birds have recovered, safe production
and processing can continue. They do not pose a threat to the food chain,"
said Lubroth.

Disease monitoring
------------------
The current H1N1 virus strain is a mixture of human, pig and bird genes and
has proved to be very contagious but no more deadly than common seasonal
flu viruses. However, it could theoretically become more dangerous if it
adds virulence by combining with H5N1, commonly known as avian flu, which
is far more deadly but harder to pass along among humans.

"Chile does not have H5N1 flu. In South East Asia, where there is a lot of
the virus circulating in poultry, the introduction of H1N1 in these
populations would be of a greater concern," said Lubroth.

This is one reason why the FAO encourages improved monitoring of health
among animals and ensuring that hygienic and good farming practice
guidelines are followed, including protecting farm workers if animals are
sick and not allowing sick workers near animals.

"We must monitor the situation in animals more closely and strengthen
veterinary services in poor and in-transition countries. They need adequate
diagnostic capability and competent and suitably resourced field teams that
can respond to emergency needs," Lubroth said.

This phenomenon is called genetic reassortment or recombination which may
happen in case of simultaneous viral infections of any of the hosts.

This is now the 4th country that is investigating the spill-over of
H1N1/2009 virus from farm workers showing flu-like illness to animals, with
swine becoming infected in Canada, Argentina and, most recently, Australia.

Even though the clinical infections in pigs and turkeys so far observed
have been generally mild, it is important to bear in mind that the
establishment of pandemic H1N1 virus in pig and poultry farms has the
potential to bring about negative economic consequences such as trade
related restrictions and misguided perceptions of the quality and safety of
meat products, according to FAO.

The emergence of new influenza virus strains capable of affecting humans
and domestic animals remains a broader, more general concern that is being
closely monitored by the FAO, the World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE), and the World Health Organization (WHO).
