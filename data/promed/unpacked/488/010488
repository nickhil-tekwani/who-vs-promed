A total of 2 people have died and 18 others hospitalized following a cholera outbreak in Bauchi state metropolis. This was disclosed by the chairman of Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Agency, Pharmacist Ibrahim Gamawa while briefing newsmen yesterday [Mon 5 Mar 2018] at the Emergency Operation Centre Bauchi. Gamawa stated that out of the 20 new cases, 2 died at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH) and the remaining 18 patients are responding to treatment in the same hospital.

He revealed that the 20 cases came from 4 different locations within Bauchi metropolis; Danmar A and B Isangaya school, Hardo within Kobi ward, Makama B at Nasarawa Jahun and Makama A Gwallaga. The Chairman said that his agency has adequate drugs like ORS [oral rehydration solution], chlorine for disinfection etc. that will aid the public in fighting the outbreak. He added that his agency had set things in motion to disinfect areas in the state.

Gamawa then called on the people of the state to cultivate good personal hygiene and also practice the habit of keeping their environment clean and they should always cover their food items properly, adding that by doing that, it would stop the disease from spreading further. He said that a sensitisation campaign in the media and other channels was being carried to sensitize people on the disease and how to avoid it.

The death toll for the cholera outbreak in Malawi continues to rise, with the number increasing to 20 from 17 within 2 days. National figures further indicate that 722 people are receiving medical treatment, rising from 693 reported on [Sun 4 Mar 2018]. This is despite health authorities declaring that 8 districts are cholera free.

The worst hit districts are Lilongwe and Karonga which have a similar death toll of 7 each. The latest deaths have been recorded in Salima and Dedza district, which was earlier put on the cholera free list.

Poor access to safe drinking water and sanitation are being described as the major causes of cholera. Spokesperson for the Ministry of Heath Joshua Malango earlier told Capital FM on government's interventions to contain the further spread of the disease.

Cholera - Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo
----------------------------------------------------
From [25 Nov 2017] through [23 Feb 2018], 1065 cases including 43 deaths (case fatality rate of 4 percent) have been reported from 32 out of 35 health zones in Kinshasa province. From [25 Nov 2017] through [15 Feb 2018], 177 stool specimens were collected for testing at the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB). Out of the total stool specimens, 83 tested positive for _Vibrio cholera_, 83 tested negative, and 11 are currently being analyzed.

Since the end of November 2017, Kinshasa province has been facing an outbreak of cholera. In January 2018, following intensive rains and flooding events, case numbers increased from less than 5 to more than 100 weekly reported cases. However since mid-January [2018], there has been a downward trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cholera cases (Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]).

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is an endemic country for cholera. Sporadic cases and outbreaks are common, particularly in the eastern provinces of the country. Kinshasa, is not part of the endemic provinces for cholera, but has reported several cholera outbreaks over the last years.

Public health response
--------------------
- Case management continues at five of the cholera treatment centers (CTC) and cholera treatment units (CTU), Pakadjuma, Luka, Bumbu, Liziba CTUs and Maluka I CTC.
Pakadjuma, Luka and Bumba CTUs are managed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Belgium.
Liziba CTU is managed by MSF Spain.
Maluku CTC is managed by the Maluku I Health Zone with support from WHO.

- MSF Belgium has planned for the withdrawal of Pakadjuma CTU which is scheduled for [28 Feb 2018], following a significant decrease in the number of cases. A transferral mechanism will be put in place for the transfer of any case to the Liziba CTU.

- The national laboratory INRB is providing laboratory confirmation services by testing stool culture.

- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to improve surveillance and case reporting at the community level and has procured and shipped diarrheal and emergency kits. The National Red Cross Society is supporting hygiene promotion activities.

- In 2016, the Ministry of Health supported by WHO and partners conducted an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign in Kinshasa, targeting around 375 000 individuals across 5 health zones (Limete, Maluku I, Masina II, Nsele and Kingabwa). The campaign was successful with an administrative coverage of 94.6 percent for the 1st round and 94.0 percent for the 2nd round.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of _Vibrio cholerae_ bacteria present in faecally contaminated water or food. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.

Kinshasa is the 3rd largest city in Africa with a population of approximately 10 million inhabitants. The city is characterized by a rapidly growing population driven by rural migration, leading to overcrowding and frequent occupation of flood plains that are not suitable for settlement, poor infrastructure, lack of adequate drainage and limited access to water and sanitation. These factors make Kinshasa particularly vulnerable to flooding and waterborne diseases, especially during the rainy season, which runs from November to June.

Although the weekly incidence of cases in Kinshasa has been on a downward trend since mid-January 2018, the situation remains alarming. New cases have been reported in areas located along the Congo River which is a major trading and transport axis to and from Kinshasa. During the week beginning [13 Feb 2018], the health zone of Maluku I in Kinshasa province reported cases for the 1st time since the beginning of this outbreak. Maluku I is a major port city and an endemic area for cholera in Kinshasa. However since a vaccination campaign was conducted in this area in October 2016, no cases had been reported until now. The emergence of cases in areas along the Congo River and the arrival of the 2nd rainy season which will last from March to June pose a risk for the resurgence of cases in Kinshasa.

This outbreak has started in 2015 and is considered as the worst cholera epidemic experienced by the country since 1994. In 2017, a total of 55 000 cases and 1190 deaths have been reported nationally. This is almost double the number of cases reported in 2016. Overall 24 out of 26 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have reported cases. The country is going through a long lasting economic and political crisis.

Furthermore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also responding to a large humanitarian emergency (IASC level 3) with more than 4 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 600 000 refugees. The country's resources and capacity to effectively respond to the current outbreak are limited.

The risk of this outbreak spreading to neighbouring countries is considered high due to regular population movement and the risk at the global level was assessed to be low.

WHO advice
----------
WHO recommends the improvement of access to safe water and sanitation and hygienic practices to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcement of surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to appropriate case management should be improved in the areas affected by the outbreak to decrease mortality. Ensuring national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to the cholera outbreak will be needed to decrease the risk of spread to new areas. The use of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread should also be considered.

WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the information available on the current outbreak. The use of microbiologically safe drinking water and implementation of general hygiene practices and other preventive measures listed above should be sufficient to prevent the disease.

[Kinshasa, formerly Léopoldville, is the capital and the largest city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is beside the Congo River. Once a site of fishing and trading villages, Kinshasa is now a megacity with an estimated population of more than 11 million. It faces Brazzaville, the capital of the neighboring Republic of the Congo, which can be seen in the distance across the wide Congo River, making them the 2 closest capital cities on Earth after Rome and the Vatican City. The city of Kinshasa is also one of the DRC's 26 provinces.

The uMkhanyakude District Environmental Health Department has embarked on an awareness campaign following a confirmed case of cholera in the district. The patient, a woman from the Makanisi area, became infected after drinking contaminated water she collected from the Pongola River. She was successfully treated at Manguzi Hospital.

According to national guidelines, a single case of cholera is regarded as an outbreak, so the district is taking all precautions necessary.

[6] Cholera - Angola (Cabinda province)
Date: Wed 7 Mar 2018
Source: Noticias AO Minuto [in Portuguese, machine trans., edited]
https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/968897/confirmados-casos-de-colera-no-enclave-angolano-de-cabinda


According to Health provincial secretary in Cabinda, Maria Carlota Tati, samples of 3 suspected cases [of cholera] were sent to laboratories in Luanda, capital of Angola, and the tests confirmed the presence of _Vibrio cholera_. The official, quoted today by the Angolan news agency, Angop, said that there are 13 cases reported, of which a death occurred in a private health unit.

Maria Carlota Tati considers the situation controlled, noting that the cases are confined to 3 districts of the city of Cabinda. The 1st suspected case was registered on [20 Feb 2018], at the Provincial Hospital of Cabinda. As immediate measures, she added that surveillance teams are disinfecting cacimbas and distributing free tablets for the treatment of drinking water, as well as educating and sensitizing residents about cholera prevention measures.

Cabinda thus becomes the 2nd province to face cases of cholera in Angola, after the Uíge, affected since 2017 by the disease, with more than a dozen dead in more than 600 cases, since December 2017.
