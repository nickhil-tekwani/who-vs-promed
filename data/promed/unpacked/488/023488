WHO: Keep current strains in 2012 Southern Hemisphere flu vaccine
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A run of stability in the makeup of seasonal influenza vaccines
continued as the World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended
using the same 3 flu strains in next year's [2012] Southern Hemisphere
vaccine as are in the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine and were
used last year in southern countries. The recommendation means the WHO
has seen little evidence of changes in circulating flu strains that
would make the vaccines now in use a poor match for them. [See: World
Health Organisation September 2011 -- Recommended composition of
influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2012 southern hemisphere
influenza season
http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2011_09_recommendation.pdf.

The WHO experts recommended keeping the pandemic 2009 strain for the
influenza A/H1N1 component of the vaccine, along with a Perth 2009
strain of A/H3N2 and a Brisbane 2008 strain of influenza B.
Officially, the agency advises using strains similar to:

- A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09
- A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)
- B/Brisbane/60/2008.

The new recommendation means the WHO has chosen the same t3 strains
for the Southern Hemisphere 3 years in a row, as the agency 1st picked
them in September 2009 for the 2010 season. That was when the WHO
first chose the pandemic 2009 H1N1 strain for the vaccine on the
expectation -- which proved correct -- that it would replace the
previous seasonal H1N1 strain.

The WHO's experts make their recommendations for the makeup of
Southern Hemisphere flu vaccines in September [2011] to allow time to
prepare the vaccine viruses and grow them in eggs, which takes several
months.

The WHO's technical report says 2009 H1N1 viruses co-circulated in
varying proportions with H3N2 and type B viruses from February to
September of this year, with widespread activity in many countries.
But compared with previous years, activity was generally "low or
moderate." No isolates of the previous seasonal H1N1 vaccine were
found.

The circulating 2009 H1N1 viruses have remained antigenically and
genetically similar to the California strain in the current vaccine,
the report says. Likewise, the majority of recent H3N2 isolates have
been similar to the Perth strain in the vaccine.

Influenza B comes in 2 lineages, Victoria and Yamagata, and predicting
which will predominate in any given season has been difficult. The
Brisbane 2008 strain in current vaccines is a Victoria strain. The WHO
says Victoria strains have predominated recently in many parts of the
world and have been closely related to the vaccine strain, but
Yamagata variants were more common in northern China from February to
May [2011].

In a note on drug resistance, the WHO says the vast majority of 2009
H1N1 viruses have remained sensitive to oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Of the
resistant isolates, most were associated with use of the drug for
prevention or treatment. But in the United States, the United Kingdom,
and Japan, "there were increased proportions of resistant cases with
no known exposure to oseltamivir."

The report also notes that 45 human infections with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus were reported from 16 Feb to 19 Sep [2011], including
24 deaths. The cases occurred in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, and
Indonesia, where the virus circulates in poultry. The cumulative
global H5N1 count is 564 cases with 330 deaths.

The same period also brought one human case of H9N2 flu in Bangladesh
and 4 human infections with swine H3N2 viruses in the United States,
the WHO said.

[The essential message is that: "The new recommendation means the WHO
has chosen the same 3 strains for the Southern Hemisphere vaccine 3
years in a row, as the agency 1st picked them in September 2009 for
the 2010 season. That was when the WHO 1st chose the pandemic 2009
H1N1 strain for the vaccine on the expectation -- which proved correct
-- that it would replace the previous seasonal H1N1 strain." We must
hope that this stability will not be undermined by future events. -
