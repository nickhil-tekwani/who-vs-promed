Measles outbreak in a Krasnoyarsk hospital
------------------------------------------
A total of 3 cases of measles have been registered among medical and
technical staff at the Krasnoyarsk City Hospital. The diagnosis is
preliminary, but all patients have been hospitalized for preventive
purposes. The 1st case was the electrician of the hospital who works
all around the hospital and thus there is no possibility for contact
tracing. Measles cases have been recorded also in Emergency Room
staff and patients. All possible contacts are under daily observation
including thermometry and screening of skin covers.

An immunization program has been launched for non-immune patients and
staff. There were 6 measles patients in this hospital [in April 2009
- Mod.NP] all of whom were discharged prior to the current outbreak.

[Earlier in May 2009 it was reported that it had been planned to
declare Krasnoyarsk a city free from measles; see, Measles, adult
cases - Russia: (KX) 20090520.1891. The present hospital outbreak
suggests that measles infection is still prevalent in the city and
that the uptake of vaccine has not been sufficient to eliminate the
disease from the city.

The city of Krasnoyarsk is located on the Yenisey River, in the
center of Russia. It is a major stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway. A
