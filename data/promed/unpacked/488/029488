Increase in cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Turkey, 2006
-----------------------------------------------------
Between 1 Jan and 30 Jun 2006, 323 people in Turkey underwent investigation
for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus infection [1]. Among these,
150 cases were laboratory-confirmed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. These laboratory-
confirmed cases, including 11 fatal cases, were reported from 22 Turkish
provinces. The 6 provinces in Kelkit Valley, northeastern Turkey are the most
affected (Tokat, Sivas, Gumushane, Amasya, Yozgat & Corum provinces (figure 1
at URL above). Most of the people investigated reported having been bitten by
ticks.
No cases have been reported from popular tourist resorts on the Mediterranean
coast. In the past 3 years, the annual number of cases (deaths) was 150 (6) in
2003; 249 (13) in 2004, and 266 (13) in 2005. Compared with previous years,
the 150 confirmed cases in 2006 so far suggest increased activity of the virus
in the area, although detection, diagnosis and notification may have improved.
Control measures implemented in Turkey
---------------------------------
Turkey�s Ministry of Health has implemented control measures, in collaboration
with the Ministries of the Environment and of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,
and enhanced CCHF surveillance has been established nationwide. Case
management guidelines, including a treatment protocol with ribavirin, have
been distributed to health care facilities throughout Turkey; 4 reference
hospitals with isolation facilities have also been identified in Ankara,
Erzurum, Sivas and Samsun. People in the occupational categories most at risk
have been alerted and informed about personal protective measures. Public
awareness campaigns are ongoing, stressing personal protective measures to
avoid tick bites, and targeting the rural population through television,
radio, posters and leaflets, and the Turkish Ministry of Health has made
information available on its website [3].
The World Health Organization Country Office in Turkey and the WHO Regional
Office for Europe are sharing information with the Turkish Ministry of Health
to closely monitor the evolution of the disease activity
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
-----------------------------
CCHF viral infections are endemic in many countries in Africa, Eastern Europe
and Asia, and occur also in the Middle East. Previous outbreaks in Europe have
been reported in Turkey in 2001-2003 (83 cases), in Kosovo and in Albania in
2001 (18 and 8 cases respectively). CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a
high mortality rate of around 30 per cent, with death occurring in the 2nd
week of illness [4]. Following infection via tick bite, the incubation period
is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. Haemorrhage is typical of
established viral haemorrhagic fevers, and represents a hazard to healthcare
workers if universal precautions are not strictly followed. Early treatment
with oral or intravenous ribavirin may shorten and ameliorate the illness, so
suspicion of the diagnosis can benefit both patient and carers.
The CCHF virus belongs to (and is the most important human pathogen of) the
Nairovirus group of viruses which are transmitted mainly by ticks of the
_Hyalomma_ genus. The animal reservoirs for the CCHF virus include hares,
birds, ticks, cattle, sheep and goats. Humans who become infected with CCHF
acquire the virus from direct contact with blood or other infected tissues
from livestock (or possibly another human), or they may become infected from a
tick bite. The majority of cases have occurred in those involved with the
livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and
veterinarians.
Advice to travellers to northeastern Turkey
-----------------------------------
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control advises travellers to
the affected area to take general preventive measures to minimise the exposure
to tick bites [2]:
- Minimise exposure, wearing light-coloured clothing (this makes it easier to
see ticks) covering arms and legs; tuck trousers into socks and keep sleeves
rolled down.
- Use insect repellent on the exposed skin (eg, DEET 30 percent) and on
clothes (eg, permethrin); before using repellents, pregnant women and children
under the age of 12 years should consult a physician or pharmacist.
- Inspect the body after possible exposure, and remove ticks immediately by
steady, gentle traction, using forceps or tweezers. When removing the tick,
protect hands with gloves or tissue. Grasp the tick as close to the skin as
possible, and rotate the tick 1-2 times, pulling back gently but firmly. Avoid
leaving mouth parts in the skin. Wash the affected area with water and soap,
and disinfect with iodine. Observe the area for a few days, and consult a
doctor if a pustule, rash or other signs develop at the site of the bite.
People who have travelled to any endemic area and develop symptoms after a
tick bite should contact their physician.
