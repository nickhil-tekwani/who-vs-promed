1st bluetongue outbreak in 2011-2012 season reported in Caceres
province
---------------------------------------------------------------
The National Reference Laboratory in Algete has confirmed renewed
circulation of bluetongue virus [BTV] serotype 1 in an unvaccinated
sentinel cattle holding in Plasencia (Caceres), which is part of the
National BT Disease Surveillance Program.

The Official Veterinary Services of the Junta de Extremadura have
reported detection of 10 animals positive for BTV-1 (see map at
http://rasve.mapa.es/Recursos/Ficheros/Noticias/LENGUA%20AZUL%2013%2010%202011.pdf).

The confirmation of this case of bluetongue means a reappearance of
the disease in Spain since the end of the last disease (vector
activity) season.

During 2010, a total of 91 outbreaks were reported, of which 80 were
of BTV-1, 10 of BTV-4, and one focus of BTV-8.

The reappearance of the disease has led to the strengthening of BT
control measures. These measures involve, in the affected area,
increased surveillance and biosecurity measures, vector control, and
the recommendation for vaccination of susceptible species.

Official notification of the new outbreak has been sent to the
European Commission, OIE, and other autonomous communities and sectors
involved.

[BTV-1 was detected in the same location/region during the same season
last year (2010); see slide 3 in Spain's presentation to EU's SCOFCAH
(Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, UK), "Updates
2009-2010 and Disease Future: Perspective in Spain", available at
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1112102010_bt_spain.pdf.
This may be indicative of the endemic status (or overwintering) of
this virus in Spain, though reintroduction from Northern Africa is not
excluded. BTV-1 and BTV-4 are currently circulating in Morocco (see
commentary in ProMED-mail 20111008.3023). - Mod.AS
