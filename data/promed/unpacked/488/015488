Light leaf spot [LLS] has been identified in oilseed rape crops across the UK, indicating that growers should remain vigilant for disease onset this [2020/21] winter. Since Bayer's SpotCheck service re-opened, there has been an increasing number of leaf samples testing positive for LLS.

By [9 Nov 2020], 50 out of 102 samples revealed 10% incidence of LLS or more. Of these, 19 samples showed 50% disease incidence or more. Positive samples were received from Scotland and the north of England, to the East of England including Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, and Kent, and further West from Somerset and Wiltshire.

Ella Crawford, Bayer, said these early results confirmed that LLS was no longer just a problem for growers in the north. "These infections in early November in East Anglia, the South Coast, and the West [are] further evidence of the southerly march of this disease." LLS is difficult to identify in the field. The only visible signs are small white dots across the leaf [which] may appear sporadically, so are easily missed and a hand lens is essential.

[Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species is caused by the fungus _Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. It is considered one of the main diseases of oilseed rape in northern Europe and is also a major disease affecting vegetable brassicas in cool, humid climates. In oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_), leaves become infected soon after sowing but remain symptomless until lesions appear on older leaves. In severe cases, developing leaves and buds can be affected causing leaf distortion and stunting of plants. Stems may split and break off. Developing pods are often infected, leading to premature ripening of seed and pod shatter. Different vegetable brassicas vary in susceptibility to the fungus, but generally, show spots and discolourations on leaves and stems which reduce quality and may also affect yield.

LLS is polycyclic and survives the summer on crop debris, volunteer oilseed rape, and vegetable brassicas. Spores are spread by wind, rain splash, and with infected plant material. Disease management may include varieties with decreased levels of susceptibility, removal of infected stubble, disease monitoring, and timely fungicide applications.

In the UK, LLS has caused considerable yield losses of oilseed rape in the past. Reduced sensitivity of the fungus to some of the fungicides used for LLS control has been observed. Research on host resistance genes and development of LLS resistant crop varieties is being carried out. Earlier in 2020, very high LLS levels were reported in oilseed rape in northern areas of the country (ProMED-mail post 20200317.7099953). LLS has become another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (for some recent examples, see ProMED-mail posts 20200811.7665227, 20200909.7763574, 20141024.2895414).
