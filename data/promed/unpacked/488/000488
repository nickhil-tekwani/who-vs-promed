[The incidence of Lassa fever cases appears to be slowing and perhaps ending for this transmission season, although the Lassa fever virus transmission season usually lasts into June, so a few more cases might occur. The graphs of the epidemic curves, continue to indicate that the peak number of cases nationally has passed. No new cases have occurred over the past week. The follow-up of thousands of contacts with so few uncontacted is remarkable. As noted in previous comments, providing adequate surveillance and timely treatment over such a large geographic area is challenging. Fortunately, there is international help participating in treatment and surveillance. No additional health care people have been confirmed as infected during this week, but a suspected case in a laboratory worker is reported below.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the source URL above.

[2] Niger state suspected
Date: Fri 28 May 2018

A woman on Monday [21 May 2018] died from a suspected case of Lassa fever in Niger state. According to a family source, the woman, who died at about 6 a.m on Monday morning was rushed to a private hospital in Minna when she started vomiting and stooling blood and emitting blood from her nostrils.

A source told The Nation that the hospital, after testing her, referred her to the Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida Specialist Hospital, but the parents refused taking her to the hospital and took her home, where she died.

"What made us suspicious," the source said, "was when some officials from the Ministry of Health came to the house, the hospital must have told them. When they came, R was already dead, so they had for the people who were going to bury her some protective surgical suits to put on, and they sprayed the body, the car that carried her to the hospital, and all 4 in the house. This was after testing her."

The source said that for about a week, the deceased, who had 6 children, had been complaining of sore throat and body pains, "but she got worse yesterday. She was taken to the General Hospital Minna, but there was no doctor on the grounds to attend to her; that was why she was taken to the private hospital. However, after admitting her, one of the doctors tested her and said she had been referred to IBB Hospital."

When The Nation visited the private hospital, one of the doctors who spoke anonymously confirmed that a woman was brought to the hospital with suspected Lassa fever symptoms, and, because they could not handle her, the hospital referred her to the IBB Specialist Hospital.

He also confirmed that the management called the state Ministry of Health to inform them of their suspicions. "The lady did not die in our hospital. When we noticed we could not handle her case, we referred her to IBB Specialist Hospital. So, whether they went or not, we do not know. I am just hearing that she died from you."

However, efforts to reach the Niger State Ministry of Health failed. Although our reporter met with the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Makunsidi, he denied knowledge of any case as such, saying he had not been informed. He, however, promised to make enquiries and get back to the reporter. At the time of filing this report, he had not called, and his number was not going through.

[Interestingly, Niger state is not mentioned above in the list of affected states this year [2018].

Obviously, the transmission of Lassa fever virus has not ended for the year in Nigeria. Although test results for this case are not available, the symptoms she displayed are certainly compatible with those of Lassa fever. The hospitals that she was taken to apparently were not equipped to handle Lassa fever cases and were wise to not admit her. One hopes that her family members are being well monitored and perhaps treated prophylactically with ribavirin. - Mod.TY
