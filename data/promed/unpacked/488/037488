Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Death Reported in Southwestern Uganda
--------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: On Mon 27 Nov 2000, Ugandan officials recorded another death from
Ebola virus infection in the southwest of the country. Meanwhile, 14
others died from the highly contagious virus in the north. The Ebola
outbreak - Uganda's first - originated in the town of Gulu, 225 miles north
of Kampala, with the first of hundreds of victims showing symptoms in
September. A total of 17 new cases was reported on Monday, said Francis
Omaswa, Director General Of Health Services. In all, 145 people have now
died of the disease. Authorities had hoped to keep the disease from
spreading beyond Gulu. However, since 12 Nov 2000, 4 people have died in
the town of Masindi, southwest of Gulu, including one death on Saturday,
said Dr. Imaan Mutyaba, a medical supervisor. 4 others have died of Ebola
in the town of Mbarara.
The fever caused by the Ebola virus is transmitted through body
fluids. The disease can cause severe hemorrhagic fever and is often
fatal. While there is no cure, patients aggressively treated for
dehydration have a good chance of survival.

Unique Preventive Approach Keeps Ebola fever in Check
-----------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Crispus Kiyonga, the Minister of Health of Uganda, is a
mild-mannered Minister who speaks little, but his influence precedes
him. In 1998, the London-based World Link magazine included him in its
list of the world's 15 most influential politicians because of his
[organisational skill. When Ebola fever struck, it found [Ugandans
prepared, though not for this particular fever. "We had set up a committee
to prepare ourselves for Marburg fever, which we thought would strike any
time along our border districts with the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"
said Prof. Francis Omaswa, the Director of Medical Services. In the first
2 weeks of October, after Ebola fever was identified, 71 people had died
and 205 were confined to their beds. However, the [spread of the fever
was brought to a full stop in the third week of October. This was
unprecedented in the history of Ebola fever. The [overall mortality rate
was only 30 percent, whereas in areas where Ebola fever first struck,
mortality
rates ranged between 80 - 90 percent.
Much of the success [in controlling spread of the disease can be attributed
to the new health strategy manual, which favours simple concepts in lieu
of grandiose projects. The local council system, which is a 5-tier system
of local government from village (LCI) to district level, [played an
important role. In the Ebola fever situation, leaders were asked to
register all visitors or people in the area with any fever, and any
suspicious fever would be brought to the attention of medical
personnel. This was the case up to the district level. This structure
helped to identify victims [and was based on experience gained earlier in
the polio eradication campaign.
Kiyonga has broken bureaucratic barriers that restricted government grants
to government hospitals only. Thus when Ebola fever struck in Gulu, the
Catholic-run Lacor Hospital was assisted by the government. In this way
Kiyonga is overcoming rivalry that existed before and was fueled by
government [resentment of the influence such institutions could wield.
Collaboration has also been [encouraged with the traditional health
system, which is visited by 6 out of 10 Ugandans. Traditional healers,
estimated to number 110 000, have [made their mark especially in fighting
the AIDS scourge. Consequently, the government has allowed some of them
[to participate in joint operations with medical personnel at Mulago
Hospital, the largest referral hospital in the country. Their recognition
will be strengthened with the passing of a bill [legalising this cooperation.
Ebola fever [information was disseminated by virtually all FM radio
stations, with a total outreach estimated at 7 million. People learned how
to take care of themselves, and [could obtain all the information they
needed in the interactive programmes.
In the government-run survey, Burden of Disease Study, it was established
that 75% of life years lost to premature death were due to preventable
diseases. Of these, prenatal and maternity-related conditions, malaria,
acute lower respiratory infections, AIDS and diarrhea account for over
60%. Consequently, Ugandan health policies will no longer favour the
elite. Ailments like hypertension, cancer, diabetes, mental illness,
chronic digestive disease, and degenerative cardiovascular diseases will
take [second place. Mulago Hospital, along with 92 [other national
hospitals, will be transformed into parastatals (i.e. quasi-government
organizations).
In May 2000 western donors issued a 4-page statement warning the Ugandan
government that it risked losing millions of dollars of aid unless it
adopted a programme that favoured the poor. It was discovered that
immunization rates had fallen to a national average of 35% and that more
[most? deaths in Ugandan hospitals were the result of carelessness. [In
response the Ministry of Health has drafted a 5-year health plan that will
cost US $954 million. Among other things, it is designed to reduce the
infant mortality rate from 97 to 68 per 1000 live births; lower maternal
mortality rate from 506 to 354 per 100 000; and raise contraceptive uptake
from 15 percent to 30 percent.
