I disagree. We have experienced several enteroviral epidemics, and we always
saw several examples of transmission within families in epidemic years. This
should surely be expected with any pathogen with a fecal-oral transmission
pattern. (This comment assumes that the epidemic is due to enterovirus --
and in fact makes it more likely -- although it is noted that the etiology
has not yet been established).
