2004/081 EPPO report on notifications of non-compliance (detection of
regulated pests)
-----------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance, for
2004, received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2004/055) from the
following countries: Algeria, Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
France, Greece, Guernsey, Ireland, Italy, Jersey, Netherlands, Poland,
Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.
When a consignment has been re-exported, and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance
made because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications
of non-compliance due to prohibited commodities and/or missing, or
invalid, certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that
the report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent
their notifications.

[Most of the reports are concerned with bacterial pathogens (9
reports), followed by viruses (5). Note that PepMV was reported on
tomato seeds from Chile which was unknown to seed producers at the
time. According to the International Seed Health Initiative for
Vegetable Crop's Manual of Seed Health Testing Methods Detection,
testing for PepMV on seeds is a 2-stage process: an ELISA, and, a
bioassay, in that order. During drying, storage, and, with
disinfection treatments, the majority of seed-borne PepMV virions
degrade and lose infectivity. Both infectious and non-infectious
virus particles are detected in ELISA. Hence, a negative (but not a
positive) ELISA result is conclusive on the seed health status of the
seed lot. In the bioassay, only infectious PepMV is detected. Hence,
both a negative and a positive bioassay result are conclusive on the
seed health status of the lot.
