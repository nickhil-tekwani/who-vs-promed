Five people were admitted to hospital and an 18-month-old boy was among
those who suffered crippling stomach pains and vomiting. One victim says he
lost 2 stone [14 lbs after being unable to eat for a fortnight. All had
bought fruit salad in August [1998 at the Haywards Heath branch of a
supermarket in West Sussex, according to a newly published Government
report into the outbreak of the highly dangerous _Shigella_ bacteria.
_Shigella_ [affects the lining of the gut causing pain and bloody
diarrhoea. It can be spread in water contaminated by sewage, but most
often the source is by the unwashed hands of a food handler with the
illness who has continued working. Outbreaks spread quickly and small
amounts of the bacteria are enough to cause acute illness. It can kill if
left untreated, especially if the victim is old or already has health
problems.
The report into the West Sussex outbreak was drawn up by a group including
doctors from the Government-run Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre
and the Department of Public Health.
In addition to 46 confirmed cases of Sainsbury's customers falling prey to
the bacteria, the report estimates the total number of victims to be 'at
least 130'.
After initial inquiries indicated that the fruit bar could be the source, a
scientific survey was undertaken. The report concludes: 'Exposure to fruit
or fruit salad at the pick and mix counter accounted for 100 per cent of
the cases.'
'Staff on site were handling raw fruit in its preparation and the most
likely source was from one of them,' said the report's author, Dr Harvey
Gordon. 'Some of the infected fruit was in pre-packaged boxes so the
bacteria would not have been brought in by a customer. 'The point is, this
is not something which can be transmitted through the air so it has to have
been conveyed to the fruit through infected matter.'
A spokeswoman for the company confessed last night: 'We have to admit that
this investigation has produced evidence which shows the _Shigella_ came
from our store.' But she added that the store saw no reason to change its
food preparation methods and had not implemented any changes in procedure
since the outbreak. 'We take these things very seriously. We closed down
the salad bar for a period but it has now reopened. We reviewed the
procedures we had in place but there was nothing that seemed to be a
problem. We are in the process of discussing the individual cases with the
people affected.'
The report comes after the raising of doubts about the origins of some of
[the storeÂ´s imported produce. Last month a tropical toad was discovered
in a bag of African-imported salad bought at a branch of the store on
Tyneside.
