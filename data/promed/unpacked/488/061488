The Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office and the Equine Disease Communication Center have reported that equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) has been confirmed at a Northern Kentucky facility.

A 2-year-old filly residing at an Oldham County facility was brought to an equine hospital in Lexington on 4 Jan 2017 for evaluation of a neurologic condition.

"The examining veterinarian noticed evidence of urine dripping, suspected an infectious disease, and reported the concern to the Kentucky Department of Agriculture (KDA)," the EDCC said. "The filly was isolated, and samples were collected, which were confirmed positive for the neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1 that same evening." The KDA placed the filly's home facility under quarantine.

Subsequently, on 5 Jan 2017, investigators collected nasal and blood samples from 14 horses in the "affected wing," as well as from 3 horses in a 2nd wing that were being prepared to be shipped interstate, the EDCC said. Equine Diagnostic Solutions, in Lexington, received those samples on the evening of 5 Jan 2017.

On the morning of [6 Jan 2017], the KDA received notice that a horse in the 2nd wing had spiked a fever of more than 103 F [39 C]. Nasal swabs and whole blood samples were collected and transported to the laboratory. That evening, the laboratory reported that 2 of the 14 horses sampled from the "affected wing," as well as the febrile horse from the 2nd wing, were positive for neuropathogenic EHV-1.

"The remaining horses on the premises were sampled, with results expected sometime on Monday [9 Jan 2017]," the EDCC said.

The KDA has traced and located all equids that have left the index facility since mid-December 2016, and those horses are being assessed and tested following the agency's defined protocol. Two horses that left the facility in late December 2016 and traveled to a track outside of Kentucky are isolated, and samples have been collected and submitted for EHV-1 testing. There has been no movement to any Kentucky racing or training facility.

The State Veterinarian's office said there is no evidence connecting this event to the recent EHV activity associated with Fair Grounds Race Course in Louisiana.

As of 7 Jan 2017, the index case was reported as improved and was being prepared to be discharged from the hospital. When released, the horse will be moved to a private facility and remain in isolation. The positive horses on the index facility have been moved to a designated isolation area.

The EDCC said the horses on the index facility continue to be monitored closely and have their temperatures taken multiple times throughout the day. There have been no fevers or other abnormalities reported as of 7 Jan 2017.

The EDCC said the facility's management "is cooperating fully and is committed to containing and effectively managing the disease."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

"Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus."

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
