Vietnam looks into unidentified disease in Central Highlands
-------------------------
Vietnam is probing into an unidentified disease reported to have killed 2
people and affected 120 others in a commune in the Central Highlands
province of Gia Lai this week.
"Our health officials and workers have set off to the commune of Lo Bang
this morning to look into the unidentified disease there. This disease
makes victims' legs and arms numb," a staff of the Gia Lai Health
Department said Friday.
The staff, who identified herself as Ha, did not elaborate on the disease
and infections, saying: "we have to wait for the outcome of the visit."
According to newswire VietnamNet Friday, the unidentified disease recently
hit some 120 residents of the commune in Mang Yang district, of whom 2 had
died 25 and 26 March 2005.
According to VietnamNet, 19 locals had been hospitalized until 30 Mar 2005
and then discharged.
However, local newspaper Tien Phong (Pioneer) reported 23 residents in
hospital on 31 Mar 2005 alone.
The patients have had symptoms similar to poisoning such as benumbed
feelings in their legs and arms, stomach aches, and the urge to vomit, with
the symptoms lasting for long periods, said the newspaper.
Local health staff has not found any suspected source of poison so far.
Samples of food and water are currently being tested.

[The above newswires mention non-specific symptomatology -- abdominal pain,
nausea, and paresthesias that can be seen with a variety of infectious and
non-infectious agents. The newswires suggest that a toxic exposure is
being considered as the etiology for this outbreak. ProMED-mail would
appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]
[The signs mentioned in the article are reminiscent of an outbreak in the
US in the 1930's, during the time of alcohol prohibition. Adding Jamaican
Ginger to drinks was a covert way of drinking alcohol. However, Jamaican
Ginger was contaminated with tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP).
TOCP is an industrial chemical sold as a plasticizer and used in the
manufacture of products such as lacquer, leather, and even airplane finishes.
It has been reported to cause staggering gaits and a feeling of numbness or
weakness in the legs. In animals TOCP will bind to cells in the spinal
cord, producing serious toxicity and even neuronal death. This would
explain the awkward gait seen in people.
Although this article does not indicate TOCP, it is a differential that
without more information I could not rule out. - Mod.TG]
