In the 1st week of June 2014, the patient (female, 35 years) was bitten in her left hand by a stray dog in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The next day, she sought medical attention and received anti-rabies vaccinations, apparently 4 vaccinations in a time span of 2 weeks (proof of vaccination status is lacking). She did not receive human anti rabies immunoglobulins.

On 17 Aug 2014 (approximately 8 weeks after the bite), she developed pain in her left hand that progressed to her left arm and neck. On 21 Aug 2014, she developed hydrophobia, aerophobia and anxious behaviour. In the night from 21 to 22 Aug 2014, she was admitted to hospital (Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis [OLVG], Amsterdam, The Netherlands). On suspicion of clinical rabies, she was transferred to the Academic Medical Center [AMC], Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on 22 Aug 2014. Presence of rabies virus (genotype 1) was confirmed in skin biopsies of the neck, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva at the Erasmus Medical Center [EMC] in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. She is currently being treated at the intensive care unit of the AMC in Amsterdam.

Dr. Goorhuis mentioned further that the patient received undocumented vaccinations in India. If she did receive proper vaccinations, there might be a chance that she will survive. - Mod.MHJ
