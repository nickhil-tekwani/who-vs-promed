[1] Images of global vaccine inequities
Date: Sat 28 Aug 2021
Source: Nature Portfolio Microbiology Community [edited]
https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/posts/10-images-that-illustrate-the-shameful-global-vaccine-inequity


Just over 5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally. But only 1.6% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose. This shameful inequity is getting worse by the day. Rich nations are offering 3rd (booster) doses to their citizens, even as 3.5 billion people are waiting for their 1st dose (my Sirius XM podcast dives deeper).

The series of images below tell the story behind the great vaccine apartheid, the single biggest moral and scientific failure during this global crisis.

Exhibit 1: What share of the population has received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine?
This graph from Our World in Data shows vaccination coverage of 60-70% in many rich nations, while several countries in the African continent have less than 2% coverage, even with a single dose.

Exhibit 2: The widening gap between high-income and low-income countries
This graph from Our World in Data shows a rapidly increasing coverage in high-income countries (HIC), while the trend is virtually flat for low-income countries (LIC).

Exhibit 3. Slow pace of progress in LMICs [lower-middle-income countries]
This graph from [https://pandem-ic.com] shows that UMICs [upper-middle-income countries] are catching up quickly to HICs, but LMICs ,and especially LICs, have not improved much.

Exhibit 4: Countries that need vaccines are not getting them
This graph, from a Nature paper by Amy Maxmen, shows the unequal distribution of vaccination as a scatter plot. While many rich nations are offering booster doses, "on the African continent, where only 2% of people have been vaccinated, COVID-19 rates are escalating, with fatality rates higher than the global average."

Exhibit 5: Confirmed doses procured
This chart by the Launch & Scale Speedometer (Duke University) shows which countries have procured vaccine doses (confirmed doses). Again, HICs have the largest number of confirmed doses.

Exhibit 6: Secured vaccines and/or expected vaccine supply (% of population)
The IMF-WHO COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Tracker provides data on secured vaccines and/or expected vaccine supply (% of population). Countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, and USA are among the countries that have secured vaccines to cover 200-400% of the population.

Exhibit 7: Delays in vaccine access will cost lives and money
This analysis by the EIU shows that while rich countries have vaccinated their populations ahead of others, many LICs, especially in Africa, will only achieve widespread coverage by 2023. A model built by the EIU shows that those countries that will not have vaccinated 60% of their population by mid-2022 will register GDP losses totaling USD $2.3 trillion in 2022-2025.

Exhibit 8: Who has surplus vaccines?
This analysis, published in the BMJ, shows the number of surplus doses that could accumulate by the end of 2022 in the 10 locations with the greatest potential waste. Billions of doses of vaccines purchased by rich nations are due to expire.

Exhibit 9: Is COVAX receiving the donations pledged?
In June [2021], the G7 pledged substantial vaccine donations to COVAX, the program that was designed to support LMICs in procuring vaccines. However, only 10% of the G7 pledges have been delivered so far, per information shared by chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.

Exhibit 10: Why is vaccine equity so critical?
In my previous post, I had offered 10 powerful reasons why all of us must demand vaccine equity. One reason I had cited was uncontrolled outbreaks anywhere will generate more variants and mutant strains. Emerging research shows that mass vaccination is a powerful way of preventing new variants. In this study (pre-print) [see citation below], vaccination coverage rate was inversely correlated to the mutation frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variants in 16 of 20 countries studied.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-28/antibodies-waning-the-immune-system-has-a-backup-plan-for-that


Antibodies against the coronavirus wane over time, but the immune system has a backup plan that doesn't rely on boosters, according to a study by scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, where technology for mRNA vaccines was developed [see citation below].

Researchers at the University's Perelman School of Medicine tracked 61 people for 6 months after immunization with mRNA vaccines. The team noted that antibodies gradually ebbed, but that the shots generated durable immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in the form of B and T cells that increased over time to help ward off serious illness.

"That was maybe a little bit surprising," said John Wherry, director of the institute for immunology, who works in the same faculty as mRNA pioneer Drew Weissman.

The research was released 23 Aug [2021] ahead of peer review and publication. Concern that COVID vaccines are providing a weaker shield against the more-transmissible delta strain in countries that began immunizations early has prompted health authorities to consider offering 3rd doses to boost antibody levels. US President Joe Biden said Friday [27 Aug 2021] his administration is considering whether to start offering extra jabs as soon as 5 months after receiving a 2nd dose.

Although 3rd doses promise to bolster antibodies and make them better at blocking SARS-CoV-2 for longer, the body has its own natural support to defend against COVID-19 even when circulating antibody levels decline, Wherry said. "Should antibodies wane and you get a little bit of local infection, you have memory B cells there to sort of renew or respond very rapidly to make new neutralizing antibodies," he said.

Antibodies on mucosal surfaces lining the nose and throat block the coronavirus at its portal of entry, preventing it from causing an infection. But as protective antibodies there fade, an infection is more likely to take hold, at least until new antibodies are triggered in response.

Wherry's group found that memory B cells generated by the mRNA vaccines made by Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE appeared better at blocking virus variants including alpha, beta, and delta than those produced in response to a mild case of COVID-19.

Additionally, high levels of vaccine-induced T cells, a type of white blood cell capable of finding and killing virus-infected cells, were detected after 6 months, "maintaining an additional armor to protect us," Wherry said.

The findings help to explain why immunization remains effective at protecting against severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death even as more break-through infections occur.

"We're seeing a drop in efficacy when you only measure whether people get infected, but really, really steady immunity if you're measuring severe-disease outcomes," Wherry said. "That fits with the idea that circulating antibodies are going to protect you from infection, but memory B cells and memory T cells, while they may not eliminate the ability to have some virus in your nose, they're actually going to prevent severe disease."

The immune backups will also decrease the duration of COVID symptoms, prevent them from worsening, and reduce the likelihood of transmitting a SARS-CoV-2 infection to other people, he said.

"Vaccinated people are really not fueling this fire; it's really unvaccinated people that are," Wherry said. "So that's more reason to get vaccinated."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract [excerpt]
-------------------
"These findings demonstrate robust, multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally, we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory. Together, this study provides insights into the generation and evolution of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and has implications for future booster strategies."

[3] Australia (Sydney)

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-28/sydney-has-worst-day-with-delta-unabated-despite-vaccinations


The outbreak of the delta variant continued unabated in Sydney, with Australia's largest city accounting for the bulk of new daily COVID-19 infections as New South Wales state had its worst day.

The state saw a record 1035 daily infections in the 24 hours to 8 p.m. local time on Friday [27 Aug 2021], the largest figure since the outbreak began in the city in mid-June [2021], NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told reporters in Sydney on Saturday [28 Aug 2021]. Two more people died.

NSW first passed 1000 on Thursday [26 Aug 2021], with 1029 daily infections. Sydney's lockdown isn't managing to reduce the number of new infections, despite being in place for more than 2 months.

Hundreds of thousands of people per day are now being vaccinated after a slow start to Australia's rollout, though cases continue to rise in various areas of NSW and have spread to other parts of the country. A record number of people were vaccinated on Friday [27 Aug 2021], Hazzard said.

"While we are seeing massive vaccination numbers, we are also seeing substantial cases," the minister said. "At the end of the day, vaccinations is the way out of this."

[In the past 24 hours,17 countries including the USA (77 016), India (45 058), UK (32 087), Iran (26 034), Brazil (24 699), Malaysia (22 597), Japan (22 580), Russia (19 492), Philippines (19 239), Turkey (17 912), France (17 590), Mexico (17 546), Thailand (16 536), Viet Nam (12 103), Israel (11 177), South Africa (10 173), and Indonesia (10 050) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 8976 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 26 Aug 2021 to late 27 Aug 2021). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 53 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 1.0%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 1.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 9.9% increase in daily reported cases and 22.6% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 500 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 216.74 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.50 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
