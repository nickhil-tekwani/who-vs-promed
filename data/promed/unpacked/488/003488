A fox kit that was found in Augustine Cove is suspected to be the 1st mammal in Prince Edward Island (PEI) to have contracted avian influenza. The test result was a preliminary positive, which will need to be confirmed by another test at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases in Winnipeg.

If confirmed, Dr. Megan Jones, assistant professor in wildlife and anatomic pathology at the Atlantic Veterinary College (AVC) and regional director of the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, said it will be the 1st case of avian influenza in an Island mammal. "We've tested some other mammals, and they were negative, just to have it on our radar," she said. "Since the virus showed up, we've been doing more testing for it, in general, just to track where it's going and what it's doing."

Southwest Lot 16 resident Candy Gallant, operator of PEI Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Inc., had been informed of sick fox kits on Sunday 15 May 2022. Initially, Gallant suspected the foxes had consumed either rat poisoning or antifreeze, due to the symptoms -- primarily seizures.

Unable to get the animals herself, Gallant had asked a friend, Kyra Deschene, to go and check out the fox kits. When Dechene arrived in Augustine Cove, she observed one fox kit lying on the ground convulsing and one more lethargic kit curled up in a tight ball.

She tended to the convulsing kit, first, and put her in a carrier, before moving on to its sibling. "There was nothing noticeable, outside of his behaviour (being) strange," said Deschene. "There was no discharge, diarrhea...normal things that you would expect to see if it was some sort of sickness."

Deschene planned to put the 2nd fox in a carrier as well but ended up holding him while she transported the foxes to Gallant's house. Mid-journey, the 2nd fox also began convulsing. "It's pretty distressing," said Deschene, who considers herself an animal lover. "When it's little babies, it's always worse."

Upon arrival at Gallant's house, the 2 foxes were euthanized. "It was horrible," said Gallant. "I have never seen any wild animals suffering from such intense seizures before."

Gallant noted that the foxes, while still alive, had been seizing so badly that she doubts they were even aware that they had been picked up and moved. "I think they were comatose, basically. Which is probably a blessing, because it was really horrible," she said. "I probably will see it in my mind for quite a while."

Other foxes in the litter, who had also shown signs of illness, were brought to the AVC. There, they were euthanized and were given a lab test to determine the cause of illness.

As of 24 May 2022, the results for one of the 3 foxes had come in, showing a preliminary positive for avian influenza. "With avian influenza, it's a big outbreak that's happening right now," said Jones, noting the number of cases across Canada and the United States since December 2021.

To date, in PEI, the only confirmed cases of the virus had been in birds, Jones said that in the last month, there have been cases of avian influenza found in foxes in Ontario and several US states. "It's something that we actually had on our radar," said Jones.

The virus, she added, would likely have spread to the fox via eating a dead or sick bird that carried the disease. She added that it is unlikely to spread from mammal to mammal.

When an animal contracts avian influenza, the illness gets into the brain, damages brain cells and causes signs like seizures, twitching, lack of balance or lethargy. If anyone sees an animal exhibiting these symptoms, Jones advises them to contact the PEI Fish and Wildlife department, rather than handling the animal themselves -- particularly since these symptoms are similar to signs of rabies in mammals.

"This virus can affect people," said Jones. "We would always recommend against handling any sick birds directly or any sick mammals directly, as well."

Knowing that at least one of the foxes may have contracted avian influenza is "frightening" for Gallant, who had 2 of their littermates in her house. "I've not had any water [fowl] in my house. Any adult birds that come in that are injured are not coming in my house, they're staying out in isolation because of avian influenza," said Gallant. "When Kyra brought the 2 foxes to me that were dying of seizures, they were in my kitchen. That's where I looked at them. So I brought avian influenza in my house without bringing a bird in."

Those 2 foxes, though, have been cremated and are unable to be tested to see if they may have avian flu, like their siblings. "But I'm kind of assuming that whatever killed the 1st two have killed the 2nd two that went to the Atlantic Vet. College," said Gallant.

The experience, although "horrible" for Gallant, has made her exercise extra caution with every animal that comes into her care. She also noted that the remaining littermates, as of Friday 20 May 2022, appeared to be healthy, and Gallant hoped that they were not merely asymptomatic carriers.

"Hopefully this is a one-off and we don't hear it anymore," she said. "We have so many issues with mange in foxes on the Island, so many killed getting hit by cars. I like our wildlife here on the Island."

Last month [May 2022], the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) identified the 1st case of avian flu in wild birds in Cache County, and now the virus has spread to 2 foxes. A red fox was discovered dead in a homeowner's yard in Murray on 24 May 2022, and another red fox was discovered dead 2 days later in a yard in Taylorsville.

Both were collected by DWR officials and taken to the Utah Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Logan for testing. The samples were then sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, where it was determined that they contained highly pathogenic avian influenza.

Officials with Utah DWR said 25 wild birds in 6 Utah counties had tested positive for the bird flu, including Cache, Weber, Salt Lake, Utah, Tooele, and Carbon. Raptors and waterbirds, specifically Canada geese, great horned owls, hawks, pelicans, turkey vultures, and ducks, are among the birds. The results of other bird deaths are still pending.

"While it does happen, it's not very common for wildlife species other than birds to get highly pathogenic avian influenza," DWR Veterinarian Ginger Stout said. "Some states have had 1 or 2 cases in wild mammals, but it's pretty infrequent, and it seems to affect younger animals more often when it does occur."

The last outbreak of bird flu in the [United] States was reported back in 2014 through 2015. There were 2 ducks detected with the virus during that outbreak.

[Infections of HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common, but red foxes have shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 previously in Europe and Japan, and there have been many reports since April [2022] in North America. Other carnivores found infected by the Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in America are skunks.

The frequent reports of carnivores infected by HPAI in North America might result from differential exposure (e.g., high quantity of infected birds used as food items by wild carnivores in the Americas compared with Eurasia), or due to mutations that render a viral lineage more capable of infecting carnivores. The fact that there is a high number of reports of HPAI H5N1 in birds of prey and scavengers suggests that predators/scavengers in general (both mammals and birds) are highly exposed. However, virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB
