China - SARS victims suffer hormone treatment effects
-----------------------------------------------------
About 300 survivors of a deadly outbreak of SARS [severe acute
respiratory syndrome] in China in 2003 are now suffering from serious
after-effects, possibly due to aggressive hormone treatment to save
their lives, the Beijing News said on Friday [25 Dec 2009]. China's
Ministry of Health did not immediately respond to a request for
comment, asking that a fax be sent.

SARS, was an unknown disease when it first struck in late 2002.
Initially covered up by the Chinese government, it spread rapidly
from south China to other cities and countries in 2003, causing
public panic. The most common complaints of the survivors are hip
problems due to bone thinning, depression, and fibrosis of the lungs
that makes breathing difficult.

The last human case of SARS was reported in June 2003. Over 8000
people came down with the disease, and 775 died. The SARS experience
has been credited with inspiring a more transparent health reporting
system in China and prompting better emergency preparedness.

[SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is a viral respiratory
illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV). SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over
the next few months, the illness spread to more than 2-dozen
countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before
the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. Currently, there is
no known case of SARS transmission anywhere in the world. The most
recent human cases of SARS-CoV infection were reported in China in
April 2004 in an outbreak resulting from laboratory-acquired infections.

In general, SARS begins with a high fever. Other symptoms may include
headache, a feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also
have mild respiratory symptoms at the outset. About 10 percent to 20
percent of patients have diarrhea. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients
may develop a dry cough. Many patients develop pneumonia. SARS is
spread by close person-to-person contact. The nature of the sequelae
exhibited by the 300 Chinese survivors of SARS infection referred to
above are not defined. It is unclear to what extent their condition
is a consequence of the original SARS virus infection or their
subsequent aggressive hormone therapy. Further information is
requested. - Mod.CP]
