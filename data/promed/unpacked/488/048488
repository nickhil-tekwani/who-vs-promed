A herd of wild horses captured near Haines Junction, Yukon will have to be destroyed; government officials say all 5 animals have an incurable infectious disease.

The small herd has been running free for years in the Canyon Creek area west of Whitehorse. But this winter [2011-2012], they started hanging around the Alaska Highway corridor, where they became a traffic hazard.

No one knows who owned them, and since their capture last month [April 2012], no one has made a claim. Now, tests have confirmed all have a deadly disease called equine infectious anemia [EIA].

Agriculture supervisor Kevin Bowers said federal regulations leave few options. "It's a disease that there's no cure for, and we have some tough decisions to make about euthanizing those horses as a result of their positive test results," Bowers said.

He said the small Canyon Creek herd was remote enough that it likely did not infect other free-ranging horses in the region. At least a dozen more animals, in 2 separate herds, still roam the Takhini Valley west of Whitehorse, Bowers said. He said quarantine was not an option.

"Unfortunately, [under] the circumstances for permanent quarantine, the horse has to remain on that premise; it has to be secured against infecting other horses and neighbors, notifications [must be given], all those kinds of things," Bowers said. "So maintaining that quarantine is just beyond the capacity of the government or any individual."

[EIA is a reportable disease under the Health of Animals Act. This means that all suspected cases must be reported to the CFIA for immediate investigation by inspectors.

The control of the disease is based on surveillance testing, identification, and destruction or life-long quarantine of infected animals, mandatory testing of imported horses, and efforts to prevent the spread of the virus by controlling insect and mechanical vectors.

Controlling vectors that carry the disease is very important. There are effective mosquito and fly controls for horses, and they should be used, along with fly masks and any other protection for the horse.

Many animals show temporary recovery from the severe stage of EIA and may even appear normal for 2 to 3 weeks before relapsing with similar, but less severe signs. Episodes of clinical illness are often associated with the use of steroid drugs or with periods of stress such as hard work, hot weather, racing, or pregnancy.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) imposes strict regulations on the importation of animals and animal products from countries where EIA is known to occur. These regulations are enforced through port-of-entry inspections done either by the Canada Border Services Agency or the CFIA.

Owners whose animals are ordered destroyed may be eligible for compensation.
