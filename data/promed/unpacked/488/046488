SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY/BSE (14): REVIEW ARTICLES ON PRIONS
=============================================================
From: "LEO LIU" <lliu@bih.harvard.edu>

[In response to requests by Paul Prociv and others for general
information on the nature and molecular biology of the spongiform
encephalopathy agents:]
The world authority on the molecular biology and genetics would be
Stanley Prusiner at UCSF. Fortunately he's written several recent
reviews, below. The Scientific American one is very accessible and readable.
