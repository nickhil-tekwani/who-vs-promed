Due to an error in translation, ProMED-mail's post entitled "Glanders, equine - Chile: (BI)" (archive number 20120605.1156371) inadvertently reported a case of equine strangles as glanders. We will post a corrected version at a later time, but wanted to alert our readers to this error as quickly as possible. We apologize for this error.
