Outbreak of Chagas disease worries residents of Para
----------------------------------------------------
There is an outbreak of Chagas disease [American trypanosomiasis] in the city of Abaetetuba, in the interior of Para state. More than 24 cases were reported in the region and one person has died.

The epidemic could be due to consumption of contaminated acai [a species of palm tree]. The mosquito that transmits the disease is attracted by the fruit, typical of this region. [The vector is not a mosquito. The vectors are hematophagous triatomines, of the species _Triatoma infestans_, the most important one. - Mod.RNA] The insect defecates on the fruit and, if it is consumed without correct hygienic measures, it can lead to the contamination and infection [of the consumers].

A local point of sale is suspected to be the source of the outbreak. This commercial site was closed by Public Health, but after 2 weeks has reopened.

[Outbreak after outbreak, it is clear the need to implement new (and more effective) strategies for surveillance, prevention and control of Chagas disease in the context of its oral transmission.

Here is a recent and excellent review article on the oral transmission of Chagas disease: - Shikanai-Yasuda MA, Carvalho NB. Oral transmission of Chagas disease. Clin Infect Dis. 2012 Mar, 54 (6) :845-52. - Mod.RNA]

[Since the 1st report of oral transmission of South American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, ProMED-mail has posted on at least 10 outbreaks (see below). It is now well recognised that freshly pressed fruit juice in some cases can be contaminated with trypanosomes from triatomid bugs. It must be emphasized that it has only been described for fresh juice, not canned or otherwise stored juice. - Mod.EP
