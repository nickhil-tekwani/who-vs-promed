Cutbacks for public health have been so severe that this was probably
inevitable
Federal health officials confirm dengue fever outbreak
Four East Maui residents diagnosed with mosquito-borne disease
---------------------------------------------
The first local outbreak of dengue fever in 50 years was confirmed
today by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Four
East Maui residents have been diagnosed with the viral disease, which
is characterized by a high fever, severe headaches, joint and muscle
pain, nausea, vomiting and rash. In rare cases, the illness can become
life-threatening, progressing to faintness, shock and generalized
bleeding.
Since none of the people with the virus has traveled recently, the
virus was acquired on Maui, probably originating as an undetected case
in a visitor or returning resident who had traveled to an endemic
area, according to the state Health Department. The health officials
pointed to a lot of dengue fever throughout the Pacific, with
epidemics in Tahiti and Samoa, and said there are a lot of people who
travel between Maui and those islands.
The disease, which is transmitted by mosquitos, occurs primarily in
tropical and subtropical regions. Bruce Anderson, director of the
Health Department, said that the state will attempt to contain the
outbreak quickly with aggressive mosquito-control efforts, which has
eliminated the disease in the past. There is no vaccine or specific
treatment.
The East Hawaii community can help by covering or properly discarding
items that collect or store rainwater, emptying and cleaning pet and
animal watering containers at least once a week, using
air-conditioning or screened windows and doors, wearing long-sleeved
shirts and pants and using mosquito repellent on skin and clothing
when exposure is unavoidable.
Those with dengue fever should protect themselves from mosquitos while
experiencing symptoms to avoid spreading the disease.
A community meeting is scheduled in Hana at 4 p.m. Monday to discuss
issues related to dengue fever. For more information, call Gen Iinuma
at the Hawaii District Health Office at (808) 984-8216.
Reports of suspected cases should be made to the Epidemiology Branch
at 586-4586 on Oahu, (808) 933-0912 on Hawaii, (808) 984-8213 on Maui,
Molokai or Lanai and (808) 241-3563 on Kauai.
