[The outbreak began on 5 Sep 2005, and as of 29 Nov 2005 the total
number of cases has reached 3053 persons including 644 children. This
represents an increase of 836 cases (including 295 children) sine the
last report from the city dated 24 Oct 2005. The outbreak is clearly
far from over and must be one of the largest outbreaks of hepatitis A
recorded in recent years. It appears that the outbreak is not
confined to the city, since an appreciable number of cases have been
reported from the surrounding area. - Mod.CP]
