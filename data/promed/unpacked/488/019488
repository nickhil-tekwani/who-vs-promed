African swine fever (ASF) has already spread to 49 towns and cities in Eastern Visayas, affecting new areas, but the Department of Agriculture (DA) said on Thu [23 Sep 2021] that the outbreak is manageable.

The animal disease has already infected 14 924 hogs in 230 villages as of mid-September [2021].

The number represents 6.68% of the region's 223 504 hog population, DA regional information officer Francis Rosaroso said.

In Leyte province, affected areas are Abuyog, Javier, Mahaplag, Dulag, MacArthur, Tanauan, Burauen, Palo, La Paz, San Miguel, Barugo, Tunga, Sta. Fe, Leyte, Pastrana, Tacloban City, Mayorga, Jaro, Kananga, Carigara, Tolosa, Dagami, Tabontabon, Ormoc City, Tabango, Matag-ob, Calubian, Villaba, and Baybay City.

In other provinces, ASF-hit areas are Silago, Sogod, and Libagon in Southern Leyte; Calbayog City, Catbalogan City, Sta. Rita, Hinabangan, Basey, Sta. Margarita, Gandara, Matuguinao, and Motiong in Samar; Lope de Vega, Catarman, Mondragon in Northern Samar; Dolores, Oras, Jipapad, Balangiga, and Guiuan in Eastern Samar.

"Although there are new areas affected, this is not alarming since the rate of increase has been going down. The total number of affected villages is only 5% of the total," Rosaroso said.

"We have been slowly controlling the outbreak. We are happy that based on trend, there's no spike in the number of cases," he added.

The unregulated trading of processed meat is believed to be the reason for the recent spread, according to the agriculture official.

Despite ASF spread, the DA has identified 23 areas qualified for repopulation due to the absence of new cases for at least 90 days.

The DA and local government are bringing the anti-ASF drive to the village level, identifying volunteers to be deputized as village biosecurity officers with provincial veterinarians as the project lead in the implementation of the program.

The initiative targets to create an effective ASF monitoring, surveillance, and reporting system, to intensify the practice of biosecurity measures in all hog farms, and to assist in recovering the industry.
