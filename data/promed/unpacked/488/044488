Thousands of birds found dead in Greek nature preserve
------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of migratory birds in the Greek nature reserve of Lake
Koronia have died in recent months in what birds specialists are
calling "an ecological catastrophe," several sources said.
Hundreds of dead gulls, tern and ducks -- at least 15 species in all
-- were discovered just in the last few days, the sources said Thu 9
Sep 2004.
Autopsies and tests of water samples from the lake are underway, but
experts do not yet know what is responsible for the sudden wave of
avian fatalities, described by Xenofon Kappas, spokesman of the Greek
ornithological society, as "a major ecological catastrophe."
"For the moment, we are in the process of counting the number of dead
birds," Kappas told AFP.
The Greek news agency ANA put the Lake Koronia avian death toll at
3000, but experts said that more than 10 000 dead birds have been
found on the lake in recent months.
The Mayor of Salonika, 520 kilometers (320 miles) north of Athens,
adopted "emergency measures" to deal with the crisis, reported ANA,
and water samples have been sent to Salonika University for testing.
Fishing has also been banned, though no dead fish have been found.
Lake Koronia is one of 27 parks in Greece that are part of Natura 2000, a
European Union-sponsored network of bird sanctuaries and threatened habitats.
The Lake is also one of 10 Greek ecological sites protected by the Ramsar
treaty, an international convention on wetland ecosystems adopted in 1971.
