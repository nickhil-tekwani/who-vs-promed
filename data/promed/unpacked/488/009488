There appears to be some confusion over the exact etiology of this outbreak
of disease in Bengal Tigers. If trypanosomes have been observed in the
blood of clinically affected tigers (and I assume they have) then the
species is _Trypanosoma evansi_ which is endemic in India and transmitted
by tabanid biting flies. Oral transmission of _T. evansi_ also occurs and
is thought to be the main route of infection for carnivores (Hoare, 1972).
As I see it there are 2 possible explanations for this outbreak. First, the
tigers were infected by tabanids feeding on ruminants housed within 50
meters or so, that were infected with _T. evansi_. Or secondly, and more
likely, the first tiger to show clinical signs (and possibly its cell
mates) was infected by ingestion of freshly killed meat from a ruminant
infected with _T. evansi_.
Regardless of the source of infection treatment of ALL remaining animals
with a curative trypanocidal drug should be effective at halting this
outbreak. Cymelarsan is effective at a dose rate between 0.75 - 1 mg/kg and
should be safe to use in tigers (it is safely used to treat heartworm in
dogs and _T. evansi_ infection in camels). I am not sure how toxic other
drugs such as Diminazine aceturate or Quinapyramine sulphate are in carnivores.
If there is still some doubt about the final diagnosis it could be achieved
post mortem. Histological changes are reasonably characteristic. The
picture seen is of a mononuclear cell infiltration in the connective tissue
of most organs, in particular, heart, lung, kidney, stomach and large
intestine. Immunohistochemistry can be used to confirm that _T. evansi_ is
present in the tissues.

BHUBANESWAR: One more Royal Bengal tiger, a white male, died at Nandankanan
zoo on Friday. The number of tigers having died since Tuesday evening has
risen to 12. The zoo is now left with 44 tigers - 19 white and 25 normal.
An expert team led by P. R. Sinha, member-secretary, Central Zoo Authority,
arrived earlier in the day. The team comprises a wildlife expert from
Hyderabad, 2 veterinarians from Chennai and the Veterinary Council of India
and the assistant director of the Bangalore zoo.
Official sources said Union minister Maneka Gandhi had spoken to some
international tiger experts in the US and the UK, who are likely to reach
here in a few days. The government had sought the help of experts of the
Wildlife Institute at Dehra Dun and the Indian Veterinary Research
Institute (IVRI) at Izatnagar near Bareilly.
The gravity of the situation can be gauged by zoo experts and environmental
activists from all over the world having expressed concern over the
developments at Nandankanan and offering assistance for the safety of the
surviving tigers, according to Biswajit Mohanty of the Wildlife Society of
Orissa. The tiger population in the wild in Orissa has declined from 226 in
1993 to 194 by May 2000, largely due to a sharp loss in their habitant and
unchecked poaching. The world population of white tigers is not more than
200. With this background, the decision of the Nandankanan zoo authorities
to administer a "toxic" drug like Bernyl to the tigers without diagnosing
whether or not they were actually suffering from "tripanosomiasis"
[trypanosomiasis has sparked widespread resentment.
However, the zoo authorities defended their decision stating Bernyl was the
"right choice". "It is true the tigers were not medically examined to
identify the disease before being given the drug. But after the death of
Debasis on June 23, we apprehended the 17 other tigers in the nearby
enclosures that might have contracted tripanosomiasis [trypanosomiasis and
hence decided to give them Bernyl," chief conservator of forests S.K.
Patnaik said.
He asserted Bernyl was not "toxic" in nature. It has been used in the past
without having any adverse effect on the animals. Bernyl was given as a
preventive measure. The tigers died due to the disease, not an overdose of
the medicine.
Patnaik denied the deaths had anything to do with the proliferation of
tigers in captivity through inbreeding. The genetic chart of each tiger in
Nandankanan was maintained and all efforts were taken to avoid inbreeding,
he added.
Nandankanan zoo has given birth to 300 tiger cubs - 177 normal and 123
white - since 1967. However, few have survived, possibly because of
weakening genes. The zoo has so far sent out 33 normal and 22 white tigers
through exchange and direct sale programmes to different zoos in the
country except 2 normal and 6 white tigers which were sent abroad in
exchange for 25 species of other animals and birds.
The state government has fixed Rs 5 lakh as the price of an adult tiger,
deterring many zoos from procuring the animals. Patnaik admitted there was
an over population of tigers at Nandankanan and said there are plans to
give them to other zoos.

[If the zoo has sent out animals in exchange for other species, then they
may well have brought in infected animals, such as ungulates from Africa!.
Tabanids may be transferring the disease or perhaps if these animals have
died, they may have been fed to the tigers. - Mod.TG

HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh wildlife authorities have started screening all
the tigers in the zoos to rule out symptoms of trypanosomiasis disease
which had led to the death of 12 Royal Bengal Tigers in Nandankannan zoo in
Orissa.
"As a precautionary measure, we are taking blood samples of tigers and
testing them for trypanosomiasis virus, [parasite" the state chief
conservator of forests (Wild Life) T Ramakrishna said.
Of the total 204 tigers in the state, 183 are in the wild, while Nehru
Zoological Park here has 16 tigers and Gandhi Zoological Park in
Visakhapatnam houses 5 felines.
"All the tigers in the zoos are being vaccinated regularly and none of them
has so far shown any symptoms of the dreaded disease," he said.
The state has never in the past witnessed an outbreak of trypanosomiasis in
this virulent form, he said, adding in an isolated incident that one tiger
had died of the disease in Nehru Zoo Park in 1964.
"We are taking up prophylactic activity every year to ensure the disease
does not strike the big cats," Ramakrishna said.

[It is interesting this article mentions trypanosomes as a virus and a
vaccination available. As Dr. Reid pointed out in the first piece there are
medications available to treat trypanosome infections. However, to my
knowledge there is no vaccine, nor is this a virus but rather a protozoan.
