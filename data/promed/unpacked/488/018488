While prion persistence in soil is problematic to assess since assays
and models rely on adapted strains such as the hamster scrapie model,
there seems to be good evidence both that prions bind to soil and
persist in soil and that soil bound prions can be infective for a
long time afterwards, and can be present in water run-off from such
soils. Deer studies placing naive animals on soils from infected and
pre-clinical infected deer have also shown transmission even after 15
months -- which is I think pretty good "natural transmission"
evidence for both environmental persistence and environmental
infectivity.

Below are some articles of possible interest.

[I wish to express my appreciation to our readers for their efforts
in providing references regarding the transmissibility of prions and
the issue of prions in the soil. ProMED-mail cannot post the
abstracts of each of these, but the references and/or web locations
are there for those who wish to follow up on this fascinating topic.
As always, I am grateful when my readers provide me the opportunity
to view articles I may have missed and keep me up to date on
findings. However, I believe this thread had ample evidence now
regarding prions in soil and that crows and gut piles being consumed
by cervids and possibly other animals may play a role in the
transmission of CWD. Therefore this thread is cut. - Mod.TG]
