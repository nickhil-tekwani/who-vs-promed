[1] Congo DR (MSF report)

The measles outbreak in Katanga province in southern Democratic Republic of the Congo worsens, and help and resources are lacking in the battle against the vial outbreak, according to the international medical humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

Official numbers put the outbreak at over 20 000 people affected, including some 300 deaths, and it is spreading. More than 20 of Katanga's 68 health districts are now affected, up from 10 districts in June 2015, MSF reported on Tuesday [1 Sep 2015]. DRC government officials have not yet declared an official epidemic, which is likely to burdening the response.

During the past 3 months, MSF vaccinated more than 300 000 children and treated more than 20 000 measles-infected patients in 5 hospitals and approximately 100 health posts; however, according to Jean-Guy Vataux, MSF head of mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, it is not enough.

"We need more actors in the field," he said. "MSF remains one of only 2 organizations in Katanga today involved in treating measles and immunizing children against it." In addition, vaccination campaigns also must deal with the geography of Katanga province, which can be difficult, and it is hard to keep the vaccine at the appropriate temperature.

Katanga province is huge, about 16 times the size of Belgium at nearly a half-million square km. "The vaccine against measles is very effective, but it is not well-suited to this type of environment," said Aurore Taconet, MSF vaccination referent in Paris. "It requires a thorough cold chain, which is difficult to maintain in such conditions, and a 2nd booster dose at least one month after the 1st one. Such constraints mean huge needs in terms of equipment and human resources, and therefore a significant cost."

Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice for the DRC recommending travelers to the Democratic Republic of the Congo protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (one dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine), in addition to practicing good hygiene and cleanliness.

Metro North Public Health Unit (MNPHU) confirmed today [2 Sep 2015] that an 8th case of measles has been linked to the University of Queensland, St Lucia campus. Public Health Physician Dr James Smith said that the student was infectious while attending classes at UQ Business School between Tue 25 Aug 2015 and Thu 27 Aug 2015.

As well as the university, the student visited the following locations in Brisbane while infectious:

- Westfield Garden City, Mt Gravatt late afternoon on Wednesday 26 Aug 2015
- City Beach, Queen Street Mall in evening on Wednesday 26 Aug 2015
- George's Paragon Seafood Restaurant in evening on Wednesday 26 Aug 2015
- Coffee Club Eagle Street Pier, Brisbane in afternoon on Friday 28 Aug 2015
- Beijing House, Queen Street in evening on Friday 28 Aug 2015
- Woolworths, Spring Hill, late morning on Saturday 29 Aug 2015
- Hanaro Mart, Spring Hill, early afternoon on Saturday 29 Aug 2015.

Dr Smith said that MNPHU continues to advise students to be mindful of the early symptoms of measles and to avoid the university campus, part-time work and social gatherings when unwell.

"Measles symptoms usually start around 10 days after contact but can occur between 7-18 days after contact with an infectious person," Dr Smith said. "Early symptoms are similar to the flu and other respiratory illnesses, and include a fever, cough, runny nose, and dry, itchy eyes. "It's important for people to know that measles is infectious for 4 days before the rash appears. It is highly contagious and is spread by way of tiny droplets created during coughing and sneezing."

MNPHU and University of Queensland recently completed a 5 day vaccination clinic at the School of Business. "We focused our vaccination efforts on the School of Business," said Dr Smith, "as recent cases had links with the school. Over 500 people have received the measles vaccine in recent weeks, and many others had vaccination records checked. Anyone who develops the symptoms of measles over the coming fortnight should seek medical advice, from their family doctor in the 1st instance. It is important to call the medical practice 1st to say you could have measles, so that staff can take precautions to avoid spreading the disease to others," Dr Smith said.
