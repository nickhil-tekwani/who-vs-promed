[Anthrax is sporadic in Romania, and, with a perception of minimal risk, any investigation seems to have been also minimal. We gave no previous reports of outbreaks in Teleorman, which is not to say they haven't occurred there before. Just not observed and reported. Outbreaks at this time of year are either related to contaminated soils, e.g. cattle graves; excavations in and around such sites resulting in digging up deep contaminated soils in proximity to the anthrax carcass; or latent infections revealing themselves from an exposure, say 1-3 years previously. According to the data available, this is a case identified at slaughter of what may have been a healthy animal. This would therefore apparently qualify as a latent Infection. By their very nature, these are under-observed. - Mod.MHJ
