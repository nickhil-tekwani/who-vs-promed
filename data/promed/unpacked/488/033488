Botswana has imposed a ban on the movement of all cloven-hooved animals following an outbreak of anthrax in Mohembo area in the northern part of the country. Veterinary Services director Letlhogile Modisa said on [30 Oct 2017] that movement of all cloven-hooved animals into the affected district is not permitted.

He explained that movement of all anthrax-susceptible animals (cattle, sheep, goats, and horses, and wildlife) is not allowed into, within and out of the area. According to Modisa, social slaughter permits would only be issued following favourable health inspections and provision of letters from relevant authorities. Modisa however said movement of fresh products is allowed as long as they are carried in sealed containers/trucks. "Movement of fresh produce from animals that have undergone quarantining and have successfully undergone deboning and maturation in licensed facilities is allowed out of the district," he said.

Botswana recently detected dead hippos floating in the Okavango River, after more than 100 of the animals were suspected to have been killed by the disease in neighbouring Namibia.

[To find Mohembo (North West/Ngamiland) on the Okavango River, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BC/00/Muhembo.html

Latterly there has been a Botswana report indicating that Botswana hippos might have been affected; see 25 Oct 2017 Anthrax - Namibia (11): (Bwabwata Natl Park) human prophylaxis 20171025.5403413. So this livestock quarantine and movement control has common sense. Subsequent report from the area may indicate how successful the demand for inspection and permissions will have been along with deboning in licensed facilities. In my experience shade tree slaughter and butchering is paperless. - Mod.MHJ
