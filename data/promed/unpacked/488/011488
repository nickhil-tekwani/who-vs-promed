Today's edition of the OIE Diseasse Information includes information on a
newly named syndrome in farmed Atlantic salmon _Salmo salar_ from Dr N.G.
Willis, Director General of the Animal and Plant Health Directorate,
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa:
Nature of diagnosis: histopathological.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: Summer 1996.
Estimated date of first infection: Spring 1996?
Location No. of outbreaks
New Brunswick Bay of Fundy area 21 of the 80 sites (125 net pens)
checked in the area
(in the eastern part of the country)
Description of affected population: farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).
Salmon farmers have experienced variable and occasionally heavy losses. Cage
mortality rates have varied from site to site between 0.01% per week to 1%
per day. Until August 1997, only the pre-market classes (fish larger than
about 1 kg) were ever identified with the syndrome. August 1997 marks the
first suspicion of mortality associated with the syndrome in smolt year
class (approx. 300- to 400-gram fish).
Diagnosis:
Early clinical signs include the appearance of slow swimming fish near the
surface and lethargic fish near the bottom of marine cages.Internal findings
include kidney hemorrhages. Dead fish may also show signs of bleeding around
the fins, eyes and belly.
The disease responsible has been tentatively named "haemorrhagic kidney
syndrome" (HKS).
Until recently, although the aetiological agent was unknown, viral aetiology
was suspected. In September 1997, kidney samples of HKS-positive fish
produced a cytopathic effect on the SHK(1) cell line. The latter was
developed in Norway for the isolation and culture of the infectious salmon
anaemia (ISA) virus. The ISA virus was confirmed at the Central Veterinary
Laboratory, Oslo, Norway.
Based on the cytopathic effect obtained on the SHK cell line and
confirmation by RT-PCR(2), the ISA virus was recently confirmed in seven
HKS-positive sites. Work is continuing on other infectious agents possibly
involved with this syndrome.
A formal survey has been initiated to correlate the presence of the ISA
virus with HKS-positive sites.
(1) salmon head kidney (anterior kidney)
(2) reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction.
Epidemiology: the syndrome has only been found in marine cages. Although no
freshwater facilities (hatcheries) have been checked, there are no reports
of HKS in such facilities. Epidemiological studies have been initiated to
examine the risk factors. The Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans
(DFO) will also conduct surveys to determine if HKS is present in wild
salmon and other marine species.
Control measures during reporting period:
This syndrome does not pose a risk to human health. All cultured salmon
harvested in the Bay of Fundy are processed according to and meet Canadian
Food Inspection Agency standards. Dead or dying fish are not sold for human
consumption; they are composted or disposed of in other acceptable ways.
The following actions minimise the risk of spreading the syndrome to other
areas:
- Restricted movement between sites.
- Strict site disinfection procedures, and waste water disinfection at
processing plants.
- Voluntary early harvest of fish at risk of developing HKS.
A Special Advisory Committee for HKS was formed by the New Brunswick
Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture to coordinate activities to address
this problem. The Committee consists of representatives of the DFO, the New
Brunswick Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, private veterinarians and
industry.
In addition, an HKS Steering Committee established by the aquaculture
industry is operating at the working level to make progress in the areas of
surveillance, containment (at the farm and regional level), research,
regulation, human health, and communication. The federal government is
represented on this committee as is the provincial government, universities,
private veterinarians, and the industry.
