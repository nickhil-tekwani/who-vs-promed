Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, Belize
----------------------------------------
Information received on Sat 15 Feb 2020 from Dr. Miguel Angel DePaz, chief veterinary officer, Animal Health Department, Belize Agricultural Health Authority (BAHA), Cayo District, Belize

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 30 Oct 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 4 Dec 2019
Report date: 15 Feb 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 15 Feb 2020
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 12 Dec 2014
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location 1: Little Belize area, Corozal South, Newland, Corozal
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Oct 2019
Outbreak status: resolved on 12 Feb 2020
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 5 / 4 / 4 / 0 / 0
Affected population: recently established Mennonite community in forested area in the north of Belize. Horses used as draught animals and for transportation - horse and buggy.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 80 / 80 / 100 / 80
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals, vectors

Epidemiological comments: The Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus is known to circulate in the northern part of Belize, and outbreaks are controlled by routine vaccination. This Newland community was recently established in forested area, hence vaccination not yet routinely done.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; no treatment of affected animals

Vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / Details
Corazal / Equidae / 350 / horses in community vaccinated against Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) (OIE reference laboratory) / Equidae / plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRN) / 4 Dec 2019 / positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (EEE, WEE, and VEE) viruses belong to the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family Togaviridae. Alternate infection of birds, rodents, and mosquitoes maintain these viruses in nature. The disease occurs sporadically in horses and humans from mid-summer to late autumn. Horses and humans are incidental end hosts for WEE. Horses are not dead-end hosts for VEE virus. The disease in horses is characterized by fever, anorexia, and severe depression. In severe cases, it can progress to hyperexcitability, blindness, ataxia, severe mental depression, recumbency, convulsions, and death.

"The VEE complex of viruses includes 6 antigenic subtypes (I-VI). Within subtype I there are 5 antigenic variants (variants AB-F). Originally, subtypes I-A and I-B were considered to be distinct variants, but they are now considered to be identical (I-AB). Antigenic variants I-AB and I-C are associated with epizootic activity in equids and human epidemics. Historically, severe outbreaks have involved many thousands of human and equine cases. The other 3 variants of subtype I (I-D, IE, I-F) and the other 5 subtypes of VEE (II-VI) circulate in natural enzootic cycles. Equidae serve as amplifying hosts for epizootic VEE strains while enzootic VEE viruses cycle primarily in sylvatic rodents and mosquitoes. Enzootic variants and subtypes have been considered to be nonpathogenic for equids but can cause clinical disease in humans. During 1993 and 1996, limited outbreaks of encephalitis in horses in Mexico were shown to be caused by enzootic VEE viruses of subtype I-E. More recently, sporadic outbreaks have occurred in Mexico, Central America, and northern and western parts of South America. Human enzootic subtypes reach more broadly into northern Central America and South America."
