The preventable but disfiguring disease of
elephantiasis is on the rise in Jambi, with 277
people diagnosed with the illness during the past
5 years, a health official says.
Anwar Djauhari of Jambi Health Office's
communicable disease eradication section said the
cases were recorded in three of the province's 10
regions. The 3 regencies -- Muarojambi and West
and East Tanjungjabung -- are located in swampy
areas or peat lands, he said. The office had
treated the illness at clinics in the 3
regencies, Azwar said. However, more clinics were
needed to prevent the disease from spreading, he said.
Elephantiasis, which is caused by the invasion of
lymphatic glands by tiny worms, leads to the
gross swelling of limbs or the scrotum. Azwar
said the office had warned villagers in the 3
regencies to maintain sanitation standards around
residential areas. They should also guard against
being bitten by mosquitoes, which help spread the disease, he said.

[Filariasis caused by _Wuchereria bancrofti_,
_Brugia malayi_, and _Brugia timori_ is endemic
in Indonesia, and WHO estimates that "22 of 27
provinces, which comprises of approximately 150
million people, are estimated to be endemic for
LF." A map of the endemicity can be found at:
<http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section2096_10614.htm>.
Filariasis is transmitted by mosquitoes.
Filariasis control in Indonesia relies on:
interruption of transmission (vector control) to
reduce the prevalence below 1 percent; institute
early treatment to prevent chronic sequelae. Mass
drug administration (MDA) has been gradually
scaled up in endemic districts. In 2004, over 82
percent coverage was achieved among the
eligible population in the implementation units
which were under MDA. The LF programme will be
focused in Sumatra and Kalimantan but some
districts outside this will continue the MDA that
commenced in 2002 (Source: WHO). - Mod.EP]
[Bancroftian filariasis, _Wuchereria
bancrofti_, occurs in Indonesia but the most
widespread and common filarial infection is
brugian filariasis, caused by _Brugia
malayi_, of which the nocturnally periodic form
is principally a rural disease. It is
transmitted by night-biting mosquitoes, such as
_Anopheles_ species and more importantly by
_Mansonia_ mosquitoes such as _Ma. uniformis_,
_Ma. dives_, _Ma. bonneae_ and _Ma. annulifera_,
all of which occur in Indonesia. There are no
known important animal reservoir hosts of the
nocturnally periodic form of brugian filariasis.
The nocturnally subperiodic form of _B. malayi_
also occurs in Indonesia, and again is
transmitted by _Mansonia_ mosquitoes. This
subperiodic form of _B. malayi_ is a zoonosis
and essentially a parasite of swamp monkeys,
especially the so-called leaf monkeys
(_Presbytis_ species), humans becoming infected
when they live at the edges of these areas. Other
reservoir hosts include _Macaca_ monkeys,
domestic and wild cats, such as civets, and
pangolins (i.e. scaly anteaters, genus _Manis_).
_Mansonia_ mosquitoes breed in more-or-less
permanent waters such as swamps and ponds having
floating or rooted aquatic vegetation. They do
not come to the water surface to breath but
obtain their oxygen requirements by inserting
their larval siphons into aquatic plants. They
are usually controlled by either removing
aquatic weeds or using herbicides to kill the
weeds. If insecticides are used then granules or
pellets are more suitable than liquid
formulations. This is because they can penetrate
the vegetation, sink to the bottom of breeding
places and release their insecticidal contents
through the water. Because larvae do not
surface to breathe, and because of their often
extensive swampy habitats, _Mansonia_ are
difficult to control. Adult _Mansonia_ bite
mainly outdoors and rest out of doors after
feeding, but they will also bite and rest indoors in some areas.
Infection rates of mosquitoes with infective
larvae of _B. malayi_ range from about 0.1 to 2ï¿½3
percent, which is slightly lower than for _W.
bancrofti_, but infection rates vary according to
mosquitoes and local conditions.
_Brugia timori_ is known only from the small
Indonesian islands of Alors, Timor and Flores,
and from lowland areas of small neighbouring
islands east of Java. Its microfilariae are
nocturnally periodic and are transmitted by _An.
barbirostris_, and possibly by other anopheline
species. There are no known animal reservoir hosts. - Mod. MS]
