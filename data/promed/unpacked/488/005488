I fail to see how Dr. Classen's holding of patents is relevant. Does that
negate the fact he is engaging in ongoing research? I cannot see that he
would have anything to gain. I also find it interesting that while Dr.
Grabenstein offers many citations to discredit Classen's findings, he
offers no data for the survey conducted by (I assume) the U.S. military
(re: "1500 lab workers at Fort Detrick, Maryland, vaccinated against
anthrax OR OTHER DANGEROUS INFECTIONS and followed for MANY YEARS")(caps
added).
Obviously, the organization administering the vaccine would have a
tremendous liability to those receiving it, should Dr. Classen be correct,
especially if they made it mandatory.

Dr. Classen is welcome to patent his intellectual property. I mentioned the
patents to describe his previous assertions that anthrax vaccination could
be valuable to infants.
The manuscript reporting the health of the 1,500 laboratory workers at Fort
Detrick is being finalized now. This manuscript picks up where the third in
a series of reports left off (White CS III, Adler WH, McGann VG. Repeated
immunization: Possible adverse effects: Reevaluation of human subjects at
25 years. Annals of Internal Medicine 1974;81:594-600). The vaccinations
against other dangerous infections included various combinations of
anthrax, botulism, brucellosis, plague, Q fever, Rift Valley fever,
tularemia, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and other vaccines. It is not
unusual for these 1500 workers to have received multiple vaccinations over
the span of 10 or 20 years or more. The medical surveillance of their
health has become
increasingly sophisticated over the years, to monitor the safety of the
vaccines they receive.
