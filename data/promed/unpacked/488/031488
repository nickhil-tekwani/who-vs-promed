As of 8 May 2013 (11:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission, China notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The patient is a 79-year-old woman from Jiangxi province who became ill on 3 May 2013. Additionally, a patient earlier reported has died.

To date, a total of 131 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus including 32 deaths have been reported to WHO. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored.

The authorities in the affected locations continue to implement prevention and control measures. Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

The H7N9 bird flu killed one person in central China's Henan Province on Thu 9 May 2013, local authorities said, bringing the nationwide death toll to 32. A 56-year-old man died Thursday afternoon in the provincial capital of Zhengzhou 2 weeks after his infection was confirmed, the Henan provincial health bureau said in a statement.

The patient suffered from a fever for one week before being admitted to the hospital in critical condition. Medical staff failed to ease his illness, as he also suffered from several other diseases, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and a cerebral infarction, according to the statement. The man had no direct contact with birds, but there were birdcages hanging in the corridor of the residential building he lived in, the statement added. Henan has reported 4 H7N9 cases thus far. The other 3 patients have since recovered.

China has reported 129 [now 131, see part 1] human infections so far, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The commission added that the cases are isolated, and there has been no sign of human-to-human transmission.

The condition of a Taiwanese businessman who contracted the H7N9 avian influenza virus in China has improved to the point where he has been taken off his ventilator and may soon be moved to a normal ward, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) said on Tuesday [7 May 2013]. "The patient has been taken off a ventilator, is no longer testing positive for the virus, and has been taken off the anti-flu drug Tamiflu," NTUH deputy superintendent Chang Shan-chwen said. "If all goes well, the patient can be transferred to a normal ward in the next couple of days for continued treatment and recuperation," Chang added.

The 53-year-old man has been receiving intensive treatment in a negative pressure quarantine ward since 20 Apr 2013 after testing positive for the H7N9 virus following his return to Taiwan on 9 Apr 2013. At the most serious stage of his illness, he was put on a ventilator and given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. He was taken off the ECMO, a machine that functions as an artificial lung, on Thursday last week. "While the patient is clearly conscious and his health is improving steadily, he nevertheless remains weak and still suffers shortness of breath," Chang said at a media briefing, with the consent of the patient's family. "It is still not clear when he can be discharged," Chang added.

Preliminary inferences on the age-specific seriousness of human disease caused by avian influenza A(H7N9) infections in China, March to April 2013. (By Cowling BJ, Freeman G, Wong JY, Wu P, Liao Q, Lau EH, Wu JT, Fielding R, Leung GM.)

Background
----------
Between 31 Mar and 21 Apr 2013, 102 laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) infections have been reported in 6 provinces of China. Using survey data on age-specific rates of exposure to live poultry in China, we estimated that risk of serious illness after infection is 5.1 times higher in persons 65 years and older versus younger ages. Our results suggest that many unidentified mild influenza A(H7N9) infections may have occurred, with a lower bound of 210-550 infections to date.

Introduction
----------
In recent weeks, increasing numbers of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infections have been identified in humans in China [1,2]. Laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A(H7N9) infection have typically suffered serious illness [3,4], and there is a notable excess of confirmed cases in the elderly [3,5]. In the present analysis, we compared the incidence of serious influenza A(H7N9) infections with data on age-specific patterns in exposure to domestic poultry and live poultry markets to estimate the relative seriousness of influenza A(H7N9) and obtain a lower bound on the number of human infections to date.

Methods
-------
Poultry exposures in China:
We obtained unpublished data on poultry exposures in Shenzhen, a city in Guangdong province on the border with Hong Kong, and in Xiuning, a rural county in Anhui province in eastern China. In each location, a 2-stage household-based cluster survey was conducted to assess poultry exposures based on average annual visits to poultry wet markets (Shenzhen, n=2058), and ownership of backyard poultry (Xiuning, n=2892). Trained investigators conducted each face-to-face interview with selected households, and every family member who met the inclusion criteria (aged at least 5 years, and resident in the study area for at least 3 months) was interviewed. Poultry wet markets were defined as places where small animals and poultry may be purchased alive or slaughtered just before purchase. The surveys were conducted from July to September 2007.

Data on poultry exposures in urban and semi-rural areas of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province in Southern China, were obtained through face-to-face interviews, from January through March 2006 [6]. Households were selected for interview through stratified cluster sampling in the 10 urban districts (n=1363) and 2 satellite towns (n=187) of Guangzhou. One adult per selected household was interviewed. We assessed household exposures to retail and domestic poultry in both urban and semi-rural locations based on average annual visits to poultry wet markets to purchase live poultry, and ownership of backyard poultry [6].

Avian influenza A(H7N9) cases:
Information on laboratory-confirmed human infections with influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) was obtained from official notifications, including age, geographic location, and seriousness of disease (mild/serious). The definition for an influenza A(H7N9) case is given elsewhere [3]. A serious case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) case that required hospital admission for medical reasons, i.e. with a complication such as pneumonia, rather than merely for isolation. Cases defined as serious included all fatal laboratory-confirmed cases. The age-specific populations of provinces in China were obtained from the 2010 population census of the People's Republic of China [7].

Statistical analysis:
[Readers are referred to the original text via the source URL for a description of the statistical analyses performed. - Mod.CP]

Results:
Between 31 Mar and 21 Apr 2013, 102 laboratory-confirmed human influenza A(H7N9) cases were officially announced in 6 provinces of China. The affected areas were the cities and provinces around the city of Shanghai on the eastern coast of mainland China.

The age distribution of influenza A(H7N9) cases was very different from the age distribution of the 43 influenza A(H5N1) cases reported between 2003 and 2013 in mainland China. In particular, 56 percent of the influenza A(H7N9) cases were persons aged 60 years or older, whereas the majority of influenza A(H5N1) cases were young adults aged 20 to 39 years. In the 8 affected areas, there were a total of 98 serious influenza A(H7N9) cases in a total population of 206 million persons. The cumulative number of serious influenza A(H7N9) cases increased substantially with age, particularly in urban locations.

We fitted the model described above to data on the incidence rates of serious influenza A(H7N9) cases in the 6 provinces, along with poultry exposures in urban and rural locations. In the age group of at least 65 years, there were 46 serious infections and one mild infection, so we used a beta distribution for the parameter R-old.

Based on the exposure data from Shenzhen and Xiuning to reflect exposures in affected urban and rural areas, we obtained the estimate B-age=5.06 (95 percent credibility interval (CI): 2.99-8.15), corresponding to a 5.06-fold increase in the risk of serious illness for those aged 65 years and older versus those younger than 65 years. The estimated values of Pij and the observed values of Aij were then used to estimate that there have been at least 323 (95 percent CI: 214-475) total influenza A(H7N9) infections in the population, including those reported. When we used the exposure data from Guangzhou to reflect exposures in affected urban and rural areas, we estimated B-age=5.95 (95 percent CI: 3.37-10.00), and an estimated minimum number of 352 (95 percent CI: 225-541) total influenza A(H7N9) infections in adults (because we did not have exposure data for children in Guangzhou).

In sensitivity analyses, results were similar using alternative simple parameterisations for the effect of age. For example when we used Ri=R7 x exp (B x (i-7)), we obtained an estimated 1.83-fold (95 percent CI: 1.56-2.18) increase in the risk of serious illness for every 10-year increase in age, and an estimate of at least 334 (95 percent CI: 239-461) total influenza A(H7N9) infections in the population. The small sample size did not allow us to examine more complex functional forms for ri. All analyses reported above were based on data available until 25 Apr 2013; we repeated the analyses based on data available until 6 May 2013, and the relationship between age and seriousness of disease was essentially the same.

Discussion:
Our results suggest that the seriousness of influenza A(H7N9) infections increases with age. Previous reports also identified increases with older age in the seriousness of seasonal influenza [11] and H1N1 pdm09 [12,13], although this may partly be due to the role of secondary bacterial pneumonia, whereas many of the influenza A(H7N9) deaths have been associated with primary viral pneumonia. However, the age distribution of serious human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) is very different. The patterns of exposure to avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses by age may not be identical because of the high degree of pathogenicity of influenza A(H5N1) in poultry compared with the absence of disease in poultry with influenza A(H7N9) infections, at least before the national influenza A(H5N1) vaccination programme in poultry was introduced in 2006-07. Exposures to sick or dead poultry would be more frequent on farms and backyards, compared to live poultry markets. In addition, healthcare seeking behaviours may also have changed over the past 10 years. There are various potential explanations for an increased risk of serious illness for influenza A(H5N1) infections in young adults compared to other ages, and these hypotheses deserve further investigation.

We estimated that a minimum of 210-550 influenza A(H7N9) infections have occurred by 21 Apr 2013, assuming that almost all influenza A(H7N9) infections are serious in the elderly and that all serious infections have been identified. This estimate is, therefore, a lower bound on the number of total influenza A(H7N9) infections, and for these 2 reasons, the real figure may be substantially higher. There could be some under ascertainment of serious influenza A(H7N9) infections through failure to seek care or failure to be tested early enough in the course of disease to permit identification of the influenza infection. Our estimate is also dependent on the assumption that age-specific patterns of exposure to retail and domestic poultry in affected areas of China in 2011 are similar to the patterns measured in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Xiuning in 2006 and 2007. We are not aware of data on age-specific patterns in poultry exposures from eastern China other than our unpublished data from Xiuning, and future collection of such data from across China (and across Southeast Asia) in urban and rural settings would be extremely useful.

Our estimates are limited by the lack of data on exposures in affected urban and rural areas. In particular, the higher risk for infection in males compared to females could be due to variation in sex-specific rates of exposure by region. Without data on such differences, we did not include sex in our models. Most confirmed cases report exposure to live poultry [3], and this remains the most likely source of infection for the majority of influenza A(H7N9) cases. However, the exposure distributions used in our analysis may not fully capture the age-specific risk profile if there are other sources of infection apart from retail and domestic poultry. As of 25 Apr 2013, we are not aware of provinces in China with laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) cases in poultry but not in humans. Finally, no published information is available on population levels of immunity to influenza A(H7N9), although preliminary investigations suggest very low antibody levels against influenza A(H7N9) virus in all ages, and we assumed there was no heterogeneity in immunity by age. If older persons had some degree of immunity against influenza A(H7N9) through potential past exposures to avian influenza viruses, this would imply an even higher number of undetected infections in adults based on our method.

In conclusion, we estimated a lower bound for the number of influenza A(H7N9) infections based on the possible age distribution of exposures and varying seriousness of infection by age. More accurate estimates of the risk of influenza A(H7N9) infection and the age-specific seriousness of infection could be provided by detailed sero-epidemiological studies in affected areas.

[5] MMWR report
Date: Fri 10 May 2013
Source: MMWR Weekly, 62(18);366-371 [abbreviated, edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr


On 29 Mar 2013, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention completed laboratory confirmation of 3 human infections with an avian influenza A(H7N9) virus not previously reported in humans (1). These infections were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 Mar 2013 in accordance with International Health Regulations. The cases involved 2 adults in Shanghai and one in Anhui Province. All 3 patients had severe pneumonia, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and died from their illnesses (2). The cases were not epidemiologically linked. The detection of these cases initiated a cascade of activities in China, including diagnostic test development, enhanced surveillance for new cases, and investigations to identify the source(s) of infection. No evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission has been found, and no human cases of H7N9 virus infection have been detected outside China, including the United States.

This report summarizes recent findings and recommendations for preparing and responding to potential H7N9 cases in the United States. Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in persons with acute respiratory illness and relevant exposure history and should contact their state health departments regarding specimen collection and facilitation of confirmatory testing.

Epidemiologic Investigation:
As of 29 Apr 2013, China had reported 126 [now at least 131] confirmed H7N9 infections in humans, among whom 24 [now 32] (19 percent) died (1). Cases have been confirmed in 8 contiguous provinces in eastern China (Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Zhejiang), 2 municipalities (Beijing and Shanghai), and Taiwan (Figure 1; interested readers are recommended to view this figure via the source URL for its clarity and information content). Illness onset of confirmed cases occurred during 19 Feb-29 Apr 2013 (Figure 2). The source of the human infections remains under investigation. Almost all confirmed cases have been sporadic, with no epidemiologic link to other human cases, and are presumed to have resulted from exposure to infected birds (3,4). Among 82 confirmed cases for which exposure information is available, 63 (77 percent) involved reported exposure to live animals, primarily chickens (76 percent) and ducks (20 percent) (3). However, at least 3 family clusters of 2 or 3 confirmed cases have been reported where limited human-to-human transmission might have occurred (3).

The median age of patients with confirmed infection is 61 years (interquartile range: 48-74); 17 (21 percent) of the cases are among persons aged 75 years or older, and 58 (71 percent) of the cases are among males. Only 4 cases have been confirmed among children; in addition, a specimen from one asymptomatic child was positive for H7N9 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Among the 71 cases for which complete data are available, 54 (76 percent) patients had at least one underlying health condition (3). Most of the confirmed cases involved severe respiratory illness. Of 82 confirmed cases for which data were available as of 17 Apr 2013, 81 (99 percent) required hospitalization (3). Among those patients hospitalized, 17 (21 percent) died of ARDS or multiorgan failure, 60 (74 percent) remained hospitalized, and only 4 (5 percent) had been discharged (3).

Chinese public health officials have investigated human contacts of patients with confirmed H7N9. In a detailed report of a follow-up investigation of 1689 contacts of 82 infected persons, including health-care workers who cared for those patients, no transmission to close contacts of confirmed cases was reported, although investigations including serologic studies are ongoing (3). In addition, influenza surveillance systems in China have identified no sign of increased community transmission of this virus. Seasonal influenza A(pH1N1) and influenza B viruses continue to circulate among persons in areas where H7N9 cases have been detected, and the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that rates of influenza-like illness are consistent with expected seasonal levels.

CDC, along with state and local health departments, is continuing epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance for influenza in the United States. On 5 Apr 2013, CDC requested state and local health departments to initiate enhanced surveillance for H7N9 among symptomatic patients who had returned from China in the previous 10 days (5). As of 29 Apr 2013, 37 such travelers had been reported to CDC by 18 states. Among those 37 travelers, none were found to have infection with H7N9; 7 had an infection with a seasonal influenza virus, one had rhinovirus, one had respiratory syncytial virus, and 28 were negative for influenza A and B. Among 31 cases with known patient age, 7 travelers were aged under 18 years, 13 were aged 18-64 years, and 11 were aged 65 years or older. Additionally, influenza activity in the United States is low and continues to decrease, with morbidity and mortality surveillance systems reporting activity below seasonal baseline levels. Although low numbers of influenza viruses are being detected, the majority in recent weeks have been influenza B.

Laboratory Investigation:
As of 30 Apr 2013, Chinese investigators had posted 19 partial or complete genome sequences from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses to a publicly available database at the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (http://www.gisaid.org). Sequences are from viruses infecting 12 humans and 5 birds, and 2 are from viruses collected from the environment. These sequences indicate that all 8 genes of the H7N9 virus are of avian origin, with the closest phylogenetic relatives from 3 Eurasian influenza virus lineages (H7N3 from domestic ducks, H7N9 from wild birds, and H9N2 from birds widely distributed throughout East Asia). In addition, genetic changes in the sequences are present that have been associated with adaptations leading to enhanced virus binding to and replication in mammalian respiratory cells and increased severity of infection (2,4,6).

CDC's Influenza Division Laboratory has received 2 H7N9 influenza viruses (A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013) from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Figure 3). Full characterization of these viruses is ongoing; however, studies to date have shown robust viral replication in eggs, cell culture, and the respiratory tract of animal models (ferrets and mice). At higher inoculum doses (106-104 plaque forming units), the virus shows some lethality for BALB/c mice.

Laboratory testing of the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus isolate at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and other laboratories indicates that this virus is susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir, the 2 neuraminidase-inhibiting (NAI) antiviral drugs licensed in the United States for treatment of seasonal influenza. The genetic sequence of one of the publicly posted H7N9 viruses (A/Shanghai/1/2013) contains a known marker of NAI resistance (2). The clinical relevance of this genetic change is under investigation, but it serves as a reminder that resistance to antiviral drugs can occur spontaneously through genetic mutations or emerge during antiviral treatment. The genetic sequences of all viruses tested showed a known marker of resistance to the adamantanes, indicating that, although these drugs (amantadine and rimantadine) are licensed for use in the United States, they should not be prescribed for patients with H7N9 virus infection.

Immediately after notification by Chinese health authorities of the H7N9 cases, CDC began development of a new H7 diagnostic test for use with the existing CDC influenza rRT-PCR kit. This test has been designed to diagnose infection with Eurasian H7 viruses, including the recently recognized China H7N9 and other representative H7 viruses from Southeast Asia and Bangladesh. On 22 Apr 2013, this new H7 test was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use as an in vitro diagnostic test under an Emergency Use Authorization, thus allowing distribution and use of the test in the United States. The CDC H7 rRT-PCR test is now available to all qualified U.S. public health and U.S. Department of Defense laboratories and WHO-recognized National Influenza Centers globally and can be ordered from the Influenza Reagent Resource (http://www.influenzareagentresource.org). Access to the CDC H7 rRT-PCR test protocol is available at http:/www.cdc.gov/flu/clsis. Guidance on appropriate biosafety levels for working with the virus and suspect clinical specimens is being developed.

Animal Investigation and U.S. Animal Health Preparedness Activities:
As of 26 Apr 2013, reports from the China Ministry of Agriculture indicate that 68 060 bird and environmental specimens have been tested; 46 (0.07 percent) were confirmed H7N9-positive by culture (7). The H7N9 virus has been confirmed in chickens, ducks, pigeons (feral and captive), and environmental samples in 4 of the 8 provinces and in Shanghai municipality (Figure 1). As of 17 Apr 2013, approximately 4150 swine and environmental samples from farms and slaughterhouses were reported to have been tested; all swine samples were negative. The China Ministry of Agriculture is jointly engaged with the National Health and Family Planning Commission in conducting animal sampling to assist in ascertaining the extent of the animal reservoir of the H7N9 virus. Sampling of animals is concentrated in the provinces and cities where human cases have been reported. Poultry markets in Shanghai and other affected areas have been closed temporarily, and some markets might remain closed.

MMWR Editorial Note:
After recognition of the 1st human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9), Chinese public health officials and scientists rapidly reported information about identified cases and posted whole virus genome sequences for public access. During April 2013, laboratory and surveillance efforts quickly characterized the virus, developed diagnostic tests, generated candidate vaccine viruses, identified cases and contacts, described clinical illness, evaluated animal sources of infection, and implemented control measures. Preliminary investigations of patients and close contacts have not revealed evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, but limited nonsustained human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission could not be excluded in a few family clusters (3). Despite these efforts, many questions remain.

The epidemiology of H7N9 infections in humans so far reveals that most symptomatic patients are older (median age: 61 years), most are male (71 percent), and most had underlying medical conditions. In comparison, among the 45 avian influenza A(H5N1) cases reported from China during 2003-2013, the median patient age is 26 years (8). This difference in median age might represent actual differences in exposure or susceptibility to H7N9 virus infection and clinical illness, or preliminary H7N9 case identification approaches might be more likely to capture cases in older persons. Ongoing surveillance and case-control studies are needed to better understand the epidemiology of H7N9 virus infections and to determine whether younger persons might be more mildly affected, and therefore less likely to be detected via surveillance.

Available animal testing data and human case histories indicate that most human patients have poultry exposure; however, relatively few H7N9 virus-infected birds have been detected. During the month after recognition of H7N9, increasing numbers of infected humans have been identified in additional areas of eastern China, suggesting possible widespread occurrence of H7N9 virus in poultry. Enhanced surveillance in poultry and other birds in China is needed to better clarify the magnitude of H7N9 virus infection in birds and to better target control measures for preventing further transmission.

The emergence of this previously unknown avian influenza A(H7N9) virus as a cause of severe respiratory disease and death in humans raises numerous public health concerns. 1st, the virus has several genetic differences compared with other avian influenza A viruses. These genetic changes have been evaluated previously in ferret and mouse studies with other influenza A viruses, including highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, and were associated with respiratory droplet transmission, increased binding of the virus to receptors on cells in the respiratory tract of mammals, increased virulence, and increased replication of virus (5). Epidemiologic investigations have not yielded conclusive evidence of sustained human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission; however, further adaptation of the virus in mammals might lead to more efficient and sustained transmission among humans. 2nd, human illness with H7N9 virus infection, characterized by lower respiratory tract disease with progression to ARDS and multiorgan failure, is significantly more severe than in previously reported infection with other H7 viruses. Over a 2-month period, 24 deaths (19 percent of cases) have occurred, compared with only one human death attributed to other subtypes of H7 virus reported previously. 3rd, H7N9-infected poultry are the likely source of infection in humans but might not display illness symptoms. Consequently, efforts to detect infection in poultry and prevent virus transmission will be challenging for countries lacking a surveillance program for actively identifying low-pathogenicity avian influenza in poultry. In the United States, an active surveillance program is in place that routinely identifies low-pathogenicity viruses. If this newly recognized H7N9 is detected, public health and animal health officials should identify means for monitoring the spread of asymptomatic H7N9 virus infections in poultry and maintain vigilance for virus adaptation and early indications of potential human-to-human transmission.

Given the number and severity of human H7N9 illnesses in China, CDC and its partners are taking steps to develop a H7N9 candidate vaccine virus. Past serologic studies evaluating immune response to H7 subtypes of influenza viruses have shown no existing cross-reactive antibodies in human sera. In addition, CDC has activated its Emergency Operations Center to coordinate efforts. In the United States, planning for H7N9 vaccine clinical trials is underway. Although no decision has been made to initiate an H7N9 vaccination program in the United States, CDC recommends that local authorities and preparedness programs take time to review and update their pandemic influenza vaccine preparedness plans because it could take several months to ready a vaccination program, if one becomes necessary. CDC also recommends that public health agencies review their overall pandemic influenza plans to identify operational gaps and to ensure administrative readiness for an influenza pandemic. Continued collaboration between the human and animal health sectors is essential to better understand the epidemiology and ecology of H7N9 infections among humans and animals and target control measures for preventing further transmission.

What are the implications for public health practice?
State and local health authorities are encouraged to review pandemic influenza preparedness plans to ensure response readiness. Clinicians in the United States should consider H7N9 virus infection in recent travelers from China who exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with influenza. Patients with H7N9 virus infection (laboratory-confirmed, probable, or under investigation) should receive antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir as early as possible.
