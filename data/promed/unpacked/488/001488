Monkey fever in Joida taluk: Villagers demand immediate supply of vaccines
---------------------------------------------------
With deaths of monkeys being reported from Avarli village in Joida taluk
and many of the villagers contracting fever, the locals have demanded
immediate supply of vaccines against the dreaded monkey fever (Kyasanur
Forest Disease, KFD). Over the past few days, incidences of deaths of
monkeys have been on the rise. One 45-year-old woman died recently at a
private hospital in Goa where she was admitted after she developed high
fever with blood discharge in the sputum. The villagers suspect that she
had contracted monkey fever. The villagers are a worried lot as vaccines
against the disease had not been supplied in adequate quantity since the
last two years. Four persons had died of the disease last year.

hemorrhagic fever in people bitten by monkey ticks. It is basically
confined to the Kyasanur Forest area of India, where vaccination has been
carried out for decades. - Mod.JW
