Alert in Herrera (Panama) for cases of equine encephalitis
----------------------------------------------------------
In the province of Herrera (Panama), the agricultural sector authorities are on alert for the presence of at least 5 suspected cases of equine encephalitis.

As reported by Ricardo Correa, the regional director of the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) in Herrera, there have been received, to date, 10 reports of suspected cases, of which half were in harmony with the symptoms of the disease, so brain samples were taken [presumably the horses had died previously to take these brain samples] and sent these to the Gorgas Institute [the Main Public Health Institute in Panama] for analysis.

On the other hand, in the province of Coclé, about 1200 horses have been vaccinated after there was an outbreak of equine encephalitis.

So far, the MIDA has confirmed the deaths of 20 horses; of these, 7 have died from eastern equine encephalitis, according to results of the Gorgas Memorial Institute, so that in Coclé and Darién (provinces) thousands of horses have been vaccinated.

MIDA says there have been no more cases of horses affected by the disease. The [prior equine] outbreak occurred in Penonomé and Nata, 2 districts of Coclé province; Penonomé is the capital of Coclé province.
