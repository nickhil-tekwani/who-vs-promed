4 persons die of hepatitis, 460 other cases reported in New Saeedabad
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to consumption of contaminated water in village Jan Muhammad
Jamali near New Saeedabad [Matiari District, Sindh], 4 people have
died, while 460 others have been diagnosed with hepatitis. The
Regional Times learnt on Monday [8 Jun 2009] that after an outbreak
of diarrhea, which killed 3 persons in village Jan Muhammad Jamali a
few days ago, the deadly disease of hepatitis has spread due to
consumption of contaminated water. In this regard, it was learnt that
4 villagers have died in a few days, while 460 other hepatitis
positive cases have also been reported.

However, health department Sindh has decided to establish an
emergency hepatitis vaccination camp in village Jan Muhammad Jamali
on Tuesday (today [9 Jun 2009]). It is worthwhile to mention that
Sindh minister for health has taken serious notice of the matter and
directed the EDO [executive district officer] Health to provide
better health facilities to the villagers. The Sindh minister for
health has also initiated an inquiry into the outbreak of hepatitis
and appointed special secretary public health as inquiry officer. The
minister also directed the inquiry officer to present a report within
3 days.

[This report does not indicate which etiological agent is involved in
this hepatitis outbreak. A 2007 report quoted Dr Sharif Ahmad Khan,
the national programme manager for prevention and control of
hepatitis, who said the percentage of hepatitis B in the country was
about 3-4 percent while those infected with hepatitis C reached 5-6
percent. "There are 5 types of hepatitis: A, B, C, D, and E."
"Hepatitis A and E occur due to consumption of unhygienic food or
contaminated water..." (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20070306.0796).
