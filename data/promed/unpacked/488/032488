Chagas disease, a protozoal infection mainly affecting people and dogs in Mexico, South America, and Central America, has been detected in a horse in Texas. Although canine cases of Chagas disease had previously been reported in southern Texas, this is the 1st known case of clinical infection in an American horse.

Caused by the organism _Trypanosoma cruzi_ and spread by the feces of insects commonly called "kissing bugs," Chagas disease may initially produce [in humans - Mod.TG] an array of vague signs, including headache, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. After the acute stage of infection, the disease enters a chronic phase. Months, years, or even decades after the initial infection, about 20 percent of humans and dogs with chronic Chagas disease develop digestive problems, neurological impairment or heart failure.

In the Texas Chagas case, the 10-year-old Quarter Horse had weakness and lameness in his hind limbs for 6 months. He had been treated for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) before being referred to the Texas A&M University Large Animal Hospital. When his condition deteriorated, he was euthanatized and a necropsy revealed evidence of _T. cruzi_ in his spinal cord. Genetic testing confirmed the identification, while other tissue tests ruled out other possible causes of neurological deficits, including EPM. No evidence of the parasite was found in the horse's heart.

The researchers concluded that the horse had contracted Chagas disease, making this the 1st equine case of the condition to have been confirmed with pathological evidence. They say that Chagas disease "should be considered as a differential diagnosis in horses with neurologic clinical signs and histologic evidence of meningomyelitis that originate in areas where Chagas disease is present." They also call for further study of the prevalence and life cycle of _T. cruzi_ in horses.

[The authors of the paper cited above concluded:
"This report represents the 1st documented incidence of clinical disease related to _T. cruzi_ infection in equids, and is the 1st histologic description of _T. cruzi_ amastigotes in the tissues of a horse. The diagnosis of Chagas disease in the horse of this report was confirmed via conventional and qPCR from FFPE [formalin-fixed paraffin embedded] tissue blocks. While the use of FFPE tissues can be problematic due to increased incidence of fixation artifacts and potential fragmentation of DNA, this report shows that FFPE tissues can be used for molecular confirmation of Chagas disease in equine tissues. In addition to retrospective analysis of archival specimens for _T. cruzi_, FFPE tissues could also be useful in determining the prevalence of Chagas disease in horses from areas that cannot process fresh tissues due to limited access to refrigeration or lack of nearby veterinary diagnostic laboratories. 3 different primer sets reported to be specific for _T. cruzi_ in samples derived from human patients were used in this report. While there is a possibility that the primer sets developed for use in people could be cross reacting with another _Trypansoma_ spp found in animals, the histopathologic morphology of the protozoa and geographic location from which the horse originated support a diagnosis of Chagas disease. The similarity of the spinal cord lesions to the more common cause of protozoal myelitis, _Sarcocystis neurona_, suggests that there is a potential for misdiagnosis and _T. cruzi_ should now be considered as a differential diagnosis in horses with similar neurologic clinical signs and lesions, especially in areas where canine Chagas disease is present. Further study to determine the prevalence of Chagas disease in horses and their role in the parasite life cycle is warranted." - Mod.AS

Since people and dogs are affected by this parasite, it is sad, but logical to think that horses, and other animals such as cats and cows could be affected. It is sadder to realize we may not have an adequate test to recognize this disease, and sadder still to realize our treatment for this condition is almost nonexistent in dogs and now in horses.

Chagas disease is caused by the vector-borne parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_, which is transmitted to animals and people by insect vectors found only in the Americas (mainly, in rural areas of Latin America where poverty is widespread). Chagas disease (_T. cruzi_ infection) is also referred to as American trypanosomiasis.

It is estimated that as many as 8 million people in Mexico, Central America, and South America have Chagas disease, most of whom do not know they are infected. If untreated, infection is lifelong and can be life-threatening.

The impact of Chagas disease is not limited to the rural areas in Latin America in which vector-borne transmission occurs. Large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas of Latin America and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution and changed the epidemiology of Chagas disease. In the United States and in other regions where Chagas disease is now found but is not endemic, control strategies should focus on preventing transmission from blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and mother-to-baby (congenital transmission).

The vector-borne protozoan parasite _T. cruzi_ causes Chagas disease in humans and dogs. The nocturnal insect vector, commonly known as the kissing bug, can transmit the parasite to hosts by biting and subsequently defecating near the site of the bite. The parasites contained in the feces of the bug infect the dog via mucous membranes or breaks in the skin. Dogs can also acquire infection by eating infected bugs. Congenital transmission is also possible.

There are no effective drugs to cure Chagas disease. Therapy directed against the organism does not alter the course of the disease in the chronic stage. Focus is on symptomatic treatment of heart failure and arrhythmias. Drug-development studies are on-going.

What is most interesting about the equine case is there were no cardiac lesions, which are most common in the dog. It can affect the neurological system in the dog, but apparently the neurological system is this parasite's 1st attack in horses. Chagas disease will now be on any differential list for neurological disease in horses. Let's hope the diagnostics are rapid to be able to provide an antemortem test for this.
