NEW ORLEANS -- At least 16 horses have died this month in south Louisiana
after becoming infected with eastern equine encephalitis, (EEE) a disease
transmitted by mosquitoes biting the horses, officials say.
The 16 cases include horses from Lafourche, Terrebonne, St. John the
Baptist, Assumption and St. Charles parishes, said Melvin Elliott, a
veterinarian with Thibodaux Animal Hospital.
Elliott said he saw 1 or 2 of the virus cases over a two-week period in
May. And he said the virus appears to be killing the animals more rapidly
than usual.It usually takes about 7 to 10 days from when the owner first
notices something wrong until the animal's death. "These are comatose in 36
hours and all but dead in 48 hours," Elliott said about the current
outbreak. "I've never seen it progress this fast."
In addition, Elliott said, this outbreak is happening much earlier in the
year than what he's seen in his 22 years as a veterinarian. The mild winter
may be to blame. "I have never seen a case before July 1," Elliott said.
There is no effective treatment once a horse contracts the virus leading to
the disease. But Elliott says a widely available and inexpensive
vaccination can prevent horses from coming down with the virus.
The disease is spread by mosquitoes to horses and humans via migratory
birds, said P.C. Roberts, a veterinarian at South Terrebonne Veterinarian
Clinic. Once infected, humans and horses are not contagious and can't
spread the disease, he said.
People can also be infected by the virus if they are bitten by one of the
virus-carrying mosquitoes that previously bit one of the infected migratory
birds. Estimates of mortality rates in humans varies from 30 percent to 50
percent, Elliot said. There have been no human cases of EEE reported this
year.
Elliott said horse owners can easily solve the problem by having their
horses vaccinated 3 times yearly. The vaccine costs about $9 per vaccination.
