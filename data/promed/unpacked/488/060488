More than 15 cattle died in Karoi last week in an anthrax outbreak amid fears the disease might have spread to humans who consumed the meat. Although no official confirmation could be immediately obtained, villagers in the affected area claimed several individuals are suspected to have contracted the deadly disease.

One of the farmers who lost livestock said villagers reported the case to the Veterinary Services Department in the district. He said officials from the department confirmed the disease when they visited the affected zones. "Over 15 cattle have died. Even people have contracted the disease since some ate the meat after the cattle died. We reported the matter to Karoi Veterinary Services, who, in turn, came with vaccines at a cost of USD 1.00 per animal. However, because of the cost, some cattle were not vaccinated, and the disease is still spreading in the area."

Veterinary Services Department director Dr Josphat Nyika said his office was yet to receive the reports. "I have not received the report yet, and the information has also not reached our Mashonaland West provincial offices," he said. "However, members of the public should know that the Veterinary Services Department does not charge for anthrax vaccines since it is funded by the government. Whenever members of the public are asked to do so, they should question and report the matter."

Dr Nyika said anthrax was mostly prevalent in the rainy season and usually affected cattle in the summer. Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease that affects animals, especially ruminants such as goats, cattle, sheep, and horses. It can also be transmitted to humans by consumption of the meat of an infected animal or their products. It is believed it does not spread from person to person.

In many parts of Zimbabwe, anthrax spores are remnants of racist Rhodesia's biological warfare on black guerillas and communities [but see comment below].

[Anthrax is common in Mashonaland West; for example: in 2005 (7 outbreaks involving cattle, 71 cases, and 88 hippopotamuses died in Kariba district), in 2007 (1 outbreak, 6 cases), in 2008 (OIE had no outbreaks reported for Mashonaland West, but ProMED reported some human cases, and the humans had to have gotten it from some sick/dead livestock. See Anthrax, human, bovine - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland West) 20080926.3045), in 2009 (4 outbreaks, 23 cases), in 2011 (1, 1), in 2012 (2, 3).

The local situation can only be made worse if the local government veterinary officers are charging USD 1.00 per dose for the otherwise free vaccine from the Veterinary Services Department. Such activities have the unfortunate side effect of reducing disease reporting, and then what reports are made come through the Health Department when there are human cases.

The claim that the Southern Rhodesian government waged biological warfare on the insurgent guerrillas is of long standing but without hard data. This claim is based on the surge in human cases during the latter fighting. But it should be kept in mind that prior to this, the number of outbreaks each year were minimal, as the disease was well controlled at the local level by the government along with tick control; the private commercial herds had zero cases thanks to rigorous vaccination. The problem was that the freedom fighters would shoot the local veterinary assistants, who thus became naturally reluctant to go out in response to villagers' calls. Without vaccination, the livestock cases increased, and, with the rural nutrition problems thanks to the fighting, villagers would butcher their dead animals. Previously, this would have been actively discouraged by their local veterinary assistants and their veterinary officers.
