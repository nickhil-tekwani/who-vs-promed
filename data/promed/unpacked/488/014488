No bluetongue yet in the Netherlands
------------------------------------
The results of the test of a young bull from a farm in Aalten
(Gelderland) appears to be "false positive." This means that no case
of bluetongue [BT] has been confirmed yet in the Netherlands during
2009.

Last week [week of 13-17 Jul 2009], the Ministry of Agriculture,
Nature and Food Quality (LNV) declared that BT was encountered in
Aalten, just its serotyping yet to be carried out. While checking for
the serotype, BT could not be found. New samples were obtained last
week from the bull as well as from his mother. Both have been tested,
and both found not infected.

A false positive result is a rarity but cannot be ever excluded.
