A total of 16 cases of encephalitis in the region of Macedonia were in fact
due to West Nile virus confirmed by [a report in] by the head of
the reference laboratory. The virus was detected in samples including 2 of
3 elderly patients (a woman and a 79 year old man) who died recently in
Thessaloniki. A stored sample from the third patient was not available,
said Anna Pappas, associate professor of Microbiology at the Medical
Faculty of the Aristotle University and head of the arboviruses reference
laboratory.

The laboratory headed by Dr Pappas diagnosed the virus. Detection is done
by serology. "The facts actually meet the laboratory and clinical criteria
for the disease," she said on Monday [9 Aug 2010]. There was only one
negative sample out of 17 sent to the laboratory on Thursday [5 Aug 2010],
she said.

The Specific Diseases Hospital of Thessaloniki hospital on Monday admitted
the 12th person with symptoms of encephalitis, one of whom was in a serious
condition. All 3 patients who died recently were elderly and at least one
of them (the 79 year old who died on Friday) had a complicated medical history.

Laboratory investigations to identify the virus were found when increasing
occurrence of encephalitis and viral meningitis occurred in central
Macedonia in the last 40 days, compared with last year [2009].

On Monday [9 Aug 2010] a meeting was held in the prefecture of Imathia for
mosquito control and discussed the expansion of this year's programming for
insecticide application. On the same issue, there is scheduled for Tuesday
[10 Aug 2010] a county meeting with the participation of mayors and county
stakeholders.

West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and
usually causes mild or no symptoms. Less than 1 per cent of patients
develop severe clinical disease.

[The confirmation of the West Nile virus etiology came quickly for these
cases. It would be of interest to know the serological tests used, as
flaviviruses are notoriously cross-reactive serologically.
