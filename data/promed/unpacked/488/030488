The Measles Treatment Centre (MTC) in the health district saw a 19 percent mortality during the 1st week, particularly in children with co-infections. Although that number has dropped, Massing says it's still very high.

MSF in the area has been instrumental in vaccinating children, treating patients and just trying to get the epidemic under control. According to the World Health Organization, 700 000 children in DRC are not vaccinated against measles, the 6th highest country globally.

In a follow-up to a report in 2014 of a measles outbreak in Katanga, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), officials with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) say this year's outbreak is the worst since 2011.

"Measles is practically endemic in Katanga. A significant increase in cases was observed at the beginning of March 2015, mainly in the Malemba Nkulu health zone", according to Dr Louis Albert Massing, MSF's medical coordinator in DRC. Massing notes that the health zone is seeing hundreds of newly confirmed measles cases on a weekly basis, and occasionally the weekly case count would top 1000.

The Ministry of Health reports that the Public Health Institute (ISP) confirmed the 4th case of measles in the country. This is a man 44 years old, a resident in the municipality of Las Condes in the Metropolitan Region, who is hospitalized without a life-threatening [condition] and has a favorable clinical evaluation. SEREMI Metropolitan proceeded to vaccinate the man's family and is conducting epidemiological research to establish and manage possible contacts.

Chile has a long history in the control of measles. Along with the USA it was one of 3 countries that started mass vaccination of the population in 1964. The last case of indigenous measles was reported in 1992, and in 2002 Chile was declared free of virus circulation by PAHO. In 2014 the WHO certified the eradication of the disease.

In 1997, 1999 and 2011 there were known outbreaks of the disease, some with dozens of cases. These outbreaks were controlled through vaccination of contacts of each case detected.

Measles is controlled by maintaining vaccine coverage close to 100 percent in children. Chileans who were born between 1971 and 1981, traveling to high-risk areas, should be vaccinated [and be ready to present vaccination proof], if the destination is 1 of the countries where the disease occurs. This is a Healthmap eyewitness report.

A person typically develops symptoms of measles 7-21 days after exposure to the virus. The infection usually begins with a mild to moderate fever accompanied by a cough, runny nose and red eyes. 2-3 days later, the fever spikes and the red, blotchy rash appears, the health department said. Those infected with measles can spread the virus up to 4 days before and after the onset of the rash, McLaughlin said.

Health officials have listed the following Fairbanks places where the man traveled while infectious (all in 2015):

- 31 May: Fairbanks International Airport and Walmart
- 31 May- 7 Jun: University of Alaska Fairbanks
- 2 Jun: Fred Meyer West-- 4 Jun: Fred Meyer East, Home Depot, Walgreens East and Avis Rent-a-Car
- 5 Jun: Social Security Office at the Fairbanks Federal Building, Old Navy and Famous Footwear
- 6 Jun: Emergency department at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital

McLaughlin said anyone present at those locations on those days should 1st check their vaccination history. "If they aren't up to date, they should become up to date as soon as possible," he said.The health department is asking people not immune to measles to stay away from hospitals, nursing homes and large gatherings during the 7-21-day span after the possible exposure.

In April 2000, the state health department confirmed Alaska's previous measles case in a 33-year-old Anchorage woman. A school-based outbreak occurred in Anchorage in 1998 that infected 33 people, mostly children, according to the state health department. In 1996, the department confirmed 63 cases of measles in Juneau after 4 children and a teacher at an elementary school were infected. It largely spread through school contact.

McLaughlin reported that a nonimmune person who comes in contact with measles has a 90 percent chance of becoming infected. He said the infected man in Fairbanks reported he had gotten the MMR vaccine, but there was no verification that he had. On Tues 9 Jun 2015, McLaughlin said the man was no longer infectious and remained at his home in Fairbanks.

The health department recommends children receive the 1st dose of the MMR vaccine at age 1 and the 2nd dose starting at age 4. Women should not get the vaccine during pregnancy, McLaughlin said.

The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services on Tuesday 9 Jun 2015 confirmed the state's 1st measles case since 2000 and urged Alaskans to review and update their vaccinations. Health officials say a middle-aged Fairbanks man likely contracted measles while traveling in Mongolia. He left Mongolia on 29 May 2015 and traveled through Seoul, South Korea, said Dr. Joe McLaughlin, chief of the Alaska Section of Epidemiology.

The man then spent a night and most of 30 May 2015 in Seattle before leaving for Alaska on a 9 p.m. flight. His flight landed in Fairbanks at 12:30 a.m. 21 May 2015 and did not stop in Anchorage, McLaughlin said. Several days after arriving in Fairbanks, the man developed a rash. On Tues 9 Jun 2015, laboratory tests confirmed he had measles, McLaughlin said.

The state health department warned Tuesday that those who have not received the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or those who have not previously had measles could be at risk of infection if they were at any of the locations the man visited 31 May -- 6 Jun 2015. "It's among the most contagious infectious diseases on the planet," McLaughlin said. It spreads "very easily" by air and by direct contact, the state health department said.

Review (WHO)
------
In 2013, the 66th session of the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region* adopted the goal of measles elimination and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control by 2020 after rigorous prior consultations. The recommended strategies include 1) achieving and maintaining at least 95 percent coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine in every district through routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs); (2) developing and sustaining a sensitive and timely case-based measles surveillance system that meets recommended performance indicators; 3) developing and maintaining an accredited measles laboratory network; and 4) achieving timely identification, investigation, and response to measles outbreaks. This report updates previous reports and summarizes progress toward measles elimination in the South-East Asia Region during 2003-2013.

Within the region, coverage with the 1st dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) increased from 67 to 78 percent; an estimated 286 million children (95 percent of the target population) were vaccinated in SIAs; measles incidence decreased 73 percent, from 59 to 16 cases per million population; and estimated measles deaths decreased 63 percent. To achieve measles elimination in the region, additional efforts are needed in countries with under 95 percent 2-dose routine MCV coverage, particularly in India and Indonesia, to strengthen routine immunization services, conduct periodic high-quality SIAs, and strengthen measles case-based surveillance and laboratory diagnosis of measles.

Immunization Activities
-----------
MCV1 was introduced in all 11 countries in the South-East Asia region before 2003. During 2003-2013, MCV1 was administered at age 9 months in all countries except Sri Lanka, where the age of administration was increased from 9 to 12 months in 2011. During 2003-2013, the number of countries in the region with a routine second dose of MCV (MCV2) increased from 2 to 9. The recommended age for administration for MCV2 varied by country and ranged from 15 months to 7 years. Countries report national and subnational coverage with MCV1 and MCV2 delivered through the routine immunization program to WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which use data from administrative records (vaccine doses administered divided by the target population) and surveys reported by member states each year to estimate MCV1 and MCV2 coverage. Estimated MCV1 coverage increased in the region from 67 percent in 2003 to 78 percent in 2013; 4 countries reported at least 95 percent MCV1 coverage nationwide and in all districts in 2013 (Data tabulated in the accompanying text.

Estimated MCV2 coverage increased from 6 percent in 2003 to 53 percent in 2013; in 2013, estimated MCV2 coverage in 3 countries was at least 95 percent. During 2003-2013, measles SIAs were conducted in all countries except Thailand and reached 286 million children (95 percent of target population) (Data tabulated in the original text). Of the 39 SIAs, 16 (41 percent) achieved at least 95 percent administrative coverage.

Surveillance Activities
-----------
By 2013, measles surveillance with laboratory confirmation of suspected cases was implemented in all countries in the region. Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar reported case-based measles surveillance data monthly to the WHO South-East Asia Regional Office, whereas other countries in the region reported aggregate measles surveillance data monthly. 5 countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Nepal) used the WHO-supported network of surveillance medical officers initially established for polio eradication to conduct measles surveillance . A measles-rubella laboratory network was established in the region by 2003, as an integral part of the WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network. By 2013, this regional laboratory network had expanded to include 34 proficient laboratories** with 1 regional reference laboratory in Thailand. All countries in the region except Timor-Leste had at least 1 proficient laboratory, including India (9 laboratories), Indonesia (4), and Thailand (13). In addition, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand had also started sentinel surveillance for congenital rubella syndrome.

During 2003-2013, a total of 5680 suspected measles outbreaks were reported in countries in the region, 5166 (91 percent) of which were fully investigated.†† Among those investigated, 2530 (49 percent) were laboratory-confirmed measles outbreaks, 1437 (28 percent) were laboratory-confirmed rubella outbreaks, and 532 (10 percent) were laboratory-confirmed mixed measles and rubella outbreaks.

Measles Incidence and Measles Virus Genotypes
-------------------
From 2003 to 2013, annual measles incidence in the region decreased 73 percent, from 59 to 16 cases per million population. 5 countries reported measles incidence of fewer than 5 cases per million in 2013, including 3 (Bhutan, North Korea, and Maldives) that reported 0 cases. In 2013, a total of 248 laboratory-confirmed measles outbreaks and 14 laboratory-confirmed mixed measles and rubella outbreaks were reported in the region. A total of 10 108 confirmed measles cases (laboratory-confirmed and epidemiologically linked) were reported in these outbreaks. The largest proportion of cases (35 percent) occurred in children aged 1-4 years, followed by children aged 5-9 years (30 percent), children aged under 1 year and persons aged at least 15 years (13 percent each), and children aged 10-14 years (9 percent). Of these cases, 68 percent were in unvaccinated persons. The highest percentage of unvaccinated persons (87 percent) was in the under 1-year age group, followed by the at least 15 years (82 perent), 10-14 years (71 percent), 5-9 years (62 percent) and 1-4 years (61 percent) age groups.

During 2003-2013, among isolates from patients, measles virus genotypes detected and reported in the region included D4, D7, and D8 in India; D8, D9, G2, and G3 in Indonesia; D5 in Maldives: D5 and D9 in Myanmar; D4 and D8 in Nepal; D8 in Sri Lanka; and D5, D8, D9, and G2 in Thailand.

Discussion
-------
During 2003-2013, substantial progress was made toward measles control in the South-East Asia Region: through implementation of the regional measles mortality reduction strategies, measles incidence decreased 73 percent and estimated measles deaths decreased 63 percent. By 2008, the goal of reducing measles-related deaths by 90 percent by 2010 from the 2000 baseline was achieved by all countries in the region except India. After increases in MCV1 and MCV2 coverage and implementation of SIAs, Bhutan, North Korea, and Maldives reported no laboratory-confirmed measles cases in 2013 and might have interrupted endemic measles virus transmission. This apparent success will only be confirmed once the regional verification commission is established and a formal evaluation is conducted, but it indicates that measles elimination in this region is feasible when the current tools and strategies are optimally implemented.

In September 2013, after an extensive review of the progress made and the biologic, programmatic, and financial feasibility of measles and rubella elimination, the 66th session of the Regional Committee of the South-East Asia Region adopted the goal of measles elimination and rubella/congenital rubella syndrome control in the South-East Asia Region by 2020, resulting in all 6 WHO regions now having a measles elimination goal.

However, challenges exist to achieving measles elimination in the South-East Asia Region. In 2013, routine MCV1 coverage was under 95 percent nationally for 7 of the 11 countries in the region. Of the estimated 21.5 million infants worldwide who did not receive MCV1, almost 1/3 were in India (6.4 million) and Indonesia (0.7 million). In addition, more than half of the SIAs implemented in the region during 2003-2013 did not achieve the target of at least 95 percent coverage.

During 2003-2013, estimated coverage with the 1st and 2nd doses of measles-containing vaccine increased from 67 to 78 percent and from 6 to 53 percent, respectively, and measles SIAs reached 286 million children. Measles incidence declined by 73 percent, and estimated measles deaths decreased by 63 percent. The region adopted the goals of measles elimination and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control by 2020. All countries in the region conduct some form of case-based measles surveillance, and some countries have implemented sentinel surveillance for congenital rubella syndrome.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First, vaccination coverage estimates are derived from administrative data and can be inaccurate because of errors in estimates of target populations or errors in recording doses administered. 2nd, surveillance data might significantly underestimate actual disease incidence, because not all patients seek care, and not all those who seek care are reported. However, the data on coverage, incidence, and estimated deaths all indicate that measles-associated morbidity and mortality declined considerably in this region during 2003-2013.

The adoption of a measles elimination goal in the South-East Asia Region is an opportunity to reenergize efforts and maintain momentum in the region to 1) strengthen routine immunization and achieve at least 95 percent coverage with MCV2; 2) optimize the timing of MCV1 and MCV2 doses, based on measles epidemiology in each country; 3) conduct high-quality SIAs; 4) enhance surveillance and build on existing laboratory networks to perform case-based surveillance; and 5) seek opportunities to collaborate with other programs, including use of the measles elimination platform to integrate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control efforts.

As of 2015, all 11 countries in the South-East Asia Region had either developed or were drafting national plans based on the strategies outlined in the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan and the Regional Committee resolution (1,10). With 35 million surviving infants in the region (26 percent of the global total), the measles elimination goal is a significant opportunity to further decrease measles-related deaths and illness globally by 2020.

The director of the infectious diseases department at Austine Hospital, Professor Lindsay Grayson, says measles cases put a huge strain on medical resources and could be avoided through vaccination. The number of people being diagnosed with measles in Australia hit a 16-year-high in 2014, as scores of travellers brought the potentially fatal disease into the country and unvaccinated children fell victim to it.

Health department data shows a total of 340 measles cases were recorded in Australia during [2014], the highest number since 1998. The rate of measles cases also peaked in 2014, with about 15 cases for every million people in Australia.

Australia's measles vaccination program has seen the incidence of the disease fall since the 1990s. While numbers are a fraction of those recorded in the1990s, National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System figures show there were just 10 cases in 2005, the best year on record.

Robert Booy, of the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said many of 2014's cases were from unvaccinated people who had been infected overseas then returned to Australia. In the early 1990s, there were up to 4500 measles cases a year, but numbers steadily fell in the following decade. Professor Booy said the drop in cases was thanks to Australia's measles vaccination program, which provides 2 vaccine shots before a child reaches school age.

A spokeswoman for the federal Department of Health said there were 140 imported cases of measles in 2014, which had led to a further 115 infections. "These cases were mainly associated with outbreaks occurring in the Philippines and Indonesia at the time," she said. Professor Booy said the disease did not tend to spread beyond 3 people in such cases, because more than 90 per cent of Australia's population was vaccinated, but there were pockets of lower immunity.

Brunswick has Melbourne's lowest vaccination rate for 5-year-old children, with 8.5 per cent not fully immunised. In 2014, there were 62 cases of measles in children under the age of 5 nationwide, the highest number since 1999.

Professor Grayson said a handful of measles cases had presented at Melbourne's Austin Hospital in the past year, including refugee families who had missed out on vaccinations. But he said most cases were "Australians who did not want to have their kids vaccinated". He said each measles case dealt with at the hospital's emergency department put considerable strain on resources, with the patient with measles having to spend time in an isolated unit. About 100 to 150 people potentially exposed in the hospital's waiting room also had to be monitored, while nurses had to contact friends and relatives of the infected person and carry out blood tests to assess infection risks.

So far in 2015, there have been 40 measles cases, including that of an unvaccinated Brisbane paramedic, who potentially exposed 4500 people to the disease, which has led to calls for all health staff to be vaccinated. The Victorian branches of the paramedics' and nurses' unions have resisted such calls, acknowledging the importance of immunisation, but saying staff should not be discriminated against for choosing not to be vaccinated.

["...paramedics' and nurses' unions have resisted such calls, acknowledging the importance of immunisation, but saying staff should not be discriminated against for choosing not to be vaccinated." Strange reasoning -- health staff who don`t believe in vaccination? Therefore more likely to catch measles at work and spread it to the public? What happened to "First, do no harm"? - Mod.JW]

Hundreds of staff and visitors to Palmerston North Hospital may have been exposed to infection after a possible measles outbreak. MidCentral District Health Board medical officer of health Rob Weir said on Monday a 3rd case of the measles during June 2015 had been confirmed at the hospital and there was concern over the source. He said there was no connection between this case and the 2 previous cases.

The person infected with measles had been moved to several areas of the hospital over a 4-day period and staff and visitors in these areas may have been in contact with the infection, Weir said. The areas include [all in 2015]:

- Palmerston North emergency department from 8.30pm on 31 May to 3.15am on 1 Jun.
- Medical assessment and planning unit (MAPU) or ward 27, Palmerston North Hospital, between 1.15am to 4pm on 1 Jun.
- Ward 26, Palmerston North Hospital between 2pm, 1 Jun and 5pm on 3 Jun.

Weir said measles was a very infectious disease so anyone who was not immune to measles was at risk if they came into contact with the disease.

Those likely to be immune are anyone born before 1969, anyone who is up-to-date with their measles vaccination for their age and anyone who has been diagnosed previously with measles. "It spreads from person to person through the air from breathing, coughing and sneezing, and contact with those secretions," Weir said. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough and sore red eyes. After 3-5 days a rash appears on the head and spreads down the body. "The disease is contagious from just before symptoms begin until about 5 days after onset of the rash. The illness usually starts between 10 and 14 days after contact with the measles virus but can be seven to 18 days after
contact."

A case of measles identified in Manawatu during May 2015 was traced to a guest who stayed at Auckland's SkyCity Hotel during the annual Firefighter SkyTower Stair Challenge leading to fears other guests may have been infected.

MidCentral's 1st measles case since 2011 was confirmed at the beginning of May 2015. Weir said for every 1000 cases of measles, about 100 would need hospital treatment, 100 would develop an ear infection and 50 would progress to pneumonia. "These cases provide a reminder about how important vaccination is. Knowing that you are fully up to date for age with your MMR vaccination will avoid the need for isolation if you are in contact with a person with measles and if you are uncertain about your vaccination status I would suggest contacting your GP to investigate further.
