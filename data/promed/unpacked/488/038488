The death toll from the cholera outbreak in war-ravaged Yemen has increased to 1759 since the end of April 2017, the WHO said on its official twitter account on Friday, 14 Jul 2017.

The suspected cases have increased to more than 332 600 as the epidemic has hit 21 out of the 23 provinces in the country, WHO said. The death toll has increased by 53 and suspected cases by nearly 35 162 in just 5 days after a 9 Jul 2017 report by WHO, where it put the death toll at 1706 and suspected cases at 297 438.

Since 27 Apr 2017, the cholera cases in Yemen have been "increasing at an average of 5000 a day," said WHO in its last week report. "We are now facing the worst cholera outbreak in the world." On Tuesday, 11 Jul 2017, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick said in a press conference that the cholera outbreak is "entirely man-made as a result of the conflict." He noted that the UN's response failed to keep pace with the cholera spread mainly because it "did not have enough resources to expand their operations into areas, where health workers were working without pay."

"Unless the international community contributes USD 200 million to address the cholera outbreak in Yemen, the UN aid agencies will be forced to reprogram more resources tagged for malnutrition in the country," McGoldrick said.

Meanwhile, WHO said it's considering shelving the shipment of cholera vaccines to Yemen. "A vaccination way ahead of an outbreak would be useful, but that would imply a huge amount of vaccines, taking into account all the countries where cholera was endemic," WHO Spokesman Christian Lindmeier was quoted as saying.

Fewer than 45 percent of the country's hospitals are operational, but even the operational ones are coping with huge challenges, especially the lack of medications, medical equipment and staff. The blockade on Yemen, as part of a Saudi-led bombing campaign launched in March 2015, has deepened the crisis in the country, which used to import most of its basic needs.
