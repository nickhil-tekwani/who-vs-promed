9 cases of chikungunya virus were discovered in Karachi [Sindh province] on Tuesday [17 Jan 2017]. Patients have been admitted in Saudabad hospital for treatment, reported 24 News.

According to reports, chikungunya virus was 1st diagnosed in a patient 2 months ago [November 2016] and since then, the disease has spread in certain parts of the city. Blood samples of 11 patients were sent to the Islamabad National Institute of Health earlier. 11 results came positive while 2 came negative.

In the initial inquiry into the disease, it was found that hospitals in Karachi did not have appropriate kits to diagnose the disease. 250 kits were bought in Indus Hospital Karachi later to deal with the situation. Hospital MS has said blood samples from Karachi Indus hospital patients are sent weekly to Islamabad to ensure that there is difficulty [sic] in treating patients.
