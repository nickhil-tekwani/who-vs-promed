[Switzerland obtained its status as a country officially free of bovine tuberculosis in 1960. Since 1980, the control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has been reduced to passive abattoir surveillance, in line with OIE's requirements as specified in chapter 11.6 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.6.htm).

Isolated cases of bTB, partly due to reactivation of human _Mycobacterium bovis_ infections with subsequent transmission to cattle, have been noticed in Switzerland during the years. Other possible sources of infection (but not necessarily in Switzerland) may be wildlife and introduced traded animals which had not undergone testing prior to transportation, particularly from other countries where bTB incidence is higher, even if such countries have, so far, managed to maintain their status as "officially free," since "_M. bovis_ infection was not present in at least 99.8 per cent of the herds and 99.9 per cent of the cattle for 5 consecutive years."
