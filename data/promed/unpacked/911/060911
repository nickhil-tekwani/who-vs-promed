Epizootic hemorrhagic disease in cattle, Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is a fatal disease of deer, which
leads to bluetongue-like illness in cattle. This is the 1st report of
an outbreak of EHD virus infection in adult cattle in Turkey.

41 dairy cattle (Holstein and Brown Swiss) were suspected to have EHD
on the basis of clinical investigation between early July and the last
week of August 2007 in several cities on the western part of Turkey.

The most important clinical signs were stomatitis, swelling of
eyelids, respiratory distress, nasal-ocular discharges, hyperemia,
and scaling of the muzzle and lips, lameness and udder erythema.
Clinical laboratory findings were non-specific. All the submitted
samples gave negative results for bluetongue. Laboratory tests of
samples originating from the Mugla and Canakkale provinces were
indicative of EHDV etiology; their details, and full description of
the observations, are included in a paper submitted for publication.

[We are very grateful to Dr Temizel for his kind and generous
agreement to share with us the valuable data above at this stage in
time. This, in view of the approaching activity season of orbivirus
vectors (culicoids); EHDV is an orbivirus, known to be transmitted by
culicoids. The current reporting of such observations, in western
Turkey, will allow relevant parties, particularly in the eastern
Mediterranean region, to enhance their surveillance efforts and
preparedness in a timely manner.

An administrative map of Turkey is available at:


EHD has become an internationally significant emerging disease of
cattle with high morbidity rates, following its reporting, during
2006, for the 1st time from 4 Mediterranean countries. Three of the
countries were North African (Maghreb): Morocco (147 foci, 28 Jul-2
Nov 2006), Algeria (7 foci, 19 Jul-10 Nov 2006), and Tunisia (24
foci, 3 Sep-15 Nov 2006). During the same period but some 2000 km
(1243 mi) eastwards, a similar disease affected dairy cattle in
Israel, where 112 foci were reported between 28 Aug and 17 Dec 2006;
see map at:
<http://www.biblestudy.org/maps/eurmedd.gif>.

The epizootic in the 3 Maghreb countries was determined, by the IAH
(Institute for Animal Health) laboratory at Pirbright, UK, to be caused
by EHDV serotype 9, and in Israel by EHDV-7. For data on the
serotypes above as well as about the other 7 globally known EHDV
serotypes, subscribers are referred to the page "Isolates of
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) in the dsRNA virus
collection at IAH Pirbright", available at:
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//ReoID/EHDV-isolates.htm>.

EHDV, becoming an emerging animal disease, has been added -- last
week -- to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) disease
list (multiple species category).

Descriptions of the recent clinical cases in cattle, including
pictures, can be seen at the following Israeli websites:

Israel. Israel Journal of Veterinary Medicine 2007; 62(1)
<http://www.isrvma.org/article/62_1_5.htm>.

The clinical signs described by Dr Temizel are highly suggestive of
EHD, as seen in the other Mediterranean countries; its spread along
the Aegean Coast (western Turkey) deserves attention within the
region.

We are anticipating with great interest the publication of the
Turkish paper, including laboratory test results. Results from
reference laboratory(ies), if available, in particular if addressing
serotyping and genotyping, are requested. - Mod.AS]
