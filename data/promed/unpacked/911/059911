From: Peter Smith <pjsmith1@gte.net>

The question was asked why reduced rainfall would increase the amount of
infection. This question could have two possible answers. First off, the
reduction in rainfall levels would lower the number of possible places
people had to swim, and would increase the probability of coming into
contact with an infected source. The other reason, is that the reduced
rainfall is lowering water levels and creates a more concentrated level of
leptospirosis in the water.

[Peter's reasons are, of course, logical -- just as rain will dilute and
flush away collections of leptospires -- but is there any reliable field
data out there? My suspicion is that there has been minimal recent research
on the relationship &/or association of leptospirosis to weather and/or
climate. LP Smith (1970) refers to two meteorological studies in "Weather &
Animal Disease", WMO Tech Note #113, p15. One in the Netherlands (not
referenced) and the other in Berkshire by a veterinary student, who was
doing his diagnostic lab precepteeship at the Reading VIC ... Stopforth A,
1969, "Leptospirosis in an Ayrshire herd", Veterinary Record, 84 (23):590
... who noted "a close relationship with soil moisture deficit, and
suggested that this had to be maintained at a relatively low level (less
than 4.5cm deficit) for some 9-12 day before an attack" of bovine
leptospirosis. Anyone with information on more recent studies is welcome to
share them with us. - Mod.MHJ .....................................mhj/es
