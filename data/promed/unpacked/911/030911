Adrar Health: the unknown fever in Amogjar continues to kill
----------------------------------------------------------
A 3rd victim died this morning [3 Nov 2010]. He was the brother of
the 2 sisters who died the day before yesterday [1 Nov 2010] from a
particular fever.

After registration of the of new cases, who arrived yesterday [2 Nov
2010] and this morning [3 Nov 2010] at the hospital in Atar, which is
near the DRASS [Regional Directorate for Health and Social Action],
the Regional Health Director himself, went immediately to the
location of the drama.

This fatal fever, which is characterized by joint pain, vomiting, and
elevated temperature, suddenly raged on Sunday [31 Oct 2010] in an
encampment near Amogjar.

Despite an autopsy done on one of the girls who died on the 1st day
and examination of other victims, the doctors are dumbfounded by this
disease, which they have not as yet identified. The population of
Atar has begun to worry.

Deaths of 2 women in Adrar, following a mysterious illness
----------------------------------------------------------
The correspondent of the AMI [Mauritanian Information Agency], in the
wilaya [region] of Adrar, quoting several sources in agreement,
reported on the deaths of 2 women following an unknown illness, which
occurred 2 days ago [1 Nov 2010] in Agjett, a locality belonging to
the Tawaz commune (45 km [28 mi] to the east of Atar town).

The correspondent also indicated that 2 members of the same family
are still under medical supervision in hospital in Atar, stating that
their health has improved, according to the treating doctor.

The deaths of the 2 women coincided with the death of camels in the
same area. The veterinary services of the province could not, so far,
determine the cause of these strange deaths.

Some citizens expressed concern that these deaths are due to
consumption of contaminated meat.

Such a hypothesis however has been rejected by the local authorities
who have stated that this may be malaria affecting individuals who
are physically weak, noting that neighbors of the victims who ate the
same meat, are healthy.

The authorities also noted that the women died a week after consuming
the "suspicious" meat.

According to a report by a veterinary mission that visited the
affected site in recent days, "no general symptom has occurred in the
animals" in this region.

The report concluded that it is impossible to confirm the existence
of a disease, without the detection of specific symptoms and
conducting tests on samples taken from animals exhibiting these signs.

These same services have also mentioned cases of deaths in camels in
other moughataas [departments] of the region, which they believe
requires intensified surveillance measures against the contagious
animal diseases.

The correspondent of the AMI in the region also reported that the
Wali [governor] of Adrar, Mr Saidou Sall, in a statement made Monday
[1 Nov 2010] in Atar, indicated "that the victims died after
suffering from fever and muscle pain."

The governor has also vigorously denied the news relayed by some
sites claiming that the cause of the deaths was food poisoning
resulting from the consumption of meat from camels affected by a
rapidly spreading epidemic in that region, stating that "to speak of
the existence of such a pandemic in animals is baseless."

The governor concluded by saying that, "to talk of the deaths of 40
camels is totally false, because the veterinary mission that was
dispatched to the area, has only found the corpse of only one camel."

[The 2 newswires above mention that the clinical presentation of
these cases has been one of high fever, arthralgia (joint pains), and
vomiting. Locally, there are numerous hypotheses being proposed for
the possible etiology of these deaths and illnesses, including
malaria, and an association with the consumption of camel meat, with
rumors that there may have been a camel die-off in the area where the
fatalities resided. As with many as yet undiagnosed outbreaks
associated with high fatalities, newswire reports often present
conflicting pieces of information reflecting a level of panic and
concern among the population and a health sector that is trying to
reassure the population. This appears to be the case where there are
rumors of a camel die-off, consumption of camel meat that is
suspected to be contaminated, and results of a field trip that
theoretically identified only one camel death in the area.

Just looking at the reported symptoms, high fever, arthralgia, and
vomiting, with an observed high case fatality rate, the differential
diagnosis would be a lengthy list of diseases including those of
viral, bacterial, and parasitic etiologies, and including diseases
that are known zoonotic as well as those not known to be zoonotic.

The rumors surrounding a possible concurrent camel die off in the
area combined with a history of consumption of camel meat increases
the temptation to put known zoonotic diseases higher on the
differential diagnosis (this presumes a probable contact with the raw
meat and blood of animals who may have been infected with viral
agents such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley
fever). But it is possible that these cases are not related to
possible diseases in the camels in the area.

It should be noted that the Adrar region (province) of Mauritania is
in the Saharan desert (the majority of the country is located in
desert and semiarid regions), with migratory populations that live in
encampments near water sources. From the above given information, it
sounds as though this outbreak is occurring in one such encampment.
While rain is scarce in this region, sudden deluges do occur. Keeping
that in mind, another disease that comes to mind with the
presentation of arthralgias, vomiting, and fever is leptospirosis.

One can keep discussing the factors in favor of one or more of the
possible etiologic agents, but at this point it seems prudent to
await further information from knowledgeable sources in the region on
results of laboratory studies conducted on the hospitalized cases.
