Twenty-two people suspected of being infected with Congo-Crimean
hemorrhagic fever virus have been hospitalized in the Stavropol region.
Since April, the number of people who developed the hazardous disease has
grown 3 fold, the Health Ministry of the Stavropol region reported.
According to reports released by the ministry, in April, cases of
hemorrhagic fever were registered in 3 districts of the Stavropol region,
while in May fever cases have been reported in 9 more districts. The
results of a medical examination of each of the patients have confirmed
that the main source of the infection are ticks, which have become
increasingly active due to favorable weather conditions in the Stavropol
region now.

[It is not possible by physical examination of the patient to determine
that the source of infection is ticks. Even if the patient has ticks
attached to him or her, the tick must be tested for virus. Simple
determination of the infectious agent (by proper serodiagnosis, virus
isolation, PCR, etc.) can provide all the etiologic information one would
need. Given that C-CHF virus infections have been treated successfully
with ribavirin, a rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical. There has been
no mention of the use of ribavirin to treat these patients. Perhaps it is
not available in Stavropol? - Mod.CHC
