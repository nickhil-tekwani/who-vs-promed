Confirmed screwworm larvae was collected from a domestic cat in Miami,
Florida.

The following is a calendar of events that led up to the screwworm
confirmation:
13 Dec 2000 - A U.S. military employee arrived in Miami, Florida with a
pet cat. The military employee and cat traveled here from Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.
14 Dec 2000 - The cat was brought to a private practitioner where one larva
was removed from an abscess on the cat.
15 Dec 2000 - The private practitioner contacted the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. NVSL told the private
practitioner to hold the larva because Iowa was in the middle of a
blizzard.
18 Dec 2000 - The private practitioner shipped the larva to NVSL.
19 Dec 2000 - NVSL confirmed that the larva was a mature 3rd instar larva.
Emergency Programs was informed by a U.S. military veterinarian in Cuba
that the cat had been treated for 5 consecutive days with ivermectin.
Throughout the treatment the veterinarian removed several dead larvae from
the wound, which was healing over. For these reasons, the veterinarian
felt that it was safe to sign the export health certificate.
Emergency Programs is working on confirming if the larva removed was alive
or dead.
Dave Wilson, Senior Staff Veterinarian, VS Emergency Programs, is incident
commander for this situation.
