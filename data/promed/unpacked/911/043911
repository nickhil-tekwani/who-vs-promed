Fowl Plague in Meeuwen - Gruitrode confirmed
--------------------------------------
Laboratory tests have confirmed the focus of "classical fowl plague"
[Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza -- HPAI] in Meeuwen - Gruitrode.
No new control measures are necessary, since the initial measures were
adopted while assuming that the seriously suspected case was, in fact, HPAI.
In the absence of new developments , the AFSCA/FAVV expects some
alleviation of measures to be possible after this weekend, enabling the
renewal of poultry slaughter liable to strict requirements. The transport
of other animal species and of table-eggs might also be allowed. The exact
instructions are to be found on the agency's web-site as of Sunday, 20 Apr
2003, evening <http://www.favv.be>.
Rapid PCR tests, carried out on poultry from the 8 depopulated farms around
the infected focus, were found negative.

[A Reuters posting of 19 Apr 2003, citing a Ministry spokesman, reports:
"A second outbreak of HPAI may have hit Belgium. The spokesman said the
second suspected outbreak was in an area near the first affected farm, and
had already been sealed off. He did not indicate the exact location".
