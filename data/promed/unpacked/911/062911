Authorities from Uman Municipality declared a sanitary alert for its inhabitants after an outbreak of hepatitis A affecting nearly 150 persons, most of them children and adolescents.

Dr. Justo Sierra-Paredes, Director of Health and Ecology, declared that the greatest incidence of this condition has been recorded in Poxila, Bolon, and Tanil communities, and for this reason, 75 patients were taken under care in the Mexican Social Security (IMSS, according to its Spanish initials) healthcare facilities, 45 in the health center, and 30 in the municipality health center.

The officer pointed out that, according to the investigations carried out to find the source of this viral infection, they detected that one vendor who sells food in the streets of Tanil, specifically at the entrance of a school, is infected with the hepatitis A virus. And since the vendor has poor hygiene practices when manipulating food, including lack of proper hand washing, the infection has spread.

Consequently, Dr. Sierra-Paredes announced that strict measures have been taken in order to prevent transmission of this disease. Personnel from the municipality visited schools in order to clean water tanks and disinfect and chlorinate tap water. He also stated that his office had requested parents not to send their children to school in order to prevent dissemination of the virus, and he also requested the population not to eat foods sold in the streets outside schools.

[Although hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease, the expense of purchasing and deploying the vaccine makes it not a feasible option for disease control until basic standards of hygiene have been achieved by education and public health measures. Fortunately, hepatitis A virus infection, unlike hepatitis B and C infection, does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal. However, hepatitis A virus infection can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis, which may have fatal outcomes. Therefore, eradication of hepatitis A virus infection demands a high public health priority. - Mod.CP
