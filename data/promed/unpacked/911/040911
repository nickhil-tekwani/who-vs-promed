Sequim FFA cow felled by rare disease
-------------------------------------
The death of Momma Cow, a champion Angus cow raised by Sequim High
School students, was both shocking and unprecedented, said
agricultural science teacher Derrell Sharp. Her memory lives on in
the hearts of the 15 students who continue to care for her only
surviving calf. "The kids were heartbroken," Sharp said Friday [23 Jan
2009] during a break between classes with his Future Farmers of
America (FFA) students. He added that no other FFA animal has died in
his 13 years at the school.

Momma Cow died [20 Nov 2008] at the Sequim High farm after catching a
rare disease known as MCF -- malignant catarrhal fever -- at the
Puyallup Fair in September [2008]. She was 2 years old and pregnant,
and collapsed in front of FFA para-educator Corrinne Dennis and a
group of students.

MCF doesn't affect humans or food safety; it's carried by sheep who
transmit the virus, said Leonard Eldridge, the state Department of
Agriculture's veterinarian.

Infected sheep show no signs, Eldridge said. The virus doesn't make
them sick, nor does it kill them.

Cattle died at fair
-------------------
But 22 cattle at the huge fair in Pierce County died after exposure
to nearby carrier sheep, and he said 17 of them were confirmed to
have MCF.

"What happened in Puyallup was a kind of perfect storm," Eldridge
said. "There was high humidity" in an enclosure full of sheep and
cattle. "They ran fans to cool the sheep. There was an exhaust fan in
the center, and the cattle that died were near the exhaust."

The MCF virus cannot live long outside an animal, Eldridge said, but
the humid air in the pen helped it survive long enough to spread.

"The bottom line is that the sheep carry it, and any time you
commingle animals, there's a chance that one could get sick. If you
go to the picture show and the flu's going around, you could get the
flu."

Momma Cow, winner of the Best in Show prizes at both the 2008
Puyallup Fair and the 2007 Clallam County Fair, was worth about USD
4000, Sharp said.

His FFA students raised her together, and now they're bringing up her
1st calf, a steer. Her 2nd calf, nearly 5 months in utero, was lost
when Momma Cow died.

"It was pretty excruciating," said Dennis. "There was nothing we could
do." For the 42 teenagers in Sequim FFA, Momma Cow taught a tough
lesson, Sharp added. "Agriculure education deals with the basics of
life," including birth and death, he said. "We're going to be faced
with losses all of our lives."

'Biosecurity measures'
----------------------
Eldridge said the spread of the disease can be prevented through
"biosecurity measures," also known as common sense.

First among them: "Wash your hands. You can carry the disease."
Animal caretakers should take time to wash after handling sheep and
before touching cattle; to be extra careful they may want to change
their clothes.

Eldridge advises against mixing sheep with other animals in the same
pen. Each species should be in a separate enclosure, even a separate
barn, and they should not share water buckets.

Good ventilation will inhibit the virus' survival, he said.

On farm tours and at petting zoos, Eldridge said, children should
wash their hands after touching sheep and lambs.

No danger to Sequim wildlife
----------------------------
Another strain of MCF, found in goats, can threaten deer and elk, the
veterinarian said. But it's a rare disease, and he doesn't believe
Sequim's wildlife is endangered.

"I feel bad for those kids," said Eldridge, who practiced veterinary
medicine in Eastern Washington for 40 years.

"We had the 4-H sheep and cattle, and we never experienced that
[disease]. Everything had to be just right for this to occur."

MCF's incubation period is about 60 days, he said, so the infected
cattle looked perfectly well for up to a couple of months after the
Puyallup Fair ended on [21 Sep 2008]

Eldridge didn't know where the infected sheep came from, and said
only that they were Washington-raised.

And the cattle that caught MCF could not spread it to other animals,
he said. "They're a dead-end host."

[Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a serious, often fatal, disease
affecting many species in the family Artiodactyla (even-toed
ungulates) including cattle, bison, deer, moose, exotic ruminants,
and pigs. At least 10 MCF viruses have been recognized, including 2
well-known viruses carried by sheep and wildebeest; 5 MCF viruses
have been linked to disease, while the others have been found, to
date, only in asymptomatic carriers. Each MCF virus is highly adapted
to its usual host and does not normally cause disease in that
species, but can cause fatal infections if transmitted to other
susceptible ruminants or pigs.

Malignant catarrhal fever is caused by several viruses in the genus
_Rhadinovirus_ of the family _Herpesviridae_ (subfamily
_Gammaherpesvirinae_). The MCF subgroup of viruses (MCFV or type 1
RuRV) contains at least 10 members, 5 of which are known to cause
disease. Ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2), endemic in most sheep, is the
major cause of MCF worldwide. Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1),
which is endemic in wildebeest (_Connochaetes_ spp.), causes the
wildebeest-associated form of MCF in cattle and other species.

MCF viruses are carried asymptomatically by their reservoir hosts,
but can cause disease in other species. Wildebeest are the carriers
for AlHV-1. All or most wildebeest in the wild, and most wildebeest
in zoos, appear to be infected by this virus. Most sheep are infected
with OvHV-2.

OvHV-2 appears to be transmitted mainly by the respiratory route,
probably in aerosols. This virus is shed intermittently in nasal
secretions, particularly by 6- to 9-month-old lambs. OvHV-2 DNA has
also been reported in the semen of rams. Unlike AlHV-1 in wildebeest,
OvHV- 2 is rarely transmitted transplacentally or in colostrum or
milk; most lambs do not become infected until they are at least 2
months of age. Susceptible animals usually become infected when they
are in close contact with sheep, but cases have been reported when
sheep and cattle were separated by 70 meters (230 ft), as well as in
bison herds up to 5 km (3 mi) from a lamb feedlot.

Ruminants that develop malignant catarrhal fever are usually dead end
hosts. A few instances of animal-to-animal transmission have been
suspected in cattle and OvHV-2 infected deer, but definitive evidence
for horizontal transmission does not exist. Subclinical, possible
latent, infections have been reported in some incidental hosts
including cattle, bison, and cervids. Recrudescence might be possible
in these animals. Case reports suggest that some non-reservoir hosts
might be able to transmit MCF viruses to their offspring.

The incubation period varies with the virus, host, and other factors,
and is incompletely understood. Cattle can become ill in as little as
9 days, but some cases occur 70 days or longer after exposure. In
bison exposed to sheep, the incubation period is often a month or
more. Latent infections are also possible. Epidemiological evidence
suggests that some cattle may be infected subclinically for more than
20 months before developing disease. In one outbreak in subclinically
infected bison, clinical cases tended to occur 3 to 14 days after the
animals were stressed by handling.

Malignant catarrhal fever is a broad syndrome with a variety of signs
in different species. Subclinical infections are usual in reservoir
hosts, and have also been reported in some incidental hosts such as
cattle and bison. Clinical MCF is very similar whether it is caused
by OvH-2 or AlHV-1. Peracute disease, which tends to occur in highly
susceptible species, is characterized by few clinical signs, rapid
progression, and death. Sudden death can occur in this form, or death
may be preceded by 12 to 24 hours of depression, weakness, diarrhea,
or dysentery. More apparent clinical signs are seen when animals
survive longer Animals with acute disease develop a high fever and
inappetence. Cattle often have bilateral corneal opacity that begins
at the corneoscleral junction and progresses inward. Serous
oculonasal discharge is common early; later, this discharge becomes
mucopurulent. The muzzle and nares are usually encrusted, and
dyspnea, open-mouthed breathing and salivation may be seen. The oral
mucosa is often hyperemic and may contain multifocal or diffuse areas
of necrosis. Erosions may be found at the tips of the buccal
papillae. The skin is sometimes erythematous or ulcerated, and
hardened scabs may develop, particularly on the perineum, udder, and
teats. In some animals, the horn and hoof coverings may be loosened
or sloughed. The joints may be swollen, milk production often drops,
and the superficial lymph nodes are markedly enlarged in cattle.
Diarrhea, hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, or hematuria also occur.
Occasionally, animals have nervous signs including hyperesthesia,
incoordination, disorientation, tremors, nystagmus, or head pressing.
Although many animals die, chronic infection or recovery is possible.
Skin lesions have been reported in cattle without other clinical
signs, and may resolve spontaneously.

In cattle, malignant catarrhal fever usually occurs sporadically in
one to a few animals, but outbreaks may also be seen. Morbidity rates
of 28 percent to 45 percent have been reported in some outbreaks. The
mortality rate is classically described to be 90-100 percent in
symptomatic animals, but a few studies have suggested that up to 35
percent of cattle may recover from disease. Subclinical and chronic
cases, including cattle with skin disease, have also been reported.
Residual corneal opacity is often seen in recovered cattle, but one
cow without ocular lesions was reported to make a complete recovery.

Cattle rarely develop the sheep-associated form of MCF, and
separation from sheep is not always necessary. However, an outbreak
of sheep-associated MCF was recently reported in cattle exposed to
hand-reared lambs in the Netherlands. For this reason, it would be
prudent to avoid mixing cattle and sheep, particularly lambs that are
actively shedding virus. Bison, some deer, and other highly
susceptible species should not be allowed near sheep. Separation by
longer distances is particularly important when the host is highly
susceptible and the concentration of virus is high (that is, bison
and lambs in feedlots).

Although most infections occur when the carrier host and susceptible
animals are in close contact, transmission of AlHV-1 has been
reported when animals were separated by a distance of at least 100
meters (328 feet). OvHV-2 was reported in cattle separated from lambs
by 70 meters (230 feet). This disease was also reported in bison
herds up to 5 km (3 miles) from a lamb feedlot.

Transmission on fomites must be avoided, particularly when the
species is highly susceptible. MCF viruses are susceptible to most
commonly available disinfectants. Cell-associated MCFV is very
fragile, and infectivity disappears after 72 hours in the
environment. Cell-free virus can survive for more than 13 days in
humid environments, but disappears quickly when the humidity is low.

In some cases, the production of virus-free hosts may also be
considered. OvHV-2 free sheep can be produced by early weaning and
isolation, and the production of CpHV-2-free goats has been
suggested. Commercial vaccines are not currently available for any
species. During outbreaks, susceptible animals should be separated
immediately from the suspected source of the virus. Most incidental
hosts are thought to be dead end hosts, and do not need to be culled;
however, there is some uncertainty about the possibility of
horizontal transmission in some species. Because the incubation
period can be very long, cases can continue to occur for months even
without horizontal transmission. Stress reduction can help prevent
disease in subclinically or mildly affected animals. Antibiotics to
control secondary infections and supportive therapy may occasionally
help, but many affected animals die.

In an era when biosecurity is preached on every agricultural corner,
it is staggering to realize that county fairs and state fairs are
still so lax as to mingle animals in the same barn. Let us hope that
fair administrators throughout the nation will take heed and separate
the species.
