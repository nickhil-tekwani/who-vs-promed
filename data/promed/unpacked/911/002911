Request for tissues
-------------------
Recently, a number of veterinarians and pathologists have observed a spike
in mortality in young ferrets less than one year of age. Deaths occur in
animals that appear to have overwhelming bacterial infections that are
unresponsive to a wide range of treatments. Several unusual findings have
linked animals necropsied on both the east and west coasts of the United
States, and suggest that a new syndrome may have appeared in our pet ferret
population.
This is not an epidemic situation, nor does the disease appear very
contagious at this time. The condition is sporadic and most commonly
affects only a single animal in a household. Unfortunately, even with the
highest levels of care, few animals have survived this condition once
diagnosed.
Investigations on these cases to date have failed to disclose a cause for
the condition. This is likely attributable to the slow progression of
disease and the number of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and other
treatments that are often used in a valiant attempt to keep the animals alive.
Recent postings on the FML [Ferret Mailing List] and in other circles on
this new syndrome have sparked a lot of interest in this "mystery disease".
One approach that has not yet been tried is to obtain diagnostic samples
from veterinarians and shelter operators prior to any attempted therapy.
This may be in the form of surgical biopsy of abscessed skeletal muscle or
lymph nodes, or necropsy tissue from animals that have been euthanized
without treatment.
The prospect of euthanizing an animal without attempting treatment is
loathe to all of us; however, the extended use of antibiotics and other
drugs in these cases (even those to which the organism is not particularly
sensitive to) likely lowers the concentration of the agent to an extent
where we cannot successfully culture it, or view it under the microscope.
There is no indication that antibiotics themselves are causing the problem
-- however it is very likely that they are masking the true culprit. Let me
also clarify that this particular disease has not been linked to any
breeder, pet store, distribution center, activity, or anything at all at
this point.
We are looking for tissue samples from animals less than 1 year of age who
are exhibiting the following signs of acute disease:
persistent high fever (greater than 104 degrees Fahrenheit [40 degrees
Celsius])
markedly elevated white blood cell count
discomfort or pain in the hind legs
enlargement of one or more peripheral nodes
cellulitis or abscessation of peripheral nodes or adjacent soft tissue
Proper collection of tissues is paramount. Surgical biopsies, such as
enlarged lymph nodes, should be bisected and several touch imprints of the
cut surface prepared and air-dried for cytologic examination and gram
staining. Half of the tissue can then be placed in formalin; the other half
should be immediately frozen for bacteriological examination. If an
untreated animal is presented for necropsy, the widest range of tissues
should be taken. Once again, equal halves can be formalin-fixed and frozen.
Screening of cytologic preps and formalin-fixed tissues will be performed
to determine whether further investigation (bacteriology, virology, etc.)
is warranted on frozen tissue.
If you know of a current case that would fit these criteria, please contact

[This unusual condition in ferrets does appear to be spreading. We post the
request to assist the pathologist and to help to identify the disease.
These animals may be sentinels for some disease, such as SARS, that has not
reached an epidemic level or perhaps has not yet crossed over into people.
In an effort to further scientific knowledge, ProMED-mail requests that
authoritative information be sent to us, and information regarding tissues
be sent to Dr. Williams - Mod.TG]
