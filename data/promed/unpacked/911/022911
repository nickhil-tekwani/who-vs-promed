While the number of the Lyme disease cases are down significantly in Maine so far this year [2014], more than 1375 cases [of Lyme disease] in 2013 compared to 246 cases reported to date in 2014, another tickborne disease is showing an uptick this year compared to last year [2013] in the "Pine Tree State" [the US state of Maine].

The Maine Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported 80 cases of anaplasmosis between [1 Jan and 24 Jul 2014], this compares to a total of 94 cases for the entire 2013.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, anaplasmosis was first recognized as a disease of humans in the United States in the mid-1990's, but did not become a reportable disease until 1999. Nationally, the number of anaplasmosis cases reported to CDC has increased steadily since the disease became reportable, from 348 cases in 2000, to 1761 cases in 2010.

The organism that causes this disease is called _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_. [_Anaplasma_ is a member of the order Rickettsiales, as is the _Rickettsia_ (the group of bacteria to which the cause of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, belongs).]"

Formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and as the former name of the disease implies, it's an infection of the white blood cells. [The disease is now called human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA. - Mod.ML]

People get this infection through the bite of an infected tick. Depending on the part of the United States you are, the tick species is different: [in] the eastern part of the country [and upper Midwest] the black-legged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_ [is the vector], and in the western part of the country, _Ixodes pacificus_, is usually involved. These are deer ticks that are also involved in the transmission of Lyme disease.

After a period of a couple of days to a few weeks, most people infected with _A. phagocytophilum_ show influenza- like symptoms (fever, malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and respiratory symptoms such as a cough) [often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Severe infections can include prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, hemorrhages, opportunistic infections, and death (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm)]. Symptoms tend to be more severe in those that are immunosuppressed and the elderly. The case fatality rate (that is, the proportion of anaplasmosis patients that reportedly died as a result of infection) has remained low, at less than 1 percent.

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ infects the white blood cells and circulates in the blood stream, this pathogen may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood.

Doxycycline is the 1st line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever anaplasmosis is suspected.

[A discussion of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) can be found in moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Anaplasmosis, nosocomial transmission - China: (AH) 20081120.3661.

In the Northeastern US, the pathogens that cause anaplasmosis (_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_) and Lyme disease (_Borrelia burgdorferi_) are transmitted to humans by the same vector (_Ixodes scapularis_; http://www.tickencounter.org/tick_identification/deer_tick) from the same mammalian reservoirs (the white-footed mouse) and patients may be concurrently coinfected by both pathogens. The increased incidence of HGA in Maine can be due to a true increase in the number of cases of HGA as the primary vector (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, but also better recognition and reporting of HGA may contribute to the increases in cases, which may explain the increased incidence of HGA, despite falling numbers of Lyme disease cases. - Mod.ML
