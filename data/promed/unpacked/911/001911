Florida counties report cases of sorghum ergot
-----------------------
[Ergot of sorghum (_Sorghum bicolor_ ) caused by the fungus _Claviceps
africana_ has been detected in ... Manatee and Alachua counties. The
pathogen's first appearance outside Asia and Africa was in Brazil in 1995
... and it now ... [occurs ... throughout eastern South America, Mexico,
and Australia. In 1997, [the fungus spread to the Lower Rio Grande Valley
of Texas and [spread to Kansas and Nebraska, Georgia and Mississippi.
Development of ... sorghum ergot [is favored by high temperatures (66-70
degrees Fahrenheit/19-21 degrees Celsius) and high relative humidities. The
disease lowers grain/seed yield and quality, makes threshing difficult,
reduces germination and seedling emergence, and predisposes seedlings to
other diseases. Clothing, footwear, and farm implements are all possible
vectors for the pathogen; at the local level, wind may disperse the fungus.

[Sorghum ergot disease is caused by fungal pathogens, _Claviceps africana_
in Africa and _C. sorghi_ in India. Sorghum is an important feed crop for
livestock and a staple food crop in many African and Asian countries where
wheat and rice cannot be grown. Disease management involves planting in
ergot-free areas, alter seeding date to allow flowering under conditions
that are unfavorable to disease development, eradication of infected
plants, and use of triazole fungicides. - Mod.DH
