It seemed appropriate that a conference of infectious disease
specialists should have been gathered [in May 2004] at Alice Springs,
Australia, when one of their colleagues sounded a red alert on golden
staph [_Staphylococcus aureus_, is called golden because its colonies
on agar tend to have a gold, rather than white appearance. In the
same context, coagulase-negative staphylococci have been called _S.
albus_ or white staph. - Mod.LL]

The resistant strain of _S. aureus_ was seen as predominantly a
hospital-based problem until Anton Peleg, a former infectious
diseases registrar at Royal Brisbane Hospital, gave his paper in
Alice Springs on the new community-acquired "Queensland" strain of
MRSA, which had emerged in the state's south-east, infecting about 50
people and killing a man in his 20s.

"It's a new community disease," says Royal Melbourne hospital
infectious diseases specialist Mike Richards, who has led Victoria's
effort to begin recording data on hospital-acquired MRSA. "If the
community-acquired strain of MRSA becomes established it will pose a
real problem," he says.

Krys Sadkowsky, a researcher at the federally-funded Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare, says that in 2002, there were 6533
deaths from septicemia (bloodstream infection), an estimated 1/3 of
which could be attributed to _S. aureus_. According to Sadkowsky,
the rate of death from septicemia has risen 5-fold since 1970 -- a
period during which antibiotic use has proliferated.

The US and UK face similar problems with MRSA, and growing public alarm in
Britain recently forced the Blair Government to announce a special [Aus.]$160
million hospital clean-up program. The US was quickest to acknowledge the
problem, and in 1999 researchers studying _S. aureus_ in New York hospitals
found patients with it were hospitalized for twice as long, cost twice as
much to treat, and had a significantly higher risk of fatal complications.

The Australian Infection Control Association's working group estimated in
2001 that surgical site infections cost [Aus.]$600 million. In Victoria, the
average additional cost of one surgical site infection after coronary bypass
surgery was estimated to be at least [Aus.]$12 000. John Turnidge, who chairs
the National Health and Medical Research Council's expert advisory group on
bacterial resistance, estimates that thousands of people get golden staph
each year. He says there is sufficient data to show that MRSA is a
significant problem, particularly in teaching hospitals that perform a lot of
surgery.

Canberra infectious diseases specialist Peter Collignon is one of
those calling for more recording and publication of data. "These data
need to be seen by people," he says. He attributes the reluctance of
hospitals to compile data partly to the cost involved, but also the
fear of adverse publicity. "In medicine, it's sometimes hard to
acknowledge you do harm," he says.

Collignon instituted an infection control program at Canberra
hospital that resulted in bloodstream infections in 2003 dropping
from 110 to 40. "I think there's a fatalistic culture in some
hospitals that there are sick people and there's antibiotic
resistance and there's nothing we can do about it," he says.

[Despite what Mike Richards is reported to have said (above), community-
acquired (CA) methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ has not been [only] recently
described in Australia. Indeed, the very same Peter Collignon quoted in the
posting published information in 1998 (Collignon P, Gosbell I, Vickery A, et
al. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in
Australia. Lancet 1998;352:145-6) that isolates of CA-MRSA were found in
Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney and cited references reporting
cases in Perth and Darwin.

It is of note that the Australian strains seemed multiply resistant
(like hospital strains), whereas many of the USA strains previously
included in ProMED-mail postings were resistant only to beta-lactam
antimicrobials. - Mod.LL]
