The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced today [Mon 7 Mar 2022] the latest epidemic situation of COVID-19. As of 0.00am, [Mon 7 Mar 2022], the CHP was investigating 9410 additional confirmed cases, 3997 additional asymptomatic cases and 11 743 cases with pending case status in the past 24 hours (i.e. there were 25 150 additional cases that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in those 24 hours). Hong Kong has recorded a total of 496 767 cases that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus so far.

The newly reported cases consist of 32 imported cases and 25 118 locally acquired cases. The CHP is continuing with epidemiological investigations on the cases.

In addition, as of 0.00am, [Mon 7 Mar 2022], a total of 2074 deaths related to COVID-19 during the 5th wave (since [31 Dec 2021]) were recorded, with 2070 and 4 deaths reported from the Hospital Authority and public mortuaries respectively. Hong Kong has so far recorded a total of 2287 deaths related to COVID-19.

As at 4pm today [Mon 7 Mar 2022], a total of 417 373 cases that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been reported in the past 14 days [21 Feb --to 6 Mar 2022], including 417 279 locally acquired cases and 94 imported cases. A list of buildings related to the cases is available at the "COVID-19 Thematic Website" (<www.coronavirus.gov.hk>).

Furthermore, among the earlier cases reported, there were cases (including pending cases) changed to confirmed, asymptomatic or re-positive cases. As of yesterday [Sun 6 Mar 2022], the total number of confirmed cases was 202 704, while the figures for asymptomatic cases, re-positive cases, pending/unknown cases recorded since [1 Jan 2022] were 90 715, 10 and 178 188 respectively.

Also, as the passenger flight (GA876) operated by Garuda Indonesia arriving in Hong Kong from Jakarta, Indonesia, on [Sun 6 Mar 2022] had 26 passengers who tested positive upon arrival, the DH thus invoked the Prevention and Control of Disease (Regulation of Cross-boundary Conveyances and Travellers) Regulation (Cap. 599H) to prohibit the landing of passenger flights in Hong Kong from Jakarta operated by Garuda Indonesia from [8 to 21 Mar 2022].

People with positive or preliminary positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test results will receive an SMS notification about the result, together with a request to fill in an electronic form (<www.chp.gov.hk/cdpi>) to submit information, including those on family members living in the same household. This is to facilitate the work of the CHP such as epidemiological investigation and arrangement of hospital admission, isolation and quarantine. People who receive the relevant SMS should check the personal information and information on testing in the SMS carefully and fill in the electronic form as soon as possible to provide accurate and complete information.

The spokesman for the CHP stressed that the local situation of COVID-19 infection became severe recently and there is a continuous increase in the number of cases involving mutant strains that carry higher transmissibility. With the higher transmissibility and risk of infection of the omicron mutant strain, the CHP strongly appeals to the community to continue to comply with the social distancing measures, avoid going out and refrain from participating in unnecessary or crowded activities or gatherings (particularly religious or cross-family activities and gatherings). This would lower the risk of infection and prevent the virus from spreading in the community.

The spokesman reminded that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe cases and deaths from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They can provide effective protection to those vaccinated in preventing serious complications and even death after infection. People who are yet to receive vaccination, especially senior citizens, chronic patients and other immunocompromised persons who face a higher chance of death after COVID-19 infection, should get vaccinated as early as possible for self-protection and to reduce the risk of falling seriously ill and death should they get infected. Meanwhile, a person who gets COVID-19 and influenza at the same time may be more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. Influenza vaccination may reduce the likelihood of hospitalisation and the length of stay. In addition, seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all people aged 6 months or above except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccination early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on the CHP's website (<www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/17980.html>).

[2] China: surge in cases
Date: Mon 7 Mar 2022

China is seeing a new surge in COVID-19 cases across the vast country, despite its draconian "zero tolerance" approach to dealing with outbreaks.

The mainland on [Mon 7 Mar 2022] reported 214 new cases of infection over the previous 24 hours, with the most, 69, in the southern province of Guangdong bordering on Hong Kong, which has been recording tens of thousands of cases per day.

Another 54 cases were reported in the Jilin province, more than 2000km (approx. 1200mi) to the north, and 46 in the eastern province Shandong.

In his annual report to the national legislature [Sat 5 Mar 2022], Premier Li Keqiang said China needs to "constantly refine epidemic containment" but gave no indication Beijing might ease the highly touted "zero tolerance" strategy.

Li called for accelerating vaccine development and "strengthening epidemic controls" in cities where travelers and goods arrive from abroad.

"Zero tolerance" requires quarantines and lockdowns on entire communities and sometimes even cities when as few as a handful of cases have been detected. Chinese officials credit the approach -- along with a vaccination rate of more than 80% -- with helping prevent a major nationwide outbreak, but critics say it is taking a major toll on the economy and preventing the population from building up natural immunity.

No new cases were reported in Beijing and the city was largely back to normal, although masks continue to be worn in public places indoors.

One area that continues to feel the effects of tight COVID-19 control is the religious sector. Three of Beijing's most famous Catholic churches, Buddhist temples and mosques stated on [Sun 6 Mar 2022] that they had been ordered closed in January [2022] with no date given on reopening.

Even before the pandemic, such institutions were under heavy pressure from the Communist authorities to follow through on demands from leader Xi Jinping that all religious centers be purged of outside influence, including the physical appearance of places of worship.

The latest daily case numbers mark some of the highest since the initial outbreak in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019 that is believed to have sparked the pandemic.

They bring China's total to 111 195 with 4636 deaths, according to the National Health Commission. At present, 3837 people are receiving treatment for COVID-19, many of them infected with the omicron strain.

[According to The Hill (https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/597102-china-reports-highest-covid-19-tally-since-pandemic), China on (Mon 7 Mar 2022) recorded the highest single day tally of infections since the outbreak in Wuhan at the beginning of the global pandemic.

The country reported 526 cases, including 312 asymptomatic patients, according to Bloomberg. (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/china-reports-most-daily-covid-infections-since-wuhan-outbreak?srnd=premium).

Shanghai, which has seen few significant outbreaks, reported almost 50 cases, while Qingdao saw 163, likely the result of a spike among students at a high school.

China has continued to deploy its zero-tolerance protocols, which include widespread testing and intensive lockdowns, strict policies that the country has used to keep infection rates low throughout the pandemic.

China and Hong Kong are among the final countries still upholding strict COVID-19 policies after places like Australia have moved to treat the virus as an endemic.

Earlier this month (March 2022), Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told citizens not to panic as people flooded grocery stores in anticipation of a lockdown with rising infections.

Lam has said there would not be a citywide lockdown, and her administration is seeking to maintain calm as it plans an expansive testing system.

According to Reuters, Hong Kong is reporting an average of 43 093 new infections each day as of (Sunday 6 Mar 2022) (see https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/hong-kong/ for graphics). - Mod.LK]

[3] New normal
Date: Mon 7 Mar 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/experts-map-out-new-normal-us-enters-third-pandemic-year


As America enters the 3rd year of the COVID-19 pandemic and approaches the 2-year anniversary of business and school shutdowns put in place when little was known about the novel coronavirus, a group of public health experts have published a new roadmap laying out how the country can enter the "new normal" stage of the pandemic and manage the virus without eliminating it (https://www.covidroadmap.org/).

The roadmap recommends against future school closings, suggests the United States will need to manufacture 1 billion at-home COVID-19 tests per month, and says the nation can lift pandemic restrictions when it is tallying 165 or fewer deaths per day from the virus.

The authors begin the roadmap by acknowledging where America stands: fatigued with the pandemic, some having stopped all COVID-19 protocols, while others still extremely cautious. In the middle are millions who are confused about how to comport themselves now that vaccines and therapeutics make COVID-19 a more manageable disease.

The roadmap was co-authored by 24 US experts, including 2 from the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, publisher of CIDRAP News.

Measures may end when deaths fall dramatically
----------------------------------------------
"The pandemic and its restrictive measures should end when COVID death rates decline to those of a bad influenza season," the authors write. That translates to roughly 60 000 deaths per year, or 165 per day.

Currently, the 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 44 800, with 1539 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker. In the past week cases fell by 31%, hospitalizations fell 23%, and deaths fell 19%.

In the best-case scenario, the authors write, widespread use of vaccines and previous infection will limit the ability of the virus to cause extensive deaths.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID Data Tracker shows 65.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster.

Testing, air quality key parts of roadmap
-----------------------------------------
White House officials say more money is urgently needed from Congress to bolster COVID-19 testing supplies and guarantee that uninsured Americans keep getting free treatment for the virus, the Associated Press reports (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-congress-7bba01ec15bdc406c793bc835f717cd1).

Expanding test-to-treat options and making widely available at-home COVID-19 tests is 1 of the main 12 recommendations made by the authors of the roadmap. The roadmap suggests that the US develop the capacity to manufacture 1 billion at -home COVID-19 tests per month.

Roadmap coauthor Michael Mina, MD, PhD, the chief science officer of eMed, a company that sells COVID-19 tests, told CIDRAP News that tests are no longer needed to simply stop the transmission chain of the virus. Instead, they will be explicitly linked to gaining access to COVID-19 treatments.

"Linking tests to treatment has already been made a priority of the administration. Making the whole test-to-treat process work at home means that people will get tested and thus treated in time for the oral antiviral treatments to be maximally beneficial," he said.

"Effective, accessible treatment changes the balance of this pandemic. And, moving forward, it will be one of the major advances and advantages associated with access to rapid testing at home."

The roadmap also emphasizes a need for schools and businesses to improve their air quality. Moreover, it emphases that school shutdowns should be avoided at almost all costs, and that most schools should and can go maskless in the near future.

Starting today [Mon 7 Mar 2022], masks for public school students in New York City are optional, the New YorkTimes reports. It is one of the biggest school districts in the country (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/nyregion/new-york-city-public-schoolchildren-head-to-the-first-day-of-class-without-masks.html).

In addition to testing, air quality, and school guidelines, the roadmap also covers the need to investigate and invest in treatments for "long COVID," to invest in public health infrastructure, and to ensure that American healthcare workers are well-equipped with personal protective equipment in the future.

[4] Social determinants of health
Date: Mon 7 Mar 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-deaths-vary-race-community-social-factors


Social determinants of health (SDOH) tied to COVID-19 death rates varied by race and community type in the first year of the pandemic, suggests an observational spatial analysis involving 3142 counties in all 50 US states and Washington, DC. The study was published late last week in JAMA Network Open.

SDOH are nonmedical factors, such as where people live and work, that influence health outcomes such as COVID-19 infection and death.

"Racial disparities in health largely emanate from the inequitable access to social, economic, and physical or built environmental conditions resulting from racism in the US," the researchers wrote. "Specifically, racism interacts with and exists within societal structures and systems to shape the major SDOH."

Limited Internet access tied to more deaths
-------------------------------------------
University of Chicago researchers analyzed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 data from [22 Jan 2020 to 28 Feb 2021], identifying counties with high proportions of residents of a single race (Black, Hispanic, or White) and high coronavirus-related death rates as "concentrated longitudinal-impact counties."

Among 3142 total counties, 531 were classified as concentrated longitudinal-impact counties, with 11% having a large Black population relative to other counties, 6.3% having a large Hispanic population, and 1.1% having a large share of White residents.

Overall, 489 254 people in the included counties died. All concentrated longitudinal-impact counties had significantly higher COVID-19 death rates than other counties. Median deaths per 100 000 residents were 231.4 in such counties with a large Black population, 218.8 in such counties with a large proportion of Hispanic residents, and 251.8 in such counties with a large White population. In contrast, the median death rate in other counties was 128.6 per 100 000.

While the 33 concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a large proportion of White residents had a higher death rate per 100 000 residents, many more such counties had higher Black and Hispanic concentrations, which the researchers said indicates that the latter counties had a higher COVID-19 death toll than all White concentrated longitudinal-impact counties (deaths, 138 315 and 195 852 vs 2586).

Across all types of communities, those with limited Internet access--particularly in urban areas--had higher death rates. "Adopting an asset-based approach, we believe this finding suggests that more awareness is needed about the essential asset of technological access to reliable information, remote work, schooling opportunities, resource purchasing, and/or social community," the study authors wrote. "Populations with limited internet access remain understudied and are often excluded in pandemic research."

Income inequality and preventable hospitalizations
--------------------------------------------------
Many concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with the largest percentages of Black (67.1%) and Hispanic residents (55.6%) had a higher proportion of working-age people than the national median. And 78.8% of counties with a large White population had a higher percentage of people 65 years and older than the national median.

Of concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a large White population, 69.7% were in rural areas, while 57.6% of counties with a large Hispanic population were located in urban areas, and those with a large Black population were in rural, suburban, and urban areas.

Most concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a relatively large Black population had disadvantages, such as greater income inequality (85.6%) and more preventable hospital stays (81%). Among counties with a large proportion of Hispanic residents, 65.7% had high percentages of residents with no health insurance.

Among concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with large proportions of White residents, 78.8% had a large population of older adults, and 72.7% had limited access to quality healthcare.

Future research is needed to identify dimensions and regional patterns of SDOH to address health disparities and guide policies and programs, the authors noted. "A more complex model that uses geospatial and temporal patterns to reflect spatial effects and dynamic community aspects (eg, changes in policies, unemployment), in addition to existing SDOH measures and human behaviors, is needed for future analysis," they wrote.

Abstract

Importance. Although social determinants of health (SDOH) are important factors in health inequities, they have not been explicitly associated with COVID-19 mortality rates across racial and ethnic groups and rural, suburban, and urban contexts.

Objectives. To explore the spatial and racial disparities in county-level COVID-19 mortality rates during the first year of the pandemic.

Conclusions and Relevance. This cross-sectional study found an association between different SDOH measures and COVID-19 mortality that varied across racial and ethnic groups and community types. Future research is needed that explores the different dimensions and regional patterns of SDOH to address health inequity and guide policies and programs.

"What are social determinants of health?
"Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. They include factors like socioeconomic status, education, neighborhood and physical environment, employment, and social support networks, as well as access to health care.

"Though health care is essential to health, research shows that health outcomes are driven by an array of factors, including underlying genetics, health behaviors, social and environmental factors, and financial distress and all of its implications. While there is currently no consensus in the research on the magnitude of the relative contributions of each of these factors to health, studies suggest that health behaviors and social and economic factors are the primary drivers of health outcomes, and social and economic factors can shape individuals' health behaviors. There is extensive research that concludes that addressing social determinants of health is important for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities. Prior to the pandemic there were a variety of initiatives to address social determinants of health both in health and non-health sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated already existing health disparities for a broad range of populations, but specifically for people of color."
