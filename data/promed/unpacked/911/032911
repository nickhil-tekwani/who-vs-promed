[One human West Nile (WN) virus infection (undefined clinically) was
reported for epidemiological week 25 (17-23 Jun 2007). This is the
1st human case of WN virus infection in Canada in 2007. One West Nile
virus positive dead bird (corvid) was previously reported in Ontario
in the 14 Jun 2007 WN virus update (archive no. 20070601.1776).

"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the
URL provided above].
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid
paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC:" These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such
cases are reported to CDC.

2007 West Nile virus activity in the United States (through 3 Jul 2007)
-----------------------------------------------
Data are being collected from state and local health departments on a
weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing
county-level wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data are published each
week on the collaborative USGS (US Geological Service)/CDC West Nile
virus website.
As of 3 Jul 2007, human, avian, animal, or mosquito West Nile virus
(WNV) infections have been reported to CDC ArboNET from the following
states: Arkansas, California, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.
WNV antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses) have
been found in California, Florida, and Utah. [Note: not all states
have WNV sentinel programs. - Mods.JW/TY]
WNV equine infections have been reported from California, Tennessee, and Texas.
WNV has been detected in dead wild birds in California, Mississippi,
Oregon, and Texas.
WNV has been detected in mosquito pools collected in California,
Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, California and Mississippi, Pennsylvania,
South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.

A dead blue jay [_Cyanocitta cristata_] collected from Jackson has
tested positive for the presence of West Nile virus, according to an
Ocean County Health Department spokesman.
Edward Rumen, the department's public information officer, said the
dead bird was sent to the state lab in Trenton, and the health
department was subsequently notified that the bird had tested
positive for the disease [virus].
"This is about the right time of the year for [WN virus] positive
birds to begin to be identified," said Dr. Ella Boyd, public health
coordinator. "This is the 1st bird to test positive in Ocean County
and the 1st bird to test positive in New Jersey this season [2007]."
"To date, there have been no West Nile virus cases in the state in
people or horses," Boyd said. "Now that we know the disease is
present once again in Ocean County, we are reminding residents to
take certain actions to limit their exposure to mosquitoes and their
possibility of coming into contact with the disease."

[5] Puerto Rico
Date: Thu 28 Jun 2007
From: Roberto Barrera [edited]

As part of a WNV surveillance program in Puerto Rico, the CDC's
Dengue Branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico began conducting sentinel
captive bird surveillance to detect arboviral transmission in July
2006. 60 sentinel chickens were placed in 12 pens (each housing 5
chickens). The pens were located in eastern Puerto Rico; 2 pens were
placed in each of 4 different natural habitats (herbaceous wetlands,
mangrove forests, deciduous forests, and evergreen forests) and in 2
human populated areas (rural and urban areas). The cages were placed
near the site where 2 resident birds and 3 horses were found to be
WNV IgG positive in 2004 (1, 2). Serum samples were taken from all
sentinel chickens every 2 weeks. Seroconversion for WNV was detected
by a chicken specific MAC-ELISA in 7 sentinel chickens in 4 pens (one
wetland, one mangrove forest, and 2 evergreen forests) from a sample
drawn on 4 Jun 2007 and from another 21 chickens on 11 Jun 2007 in 11
out of the 12 pens, covering all types of habitats, including rural
and urban areas.
This was the 1st time that this sentinel surveillance system detected
any arboviral infection among these 60 sentinel chickens. Plaque
reduction neutralization tests (PRNT90) [90 per cent plaque reduction
- Mod.TY] against WNV and SLE confirmed that the chickens were
infected with WNV. Testing of mosquito captures around the positive
pen areas is ongoing in an attempt to isolate the virus. The Puerto
Rico Department of Health (PRDH) has alerted the population to take
prevention measures. The CDC and PRDH have conducted routine
island-wide human surveillance for WNV since late 2002. To date, no
human cases of WNV infection have been reported in Puerto Rico. More
active surveillance has been initiated.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Barrera for this interesting information on WNV
transmission in Puerto Rico and requests additional information as it
emerges from their surveillance program. It seems apparent that WNV
has become endemic on the island. Although the serological tests used
indicate that the seroconversions are due to WN virus and not some
other flavivirus, WN virus isolation will be important to confirm the
serological results. ProMED would be interested in receiving
information on WNV transmission from other locations around the
Caribbean. A map of Puerto Rico can be accessed at:
