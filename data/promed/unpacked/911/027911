Nationwide alert on IV Flush brand of preloaded syringes
-----------------------------------------------
FDA is issuing a nationwide alert against the use of all lots of preloaded
syringes containing either heparin or sodium chloride intravenous catheter
flushes manufactured by the IV Flush, LLC and distributed by Pinnacle
Medical Supply, of Rowlett, Texas, because these products have not received
proper clearance from FDA and may be contaminated.
Consumers and institutions who have these preloaded syringes containing
heparin or sodium chloride intravenous flushes should return them to the IV
Flush, LLC or the original distributor. The firm voluntarily recalled the
products, because they lacked proper FDA clearance for marketing. FDA and
the company have also been informed of _Pseudomonas fluorescens_ infections
in patients possibly caused by the heparin flushes. These cases are
continuing to be investigated.
The heparin and sodium chloride containing intravenous flushes were sold to
distributors who redistributed to other medical distributors and hospitals.
They can be identified by the syringe label, which reads in part: "IV Flush
Dallas, TX." IV Flush, LLC, is notifying its distributors by phone and
letter and has requested that those distributors contact their customers.
The company is arranging for return of all recalled products.
_P. fluorescens_ is an infrequent cause of infection, but has been reported
to cause outbreaks of pseudobacteremia, i.e., presence in a blood culture
in the absence of clinical evidence of bloodstream infection. _P.
fluorescens_ has also been reported as the cause of procedure-related
infections and infections resulting from transfusion with contaminated
blood components. Consumers with questions may contact the company at
1-972-463-7389. Persons wanting to report anything to the Food and Drug
Administration regarding either of these products may contact FDA's
MedWatch office at 1 800-FDA-1088.

[In one city in the Northeast, 6 children have been discovered with _P.
fluorescens_ bacteremia that may be associated with contaminated pre-loaded
syringes containing heparin. Of the 6 cases, 5 required hospitalization, 2
became hypotensive and one of these required intensive care. An outbreak of
_P. fluorescens_ bacteremia has also been found among patients at an
oncology clinic in the Midwest. It should be noted that _P. fluorescens_
can be confused with _P. putida_ and _P. aeruginosa_ on automated
microbiologic testing.
_P. fluorescens_ is one of the pseudomonads that may cause pith necrosis,
one of the most destructive diseases of tomato in Europe. The organism may
also be used in the prevention of apple fire blight (caused by the
bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_) by spraying suspensions of bacterium as an
antagonist onto apple blossoms. The antagonist colonizes the apple
blossoms, effectively interfering with the growth of the pathogen. - Mod.LL]
