Mpumalanga's international safari parks are under threat following an order
they shoot all lions and other game infected by tuberculosis (TB). The
private 15 000-hectare Ligwalagwala Conservancy near Malelane has already
been forced to kill 12 infected lions and claims to have lost 80 percent of
its tourists as a result.
The lions were shot on instructions of the Mpumalanga Veterinary Department
in September [2000] but surrounding game reserve operators have refused to
follow suit. "The only real drawing power for many of these reserves is
the Big 5 [lion, elephant, water buffalo, cheetah and zebra?]. Tourists
simply will not travel thousands of miles from America or Europe if they
are not given the chance to see lions," said wildlife documentary maker and
local resident Greg Nelson. "But TB will not be wiped out even if all the
local lions are killed. Lions get TB from the animals they prey on."
TB is endemic to buffalo and wildebeest in the area, and a visiting doctor
recently detected TB in a warthog. "You'd have to kill all carriers to
wipe the disease out, so are they saying we have to shoot all game in the
Onderberg?" said Nelson.
Gazebo game farm manager Louise Marais confirmed her reserve was ordered to
kill 12 infected lions last year. "Lions are expensive assets and we
simply couldn't just kill them, so when there was no other option we
obtained a permit to allow American hunters to cull the animals," said
Marais. "We mitigated some of our losses, but now we've lost 80 percent of
our tourists because no one is interested in visiting a reserve that can't
promise lions."
Mpumalanga's veterinary services department on Friday admitted it does not
know the source of the disease but speculates it could be coming from the
Kruger National Park, where it was identified in 1990. Deputy director for
animal health in Mpumalanga Lowveld region, Dr. Ben du Plessis, said game
farm owners would have to cull their infected lions because there is no
treatment for bovine-TB. "The disease cannot be treated and the way to
solve it is to destroy the animals," said du Plessis. [This involves
destroying a tremendous number of animals, not just lions, but wildebeest,
buffalo, potentially warthogs and many others. ­ Mod.TG]
That idea has however been considered "heavy-handed" by Johan Moller, an
owner of Lowhill Game Lodge in the conservancy. Moller's 15 lions are
infected but he is adamant he will not cull them. "Why should I kill mine
when those in the Kruger Park are not killed?" he said.
The aim of the Ligwalagwala Conservancy was to introduce TB-free lions from
areas as far [away] as KwaZulu-Natal and the northern part of Kruger Park
which was considered to be TB-free. Dr. du Plessis said his department was
doing regular testing of lions in about 20 game farms in the province.

[If the source of TB is thought to be Kruger National Park, then it does
not make sense to try and import TB-free lions when lions are nomadic
creatures. Furthermore, if they are willing to eliminate all TB-positive
animals, where is the testing program for hoofed stock? How would they
manage a testing program for wild buffalo, wildebeest and other hoofed
animals? ­ Mod.TG]
