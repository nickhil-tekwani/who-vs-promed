The number of people suffering from the dreaded dengue fever is
slowly rising, with 4 new cases being reported from the capital
[Delhi]. The total of patients afflicted by the fever this season is
5 an official said. Chief medical officer (CMO) of the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (MCD), NK Yadav said: 'The fresh cases have been
reported in the month of July [2010].' The people who tested positive
were immediately admitted to Apollo, Safdarjung, and Ram Manohar
Lohia hospitals, said the CMO. Dengue usually hits the capital after
monsoon showers, when the mosquitoes breed in stagnant rainwater. The
1st case in the capital was reported in June [2010].

Symptoms of dengue are high fever for 4-5 days, usually accompanied
by headache and body ache, after which the patient's blood platelet
counts begin to fall and rashes could also occur.

The health department of the MCD has issued guidelines for checking
the spread of dengue. These are: cooler tanks should be emptied and
dried regularly, water kept for birds should be changed regularly,
containers should not be kept in the open, water tanks should be
tightly covered with lids, unused containers should be kept upside
down, and water should not be allowed to accumulate near homes.

The Department of Health (DoH) reported a total of 25 283 dengue
cases nationwide from 1 Jan-26 Jun [2010], a figure that is 40
percent higher than last year [2009]. A total of 190 deaths were
registered within the said period and health officials warned the
public to be on alert against the mosquito-borne disease that is
present all-year round. Last year, there were only 18 055 cases
registered within the same period.

The DoH said changes in weather condition is suitable for
mosquito-breeding, because rains result to clean, stagnant water in
containers making it easy for mosquito breeding.

"The public should avoid contracting dengue. They should be wary
against stagnant water...It does occur all over the year and this
does not occur for only a certain month like during the start of the
rainy season," Health Secretary Enrique Ona said.

A total of 172 barangays [local community units] nationwide were
found to have clustering of dengue cases.

The regions with the most number of cases were found in Central
Luzon, Socsargen, Southern Tagalog region, NCR [national capital
region], and Central Visayas and Davao region.

Dengue fever is now rampant in many areas in southern province of
Binh Duong including Thuan An, Di An, Ben Cat, and Thu Dau Mot town.
To cope with the epidemic, the province has set up a quick-response
team to control outbreaks of dengue fever. The province has also
prepared medicine and equipment as well as chemicals to prevent the
spread of the disease.

Doctor Luong Thi Hong Le, director of the provincial preventive
health centre said the centre has run crash courses for medical staff
at grassroots level so that they can early detect and stamp out new outbreaks.

A massive dengue outbreak is spreading through Mae La refugee camp on
the Thai-Burma [Myanmar] border, and 500 refugees are receiving
treatment for the mosquito-borne fever, according to staff at the
camp yesterday [12 Jul 2010].

The camp that is home to almost 40 000 refugees in Thailand's Tak
province is 35 miles (57 kilometres) from Mae Sot, the main gateway
between the countries on the Moei River opposite Burma's [Myanmar's]
Myawaddy Township. Most of its residents are Karen [ethnic minority].

"Last year [2009], just about 15 people per month suffered dengue
fever but prevention was not carried out systematically, so it has
not been eradicated," camp hospital manager Saw Nay San told Mizzima.
"Early this year [2010], the number of dengue cases increased and
about 500 people are suffering from the fever."

A total of 2 children and 3 adults at the camp had died from the
fever this year [2010]. But, prevention systems remained ineffective,
Saw Nay San said.

"We don't have enough nurses, money or medicine. We don't have enough
mosquito repellent. During the monsoon, the mosquito population
increases so every home needs to use mosquito-repellent spray. Bushes
need to be pruned and we need to eliminate areas of standing water in
the camp," Saw Nay San added.

"I think the patients will recover after they have received medical
treatment for about a week," the hospital chief said.

According to the spokesman from the camp's clinic, most of the
patients suffering dengue fever were between one and 60 years old.

The camp is divided into zones A, B, and C and there are 5 quarters
in each. Most of the houses are thatched cottages. Mae La is the
biggest refugee camp among the 10 camps managed by the NGO alliance
called the Thailand-Burma [Myanmar] Border Consortium along the
border. The other refugee camps are Tham Hin, Ba Don Yang, Nu Po,
Umpiem Mai, Mae La Oon, Mae Ra Ma Luang, Ban Mae Surin, Ban Mai Nai
Soi, and Wieng Hang.

In Mae La camp, most of the refugees are Karen.

infection among refugees in Mae La Camp. Their ages ranged from one
to 60 years. A total of 5 fatalities -- 2 children and 3 adults --
have been reported in 2010. Mae La Camp is located near the
Thai-Myanmar border in Mae Sot district, Tak province. The camp is
about an hour's drive north of Mae Sot. About 40 000 refugees lived
in Mae La camp in 2009.

A summary of the dengue infection situation in Thailand during the
1st 6 months of 2010 is available from PRO/MBDS posting Dengue -
Thailand (04) 20100629.2174. The total numbers of dengue infection

(DF), 13 676 cases and 12 deaths of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF),
483 cases and 18 deaths of dengue shock syndrome (DSS).

According to the Thai Ministry of Public Health, Bureau of
Epidemiology (BOE)'s report of reported cases and deaths of suspected
dengue infection since January 2010 until week 27 (4 Jul 2010 to 10
Jul 2010), available (in Thai) at <http://epid.moph.go.th/>, a total
of 36 087 cases and 36 deaths were reported nationwide. The attack
rate was 56.81 per 100 000 population. Case fatality rate was 0.10
percent. In Tak province, there were 701 cases and 4 deaths of dengue
infection. The attack rate was 134.90 per 100 000 population and the

Outbreaks of dengue fever are spreading through military units in
Naypyidaw, the Burmese [Myanmar] military regime's seat of
government, according to a military hospital source.

Infected soldiers were admitted to the new 1000-bed military hospital
in Naypyidaw for treatment. Moreover, dengue fever is spreading among
residents in the capital's neighbouring township of Pyinmana
[Naypyidaw], home to 100 000 people.

"Children under-12 [of soldiers] in these Naypyidaw military units
infected with dengue fever were admitted to the children's hospital,
and the troops infected with dengue and their children over 12 were
admitted here," an officer from the military hospital, who requested
anonymity, told Mizzima. He declined to give further details on the
scale of the epidemic.

According to official government figures released last year [2009],
Naypyidaw, meaning Royal City, is the 3rd largest city in Burma
[Myanmar], with a population of 925 000.

Residents of Yauktharinn, Kanoo, Yanaung (2), and Shwechi wards in
Pyinmana [Naypyidaw] said that dengue fever were spreading in their locality.

Previously, it infected children aged between 5 and 12, but elderly
people were now also being infected.

"Some dengue fever patients visited nearby clinics and could recover
within 1-2 days. Some of them were referred to hospitals," a
brokerage owner in Yaukthuarinn Ward told Mizzima.

The virus that causes dengue fever is carried by mosquitoes. Wet,
humid weather during the monsoon has encouraged breeding of mosquito
larvae in drains, ponds, and garbage dumps, which encouraged the
breeding of flies and mosquitoes and the subsequent spreading of the
virus that causes dengue, Dr Khin Myint Aye said. Dengue spreads
because of our inability to fight the mosquito menace, he said.

Dengue outbreaks are not rare in Burma [Myanmar]. Ministry of Health
announced that 910 people were infected with dengue during the
January-May [2010] period, and 6 of those died from this disease,
which is also known as break-bone fever because of severe pain in the
bones and joints that often characterizes infection.

At least 80 people were infected in Rangoon [Yangon] in the last week
of June [week of 28 Jun 2010], Mizzima reported on [1 Jul 2010].

According to official statistics, 3129 Burmese [Myanmar] people were
infected with dengue last year [2009], and 37 died.

[The dengue virus spreads through the bite of the infectious female
_Aedes_ mosquito, primarily _Aedes aegypti_, which breeds in
artificial containers and in improperly managed garbage where clean
or clear water accumulates (see <http://www.who.int/csr/disease/dengue/en/>).

According to WHO's Regional Office for South-East Asia (WHO/SEARO)
report available at
<http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section332/Section2277_11962.htm>,
in 2005 the total dengue cases reported were 17 454 and 169 deaths in
Myanmar. In 2006, the reported dengue cases and deaths were reduced
as compared to 2005.

According to the situation update of dengue in the SEARO, 2007,
available at
<http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Dengue_DengueSEAR-07.pdf>, the
total dengue cases and deaths reported between January 2007 and
August 2007 were 9578 cases and 117 deaths. During the same period in
2006, the total dengue cases and deaths reported were 8674 cases and
102 deaths. The case fatality rates were 1.22 and 1.18 in 2007 and
2006, respectively.

In 2007, the states/divisions in Myanmar that reported maximum cases
were Mon, Yangon, Ayayarwaddy, Kayin, Tanintharyi, Rakhine, Mandalay,
Bago(W), Bago(E), Magway, Sagaing, with fewer numbers of cases
reported from other states. Myanmar has peaks in July, as has been
observed between 2004 and 2007.

According to the newswire above, officials stated that there were
3129 cases and 37 deaths in Myanmar due to dengue infection in 2009.
From January 2010 to May 2010, there were 910 cases and 6 deaths of
dengue infection. At least 80 cases were reported in Yangon during
the week of 28 Jun 2010. This brings the total number of cases due to
dengue infection during 1st 6 months of 2010 in Myanmar to at least
990 cases and 6 deaths.

The newswire above mentions outbreaks of dengue fever in military
units in the capital, Naypyidaw. Cases were soldiers and their
children and also residents in the capital's neighbouring townships.
However, the numbers of infected cases were not mentioned in the newswire.

PRO/MBDS would appreciate further information from reliable sources
about the current situation of dengue outbreaks in Myanmar.
