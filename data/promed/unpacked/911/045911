A Comment on the Liverpool Study And Similar Data
-------------------------------------------------
Addressing the Liverpool and similar studies [referred to in the preceding
post "Smallpox, duration of immunity 0020830.5193"], it would seem one of
the problems is that we do not know about the rates of asymptomatic
intercurrent smallpox infection in those populations. They may have been
vaccinated 50 years ago, but that does not exclude [the possibility] that
their immunity was boosted by natural infection on numerous occasions. The
same may be said of laboratory workers whose immunity may (or may not) have
been boosted in a lab.

[In the absence of additional experimental data, it is clear that there are
too many unknowns in this situation for further useful discussion.
Consequently this thread is now cut. - Mod.CP]
