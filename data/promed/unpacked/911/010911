Ginseng jabs kill 3 in Yunnan
-----------------------------
A total of 3 people have died in south-western China after receiving
an injection of Siberian ginseng extract. The deaths, announced on
China's health ministry Web site, occurred in Yunnan province after 6
hospital patients received the injections. It said sales and use of
the ginseng extract had been suspended.

The ministry is also trying to dampen fears about melamine poisoning
of milk, which has killed 4 babies and made thousands ill in a
months-long scandal. It said that 10 666 babies remained in hospital
receiving treatment for renal problems caused by the melamine
contamination of baby milk formula.

Some parents are taking legal action against the manufacturer at the
centre of the scandal, the Sanlu Group, and the state quality supervision body.

Ginseng treatment
-----------------
The ginseng injection was manufactured by Wandashan Pharmaceutical,
based in the north-eastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang. Siberian
ginseng is often used in China to treat heart disease and thrombosis.

The 6 patients suffered "serious ill effects" including chills,
vomiting and sudden drops in blood pressure after receiving the
injections at the Number Four People's Hospital in Honghe prefecture
on Sunday. Some went into a coma. Of those 6, 3 died on Monday [6 Oct
2008], official media reported 2 days later.

The State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) says it has isolated 2
problematic batches of the extract, made from a herb called
"ciwujia," and has urged immediate nationwide reporting of any adverse effects.

The Associated Press reports that a man who answered the telephone at
Wandashan's marketing department in Heilongjiang, in China's
north-east, said the company had stopped selling the herbal injection
and had sent the 2 batches to the SFDA for testing. The man was
reported as saying the company had used ciwujia in its products for
more than 30 years without any problem.

Poor regulation
---------------
He added that the injectable form of the herb was relatively new,
saying: "I haven't heard of any bad reaction [to] this injection before."

China 's pharmaceutical industry is highly lucrative but poorly
regulated. Last year, the country's former top drug regulator was
executed for taking millions of dollars in bribes to approve
substandard medicines, including an antibiotic that killed at least 10 people.

[Siberian ginseng (_Eleutherococcus senticosus_) is a shrub that
grows 3 - 10 feet high. Its leaves are attached to a main stem by
long branches. Both the branches and the stem are covered with
thorns. Flowers, yellow or violet, grow in umbrella-shaped clusters,
and turn into round, black berries in late summer. The root itself is
woody and is brownish, wrinkled, and twisted. The primary herbal use
of this plant is from the roots. It is a distant relative of true
(Panax) ginseng (which includes Asian ginseng and American ginseng),
but it does not belong to the Panax group of herbs

Its scientific name is where the plant/herb derive its other common
name of eleuthero.

The herb has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries.
It is usually used to improve stamina, the immune system and to some
extent mental acuity and some liver ailments. It is generally
available as tea or from died or cut roots designed to be made into a
tea, tablets, capsules, powders and extracts that are both solid and
liquid in nature. The injection is relatively new use of the extract.

Eleuthero did not come into more widespread use until the middle of
the 20th century, at a time when supplies of Panax ginseng were low.
Russian and Chinese scientists found eleuthero seemed to have some of
the same properties as Panax ginseng and could be grown faster.
Athletes from the former Soviet Union used it to enhance athletic
performance during competitions. After the Chernobyl nuclear reactor
disaster, Russian and Ukrainian citizens reportedly received the herb
to counter the effects of radiation poisoning. It is still widely
used in Russia and other Asian countries and has gained popularity in
Western countries as well.

Eleuthero does not contain the compounds (ginsenosides) found in
Asian and American ginseng that are thought to be responsible for
those plants' medicinal effects. It contains other compounds
(eleutherosides), some of which may act like estrogen or other
steroid hormones.

It is equally possible that the ginseng may not be correctly
identified or as an extract, that an in appropriate solvent was
used. More information on the findings of the investigation would be
appreciated.
