PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2009 (04)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the

[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include some other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data
on other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease), are included also since
they may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

Date: Mon 6 Apr 2009

<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>


The number of suspect cases of vCJD referred to the CJD surveillance
unit in Edinburgh, and the number of deaths of definite and probable
due to vCJD remain unchanged since the previous monthly report; that
is, the number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD cases
remains 164. Four definite/probable patients remain alive, bringing
the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases to 168.

This situation is consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in
the UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in
2007, only one in 2008, and none so far in 2009.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2009
---------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 6 Apr 2009 in the UK so far this year [2009], there have
been 28 referrals, 11 cases of sporadic CJD, one case of familial
CJD, one case of iatrogenic CJD, and no cases of GSS or vCJD.

<http://www.invs.sante.fr/display/?doc=publications/mcj/donnees_mcj.html>


During the period 1 Jan 2009 to 1 Apr 2009 there were 359 referrals,
12 cases of sporadic CJD, 1 case of familial CJD, no cases of
iatrogenic CJD, and no cases of vCJD. [With more than 10 times the
number of referrals, the numbers with final diagnoses are remarkably
similar to those recorded in the UK during the same period. - Mod.CP/JW]

During the period 1992 to 2008, there were 23 cases of vCJD, all now
deceased. They occurred between 1996 and 2007: one case in 1996, one
in 2000, one in 2001, 3 in 2002, none in 2003, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005,
6 in 2006, 3 in 2007, none in 2008, and none so far in 2009. There
were 12 male and 11 female patients.

Not updated since 31 Dec 2008. As of 31 Dec 2008, the number of cases
examined since 1996 are the following: referrals, 3071 of which 1775
were attributed to prion disease, 1490 to sporadic CJD, 254 to
familial CJD, 4 to iatrogenic CJD, and 2 cases of vCJD, both
contracted abroad.

In 2008, there were 228 referrals attributed to prion disease, 182
cases of sporadic CJD, 23 cases of familial CJD, and no cases of
iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

Mad cow disease suspected in Spanish doctor's death
---------------------------------------------------
A Spanish pathologist who specialized in a human strain of mad cow
disease died Saturday [28 Mar 2009], and officials suspect the
disease played a role in his death, officials said. The doctor was
head of the anatomy pathology section at the University Hospital
Principe de Asturias in Alcala de Henares, outside of Madrid,
according to the Madrid regional government's health office. He died
Saturday night, at the hospital where he worked, officials said. The
doctor's name was not released at the request of his family.

Several samples have been sent off for testing, the office said, but
results are expected to take a month. The doctor was well known both
in and outside Spain for his work in the pathology field. His
specialty was the human strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease].

It is not known how the doctor might have contracted the disease, but
the health office said it was not thought to be through ingestion of
contaminated meat. Authorities are investigating whether the doctor
had been exposed to contaminated human tissue through his work.

Since 2001, 702 Creutzfeldt-Jakob cases have been reported in Spain,
of which 87 have been reported in Madrid. Five people have died [as a
result of contracting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. - Mod.CP]

[This report contains no compelling information that would suggest
that this is a 6th case of vCJD in Spain. The victim's exposure is
attributed to his role as a pathologist in the investigation of vCJD.
No previous case of vCJD has been contracted by this route. Further
information and the results of laboratory investigation are awaited.
