Abstract
--------
Oseltamivir ('Tamiflu') is the most widely used drug against influenza
infections and is extensively stockpiled worldwide as part of pandemic
preparedness plans. However, resistance is a growing problem and in
2008-2009, seasonal human influenza A/H1N1 virus strains in most parts
of the world carried the mutation H274Y in the neuraminidase gene,
which causes resistance to the drug.

The active metabolite of oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), is
poorly degraded in sewage treatment plants and surface water and has
been detected in aquatic environments where the natural influenza
reservoir, dabbling ducks, can be exposed to the substance. To assess
if resistance can develop under these circumstances, we infected
mallards with influenza A/H1N1 virus and exposed the birds to 80
nanograms/liter, 1 micrograms/liter and 80 micrograms/liter of OC
through their sole water source. By sequencing the neuraminidase gene
from fecal samples, we found that H274Y occurred at micrograms/liter
of OC and rapidly dominated the viral population at 80
micrograms/liter. IC50 [half maximal inhibitory concentration] for OC
was increased from 2-4 nanomoles in wild-type viruses to 400-700
nanomoles in H274Y mutants as measured by a neuraminidase inhibition
assay. This is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to OC that
has been noted among human clinical isolates carrying H274Y.

Environmental OC levels have been measured to 58-293 nanograms/liter
during seasonal outbreaks and are expected to reach
microgram/liter-levels during pandemics. Thus, resistance could be
induced in influenza viruses circulating among wild ducks. As
influenza viruses can cross species barriers, oseltamivir resistance
could spread to human-adapted strains with pandemic potential
disabling oseltamivir, a cornerstone in pandemic preparedness
planning.

We propose surveillance in wild birds as a measure to understand the
resistance situation in nature and to monitor it over time. Strategies
to lower environmental levels of OC include improved sewage treatment
and, more importantly, a prudent use of antivirals.

The authors mention an alarming scenario of direct transmission if a
high-pathogenic avian influenza virus (such as H5N1) acquires the
H274Y mutation and then adapts to humans. They raise the need for
prudent use of antivirals in medicine and suggest strategies to reduce
environmental levels of OC. They also point at surveillance in wild
bird populations as "an important measure to gain more knowledge of
the resistance situation in nature and to monitor it over time."
Laboratory-backed investigations should be included within ongoing
wildlife surveillance activities; enhancement of additional
surveillance deserves to be considered by international Public and
Animal Health institutions. - Mod.AS]
