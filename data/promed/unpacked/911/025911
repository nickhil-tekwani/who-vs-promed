A Filipino was among at least 3 new cases of chikungunya fever in Taiwan last week, a Taiwan news site reported on Wednesday [14 Aug 2013]. Taipei Times said the 3 recent patients also include a Taiwanese "who contracted the disease in the Philippines" and an Indonesian.

"Of this year's [2013] 14 cases, 10 originated in Indonesia, with 2 from the Philippines, one from Thailand and one from Singapore," the report quoted Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) official Liu Ting-ping as saying.

Liu noted many Southeast Asian countries had experienced chikungunya [virus] outbreaks this year [2013]. According to Liu, "Singapore had 488 reported cases as of 3 Aug [2013], 54 times more than the number reported during the same period last year [2012]."

Chikungunya [virus infection] has symptoms similar to dengue, with both diseases [viruses] spread by mosquitoes. Among the symptoms of chikungunya [virus infections] are fever, severe headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, and joint pains. However, chikungunya [disease] is not fatal and usually hits adults.

[This report is another example of long distance movement of individuals infected with chikungunya virus. Had any of these individuals been viremic at the time of arrival in Taiwan, there would have been a risk of ongoing, local transmission. Vector mosquitoes are present in Taiwan. Fortunately, there is no mention in the above report of local cases.
