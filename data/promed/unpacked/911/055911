MENINGOCOCCEMIA - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: HOROWITZ REPORT (04)

It appears that a Dr Len Horowitz had issued an incorrect report to the
members of the Vaccine and Health Care Networks along the lines that there
was an Ebola-like epidemic on the island. He has now issued a retraction. A
copy of his retraction was provided by a PAHO member along with
communications from others contradicting Horowitz's earlier statements. This
is being copied on ProMED-mail in case anyone had read those early and very
incorrect reports, and to allay any fears. The copy of his faulty report,
provided by Dr Horowitz, has not been included in case anyone should be
tempted to say, "But I read it on ProMED!"

Subject: No Ebola Only Meningiococcal Disease in Dominican Republic

Please find attached communications from a Dominican Republic health
official and another physician on site observer in response to my May 6,
1996 communication entitled, "Ebola-like Outbreak in Dominican Republic?".

Initial reports of an Ebola-like outbreak were false. The outbreak was that
of a highly virulent meningiococcal disease. This illness mimicks Ebola,
however, with subcutaneous bleeding and high mortality rates. Therefore, it
is easy to understand how and why local citizens feared they were under
Ebola attack and were concerned for their lives.

The attached e-mails do not confirm CDC activity in the area as was
initially reported to me. Nor do the messages discuss farm animal fatalities
as my information source said was observed.

I appreciate the attached responses, both official and independent, as an
effort to shed light on this matter of international affair. I relay this
information to you, as requested, once again, in an effort to pass important
health information along. So please pass this message on to others in your
network.

I have relayed my sincere condolence for any economic loss sustained by the
Dominican Republic that attention to this matter has brought.

Given the times we live in, however, anticipating increasing worldwide
outbreaks of infectious diseases, including those from biological weapons,
individual and network vigilance is prudent.

Yours in the spirit of health,

Len Horowitz, D.M.D., M.A., M.P.H.

This is the response from Dominican Republic Health Official

Mr. Len Horowitz,

I have received a copy of your internet message (May 15, 1997) on a supposed
outbreak produced for an Ebola like virus in Dominican Republic, and a
supposed intervention of CDC (USA) officials. We have inform to national
authorities of health about this rumour and we have joined to them for
search any related information on this matter.
I would like to inform you that according to national authorities of health,
National Society of Pediatricians, National Society of Neurologist,
Dominican Medical Association, and National Epidemiologycal Surveillance
System, no outbreak or case compatible to the clinical and epidemiological
profile that you have depicted in your internet message has been reported in
Dominican Republic.

There is no evidence of any biological weapons or terrorist attack in any way.

They have also reported that no CDC officials have participated in any
action as you described. No limitations of traffic of persons or vehicles
has been stablished in any place of the country for national and
international travelers.

Considering that this kind of rumours could be very dangerous for the
tourism in caribbean region, and they could alarm the populations in
differents countries, we would like to ask you to reproduce and distribute
this message to the same networks that you delivered the initial message.

We would also like to suggest you to try to obtain a confirmation of this
kind of alarmist rumours before spreading them.

For any aditional informations you could consider to reach the National
Department of Epidemiology of Dominican Republic by: SESPAS1@codetel.net.do

You could also contact to us by:CASTELLP@cclink.paho.org

Sincerely,

Dr. Pedro L. Castellanos
Epidemiologist.

[2] "(This is from a physician I've been corresponding with whose English is
less that perfect)"

I am a physician, born in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic;
graduated at Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo and trained in Internal
Medicine at The University of Maryland Affiliated Hospitals with a
subspecialty training on Medical; Oncology at Harbor UCLA Medical Center. By
accident, I was visiting my mother in
SPM (which Mr. Bell report as one of the cities affected by the epidemic) from
May 1 to May 5 and have first hand, on the field, information of the
meningoccocemia in D.R. It is true that several people have been affected of
the disease, but this has been handled in the same way that any other
country of the world including USA. Rifampin 600 mg. PO Q12H for 4 doses has
been given as chemoprophylasis to all the close contacts of the patients;
and the Health authorities has recommend to treat immediately with high
doses PCN any pts. with Sx. of the disease. During our visit
to D.R., as well by phone after we return, we had discussed the so call
epidemic
with several close friends in and out of the medical field, visited SPM, Sabana
Grande de Boya, Villa Mella, San Cristobal, and NO ONE, again NO ONE
INCLUDING MYSELF, has seen all the Science Fiction scenes described by Mr.
Bell and Dr Horowitz.

Please, read the newsgroup soc.culture.dominican.rep, or ask the member of
the mailing list dom-rep@list.uoregon.edu and all of them will laugh at Mr.
Bell reports due to its inaccuracy.

Angel.
