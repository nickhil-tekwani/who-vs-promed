Use of adulterated ice is rampant in juice parlours in Kozhikode district. The number of people with jaundice symptoms in Thalakkulathur grama panchayat in Kozhikode district is going up as the Health Department suspects that the "welcome drink" served at a private party had led to the outbreak. 23 more people were diagnosed with jaundice on Sat 16 Jun 2018, taking the total number of affected persons to 84. Health officials claimed that only those who had the welcome drink at the function on 12 May 2018 were showing the symptoms.

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree told The Hindu that one jaundice-affected person was suspected to have served the drink to those who attended the party. Around 2000 people were reported to have participated in the feast. Those who had lunch, however, did not show any symptoms.

"The incubation period is 45-50 days. More cases may crop up in the coming days," Dr. Jayasree said. The 1st cases were reported on 11 Jun 2018. Precautionary measures to avoid the disease spreading from the affected persons to others were being taken now, she added.

Sources in the department said adulterated ice blocks were reportedly used while mixing the drink. Many of the ice factories are unaware of the hygienic practices to be followed while making ice blocks. Some of them supply ice blocks to fishers to be used for cold storage. It is reported that the same ice blocks are being sold in the market to be used at private parties.

Meanwhile, Health workers continued activities to create awareness among local residents. They also inspected juice parlors, bakeries, and restaurants in the area, and 3 of them were served notices under the Public Health Act.

[Although another publication specifically stated that the etiology of this cluster of jaundice is caused by hepatitis A, with cases only starting to occur 24 days after the exposure, it is more likely, especially if the cases are in adults, that the pathogen is the hepatitis E virus. HEV is waterborne and much more likely to cause outbreaks in adults in the developing world than HAV would be. Almost 100 percent of the population in the developing world is seropositive for HAV by the age of 10 years.
