WA [Western Australia] grain growers are being warned that stem rust
has been observed in a 700-hectare (1730 acres) wheat crop at
Warralakin in the eastern wheatbelt and are being asked to be
vigilant checking their own crops. David Keamy of Merredin Rural
Supplies found the rust in less than 10 percent of the crop, with the
infection averaging 5-10 pustules on leaves and stems of scattered
plants at early flag leaf emergence.

Dr Colin Wellings, plant pathologist at the Grains Research and
Development Corporation [GRDC] supported Cereal Rust Laboratory
[CRL], University of Sydney, described stem rust as "a disease to be
nervous about." "It could represent the beginnings of an epidemic if
conditions are favourable," he said. "Optimal average daily
temperatures are 18-30 deg C [64.4-86 deg F] and the latent period,
which is the time between infection and production of new spores, is
8 to 12 days. If moisture conditions become favourable, we could have
a problem."

Samples are now being typed at CRL, but the process takes 3 weeks. Dr
Wellings said Yitpi, a wheat variety grown in WA and widespread in
the Mallee region of SA [South Australia], is vulnerable to stem rust.

Under favourable conditions, stem rust outbreaks could destroy up to
70 percent of a susceptible wheat crop, according to Dr Rohan
Rainbow, GRDC Manager, Crop Protection. "The Warralakin outbreak is a
classic example of green bridge proximity, where small patches of
self-sown Yitpi, with advanced heading plants, spread the disease to
the sown crop," Dr Rainbow said. "After this season's [2008] harvest,
growers should be careful with variety selection for next year and
make informed choices based on several factors, including degree of
rust resistance."

[Wheat stem rust (also called black rust) is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Yield losses of up to 70
percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. If stem
rust arrives early in the growing cycle, losses are higher. Spores
are spread by wind and with infected straw, but the fungus needs
living tissue to survive between seasons. Volunteer wheat plants
forming a 'green bridge' are often a source of infection for a new crop.

New pathogen races are emerging with increased virulence. The most
dangerous at present is strain Ug99, which is spreading eastwards on
prevailing winds from its origin in Uganda. At this time Ug99 has not
spread beyond the Middle East, nevertheless the typing of the strain
in WA which is currently in progress is important. For more
information on stem rust and Ug99 please see previous ProMED-mail
