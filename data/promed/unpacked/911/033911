West Nile Virus Detected in Lake County Blue Jay
------------------------------------------------
COLUMBUS: A Lake County blue jay is the first positive indicator that West
Nile virus has officially arrived in Ohio, according to state and local
health officials. No human cases have been found. While this is the first
time West Nile virus, a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, has been
identified in the state, it is not unexpected.
The first confirmed bird incidence of West Nile virus in the state was
located in southern Lake County in Concord Township. It was confirmed
through testing by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in
Madison, Wisc., marking the farthest west the virus has been identified,
said Dr. Robert McLean, chief of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center.
"It's not very surprising to see the virus continue its spread along the
shores of Lake Erie. Last year, a pool of mosquitoes carrying the virus was
identified 2 counties away in Erie County, Pennsylvania and positive birds
were also found in western New York," McLean said, adding that the bird was
likely infected locally and did not fly to Lake County carrying the virus.
"Blue jays are short-distance migrants and they generally stay in the same
area during the summer breeding season. So we think the bird was infected
nearby."
"The state's arboviral surveillance system is designed to provide us with
the necessary information about the infected areas so we can take the
appropriate steps," according to Richard Berry, chair of the state's West
Nile virus Workgroup and chief of the Vector-Borne Disease Program. The
statewide West Nile Virus Workgroup, consisting of representatives from
Ohio Department of Health, the Ohio departments of Natural Resources and
Agriculture, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and federal and local
partners has been working since last year to develop a statewide West Nile
virus plan. As part of the planning, a statewide surveillance program was
instituted that helped detect the disease and includes guidelines for
mosquito control. Mosquito spraying is done on a local basis, and Lake
County has an existing mosquito control program.
