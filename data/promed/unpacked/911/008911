Cases of Hepatitis E are on the rise in South Sudan's Lakes state, with about 100 people diagnosed with the disease, the United Nations humanitarian coordination agency (OCHA) said. Two cases of the disease, OCHA said, were initially recorded in April 2014 and 52 in June 2014. At least 4 people have died at Lakes state's Mingkaman internally displaced camp, OCHA said in its latest bulletin.

John Parach, a local administrator, told Sudan Tribune that the disease has affected both the host population and those displaced, forcing them to flee from the area. He said poor sanitation and regular flooding caused by rainwater that destroyed toilets have accelerated the spread of the viral disease. "This place is lowland, and many of the toilets built in February 2014 were not good enough. Most of them went down when heavy rains started; feces went randomly with the water, contaminating people around; this increased the level of infection," Parach said by phone. Those affected, he said, are being handled by Medicines San Frontiers (MSF) at its health center in Mingkaman, with women and children said to be the most affected. "There is no cure for this disease; people died due to liver failure. Nobody has died since July 2014," said Parach.

[The following is from WHO regarding the disease (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/):

Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus.

Transmission
------------
The hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route due to faecal contamination of drinking water. Other transmission routes have been identified, which include:

- foodborne transmission from ingestion of products derived from infected animals;
- transfusion of infected blood products;
- vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus.

Although humans are considered the natural host for the hepatitis E virus, antibodies to the hepatitis E virus or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and several other animal species.

Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks. The ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has also been identified as the source of sporadic cases in endemic areas.

The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation in large areas of the world and shedding of the hepatitis E virus in feces. - Mod.LL
