Regarding the recent Ecuador leptospirosis cases and the 1995 outbreaks in
Nicaragua, has there been any follow-up of diagnosed patients exhibiting
neuropsychiatric sequelae? The question is prompted, in part, by the
following item from S. Faine's textbook, "Leptospira and Leptospirosis."
"A number of patients suffer prolonged mental symptoms after leptospirosis,
ranging from mood changes, irritability and irrational thoughts to
dementia, serious psychosis and depression. Inability to concentrate or to
carry out skilled tasks may affect employability. The condition may persist
for several months to two or more years; it may be permanent. The
relationship of such changes to physical effects of leptospirosis,
including the cerebral arteritis mentioned above, is not well documented.
In order to incriminate leptospirosis as a cause of the mental condition,
the initial diagnosis must be proved, and the symptoms date clearly from
after the time of recovery from the illness." Leptospira and Leptospirosis.
S. Faine. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 1994. The chapter on clinical
leptospirosis is available on-line at:
<http://www.monash.edu.au/informatics/micro/department/clinlep5.htm>.
According to Vinetz, et al., two of three leptospirosis patients in
Baltimore, Maryland (USA) presented with meningitis, and the organism can
be PCR'd from the brains of infected rats. (Vinetz JM, Glass GE, Flexner
CE, Mueller P, Kaslow DC. Sporadic urban leptospirosis. Ann. Intern. Med.
1996;125(10):794-798.) Given suggested infection rates in Baltimore and
Detroit, and the likelihood that leptospirosis is the most common
rat-transmitted infectious disease in the U.S., are cases of U.S. urban
leptospirosis going undetected because of 1) inadequate diagnostics, and 2)
nothing but mental symptoms upon patient examination?

[There never was a final report issued on the leptospirosis problem in
Nicaragua. Enquiries at PAHO have always been turned aside with mild
embarrassment, but maybe I had asked the wrong group. My experience with
this disease is that for every hospitalised case, which carry significant
CFRs, there are 30+ mild domestic cases, usually dismissed as pyrexias of
unknown origin, i.e. aspirin problems. It is a zoonosis with higher
economic costs, for humans and livestock, than are appreciated. Comments
addressed to Edward's question are welcomed. - Mod.MHJ
