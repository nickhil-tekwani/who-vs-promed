As far as the outbreak in Kiambu is concerned, I am horrified but do
believe the story. Kiambu was one of the areas where the outbreak in
1994/5 occurred. There is quite a lot of backyard pig farming there. I
would be most interested to know where the outbreak came from. In
1994/5 the outbreaks were not warthog-associated (as one expects in
Kenya), but were considered with reasonable certainty to have
originated from pigs brought from the Ugandan border (or probably
from Uganda itself) for slaughter at one of the 2 smaller abattoirs.
These abattoirs sell offal from slaughtered pigs as feed.
The statement that ASF virus will not affect people because pork is
cooked is wrong, of course. It will not affect people, period! Products
such as smoked hams, salamis, sausages, etc. can contain large
amounts of infective virus for long periods, and people eat them with
impunity, but pigs do not. Swill feeding is common in backyard
operations in Kenya and everywhere else, and I am sure the cooking of
swill that followed the 1994/95 outbreaks has long been abandoned.
People forget fast. However, other possible sources are offal from
abattoirs or even pigs brought for slaughter and then sold live instead --
that also happens.
Kenya, in common with many (most?) other African governments,
cannot afford to compensate pig owners for compulsory slaughter,
which does not help at all. In fact, in 1996, the legislation fixed
compensation at 63 ksh (there are at least 80 ksh to the dollar), as per
the law passed in 1960. The owners would not have been impressed
[by that sum, but as the vets told me, it didn't arise because [the
government could not afford even that!
Kenya has a very sophisticated small pig industry [with a top-grade
abattoir to supply the tourist hotels. They produce their own top-grade
pigs under excellent conditions, but they do supplement by buying pigs
from small-scale producers. So one cannot be absolutely sure that swill
from top hotels is OK, even though infection of the Farmers Choice
pigs themselves is unlikely. The trouble is that pigs can shed virus for
up to 48 hours before they show any sign of disease, [and so may
easily pass slaughter inspection.
My colleague at FAO asked me whether I think the increased reporting
of ASF is due to our efforts at sensitisation or a genuine increase in the
incidence of the disease. I have told him that, much as I would like us
to share the credit, I do really think ASF is on the increase, in response,
especially, to increased peri-urban pig production. The price of pork
has more than doubled in The Gambia since the 2000 outbreaks that
decimated the pigs, and you can bet your life people will obtain pigs
just anywhere, in any state (dead or alive), to sell the meat. And our
borders in Africa are not just soft, they're fluffy!
