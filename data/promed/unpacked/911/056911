The Agriculture Ministry yesterday reassured the public that ducks found
dead at the Athalassa Lake in Nicosia were not infected with bird flu. [Map

An emergency meeting was yesterday held by Agriculture Minister Fotis
Fotiou, who informed officials of the Veterinary Services, Forestry
Department and Games Service that the dead birds were not infected by bird flu.
The ducks are believed to have died after being infected by _Clostridium
botulinum_, a soil bacterium that cannot be spread from animal to animal or
from animal to humans.
_Cl. botulinum_ causes the production of [botulinum], which is a potent
toxin that blocks nerve function and leads to respiratory and
musculoskeletal paralysis.
Fotiou yesterday informed officials that the ducks appeared to have drunk
water from a small puddle left in the dried-out lake and became infected
from the bacteria.
According to health officials, samples have already been sent to Rome and
London for tests to have the results officially confirmed by 2nd and 3rd
sources.
"I would like to assure the public that the discovery of [these] bacteria
does not pose a public health threat to anyone," said the Minister.
He added: "However, as a necessary precaution, the authorities are taking
all the appropriate measures."

[Botulism in waterfowl is generally caused by one of 2 toxin types. Type E
toxin is found primarily in decaying fish and causes intoxication in those
feeding on them. It may also cause intoxication in humans.
Type C toxin, on the other hand, is not related to fish. It occurs in
carcasses of dead invertebrates, in the flesh of birds dying of botulism,
and in maggots feeding on toxic carcasses. Type C, which is regarded as
responsible for most outbreaks in waterfowl world-wide, does not pose a
risk to humans.
Identification of the causative toxin in the outbreak in Cyprus will be
helpful. - Mod.AS]
