The two most recent cases of cholera have been recorded in Mariches and
Caucaguita in the town of Sucre. The director of Epidemiology of the
Ministry of Health, Francisco Araoz, reported that in the Caracas
metropolitan area in the past three weeks, 27 cases of cholera and one death
have been reported.
The Mayor, Raoul Bermudez, explained that the persons infected were fruit and
vegetable sellers in the Coche market. The city health department has
distributed saline for rehydration, chlorine, and brochures on how to prevent
the disease among the areas affected.
Araoz said that in a meeting with regional health directors there was
agreement to increase preventative measures owing to the rains and the water
quality that increases the appearance of the [bacterium].
[from El Universal, 22 July 1997, Caracas, Venezuela]
In the state of Miranda, 12 cases have been recorded, since last Friday the
first two cases were reported in Victorino Santaella Hospital, both coming
from neighborhood of El Nacional in Los Teques.
Irene Engelke, head of the Department of Epidemiology of the Health
Department of the State of Miranda, reported that 8 cases were reported in
the area of Los Eucaliptus coming from the neighborhood of El Nacional, one
in Carrizal, two in Caucauita and one in Ocumare del Tuy.
Miranda state health authorities ordered a quarantine of the areas affected,
and medical personal carried out programs of disease prevention. The
operation pertains to those areas where a patient lives and extends 200
meters into the surrounding area.
In addition to the provision of saline, etc. mentioned above, rifampicin is
being given out as well.
