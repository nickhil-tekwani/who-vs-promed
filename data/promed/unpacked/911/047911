Red alert on lethal yellowing
------------------------------
Concerns over lethal yellowing [LY], a fatal disease affecting
coconut trees, have resurfaced in San Pedro [Ambergris Caye]
following new reports of its presence all around the island. The
continued spread of the lethal yellowing disease in Belize is
generating justifiable fears about the future of coconuts.
Informed sources close to the issue say that the infection is
widespread and has been detected in Northern Belize since 1992. It is
estimated that around 50 percent and rising of the Tall coconut palms
in Belize have been infected by lethal yellowing, and its spread is
considered rapid. The disease has reportedly intensified over the
past years. As lethal yellowing continues to spread throughout the
Cayes, the effects are very visible. Almost all of the Tall variety
of coconut trees are expected to die.
The only practical solution for the control of lethal yellowing is
the continuous planting of resistant varieties; that is the Malayan
Dwarf variety and its hybrids, both of which have high levels of
resistance. The disease can be effectively controlled by trunk
injecting an antibiotic palm formula (oxytetracycline) for a minimum
of 3 injections per year. This is a long-term project and needs to be
continued once it is started.
On Ambergris Caye, LY is widespread from the Holiday Lands area south
of San Pedro town to north by Mexico Rocks where most of the coconut
trees are damaged and destroyed, but records show that the island has
the highest concentration of treated trees and the least damage from
lethal yellowing. Caye Caulker is infected evenly throughout the
Caye, St George's Caye is devastated, Middle Caye, and Long Caye at
Glover's Reef are also highly infected and further stats show that 95
percent of the trees in Corozal and Orange Walk [mainland] Districts
have died, while 60 to 70 percent have died or are symptomatic in the
mainland Belize District. Coconut palms are a vital part of the
subsistence agriculture in many tropical coastal areas. The trees
require very few inputs, yet provide food, fuel, shelter, and
property beautification as well.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) was first reported from the Caribbean region.
By 1981, it had killed 90 percent of the Jamaican Tall variety of
coconut palms in Jamaica. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_
Phytoplasma palmae), and the planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected
to be the vector. Seed-transmission of the pathogen cannot be
excluded. The LY phytoplasma was recently reported to be present in
weed species, which may serve as reservoir hosts. LY affects many
palm species causing premature nut drop, blackening of
inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually
within 4 to 6 months. LY has been spreading in the Americas and parts
of Africa, while in Asia, there are a number of coconut diseases
suspected to be caused by related phytoplasmas.
New outbreaks or sudden intensification of the disease have been
reported on several occasions in LY affected areas, but it is usually
not known what triggers them. Theories surrounding hurricanes
distributing vector insects or emerging environmental stress factors
making palms more susceptible to vector attacks have been put forward
but so far could not be proven. Alternatively, new pathogen strains
with increased virulence may be emerging.
LY symptoms can be suppressed by regular trunk injections of
tetracyclines if they commence at or before the very earliest signs
of disease. This treatment is not a cure, but it keeps palms alive
despite the pathogen. It is costly because it is very labour
intensive, depending on constant monitoring for new infections and
continuity of treatments. It is therefore mostly used in private
gardens or to save individual palms of significance. The palms in
Belize are obviously regarded as very valuable (perhaps for tourism)
to justify tetracycline treatment on the large scale described above.
Commercial control of LY relies on replanting with resistant
varieties. The Malayan Dwarf varieties are highly resistant to LY and
were used to create a number of resistant hybrids. The level of
resistance of a specific cultivar may vary according to the region
where it is grown. Unfortunately, resistance breakdown of some widely
used hybrids has recently been reported in Jamaica, but the reasons
for this phenomenon are unknown. This is causing great concern for
coconut replanting programmes worldwide and appears to have
encouraged surveys to determine the current LY status in a number of
countries, like the one reported here for Belize.
