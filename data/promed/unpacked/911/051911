Croatia: Tick bites provoke health scare
----------------------------------------
A total of 6 people are in a serious condition in a Croatian clinic
after being infected by tick bites, Croatian media said on Thursday [1
Jul 2010]. 5 of the 6 are reportedly in a coma.

"Five people are connected to artificial respirators and their
recovery is uncertain," doctor Bruno Barsic told the media. The 6th
patient is in better condition and his life is not in danger, he added.

The patients, aged between 30 and 70, are from northern Croatia and
were bitten by ticks carrying meningoencephalitis [tick-borne
encephalitis virus] which causes a serious brain infection, Barsic said.

A total of 11 people from rural areas have been hospitalised for tick
bites this year [2010], but the latest cases are more serious.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is one of the major human
pathogenic flaviviruses and causes disease that can impact on public
health in endemic countries. TBE is caused by 3 different subtypes of
tick-borne encephalitis virus: Western European TBE virus, Far Eastern
TBE virus and Siberian TBE virus.

Western European TBE (also known as Central European encephalitis) is
endemic in western and central European countries, and is particularly
common in forest and mountainous regions of Austria, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Switzerland, western Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Croatia and Slovenia.
It occurs at a lower frequency in Denmark, France, Liechtenstein,
Italy, Norway, the Aland archipelago and neighbouring Finnish
coastline, and along the coastline of southern Sweden, from Uppsala to
Karlshamn.

Thousands of cases of TBE occur each year from late spring to early
autumn. This type of TBE is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_
and outbreaks often follow periods when voles (the principal
reservoir) and ticks are numerous (May-June and September-October).
TBE is a vaccine-preventable disease. For further information see:
<http://www.nathnac.org/pro/factsheets/tick_borne.htm#Risk>.

Travellers to forested ares of Croatia should be aware of the need to
avoid tick bites.

Confirmation of the suspected diagnosis would be appreciated.
