[HPAI subtype H5N6 has been circulating in China since 2014, and since that time, the subtype has been reported by several countries in Asia (see reports below) occurring in both poultry and wild birds.

"The Asian lineage H5N6 causes severe clinical signs in poultry and associated mortality. Detection of HPAI H5N6 virus in migratory bird species pose a potential threat for the dissemination of this virus by wild birds outside Asia.

This group of H5N6 viruses has also been associated with human infection, including a number of deaths. A total of 16 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 6 deaths, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/OIE_SituationReport_AI_18September2017.pdf
