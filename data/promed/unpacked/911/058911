Cambodian officials warn of widespread dengue in 2009
-----------------------------------------------------
Cambodian health officials have warned of a possible outbreak of dengue
fever next year [2009] as the number of children seeking treatment
continues into the disease's low season, state media reported Thursday [4
Dec 2008].

"Everyday, the hospital still receives more than 20 children with dengue
fever," Lam Eng Hour, deputy director of Phnom Penh's Kantha Bopha
children's hospital, was quoted by the Phnom Penh Post as saying. "We are
worried this is a sign that the number (of infections) will be higher next
year [2009]," he added.

According to Lam Eng Hour, Kantha Bopha hospitals in both Phnom Penh and
Siem Reap have received 5552 dengue cases so far this year [2008], of which
43 have been fatal. He said that despite being a dramatic decrease from
last year's [2007] 23 000 cases, children lining up for dengue treatment
this late in the year [2008] is a bad sign for 2009. "An outbreak can
happen every 2 years," he said.

National statistics from January to November this year [2008] showed that
throughout the country 8783 cases have been recorded by national and Kntha
Bopha hospitals, Ngan Chantha, the national dengue control program director
at the Ministry of Health, told the Post.

[To date, a total of 5552 cases and 43 deaths attributable to dengue fever
have been identified in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. This is the 1st report on
dengue fever from Cambodia in 2008. Nearly 40 000 cases of dengue fever and
400 fatalities were reported in Cambodia during 2007 (see PRO/MBDS posting
Dengue - Cambodia: 2007 20080106.0076).

The dengue fever activity in Viet Nam is still increasing with a total 78
512 cases and 79 fatalities during 2008 (see PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet
Nam (20) 20081126.3720).

[2] France ex Mali
Date: Fri 5 Dec 2008
From: Marc Grandadam <marc.grandadam@pasteur.fr>


In November 2008 dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever suspected cases were
declared in Kayes region, Mali (ProMED-mail: 20081114.3582). In this report
preliminary testing results confirmed dengue disease as a possible cause of
Kayes' outbreak. However, diagnosis methods (serology and/or RT-PCR
[reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction], viral culture) were not
yet specified. Serotyping of dengue virus was also lacking in this study.
Finally, the burden of the outbreak and the proportion of severe forms were
not fully documented. Considering the recent emergence of dengue [virus]
serotype 3 in Cote d'Ivoire (ProMED-mail: 20080808.2446, 20080818.2573, and
20080820.2597), efforts are needed to better evaluate the risks of a huge
dengue epidemic in western Africa.

As suggested in a recent message (ProMED-mail: 20001114.3582) relevant
information could be retrieved from diagnosis and investigation of imported
cases from Africa. In 2008, a 1st dengue imported case from Mali has been
diagnosed in France and reported through mandatory notification (onset of
symptoms [7 Jul 2008]). This 1st case was positive in IgM but serotyping
was not performed. On [14 Nov 2008], a 23 year old individual returning
from a 3 week stay in Bamako city was hospitalized in Paris for an acute
dengue-like syndrome with fever, cutaneous rash, and thrombopenia.
Serological investigations revealed the presence of anti-flavivirus
antibodies (that is, dengue; West Nile; yellow fever) cross-reactive IgM
and IgG. Real-time PCR assay detected genomic RNA of dengue 2 virus in
serum samples. Experiments are currently undertaken to characterize the
infecting strain of dengue virus in imported case.

To date, no obvious argument supports a possible link between Bamako's
human case and those distantly separated declared in the mining area of
Kayes in the same period of time. However, important economical exchanges
occur between the capital and the industrialized region of Kayes. Such
situation might greatly favor the circulation of dengue virus and/or
infected vectors throughout the country. Improved knowledge on the viral
sequences of imported and autochthonous cases will provide new insight on
the genetics of circulating strains of dengue virus in Mali. As the
introduction of a new serotype in an African country could have an
important epidemic potential and be associated with a higher proportion of
severe forms, it is also essential to characterize the extent of the
epidemic and to specify severity.

need for good laboratory support of clinical observations from the field.
