Avian influenza H5N1 in tigers and leopards in Thailand

[Yang Li is cordially acknowledged for his help. The dispatch of the said
"Ahead of print" paper is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no12/04-0759.htm>.
The paper provides histopathological and immunohistochemical evidence of
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in leopard lung and phylogenetic comparison
of zoo felid isolates with other H5N1 viruses.
The authors conclude:
"Our findings in tigers and leopards extend the host range of this virus
and, together with the findings in domestic cats, suggest that this H5N1
virus is more pathogenic for felids than other influenza viruses. This
finding has important implications for wildlife conservation and influenza
virus epidemiology. 1st, H5N1 virus infection may threaten the survival of
endangered felids, as has been shown recently for other emerging viruses in
susceptible wildlife. The severity of this threat is increased, because
H5N1 virus may be transmitted horizontally between domestic cats. 2nd, if
the higher pathogenicity of H5N1 virus for felids also means longer
excretion of more virus, the role of felids in avian influenza
epidemiology, both in humans and in poultry, needs to be reevaluated.
Finally, the confirmation of H5N1 virus infection as the probable cause of
death in 2 other mammalian hosts besides humans implies that more species
of mammals may be at risk for infection with this virus."
The paper is based upon the investigations in 2 tigers (_Panthera tigris_)
and 2 leopards (_P. pardus_), which died unexpectedly at a zoo in
Suphanburi, Thailand in December 2003, after showing clinical signs
including high fever and respiratory distress.
This incident underlines the importance of disease information, from all
available sources on all animal species, to enhance early detection of
emerging infectious diseases. The described cases in felidae in the
Suphanburi zoo occurred at least a month before the Thai authorities
acknowledged the presence of HPAI in poultry. Rumors on the spread of the
disease in poultry were initially denied (see 20040109.0097). Following the
published reporting of Thailand's 1st suspected H5N1 human cases, on 22 Jan
2004, the Thai animal-health authorities sent to the OIE, on 23 Jan 2004,
the official report on HPAI in poultry. - Mod.AS].
