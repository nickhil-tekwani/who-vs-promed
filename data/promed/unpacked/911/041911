Egypt's top prosecutor ordered on [Wed 22 Oct 2014] a swift investigation into the 178 cases of food poisoning reported in 2 primary schools in Suez.

Ayman Samir, the ministry of education's media official in Suez, told Aswat Masriya that the poisoning was caused by the consumption of milk provided by the schools. He added that the ministry's deputy to Suez, Abdel Hafez Waheed, halted the distribution of milk to all schools in the governorate until the milk's validity is ensured.

At least 3 outbreaks of food poisoning occurred at al-Azhar University between April and May 2013. Over 700 cases of food poisoning were detected in the university's male dorms.

[It is necessary to know the incubation period related to the milk ingestion and the symptom complex related to fever, vomiting, and or diarrhea to assess the potential etiology of the illnesses. Many infections can be associated with unpasteurized milk as seen in the "See Also" list below. Pasteurized milk can also transmit infections if the pasteurization is not adequate or contamination occurs after the process. Illnesses can also be related to toxins rather than infection.

Suez (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez) is a seaport city in north eastern Egypt, located on the north coast of the Gulf of Suez (a branch of the Red Sea), near the southern terminus of the Suez Canal, having the same boundaries as Suez governorate. - Mod.LL
