I have been following the news regarding the rise of leishmaniasis cases
after the volcanic eruption on the western province of Nicaragua (Leon).
An article in a Nicaraguan newspaper (La Prensa 13/9/99) (sic) reported that
the
Ministry of Health carried out an investigation (by the Director of the
National Dermatologic Center) and found 56 cases from different ages in a
camp for displaced people in Malpaisillo. The clinical lesions were on the
face, upper and lower extremities and back. Some patients presented
several nodular lesions and others only one, none of them with ulceration.
The clinical diagnosis was Atypical American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis but
more studies are still being done. A number of this type of leishmaniasis
cases were identified in the same region as early as February 1997 and
even then were already being followed up by the local health authorities.
The Ministry is still investigating if more persons are affected, and if
there might be a genetic predisposition of the disease in these people.
***
But I think this purported rise (epidemic) it is not related to the
volcanic activity. A lot of these people have had the disease previously
and it is only now that they have been detected in such high numbers that
they have been grouped together in the shelters and attended to.
