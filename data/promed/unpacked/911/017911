[1] South Carolina: cow, human exposure; skunk, dog exposure

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control says 2 recent encounters with rabid animals have exposed both people and pets to rabies.

According to DHEC, a cow located near Nance Street and Dennis Dairy Road in Newberry tested positive for rabies. DHEC is investigating the potential for multiple human and animal exposures, and anyone known to have had potential exposure to the rabid cow has been referred to their healthcare providers. The cow was submitted to the agency's lab for testing on 12 Nov [2020] and confirmed to have rabies on 13 Nov [2020].

The 2nd incident involved a skunk found near Mt. Pleasant Road and Ringer Road in Pomeria. The skunk was submitted to DHEC's lab for testing on16 Nov [2020] and the next day [17 Nov 2020] was confirmed to have rabies. While there were no known human exposures, a pet dog was exposed. The dog was never vaccinated for rabies, and now DHEC says the owners are considering euthanasia.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals plenty of space," said David Vaughan, director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it since the possibility of exposure to rabies can occur anywhere and anytime. Contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator."

If you believe you or someone you know has had contact with or been potentially exposed to these animals or another suspect animal, you're asked to reach out to your local Environmental Affairs office. An exposure is defined as a bite, a scratch, or contact with saliva or body fluids from an infected or possibly infected animal.

If your pet or livestock are found with wounds of unknown origin, DHEC asks you to consider your pet or livestock could have been exposed to rabies and contact the Columbia office at (803) 896-0620 during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday). To report a bite or exposure on holidays or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number at (888) 847-0902.

DHEC reminds animal and livestock owners it's important to keep animals up to date on rabies vaccinations. The cow and skunk are the 11th and 12th animals in Newberry County to test positive for rabies in 2020. There have been 158 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2020]. Since 2011, South Carolina has averaged approximately 130 positive cases a year. In 2019, 5 of the 148 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Newberry County.

Police on Friday [20 Nov 2020] notified residents a rabid cat was found in the township. The stray cat was found Wednesday (18 Nov 2020) by an animal control officer in the 1900 block of South Cologne Avenue after it had been struck by a car, police said in a news release. According to a separate news release from Atlantic County, the cat bit the officer as he was removing it from the road.

The cat was taken for evaluation and then euthanized due to the extent of its injuries, county spokeswoman Linda Gilmore said. The state lab confirmed the cat tested positive for rabies Friday [20 Nov 2020]. The animal control officer has been treated for rabies exposure, Gilmore said.

Atlantic County officials said it was the 5th rabies case identified in Atlantic County this year [2020] and the 3rd in the township.

The township advises residents to avoid feeding or touching feral or wild animals and encourages them to keep up to date with their pets' rabies vaccinations.

The Atlantic County Animal Shelter will hold its next free rabies vaccination clinics for dogs 6 Dec and 13 Dec [2020] by appointment only. Appointments can be made at <aclink.org/animalshelter>.

Falmouth Police are advising caution about potentially aggressive wild animals after a Falmouth resident was attacked and bitten by a rabid raccoon on 11 Nov [2020] while walking through the Woodlands Country Club trail system.

The raccoon was later captured and tested positive for rabies. The Falmouth Police Department is asking residents to be wary of any aggressive characteristics in wild animals and to report them if the behavior is observed. The department has not received any other calls regarding possibly rabid animals.

Information on rabies is available on the Center for Disease Control's website (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html).

[Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease. It can spread to people and pets if they are bitten or scratched by a rabid animal. In the United States, rabies is mostly found in wild animals like bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. However, in many other countries, dogs still carry rabies, and most rabies deaths in people around the world are caused by dog bites.

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start.

Rabies virus is transmitted through direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected animal.

People usually get rabies from the bite of a rabid animal. It is also possible, but rare, for people to get rabies from non-bite exposures, which can include scratches, abrasions, or open wounds exposed to saliva or other potentially infectious material from a rabid animal.

In the United States, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your health-care provider as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm like a flu or tetanus vaccine; rabies vaccines are not given in the stomach.

After a bite or other rabies exposure, the rabies virus has to travel through the body to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between the exposure and the appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period, and it may last for weeks to months. The incubation period may vary based on the location of the exposure site (how far away it is from the brain), the type of rabies virus, and any existing immunity.

The 1st symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu, including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.

There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite, progressing within days to acute symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia. The acute period of disease typically ends after 2-10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. To date, fewer than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been documented, and only a few survivors had no history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis.

The signs, symptoms, and outcome of rabies in animals can vary, but are often similar to those in humans, including early nonspecific symptoms, acute neurologic symptoms, and ultimately death.

Consequently, one can see why preventing rabies is so very important. Please vaccinate your pets, for your protection and for theirs. Be cautious of wild animals or animals unknown to you. - Mod.TG
