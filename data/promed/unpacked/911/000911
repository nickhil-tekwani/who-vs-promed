A deadly strain of avian influenza has spread to a 2nd location in Newfoundland. Federal officials confirmed Sunday [9 Jan 2022] H5N1 bird flu killed chickens in a small backyard flock.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] says avian flu has killed chickens at a small, backyard farm on the Avalon Peninsula. "This backyard flock owner had just a few chickens and ducks," Dr. Mary-Jane Ireland, the agency's chief veterinary officer, told CBC News on Tuesday [11 Jan 2022].

Last week, CBC News reported Lester's Farm Chalet in St. John's is the first operation that lost hundreds of birds to avian flu before Christmas. More than 350 birds died there and another 60 birds, including geese, peacocks and an emu, were euthanized in an effort to contain the virus.

The CFIA says 17 birds died at the 2nd location. Three were hens that were killed by the virus and the rest were ducks which were euthanized.

Ireland said both locations had ponds where farm birds could mingle with wild birds, and both owners had chickens dying suddenly.

The CFIA euthanized the surviving birds and drew out a 10-kilometre control zone around both facilities, putting them under quarantine. The agency says it continues to monitor wild and domestic birds through surveillance and sampling. Federal officials say they are also contacting farms and people with birds in the area to ask if any birds are showing signs of the disease.

Ireland says the H5N1 strain of avian influenza which was identified can, on rare occasions, cause disease in humans.

"It's almost always acquired through direct contact with infected birds and contaminated environments. Most human cases are limited to mild symptoms, like mild respiratory disease," said Ireland.

"Some (avian flu) viruses can cause severe illness. So public health officials are recommending people avoid handling live or dead birds and they are also recommending against the feeding of wild birds like ducks, gulls and pigeons at local parks."

Ireland said the strain at the 2 locations has also been identified in wild birds in Newfoundland.

"Through wild bird surveillance that has been undertaken by Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, we found 2 birds with the same virus. So we know it is in some wild birds we have sampled," she said.

Ireland called on people who keep birds to take steps to prevent them from becoming infected.

"Whether you are a commercial poultry facility or whether you own a small, backyard flock, make sure you are keeping your domestic birds away from areas frequented by wild birds and maintain strict control over access to your birds and chicken coops," she said. "Make sure equipment is cleaned and disinfected before taking it into your chicken coops or enclosures."

The CFIA suspects the source of infection at the 2 Avalon Peninsula locations is wild, aquatic, long-range, migratory birds but don't believe the virus has spread to the rest of Canada or North America.

"There have been a number of outbreaks in Europe at commercial operations and in wild birds but we do not have evidence it is in other locations," said Ireland.

[Hopefully, this disease is quickly contained and does not spread any further.

"AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: the hemagglutinin, or H proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or N proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many strains of avian influenza (AI) virus exist worldwide. These viruses affect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl as well as a wide variety of free-flying species. Migratory waterfowl have been shown to be a natural reservoir for AI. AI strains also are divided into 2 groups based upon the ability of the virus to produce disease.

"Low pathogenicity or "low path" avian influenza (LPAI)
LPAI occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds. In most cases it causes no signs of infection or only minor symptoms in birds. These strains of the disease pose little significant threat to human health. These strains are common in the US and around the world.

"Highly pathogenicity or 'high path' avian influenza (HPAI)
HPAI is often fatal in chickens and turkeys. HPAI spreads rapidly and has a higher death rate in birds than LPAI. HPAI has been detected and eradicated 3 times in US domestic poultry. HPAI H5N1 is the subtype rapidly spreading in some parts of the world. Most of the highly pathogenic AI viruses fall under types H5 or H7; however, most AI infections, including those typed as H5 or H7, are clinically of low pathogenicity. These typically produce few or no clinical signs in affected birds. Sometimes the only evidence of this virus is a minor increase in bird mortality. Aside from the possible mutation of low-pathogenicity strains under field conditions into high-pathogenicity strains, the presence of low-pathogenicity virus can also result in restrictions on exports and serious repercussions on the production economy. Avian influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes are known as notifiable avian influenza (NAI). APHIS works to keep NAI from becoming established in US poultry populations.

"Identifying infected birds
Birds infected with the HPAI virus may show one or more of the following signs:
- sudden death without clinical signs;
- lack of energy and appetite;
- decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs;
- swelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles, and hocks;
- purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs;
- nasal discharge, coughing, and sneezing;
- incoordination; or
- diarrhea.

"Epidemiology
HPAI can strike poultry quickly and spread rapidly from premises to premises. Migratory waterfowl can introduce the disease to US poultry. International visitors or smuggled birds are also risk factors. Once introduced, the disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contact with contaminated manure, equipment, vehicles, crates, and the clothing or shoes of individuals who have come in contact with the virus. The virus remains viable in the environment for long periods, particularly at lower temperatures, and it can survive indefinitely in frozen material.

"Biosecurity measures on the farm
Veterinarians should work with poultry producers to strengthen biosecurity practices. Established and enforced biosecurity protocols will help prevent introduction of HPAI and other infectious agents.

"Recommended biosecurity measures include
- establishing an 'all-in, all-out' flock-management policy;
- protecting against exposure to wild birds or water or ground contaminated by wild birds;
- closing bird areas to nonessential personnel or vehicles;
- providing employees with clean clothing and disinfection facilities and directions for their use;
- thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting equipment and vehicles (including tires and undercarriage) when entering or leaving the farm;
- banning the borrowing or lending of equipment or vehicles;
- banning visits to other poultry farms, exhibitions, fairs, and sales or swap meets (if visits must occur, direct workers to change footwear and clothing on their return); and
- banning bringing birds in slaughter channels back to the farm.

"Reporting suspicious diseases
Practitioners are encouraged to educate their poultry clientele and pet bird owners to report all signs of disease. If signs of disease resemble AI or cannot be diagnosed, they should immediately be reported to both the assistant district director and the state animal health official."(https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/NVAP-Reference-Guide/Poultry/Avian-Influenza). - Mod.TG
