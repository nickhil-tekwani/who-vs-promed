Health officials say Michigan has its 1st confirmed case this year [2018] of a mysterious paralyzing illness called acute flaccid myelitis.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced on [Wed 5 Dec 2018] it was notified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the state has a confirmed case in a child in Wayne county including Detroit and some suburbs.

A total of 7 suspected cases in Michigan are under investigation. Officials have said this year's [2018] count nationally could surpass totals seen in similar outbreaks in 2014 and 2016 .

It's not clear what's causing some children to lose the ability to move their face, neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms tend to occur about a week after the children had a fever and respiratory illness.

The number of cases of the polio-like illness acute flaccid myelitis [AFM] "appears to have peaked" for 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said [Mon 3 Dec 2018].

In its weekly update on cases of the illness, the agency said there have been 134 confirmed cases in 33 states this year [2018] [see comment]. In addition, there are 165 patients under investigation as possibly having AFM, as the illness is known.

Since 2014, when the agency began tracking cases, the illness has peaked every other year in the fall. According to the CDC, in 2014, there were 120 confirmed cases between August and December; in 2015, there were 22 confirmed cases; in 2016, there were 149 confirmed cases; and in 2017, 35 confirmed cases were reported.

The agency said on [Mon 3 Dec 2018] that it has previously seen a drop in cases in November. "That pattern appears to be repeating in 2018 because states have reported fewer PUIs [patients under investigation] over the past couple of weeks. CDC expects this decline to continue," it said on its AFM investigation website.

The update also noted that the number of cases could still change, as patients under investigation are still being classified as confirmed or not. Last week [week of 26 Nov 2018], the CDC said that more than 95% of the patients with AFM this year [2018] have been children younger than 18, and the average age of those infected was 5. Most of the children with confirmed cases experienced a viral illness with symptoms including fever and cough about 3 to 10 days before the onset of paralysis, the CDC said this month.

An AFM task force created by the agency last month [November 2018] is made up of 12 experts and will convene in Atlanta this week. On [Fri 7 Dec 2018], the group is expected to present key recommendations to an infectious disease scientific committee to "inform and strengthen CDC's response to this urgent public health concern."

[Based on the latest update from CDC dated 10 Dec 2018, so far in 2018 there have been 158 confirmed cases of AFM in 36 states across the US (https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/afm-cases.html).

The AFM outbreak in 2018 has been quite widespread with cases reported in 36 states (see map of confirmed cases by state as of 7 Dec 2018 at https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/images/afm-state-map.png), a trend that has been observed every other year between August and October, in the United States. Around the same time of year, many viruses commonly circulate, including enteroviruses (coxsackie virus A16, EV-A71, and EV-D68), and are temporally associated with AFM. However, this trend of alternate year surge remains largely unexplained. - Mod.UBA]
