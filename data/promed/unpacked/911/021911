Murray Valley encephalitis in a returning Canadian traveller
------------------------------------------------------------
Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) has been identified in the
CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] of a 19-year-old female who recently
returned from travel in the Northern Territory of Australia, an area
endemic for MVEV due to recent floods.

She had spent 6 months working at a farm in New Zealand, followed by
a 10 day vacation in Australia, camping and spelunking in the Darwin
and Alice Springs area. She returned to Canada by way of New Zealand.
The day prior to her departure on 13 May [2011] from Auckland to
Calgary, Alberta, she reported feeling tired. Upon her return home her
tiredness persisted which was attributed to jet lag. However, with the
development of rigors, chills, and increasing confusion, she was taken
to hospital for medical assessment. On 17 May [2011] she was admitted
to the ICU at a tertiary medical facility in Calgary for further
investigation.

On admission she was agitated and confused but still rousable to
voice, and able to follow simple commands; she also had a mildly
increased temperature. She was anemic (Hb 101 g/L, normal range
120-160 g/L) and thrombocytopenic (111x10E9/L, normal range
150-400x10E9/L ), although her WBC [white blood cell] count was
normal. Her CSF was mildly bloody with a predominantly lymphocytic
pleocytosis (45x10E6/L), protein (0.33 g/L), glucose (4.0 mmol/L).
Bacterial culture of blood and CSF were negative.

Her MRI was not typical for herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE).
Predominant findings included, restricted diffusion in the splenium of
corpus callosum; vasogenic edema (with increased T2 signal on FLAIR
[fluid attenuation inversion recovery]) in both posterior thalami.
These findings became more apparent and pronounced on serial CT
scans.

As a molecular panel for herpes simplex, varicella-zoster,
enterovirus, and West Nile virus on the CSF was negative, the
following testing was performed. Reverse-transcriptase PCR using
primers targeting a region of the NS5 gene of the _Flavivirus_ genus
(Ayers et al, J Virol Met 2006; 135: 235-9), was followed by
sequencing. The 770 bp sequence obtained from the amplicon was
compared to published sequences in the NCBI nucleotide database and
showed a 98 per cent identity to MVEV (AF161266.1), consistent with
the epidemiological and clinical history for this patient.

This is the 1st laboratory confirmed case of MVEV reported in Canada
and serves as a cautionary reminder of the other viral etiologies that
should be considered in returning travelers that may be outside the
diagnostic capability of many clinical laboratories. Appropriate
samples should also be referred to centres where specialized testing
is available to determine a probable viral etiology.

Despite intensive medical and surgical interventions, she developed
progressive cerebral edema, progressing to neurological death on day 8
of her hospitalization.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Fonseca and colleagues for this 1st hand
report. It illustrates the need for taking a good travel history in
these kinds of cases, and for the availability of competent, highly
specialized laboratory support. Although human Murray Valley
encephalitis viremias are not of sufficient magnitude and duration for
ongoing transmission by mosquitoes, this unfortunate case is an
example of risk when travelers visit endemic areas, and their need to
know how best to avoid exposure (in this case to mosquito bites). The
MVE virus infections reported this year (2011) have been in South
Australia and Victoria states. The infection in the case above was
acquired in the Northern Territory.
