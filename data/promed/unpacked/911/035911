The mysterious virus that killed Atlantic salmon at a Massachusetts fish
hatchery last winter has been detected in fish from 3 more Maine rivers,
prompting a multi-state scientific effort to understand the disease before
it threatens the tiny population of one of the Northeast's premier sport
fish.
None of the 6 salmon whose blood tested positive for the virus this month
showed signs of the tumors that killed salmon at the North Attleborough
federal hatchery. However, biologists were concerned to find the virus at
all: It has now been detected in 4 of the 7 Maine rivers that are the focus
of efforts to restore salmon runs decimated by dams and pollution.
Despite the unsettling findings, state officials began releasing 2.3
million salmon fry into the rivers this month to boost populations.
Biologists said the young fish would have died in captivity anyway because
hatcheries lack facilities to raise salmon to adulthood.
The virus ''is certainly a cause for concern,'' said Donald Hoenig, a Maine
Department of Agriculture veterinarian who chairs the state fish health
technical committee. ''Whether we should be alarmed at this point, I would
hold off on that.''
However, state and federal officials are taking no chances. They are
sending fish to a US Fish and Wildlife lab in West Virginia for analysis
and are holding for research 500 to 1,000 salmon fry whose parents came
from rivers where the virus has been detected. Meanwhile, researchers at
Cornell University are studying the virus, and they have already developed
an early detection test.
Biologists hope that the so-called swim bladder sarcoma virus has always
been present at low levels in the Atlantic salmon population, and they have
only recently noticed it. They theorize the outbreak at the North
Attleborough hatchery, which killed 82 of 276 salmon in one group, was
triggered by stress not normally found in the wild.
But some observers fear the virus is a new invader, perhaps imported by
aquaculture facilities raising salmon in pens on the coast. Hoenig said
aquaculture is an unlikely suspect since the virus has not been detected
among the pen-raised fish.
Still, researchers have frustratingly little evidence since the virus is
newly discovered and there are few similar documented outbreaks among fish.

Maine's effort to rebuild its salmon stock centers on hatcheries where fish
are segregated according to the river their parents came from. This way,
each of the 7 eastern Maine rivers in the program gets a genetically
separate population that returns each year to spawn.
After the outbreak at North Attleborough last year, state officials had to
quarantine a second hatchery that raised fish from the same Maine river,
the Pleasant. Two of 150 salmon tested positive for the virus, and all the
fish were destroyed. Before releasing this year's fry, officials at the US
Fish and Wildlife Service hatchery in East Orland used the Cornell blood
test to determine if the virus was present. To their disappointment, they
found a small number of fish from the Narraguagus, Machias, and East
Machias rivers all carried the virus, though they showed no signs of
illness.
John Coll, regional chief of fish health at the US Fish and Wildlife
Service in Pennsylvania, said he was encouraged only 3 adults out of more
than 150 tested carried the virus, along with another 3 juveniles, called
smolts. However, he avoided drawing conclusions.
