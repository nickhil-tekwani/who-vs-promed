[The report addresses an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in cattle in Algeria's eastern province of El Oued (1 animal in a holding of 10, reportedly vaccinated in October 2014), and 2 outbreaks affecting sheep in the central-western province of El Bayadh (see interactive map at the source URL above).

Regarding the cattle case, subscribers are referred to Mod.AB's comprehensive commentary in PRO/MENA 20150307.3213558, dated 7 Mar 2015, following the initial press report on this outbreak, dated 6 Mar 2015.

According to the current OIE report, the affected cattle holding in El Oued, southeast Algeria, had been vaccinated in October 2014; no information is available on the single animal affected, particularly its age. The duration of protection rendered by the vaccine depends on the vaccine quality, its matching to the circulating field strain, and previous vaccination history of the vaccinated cattle. The protection rendered by primary vaccination in (adult) cattle (against matching virus strains) will last for a limited period (up to several months). Timely booster vaccination is prescribed.

During July-September 2014, Algeria reported 420 FMD outbreaks, all in cattle, in its provinces along the Mediterranean (northern) provinces, spreading from east to west. The epizootic was declared as "resolved" on 12 Oct 2014. An interactive map showing all outbreaks during 2014 is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15727. The current outbreaks are located in regions apparently not affected in 2014.

The 2 outbreaks in sheep are adjacent to each other. They are located in the province El Bayadh in western Algeria (steppe, sheep country; see at http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/as.2014.57061). These 2 outbreaks may represent wider virus circulation and a threat to other regions, including Morocco. Though it may be assumed that the FMDV-O virus strain involved is similar to the FMDV O, strain 'O/ME-SA/Ind-2001' which caused the Maghreb (Tunisia and Algeria) epizootic of 2014, its genotyping may be recommended to enable selection of a matching vaccine. Information on the vaccine strain incorporated in the vaccine applied, reportedly, in sheep and goats in El Bayadh, will be helpful.

In 2014, Algeria, in difference with Tunisia, vaccinated cattle only; the sheep and goat population remained fully FMD-susceptible. The absence of FMD in sheep was subject to discussion (see commentary in ProMED-mail post 20140910.2764083), particularly since the same virus strain reportedly did cause disease in Tunisian small ruminants: in sheep 9.9 and in goats 8.7 percent morbidity rates. Moreover: according to information included in ProMED-mail post 20140914.2773348, cases of FMD have been recorded in 43 sheep in the Algerian province of Bejaia. A request for information on the said event remained unanswered.

FMD in sheep and goats may cause high mortality in their offspring (up to 50 percent and beyond in lambs and kids under the age of 1-2 months) due to cardiac arrest ("pancarditis"). In adult sheep, the main FMD symptom is lameness, transitory pyrexia, and inappetence; in dairy sheep, the milk production may be considerably reduced and mastitis may occur. Mortality in adult sheep is mostly low (usually less than 3 percent), unless gangrenous mastitis develops. Sometimes, FMD infection in sheep may show a subclinical course; however, these animals are effective disseminators of infection. Samples from small ruminants should be obtained according to the Probang method, applying probang cups as described in FAO's guidelines "Diagnostic and Sampling procedures for FMD" slide 11, in the presentation at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/docs/training/material/Diagnostic_sampling_procedures/Diagnostic_sampling_procedures.pdf. - Mod.AS
