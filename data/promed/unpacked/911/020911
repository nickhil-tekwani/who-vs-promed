[The latest OIE report on the current situation of African swine fever (ASF), from 29 Apr to 12 May 2022, is available at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2022/05/asf-report12.pdf.

This report mentioned: "The events reported in the last year confirm the global threat of ASF, which continues to spread in several regions, reaching new territories, with serious impacts on pig production systems, animal health and welfare, as well as on livelihoods, national food security and international trade.

"The detection of ASF in new territories poses a risk of spreading to neighbouring areas. Therefore, the OIE encourages Veterinary Services to remain vigilant, and implement science-based international standards and guidelines in their national disease prevention and control programmes." - Mod.CRD
