An equine veterinarian in Canterbury [South Island] is urging horse owners to get their animals vaccinated after another strangles outbreak in the region.

The highly infectious bacterial disease puts horses off their food, with fevers and swollen, hot, painful lymph nodes around the jaw that could burst. While most horses recover, it could result in death.

Mountainview Equine vet Glenn Beeman said there have been 3 separate cases of the disease recently on properties throughout Canterbury.

Mr Beeman said there was a flare-up of strangles in 2009 in the province and the latest outbreak is a stark reminder that the disease is not going away and horses should be protected.

[Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a Gram-positive, capsulated-hemolytic Lancefield group [serologically distinguishable groups into which most streptococci can be divided and which are based on the polysaccharide antigens present in the cell walls] C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F/39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. The affected horses are quite uncomfortable.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed with dilute (3-5 percent) povidone-iodine solution for several days until discharge ceases. NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia [loss of appetite]. Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.

Sharing of halters and brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread the disease to other horses.
