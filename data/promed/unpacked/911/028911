The NSW [New South Wales] Food Authority has recalled a batch of tinned tuna from Thailand that was served at a Sydney cafe after 4 people fell ill with suspected scombroid fish poisoning. Soul Origin takeaway, a cafe in Sydney's central business district, were notified by the NSW Food Authority that their John Bull Tuna Chunky Style had made 4 customers ill after they ate tuna salads on Mon 23 Feb 2015.

The NSW Food Authority confirmed that further samples of the tuna would be used for testing but said the same product was not generally available to the public for purchase. "A trade level recall of the affected batch has been undertaken, and all affected product has been removed from the market," NSW Food Authority said in a statement. "The information available is that this incident is isolated to one group at the one location."

Director of Health Protection NSW Dr Jeremy McAnulty said although there were a small number of scombroid cases every year in NSW, the condition rarely caused people to go to hospital. "It's usually a very typically rapid onset and fairly rapid recovery," Dr McAnulty said. "It happens where there has been mishandling of fish after it has been caught ... so typically it happens if the fish is caught and it is not put on ice straight away."

Symptoms of scombroid poisoning include burning around the mouth, facial flushing and diarrhoea, and it is mostly linked to fish such as mackerel, tuna, bonito and sardines.

Soul Origin said they were assisting the NSW Food Authority in its investigations and continued to "maintain the highest hygiene standards."

[Another 3 persons have been diagnosed, bringing the total to 7 so far (http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/tuna-from-sydney-cafe-affects-seven/story-fn3dxiwe-1227241222529).

Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize naturally occurring histidine in fish, decarboxylating the histidine into histamine. This most often occurs when fish is held at ambient or high temperatures (such as 70 to 90 F / 21.1 to 32.2 C) for several hours, but can occur at more moderate temperatures (over 45 F or over 7.2 C). Rapid chilling of fish immediately after catch is the most effective measure to prevent scombroid fish poisoning. Fish from the family _Scombridae_ (such as tuna and mackerel) contain high levels of free histidine in muscle tissue and are the commonest sources of scombroid fish poisoning, but other fish (such as mahi mahi, amberjack, bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also have been implicated.

The symptoms of scombroid are identical to those of an allergic reaction since the mediator of both are the same, histamine; but in scombroid's case, the histamine is externally produced and not secreted by the affected person's mast cells. The symptoms generally begin 15-60 minutes after ingestion and usually resolve within several hours but may last for 24 hours, rarely longer. Serious cardiac and respiratory complications can occur (1-3) but documented fatalities were not found in the literature by this moderator.

Scombroid poisoning is clearly associated with elevated histamine levels in the implicated vehicles but, as stated by Hungerford in a well-written review on the subject (4), there is not a clear dose-response relationship in the disease, and symptoms from the ingestion of the scombrotoxic fish can be higher than an equivalent oral dose of pure histamine. Drugs such as isoniazid that inhibit the body's histaminases (such as monoamine oxidase and diamine oxidase) will increase symptoms in scombroid (5).
