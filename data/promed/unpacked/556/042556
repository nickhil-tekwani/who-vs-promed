Rabies outbreak in Gauteng Province, South Africa
-------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 28 Sep 2010 there have been a total of 10 confirmed cases of
rabies in dogs in the south western areas of the City of Johannesburg,
Gauteng Province, predominantly in unvaccinated domestic dogs. All
isolates have been identified as canid biotype, originating from
KwaZulu province. The canid strain has never previously been a problem
in Gauteng.

The campaign reported in the recent ProMED article [see: Rabies,
human, canine - South Africa (GG) susp. 20100927.3504 2008] is only a
small part of a massive drive to control rabies in the area. This
campaign was launched after the 1st diagnosed case of dog rabies in
June this year [2010] in the suburb of Witpoortjie in Roodepoort in
the west of the City of Johannesburg. House-to-house vaccinations in
the immediate area of the cases have been followed by a 3 km radius
vaccination campaign as a 1st phase in a joint exercise between
Gauteng Veterinary Services and the City of Johannesburg Environmental
Health. The 2nd phase which has just commenced involves vaccination of
an extended area in the region. This has been accompanied by targeted
awareness campaigns involving all forms of media and direct community
liaison. Use is also being made of animal welfare organizations and
private veterinarians to assist with vaccinations.

One suspected human case is currently under investigation. This is a
2-year-old child scratched by a domestic puppy in Gauteng one month
prior to the onset of an acute encephalitis-type illness in the child.
The puppy disappeared soon after the initial incident. Post-exposure
prophylaxis was not given as medical treatment was not sought largely
because of the perceived relatively minor nature of the injury. Rabies
was suspected in the child on the basis of compatible clinical
features but other conditions are also being considered in the
differential diagnosis. An initial ante-mortem saliva tested negative
by nucleic acid detection and the child died before further samples
could be obtained. Post-mortem specimens will be tested.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Malcolm de Bud and his colleagues for their
immediate and comprehensive response to our request for further
information regarding the suspected fatal case of rabies virus
infection in a child in Johannesburg. The current canine vaccination
campaign is indeed a model for others in similar situations to follow.
It is intriguing that genome analysis is sufficiently informative to
indicate that the current outbreak of canine rabies in Johannesburg
appears to have resulted from introduction from a non-adjacent province.
