The Health Ministry has launched an investigation of recent hepatitis
A outbreaks in several regions of West Java. The ministry will present
its findings at a coordination meeting with a panel of experts who
will decide on measures to control the spread of the virus disease.

Hepatitis A has been reported in several locations in Bandung,
Tasikmalaya, and Depok over the last 2 months, most recently striking
89 students and a teacher from SMKN 2 Depok state vocational school.
"Patients have been recovering under the care of local health
officials," ministry disease control and environmental health chief
Tjandra Yoga Aditama told The Jakarta Post on Sunday (13 Nov 2011).

In the last 3 weeks, 54 elementary school students in Tasikmalaya have
contracted hepatitis, suffering from fevers and weakness, which are
common symptoms of hepatitis A. Meanwhile, 40 students from
Parahyangan University in Bandung contracted hepatitis in October
(2011).

The West Java administration declared the outbreaks an extraordinary
situation (KLB) in the province. Tjandra said poor food hygiene at
canteens near the schools was the likely cause of the infections,
although epidemiological investigations would continue to develop a
complete picture of the outbreak. "We will inspect schools because
eating meals together is common at schools," he said, adding that the
ministry would also inspect factories and offices equipped with
canteens.

SMKN 2 Depok students were given a one-week vacation as part of
efforts to control the spread of the outbreak. In Bandung, Parahyangan
University students were reportedly serving their own meals or buying
more expensive food at cleaner canteens to avoid infection.

Hepatitis A is an acute liver infection that is caused by the
hepatitis A virus. A person afflicted with the virus exhibits several
symptoms, including fevers, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and
jaundice. While hepatitis A does not destroy the liver and is usually
self-limiting, people who suffer from hepatitis B and C can develop
chronic infections that might lead to liver cirrhosis or even liver
cancer. The livers of most victims of hepatitis A infections usually
heal completely without lasting effects.

"Like dengue, people suffering from hepatitis A may die; but usually,
the patients die of complications of the disease and not because of
the infection itself. Therefore, hepatitis A-infected people should
have proper medical treatment to prevent the complications of the
disease," Sangkot Marzuki, a clinical microbiologist from the Eijkman
Institute, said.

The province's health authority recorded that 24 university students
and residents living near the campus of Parahyangan University have
been treated for the disease.

Despite its low mortality rate, the hepatitis A virus spreads easily
and tends to emerge in epidemics or outbreaks. In previous years,
local governments in several provinces declared a KLB status [high
alert status] for hepatitis A. Health minister Endang Rahayu
Sedyaningsih said hygiene and sanitation were the only ways to prevent
the outbreak. "It's important to make hand-washing with soap a habit
and to encourage the use of alcohol as the sanitation standard for
hospitals as well," she said, adding that the hepatitis A
virus-infected people should rest and eat well. Although hepatitis A
is self-limiting, the disease still has an effect on its victims. "The
healing process may take quite a long time, possibly resulting in a
heavier burden on public health," Endang said.

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's faeces. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene habits, such as hand-washing. Improved sanitation and
the hepatitis A vaccine are the most effective ways to combat the
disease. WHO estimates 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A occur
annually. This is reflected in the wide geographic range of reports of
hepatitis A virus infection received by ProMED-mail during the course
of this year (see list below).

Hepatitis A virus infection is a vaccine-preventable disease.
According to the World Health Organisation, several hepatitis A
vaccines are available internationally. All are similar in terms of
how well they protect people from the virus and their side-effects. No
vaccine is licensed for children younger than one year of age (see
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html).

However the recommendation from the health minister that: "hepatitis A
virus-infected people should rest and eat well," may be more
attractive to many.
