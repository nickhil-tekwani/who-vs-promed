My colleague at the Brooklyn VAMC (now Veterans Administration
New York Harbor Health Care System, Brooklyn Campus) has
recently seen 3 adult men in Brooklyn with an odd combination of
signs and symptoms. All began with URI-type symptoms (without
significant pharyngitis) and fever, developed conjunctivitis, and
wound up with prominent desquamation of palms and soles,
reminiscent of toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. Of the 3 cases, 2 were
outpatients, not acutely ill, and only identified in retrospect -- one of
these was a physician.
The 'index' case -- the first to be seen, at the very beginning of
September [2001] -- was hospitalized with temperatures as high as 40
C, axillary -- not cervical -- lymphadenopathy, and ophthalmology-
diagnosed uveitis. He had prominent desquamation of his palms and
soles in convalescence. ASO was negative, throat culture negative, and
platelet count never became elevated.
None of the cases had any contact with each other. Although the 'index'
case may well have been a case of adult Kawasaki, it seemed odd that 2
other milder cases also with palm/sole desquamation were seen shortly
after the first case.
Comments? Ideas?

[I must admit I'm stumped here. Running GIDEON
<http://www.GideonOnline.com> was not that helpful, as it gave AIDS
and a few of the fungal disorders. If additional cases with more
specific/detailed symptomatology have been seen, and more detailed
laboratory testing has been done, weÂ´d like to hear about it. -
