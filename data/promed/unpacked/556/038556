The mass vaccination campaign [in Togo] is scheduled to begin today
[12 Feb 2007] in the Savanes and Kara regions, where 3 cases of
yellow fever (YF) were laboratory confirmed [see previous report:
Yellow fever - Togo: conf. 20070111.0129. - Mod.TY]
Yellow fever reappeared in these regions after an absence of more
than 20 years.
The campaign will target children more than 9 months old in 11
districts in these 2 regions. The vaccine (1 500 000 doses) has been
provided by the The GAVI Alliance [formerly known as the Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation] emergency stockpile, through
the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for
Yellow Fever Control. ECHO [European Commission's Humanitarian Aid
department] has provided funding for the campaign.
An additional 2 cases of yellow fever were reported at the end of
January [2007], one in the Kara region (Kozah district) and the other
in the Maritime region (Lacs district); both cases were laboratory
confirmed by the Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal.
An investigation was carried out by the Ministry of Health, assisted
by the WHO Regional Office for Africa and the WHO country office.
Containment measures, including a vaccination campaign in the
Maritime region, are currently being assessed.

[It is good to learn that the numbers of cases of YF in Togo have
been very few, so that the prospects of control by means of the
current vaccination campaign are good. A map of Togo can be accessed
