Another blow comes for Sicilian animal husbandry, already in crisis from drought and skyrocketing prices of agricultural fuel. We are talking about the epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHD) -- a virus which affects ruminants but is not dangerous to humans and which has also been recorded on our island and which puts the movements of livestock at serious risk.

As we read on NebrodiNews, which has dedicated an extensive article to the subject, the 1st European outbreak of the virus -- which has already been present for some time in North Africa -- was detected in Sardinia. It has already led to the blocking of movements of cattle outside the island and within its territory.

There is maximum precaution, since the Ministry of Health has intervened, asking the Sicilian Region to act similarly to Sardinia in blocking any movement of ruminants leaving the Sicilian territory. There is also a monitoring plan aimed at identifying the possible spread of the disease, aiming at curbing it.

In this regard, NebrodiNews interviewed Gabriella Regalbuto, who in addition to being the provincial head of the Agriculture Department of Fratelli d'Italia, is familiar with the animal husbandry situation in the Nebrodi area.

Regalbuto does not hide her concern and calls for caution: "The situation is particularly delicate also because it is a virus of which little is known yet. From the ministry's note, we learn that only one infected animal has been identified in a farm in the province of Trapani [see comment]. I personally believe that a possible movement block extended to all island farms becomes a penalizing measure for the category, already sufficiently oppressed by market prices, international crises, delays in Agea payments. Unfortunately I am almost certain that Sicily will also adopt the same precautionary strategy as its Sardinian colleagues, in synergy with what is requested by the ministry, but we are confidently awaiting provisions from the newly installed health councilor."

The veterinary services involved are already at work. "Let's hope" -- adds Regalbuto -- "they will succeed in a rapid monitoring so as to minimize any blockage of movements and bring the livestock trade back to that balance, still precarious, which it had almost reached in recent months."

But is there anything else to pay attention to as a precaution? Regalbuto explains: "In my opinion it would also be important to pay attention to wildlife, the 1st vehicle of contagion. Farmers have been asking for it for years: It is a nonsense to impose periodic rehabilitation plans on our farms (with significant costs borne by companies) and at the same time allow wildlife to proliferate undisturbed and destroy farms and livestock. Fallow deer, wild boars and wild or feral pigs are not a resource, and their containment is a problem that must be tackled urgently; one cannot turn away."

As mentioned, EHD does not pose a danger to humans. It is an infectious disease transmitted by insects of the genus _Culicoides_, which affects domestic and wild ruminants. The etiological agent is a virus belonging to the same genus as the bluetongue virus and African horse sickness. The disease is characterized by high morbidity and mortality in cervids, while in cattle the morbidity ranges from 1% to 18% and mortality is low.

[Italy suffers at present 2 primary disease events in cattle caused by EHD virus. Its 1st reported outbreaks were from Sardinia (3 locations in the west of South Sardinia; 20221110.8706660 and WOAH immediate notification at https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/4712). The start dates of the events presented in the 2 WOAH reports are 28 Oct 2022 for Sardinia and 24 Oct 2022 for Sicily. In case these dates are accurate, such synchronicity might be attributed to weather conditions, allowing airborne transmission of infected (_Culicoides_) vectors from north Africa. The distances between the affected locations in Sardinia and Sicily from Tunisia are about 280 and 200 km (174 mi and 124 mi), respectively.

The EHD virus causing the outbreak in Tunisia during October-November 2021 has been recently published to be serotype 8. The serotyping of the current outbreaks in Tunisia, Sardinia and Sicily is pending.

EU member-states and some non-members have been applying vaccination against circulating bluetongue virus, a vector-borne orbivirus of domestic ruminants, using an inactivated vaccine against the relevant serotype, since the extensive BTV-8 event. Similar policy may be considered in relation to EHD. At present, no licensed vaccine against EHD in cattle is commercially available. - Mod.AS
