TAVERNIER, Florida: A 350 pound loggerhead turtle [was one of three
turtles, one of which was dead plucked from shallow ocean waters Tuesday
[30 Jan 2001 after Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary officials
spotted her a quarter mile from shore, lethargic and struggling to breathe.
Richie Moretti, director of the famed "Turtle Hospital" in Marathon,
commented that a growing group [have been rescued since October [2000,
barely clinging to life. "So far, we have lost about half of them," Moretti
said.
Pathologists and veterinarians are studying the turtles in an effort to try
to determine what is killing them. The team believe it could be something
the turtles are eating or a virus. "I think it's something they are eating;
the stuff in their stomachs is toxic," Moretti said. "This is the biggest
die-off we've ever seen," he said.
