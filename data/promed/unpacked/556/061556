Some Australians may have been falsely diagnosed with human swine flu
while others with the disease may have been sent home with a negative
result because the laboratory test used to identify the potentially
deadly virus is only about 90 per cent accurate.

So far more than 1200 Australians have tested positive to swine flu.
NSW [New South Wales] Health is among those using polymerase chain
reaction testing, also known as the PCR testing, to identify the H1N1
strain of influenza. Last night [9 Jun 2009] NSW Health declined to
make any further comment. The latest information from the World
Health Organisation, supported by the US Food and Drug
Administration, suggests the newly developed rRT-PCR "rapid" testing
method gives only a "presumptive positive" rather than a "definitive
positive" result for H1N1 influenza. According to reports from both
organisations, the test can also provide a "false negative" result in
cases where the patient actually has the virus. PCR testing is the
global benchmark used to identify viruses and is endorsed by the WHO.

In April [2009], the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation to
allow a "rapid" form of the method to be rushed to laboratories
across the US to combat a potential swine flu epidemic, even though
the method had not been fully developed or obtained approval. A
document released by the FDA on 28 Apr [2009] states only that
rRT-PCR swine flu testing "may be effective" in testing for swine
flu. The FDA report states that "a positive result indicates that the
patient is presumptively infected with swine flu virus, but not the
stage of infection", and that "a negative result does not, by itself,
exclude the possibility of swine flu virus infection."

The WHO has issued its protocols for using the new test method to
laboratories around the world. That document states tests can provide
only a "presumptive positive" result for swine flu. The WHO document
also said "a false negative result may occur if inadequate numbers of
organisms are present in the specimen due to improper collection,
transport, or handling".

The rRT-PCR testing method was developed by the global pharmaceutical
giant Roche -- the company that also owns the rights to Tamiflu, one
of just 2 anti-viral drugs used to treat the virus. George
Koumantakis, the Scientific and Regulatory Affairs manager for Roche
Diagnostics Australia, said the PCR testing method was "about 90 per
cent accurate." "It's impossible to claim 100 per cent accuracy for
the method due to a number of reasons," Dr Koumantakis said. "The
primary one is that the virus only has to mutate slightly for the
test to be completely ineffective."

Last week [week of 1 Jun 2009] Roche reported that stocks of Tamiflu
had sold out in Australia due to unprecedented demand.

The number of Australians with the H1N1 virus increased from 1207 to
1224 yesterday [9 Jun 2009]. The health minister, Nicola Roxon, said
the virus was mild in Australia, and only about 10 people had been
hospitalised.

[With A (H1N1) influenza virus infections spreading rapidly around
the world, it is not surprising that there is a real sense of urgency
in developing tests to diagnose it. Ideally, a diagnostic test should
be 100 per cent specific for the pathogen in question (A (H1N1)
influenza virus in this case) and sensitive enough to detect all
infected individuals without false positives. It should be
inexpensive to conduct and suitable for processing a large number of
samples quickly. But diagnostic tests seldom, if ever, reach this
ideal. The question, then, is if 90 per cent accuracy is helpful in
providing timely treatment to patients and in tracking the disease in
time and space. In this instance, it is much better than no
diagnostic test at all, even if the positive results are considered
presumptive. - Mod.TY]
