---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Muskmelon (_Cucumis melo_ L.) is one of the most important vegetable
crops in Oman. In the fall of 2004, sudden wilt was observed in
muskmelon grown in a field at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat. The
disease was characterized by rapid collapse of vines and muskmelon
plants at the fruit production to maturation stage, associated with
brown to dark brown rotted primary and secondary roots. The disease
resulted in death of more than 85 percent of muskmelon plants in that field.

_Pythium_ spp. were consistently isolated from crowns and roots of
plants showing wilt symptoms. Further identification of 5 isolates of
_Pythium_ produced a nucleotide sequence 806 basepairs long, which
was identical among all isolates. Comparison with sequences deposited
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information revealed 100
percent nucleotide similarity to a previously published sequence of
an isolate of _P. splendens_ from cucumber from Oman, for which
identification has also been confirmed by morphological characteristics.

In pathogenicity tests conducted in a greenhouse, _P. splendens_
induced damping-off symptoms on 7-day-old muskmelon seedlings and
also reproduced the same wilt symptoms observed in the field when
2-month-old muskmelon plants were inoculated with 3-day-old _P.
splendens_ cultures. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of
association of _P. splendens_ with wilt of muskmelon in Oman.

[Fungal diseases called sudden or severe wilt of melon occur in many
areas of the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas, and can
cause severe yield losses. The term is a generic name for plants that
suddenly die at or around fruit filling and is associated with fungal
root infection and plant stress occurring at fruit set. Several
soil-borne fungi can be associated with the symptoms, including
several species of _Pythium_, which destroy the plant feeder roots
and invade larger roots, thus restricting water uptake. The high
demand for water during fruit enlargement cannot be met following
this invasion, and the vine wilts and plant death follows with
immature fruits. The fungi can be spread by soil and infected plant
material. Disease management includes cultural practices and use of
resistant varieties. Soil fumigation and some fungicide treatments
have been found to be of limited use.

_P. splendens_ is found in many areas of the world on a wide range of
hosts, including crops such as taro and oilpalm, but has rarely been
reported as being associated with sudden wilt of cucurbits. It has,
however, been reported as one of the main causal agents of melon wilt in Japan.
