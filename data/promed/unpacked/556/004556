Headlines
World Polio Day is coming up on 24 Oct 2018: join partners around the world in making this year's World Polio Day a success.

Summary of newly reported viruses this week
- Afghanistan - 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case and 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Pakistan - 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Niger - 3 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases;
- Somalia - 1 cVDPV type 3 (cVDPV3) case; and,
- Papua New Guinea - 3 cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) cases.

Afghanistan
- 1 WPV1 case was reported in the past week, with onset of paralysis on [1 Sep 2018] from Hilmand province. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 16.
- 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from Kandahar, Kunar, and Khost, all collected on [25 Sep 2018].

Pakistan
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 4.
- 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from Sindh (greater Karachi) and Balochistan (Quetta), collected on [10 and 20 Sep 2018], respectively.

Nigeria
- No cases of cVDPV2 cases were reported this week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 is 16.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance-strengthening activities, including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- 3 cases of cVDPV2 are reported from Niger, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 in Katsina, Nigeria, with onset of paralysis on [31 Aug 2018, 6 Sep 2018, and 7 Sep 2018, respectively], all from Zinder province. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 is 6, all from Zinder province. These cases are all linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Jigawa, Nigeria.
- The government of Niger has declared a national public-health emergency, as per the temporary recommendations of the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulation.
- WHO and its partners are supporting local public-health authorities in field investigations and risk assessment, and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary. Health workers are conducting active searches for additional AFP cases; surveillance is also being strengthened by taking more environmental samples from more areas and sampling the stools of healthy people.
- The detection of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin. Emergency outbreak response and efforts to improve surveillance continue across the basin. These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.

Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo)
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week.
- DR Congo is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- The relevant provincial governors have signed a "Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication," committing to provide the necessary oversight, accountability, and resources needed to stop the outbreak. It is hoped that level of oversight will improve operational performance of the outbreak response.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously with an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- 1 new case of cVDPV3 was reported in the past week, from Middle Shabelle, Somalia, with onset of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018].
- The country is carrying out outbreak response to both virus types in line with internationally agreed guidelines. An outbreak response assessment is due to start on [18 Nov 2018], followed by a technical advisory group meeting.

Papua New Guinea
- 3 new cases of cVDPV1 were reported in the past week, from Enga, Eastern Highlands, and Madang, with onset of paralysis on [6 Aug 2018, 29 Aug 2018, and 6 Sep 2018], respectively. This brings the total number of cases in 2018 to 18. Two cVDPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from Port Moresby, both collected on [5 Sep 2018].
- Emergency Operations Centres are established and operational in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 due to the large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened, and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

[In the past week there have been no newly reported cases in Pakistan, Nigeria, or the DR Congo. That being said, there have been positive environmental specimens in Pakistan (see the discussion below in section [2]), and there have been 2 non-paralytic cases of polio confirmed in Pakistan in the past week as well. It is too early to officially declare that transmission has been interrupted in any of these countries (Pakistan, Nigeria, and the DR Congo).

As mentioned in previous comments, these past 2 years have shown a reversal of type of poliovirus associated with paralytic disease, from a preponderance of WPVs to a preponderance of cVDPVs. It appears as though this year [2018] will end similar to last year [2017] with similar counts in both WPV- and cVDPV-associated paralytic disease, although there is a difference. Last year (2017) had cases of cVDPV reported by 2 countries (DR Congo and Syria), whereas this year (2018) there are 5 countries with active transmission of cVDPVs (Somalia, Nigeria, DR Congo, Niger, and Papua New Guinea).

The National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) for polio eradication on Wednesday [17 Oct 2018] notified about 2 new polio cases -- 1 from the Gadap area in Karachi, and the other from the Khyber tribal district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- bringing the total number of polio cases in the country to 6 this year. However, the virus failed to cause any clinical paralysis to either child.

According to a statement issued by the health ministry, the 1st case of polio was confirmed in a 42-month-old female child from Gadap, Karachi, and the other case was confirmed in a 55-month old female child from Khyber tribal district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The laboratory detected the presence of poliovirus in their stool samples taken on [1 Oct 2018 and 30 Sep 2018], respectively.

"Fortunately, both girls had received multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which boosted their immunity and protected them from a lifelong paralysis," read the statement.

"The polio virus has been continuously found in the sewage waters of Peshawar and Karachi for the last 12 months," said Babar Bin Atta, the prime minister's focal person for polio eradication. "The programme will continue to focus on clearing these 2 remaining reservoirs from the virus with full force."

National coordinator for polio eradication Dr Rana Safdar said, "The multiple vaccine doses gave the children the immunity boost to fight off the poliovirus attack. They have no residual weaknesses and will live like normal children."

He appreciated the vigilant health workers who picked these cases with atypical clinical presentations, saying, "This why it's important for every under 5-year-old child to be vaccinated in every round, so immunity levels are high enough to fight off the virus in its entirety."

Earlier this year, 3 polio cases were reported from Dukki district in Balochistan, while one case was reported from the Charsadda district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Being fully vaccinated in routine and door-to-door campaigns, the Charsadda child had also escaped paralysis.

The wild poliovirus case numbers in Pakistan are the lowest ever, and the immunity gaps continue to fall. However, despite this historic progress, Atta said: "We cannot afford any let-up in our efforts, because as long as the virus is being detected anywhere in the country, no child is absolutely safe."

Multiple doses of polio vaccine are required for a child to be fully protected; each additional dose further strengthens a child's immunity level against polio. Contrarily, every missed child provides a place for the polio virus to hide.

"Any child with low immunity will be where the virus will find refuge. We need to ensure all our children have received all of their routine immunisations and are vaccinated, with 2 drops, every time the vaccine is offered," Bin Atta added.

[The above media report mentions that in the 2 cases in which poliovirus (presumably WPV1) was isolated, both had "atypical symptoms," but it does not specify what the symptoms were that led to suspicion of WPV infection. It does serve as verification that the surveillance activities in Pakistan are excellent for detecting clinical poliovirus-associated disease. I suspect that when there are positive environmental samples in an area, the surveillance activities go into overdrive to identify where the virus shedders might be found.

More information on the clinical presentation of these cases would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
