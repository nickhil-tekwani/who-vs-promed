PNEUMOCOCCAL MENINGITIS, JAPAN: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
*******************************************************
Date: Mon, 30 Jun 1997 18:38:04 +0900
From: Capt Philip Gould <GOULDPH@35MDG.Misawa.af.mil>
Does anyone know the relative incidence of pneumococcal meningitis in Japan?
We have just sent an airman from our base to a local Japanese base with what
appears to have been a pneumococcal meningitis (presumed, based on the
presence of GPCs in the spinal fluid; culture isn't back yet, but should be
back soon.) There is some possibility of a spenoidal sinusitis, based on a
review of MRI films taken earlier this month on the patient who had been seen
multiple times for evaluation of gradually progressing headache. The MRI had
initially been read as negative by our radiologist, who reexamined the films
in light of the patient's deterioration. The patient was admitted on
Saturday with obtundation, responding only to painful stimuli, but with
spontaneous movements, so spontaneous that the patient was too disruptive to
be maintained on the general medicine ward and was transferred to the ICU
(Japanese hospital).
So far, no further cases have been identified, although there has been the
usual panic (we are a small base.)
