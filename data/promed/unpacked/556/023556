A locally acquired case of dengue fever has been reported in the
north Queensland town of Tully -- the 1st in the town in at least 2
decades, Queensland Health says. Townsville has also recorded 13
locally acquired cases of the potentially deadly mosquito-borne
disease in 2 separate outbreaks this season.

Queensland Health medical director Jeffrey Hanna said a Dengue Action
Response Team would visit Tully to undertake yard inspections and set
traps for dengue mosquitoes. "Dengue mosquitoes only breed around
homes and in urban areas ... not in swamps or creeks," he said.
Common dengue mosquito breeding sites include tyres, buckets, toys,
and pot plant bases.

"With the recent rains and the warm temperatures, I strongly urge all
Tully residents to take preventive steps," Dr Hanna said. "It is
important that people -- individuals, as well as businesses -- get
rid of mosquito breeding sites around the yard and workplace."

Departmental Health Service authorities (SEDES), declared an orange
alert following the death of a young man of 26 years with severe
dengue fever, and the rise of suspected cases as a result of the
weather conditions. Ervin Saucedo, director of SEDES, reported that
the city of Santa Cruz confirmed 24 [dengue] cases of the 246
suspected cases; in the municipality of Yapacani, 5 cases were
confirmed. There is also a major outbreak in relation to last year
[2009] in the border area of Mato Grosso do Sul [state] in Brazil.

"We again urge people to continue collaborating with cleanup to avoid
mosquito breeding sites in old tires and trash in the open," he urged.

Saucedo said the man's death, which is still under investigation, was
due to a severe dengue [virus] type 2 [infection], which along with
[dengue virus] serotypes 1 and 3 may be circulating in Santa Cruz
given that weather conditions are propitious for the proliferation of
the mosquito.

"This [dengue virus] serotype is highly lethal because of a
combination of 2 factors, which can make this severe dengue
[infection] lead to death. We are facing a clinical complication and
that is why we are undertaking a series of activities," he said.

For his part, the director of SEDES recalled that this period is one
of high risk, because in March the rains intensify and, combined with
the heat, the development of larvae and [adult] mosquitoes is
accelerated, which can cause an outbreak of important proportions. To
avoid this, severe measures will be taken.

The Brazilian state of Goias and 4 others that border Bolivia have a
concentration of 71 percent of the dengue cases registered in Brazil
during the 1st 6 weeks of the year [2010] and which have issued an
alert in the northwest region of the country, the Ministry of Health
announced today [27 Feb 2010]. Rondonia, Mato Grosso do Sul, Acre,
Mato Grosso, all bordering Bolivia, and Goias are the states which
record the highest dengue incidence in Brazil with indices between
423.2 and 891.7 cases per 100 000 population, a scale that is
considered high when above the 300s. In absolute numbers, these 5
states record 77 117 of the 108 640 cases registered in the whole
country between 1 Jan-13 Feb [2010].

Despite a doubling of the number of [dengue] cases from the same
period of 2009, when 51 873 cases were reported, in the 1st 6 weeks
of this year [2010], 21 deaths from the disease have been registered,
10 less than in the same period of 2009.

The concentration of the disease along the border with Bolivia was
confirmed after the vice minister of Health of the Andean country,
Nila Heredia, stated that the new strain [serotype] of dengue [virus]
which has been detected in Bolivian territory may have come from Brazil.

Data from the CVE (Center for Epidemiological Surveillance) of the
Secretariat of Health of Sao Paulo reveal that the number of dengue
cases in the state between 1 Jan and last Wednesday [24 Feb 2010] has
reached 7594, which represents an 84 percent of the total [recorded]
for 2009, when 8996 [dengue virus] infections were confirmed. In the
same period of last year [2009] (in 6 weeks) there were 771 [dengue
virus] infections, according to SUCEN (Superintendency of Control of
Endemics), which represents an increase of 885 percent.

Despite the increase, the SUCEN superintendent, Affonso Viviani,
denied that there is an imminent [dengue] epidemic in Sao Paulo, but
issued an alert of risk for dengue spread mainly in the
municipalities of the western region, such as Ribeirao Preto, Sao
Jose do Rio Preto, and Aracatuba. "At the moment, there is not a
picture that signals a dengue epidemic in Sao Paulo, because this
depends on the number people in the state. But some cities in the
western region, and Guaruja (Baixada Santista) already have
transmission indices compatible with a risk of epidemic," he stated
to Folha Online.

SUCEN is responsible for a mega operation to combat the mosquito that
transmits the disease [virus], _Aedes aegypti_, initiated this Friday
[26 Feb 2010]. Altogether, more than 10 000 agents participate in the
preventive action, which was anticipated this year [2010] due to the
heat and above average rainfall recorded since the beginning of the
year [2010]. The index of above average rainfall is noted by the
superintendent of the municipal government as one of the reasons for
the increase in the number of cases in the state.

Another factor that helped boost the number of cases is the
recirculation of dengue [virus] type 1, which did not prevail in the
state for more than a decade. "The objective of this [control]
campaign is to reinforce the necessity of elimination of breeding
sites of the dengue mosquito. The greatest infestation occurs from
March, and the only way to reduce dengue is to eliminate the breeding
[sites] of the mosquito, "said Viviani. He said that only in the city
of Sao Paulo 30 cases of the disease were confirmed, of which just 3
were in Bristol Park, in the southern area of the city, a locale
supervised during the [control] blitz today [27 Feb 2010] by the
Secretariat of Health.

All together, 28 deaths are being investigated in the state, with
another 2 cases now confirmed -- one in Mirassolandia and another in
Sao Jose do Rio Preto, reported Viviani to SUCEN.

According to the Ministry of Health, in the 1st 6 weeks of this year
[2010], the number of dengue cases increased more than 100 percent in
relation to 2009. Between 1 Jan-13 Feb [2010], 106 640 [dengue] cases
have been recorded in the whole country, versus 51 873 last year [2009].

The numbers from CVE (which may be changed according to the daily
data of confirmations from the municipalities), however, differ from
those announced today [26 Feb 2010] by the Ministry of Health, which
noted that there were 2930 confirmed cases of the disease in Sao
Paulo (in 6 weeks), compared to 425 registered in the same period
last year [2009] -- an increase of 589.4 percent. This [difference]
is because Sao Paulo state counts confirmed cases up to the last day,
24 Feb [2010], whereas the Ministry of Health presents data up to 13
[Feb 2010]. That, according to the Secretariat, accounts for the difference.

Dengue returns to RS [Rio Grande do Sul] after 3 years without
recorded cases. Although the number of cases is small relative to
other regions, the resurgence of dengue is worrying. After almost 3
years without registering dengue cases, Rio Grande do Sul is facing a
new epidemic of the disease.

In Ijui (402 km [250 mi] from Porto Alegre), 11 people have now
contracted the disease, according to the state Center for Health
Surveillance). The state authorities are now treating the case of
Ijui, a municipality of 80 000 inhabitants, as a dengue outbreak
because it has registered a large number of cases in a small
geographic region. "The 1st tests indicated that this is dengue
fever, but there is already an epidemic reality because dozens of
people with [dengue-like] symptoms sought [attention by the] health
network of the city during the weekend [20-21 Feb 2010]," said the
director of the state center, Francisco Paz. The determination of the
type of dengue [virus] still depends on the results of tests with are
being done by the Instituto Adolfo Lutz in Sao Paulo.

Although the number of [dengue] cases in RS is small in relation to
other regions of the country, the resurgence of dengue in Rio Grande
do Sul worries the Ministry of Health because, while they are not
dealing with a common disease in the state, the majority of
[individuals in] the population have not developed antibodies against
the virus. "There is an alert situation because the majority of
[individuals] in the population have never had contact with the
disease [virus]," said the Coordinator of the National Dengue Control
Program of the Ministry of Health, Giovanini Coelho. He said that as
there is no vaccine, all that can be done is to combat the vector
(_Aedes aegypti_) so that [dengue does] not spread between the
regions, as well as strengthening [medical] assistance to those who
develop symptoms.

The health authorities as well as specialists in epidemiology
consider that a combination of climatic factors, which benefit the
proliferation of mosquitoes, with the circulation of virus by
visitors who have had contact with [dengue] foci in RS, is the most
probable cause for the return of the disease.

According to the private meteorological service, MetSul, the
temperature this summer is around 4 deg [C, 7 deg F] above the
historical mean for February in many regions of the state. The hot
temperatures, in combination with a rainy period that in some cities
has brought 3 times more rainfall in relation to historical averages,
has boosted mosquito breeding. According to the state Secretariat of
Health, _Aedes aegypti_ has now been found in 53 of the 496 RS municipalities.

"If the virus arrives in a region that has the vector, an epidemic
can occur, especially if the population has not had previous massive
exposure to the disease [virus] and has not developed immunity,"
stated Jose Evoide de Moura, epidemiologist at the UnB (University of
Brasilia).

An outbreak of dengue has killed 9 people in the [state] capital.
From official statistics, the severity of the dengue epidemic has
frightening numbers. While SESAU (municipal Secretariat of Health)
confirms one death in Campo Grande, 8 others died of the disease.

Just in the San Juliao Hospital, which since January [2010] has 20
beds for care for patients with dengue, 4 deaths were recorded.
According to infectious disease physician, Mauricio Pompilio,
referring to the disease in the state, 3 died in San Julian and one
was transferred to the CTI (Intensive Care Center) of HU (Regional
Hospital), where he died. "The youngest patient was 56 years, others
were older than 60 years." The doctor explained that in all cases the
clinical picture (symptoms) was dengue, but to enter the official
statistics of the disease, serology tests are necessary, the results
of which are sent to health secretariats.

After the outbreak, which recorded 45 000 cases and 2 deaths in 2007,
one death from dengue was officially registered in 2010, in Campo
Grande. However, adding the deaths in Sao Juliao, plus the confirmed
case and those under investigation, the total reaches 9 deaths.

SESAU investigated the death of a 22 year-old after being attended in
the UPA (Emergency Care Unit of Vila Almeida), a woman of 67 years
who was admitted to the HR (Regional Hospital) Rosa Pedrossian, and a
man of 75 years. There is a 4th death, a woman of 83 years, who died
of DHF in the Campo Grande Clinic. Last year [2009], a child of 7
years and an adolescent of 13 years died of suspected dengue.

In Santa Casa [?hospital] 9 people have been admitted with dengue. Of
that total, 7 patients presented with DHF; 5 children and 2 adults.
No deaths were registered.

Since January [2010], dengue has caused hospital admission of 169
people. Santa Casa and HR provide references for admissions of
children in serious condition.

The infectious disease physician Mauricio Pompilio emphasizes that
people must seek medical attention when they experience the 1st
dengue symptoms. The disease causes fever, headache, body ache, and
loss of appetite.

According the SESAU bulletin, as of yesterday [22 Feb 2010] Campo
Grande had a total of 14 202 dengue cases.

The Ministry of Public Health (MSP), in a statement by Dr Julio Cesar
Manzur, director of the National Vector-Transmitted Diseases Service
(SENEPA), has confirmed the circulation of 3 types of dengue [virus]
(with the arrival of [dengue virus] serotype 2) in the country, which
increases the probabilities of the appearance of serious dengue
[disease], previously termed DHF. When a region has 2 or more [dengue
virus] serotypes [circulating] at the same time, it turns into an
area of hyperendemicity. "A hyperendemic area is characterized as
such because there is more virus circulation and among them more
virulent strains might appear. This is a great public health menace,"
he said. According to Manzur, it has been shown that with an
increasing number of mild cases -- that is as the epidemic grows --
more serious cases begin to appear as well. "The greater the
appearance of mild forms [of the infection], more serious forms
appear also," he added. and pointed out that severe forms of dengue
can be caused by whichever of the 3 [dengue virus] serotypes (1,2, or
3) is circulating in the country.

There are various factors included in the appearance of serious
cases. "In the 1st place, the predisposition of the patient. Every
person reacts in a different way to the virus attack. In 2nd place,
if the person has been infected by a given [dengue virus] serotype,
when they are infected by a 2nd serotype, the probability of
development of serious dengue is greater," he noted. "That is why, he
added, it is best to cut short an outbreak which could hit a specific
city or in a specific department [state of province equivalent]," he
pointed out.

The past [1 Feb 2010], the Ministry of Public Health declared an
epidemiological alert as a result of the detection of dengue virus
serotype 2 (DEN-2) in the country. The discovery was made in patients
resident in the department of Amambay. The declaration of the alert
signaled that the introduction of this new strain [virus serotype]
"implies high risk for Paraguay in case an epidemic is produced,
especially because of the risk of appearance of serious dengue cases."

The alert situation implies the activation of the departmental
contingency plans for dengue mitigation, as well as the activation of
regional rapid response teams for exhaustive investigation of
outbreaks of febrile syndromes, among other actions.

Up to now, there are 5 departments of the country with active
circulation of dengue virus. They are: Concepcion (174 cases), Alto
Parana (153), Amambay (51), Central (37), and Alto Paraguay (11),
plus the Capital (12). At the same time, the departments free of
cases are: San Pedro, Cordillera, Guaira, Caazapa, Itapua, and Neembucu.

The confirmed dengue cases in the country, since the beginning of the
current epidemic period (in November 2009), total 477, with a total
of 1653 suspected cases, according to the latest official report. Of
the confirmed [cases], 19 required hospitalization and 9 had been
classified with alarming signs. To date, no dengue-associated deaths
have been registered, according to MSP.

In Asuncion, the neighborhoods affected by dengue outbreaks are:
Banado Tacumbu, Jara, Villa Morra, Loma Pyta, Mburucuya, San
Cristobal, and Herrera.

[Demonstrating the emergence of more virulent dengue virus strains
during an epidemic would require extensive prospective studies,
something that is difficult to accomplish when confronting an
epidemic involving 3 dengue virus serotypes and hundreds of cases.
