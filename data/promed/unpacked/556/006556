Re: ProMED-mail Post: "Influenza vaccine cross-protection: RFI 20051019.3051"
-----------------------------------------------
My thanks to all of you who responded to my question either with an
expression of interest or relevant information. Due to ProMED-mail's space
constraints and the maintenance of some confidentiality, I have abridged or
paraphrased the information below from the original responses. For those of
you who recognize the content, please email me directly if I have
misrepresented your statement, but I hope that I have not.
Vaccine content
---------------
All split vaccines contain HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase)
antigens, which are anchored in small fragments of the viral membrane.
Other viral proteins (such as matrix proteins, e.g. M2) can also be present
in these vaccines. In accordance with the WHO and CPMP guidelines for the
production of inactivated influenza vaccines, all the registered
inactivated influenza vaccines are controlled and released based upon their
content of HA (i.e. 15 ug by strain), the NA content is never mentioned in
the summary of product characteristics. Therefore, the reason NA content is
not indicated is only related to regulatory requirements.
Vaccine cross-protection (via the N1 component)
---------------
Most of the responses on this topic were speculative in nature, but there
were generally 2 opposing views on this point. Some responses suggested
that there should be some cross-protection, since the antigens are similar
enough to be classified in the same neuraminidase subtype (N1) by routine
typing assays. In contrast, other responses suggested that such
cross-protection cannot be relied upon. Perhaps one line of reasoning for
the latter is that, if there was some degree of cross-protection (assuming
that asymptomatic avian H5N1 human infections are very rare), the overall
case-fatality from the recent avian H5N1 influenza cases in Southeast Asia
should not be so high (>50 percent on average so far). Most people in
Southeast Asia would have had experience of H1N1, either through
vaccination or natural infection. With this case-fatality rate, unless the
mortality from H5N1 influenza is even higher in the absence of any N1
immunity, it is difficult to believe that there is any cross-protection
from the N1 component of H1N1 against avian H5N1 influenza.
I expect there may be some further responses to this summary. ProMED-mail
has asked that all responses be directed to me, and I will respond to them
personally. If any further useful information arises, I will contact
ProMED-mail regarding further postings.
