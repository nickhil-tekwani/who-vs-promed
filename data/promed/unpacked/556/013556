Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
In the United States, JYNNEOS vaccine is recommended for persons exposed to or at high risk for exposure to Monkeypox virus.

What is added by this report?
By 10 Oct 2022, a total of 931 155 JYNNEOS vaccine doses were administered in the United States. Among persons who received â‰¥1 vaccine dose, 51.4% were non-Hispanic White, 12.6% were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), and 22.5% were Hispanic persons. The percentages of vaccine recipients who were Black (5.6%) and Hispanic (15.5%) during 22 May-25 Jun 2022 increased to 13.3% and 22.7%, respectively, during 31 Jul-10 Oct 2022.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Tracking and addressing disparities in vaccination can reduce inequities and help ensure that disproportionately affected populations are protected.

[4] Canada (British Columbia): scam calls

Have you gotten a phone call lately informing you that you've been exposed to monkeypox? Well, many people in BC [British Columbia] have received alarming automated calls in recent days about their so-called positive diagnoses of viral infection, but officials are clearing up the concern.

The BC Centre for Disease Control (BC CDC) and several health authorities, including Vancouver Coastal Health, are alerting locals that this is a scam.

A statement from Provincial Health Services Authority and the BC CDC explains that there is no case in which public health will send an automated message to tell people they've been exposed or infected.

"After an individual has a positive test for a communicable disease, such as monkeypox, public health contacts individuals for follow-up and/or to identify people who may have been exposed to the communicable disease. This is known as case and contact tracing," the statement reads.

Most importantly, you will never be asked to provide financial information for test results and contact tracing.

In most cases, test results and contact tracing are handled by public health staff in the regional health authorities and not the Ministry of Health.

"Please be alert for cybercriminals sending fake phishing emails, texts and robocalls to steal your personal and financial details," the Provincial Health Services Authority urged.
