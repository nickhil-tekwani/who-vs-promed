Suspect beef triggers French BSE scare. The suspect beef was sold in French
supermarkets. The authorities in France say one of the leading supermarket
chains, Carrefour, has sold up to a ton of beef which may be infected with
Mad Cow Disease, or BSE (Bovine spongiform Encephalopathy). The authorities
say the beef came from a herd of 13 cattle which was slaughtered earlier
this month.
Tests later showed one of the animals had the disease, but by then meat
from the other animals was already on sale in 39 Carrefour supermarkets. A
cattle trader, his wife and son and a farm worker were detained for
questioning, a prosecutor in the western town of Bernay said. The trader
faces possible charges of selling goods liable to endanger health. Eating
beef infected with BSE can cause a similar brain disease in humans.
The French Green party has demanded an immediate ban on the feeding of
animal products to other animals, after a report cast doubt on French
efforts to stop transmission of the disease. France banned the use of meat
and bone meal (MBM) in foodstuffs for cattle herds in 1990, amid fears they
played a key role in transmitting BSE. But the Liberation daily said the
state consumer fraud agency, which checks compliance with the 1990 law, had
tolerated MBM in cattle feed for at least 2 years, however at levels of
less than 0.3%. Unlike Britain, France - which refuses to lift its ban on
UK beef imports in defiance of an European Commission ruling - does not bar
all cattle over the age of 30 months from human consumption. Under the
30-month rule, all cows in the UK over this age have to be slaughtered and
their carcasses incinerated.

Seven new cases of mad cow disease in France
----------------------------------------------
France reported 7 more cases of BSE amid growing consumer fears after
supermarkets unknowingly sold beef potentially contaminated with the
deadly, brain-wasting disease. The new discoveries brought to 78 the total
number of cases of BSE reported this year in France. Last year, France
reported 30 cases of BSE. Of the 7 new cases, 6 were detected under the
traditional surveillance system while the seventh was spotted under the
country's new BSE testing program launched in June.
Authorities destroyed all 7 cattle as well as their herds, for a total of
531 animals. 3 retail chains earlier this week alerted customers they had
sold beef from a herd in western France containing a cow suffering from
BSE. Approximately 10 makers of tripe and animal feed also received offal
and meat products from the same BSE-tainted herd, prompting a scramble to
track down contaminated food.
The revelations have forced the government to consider taking more
precautions against the spread of the disease, such as banning the feeding
of animal products to other animals. Currently, France only bans the use of
such products in cattle feed.
There have also been calls for a more systematic program of testing cattle
for BSE. Farm Minister Jean Glavany said the government was leaning towards
testing the 5 to 6 million cattle slaughtered in France each year, but it
would take time to set up the necessary infrastructure and the tests were
not fully reliable.

Teen-Age Girl Latest Victim of Human Form of Mad Cow Disease
--------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON -A 14-year-old girl became the latest person to die of new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD or vCJD), the human form of mad cow
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE). The victim died at her home in
Wigan in northern England, just days after her family allowed television
cameras to record her plight. She was seen lying virtually motionless in bed.
The British government this week promised millions of dollars in
compensation for families stricken by the disease. It released an
independent report Thursday showing officials were slow to respond to
evidence of its threat to human health.
It said mistakes were made in the handling of the crisis, including a
6-month delay in informing the public about the disease after government
scientists identified it in late 1995, for fear of causing panic and
damaging British trade.
A total of 81 people have now died from the brain-wasting disease in
Britain and 5 other cases are suspected. Three lawsuits have been filed
against the government.
