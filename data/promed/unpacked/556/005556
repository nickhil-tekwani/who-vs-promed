USDA Veterinary Services has been working with state and industry partners on an investigation into swine mortalities attributed to _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _zooepidemicus_ (_S. zooepidemicus_ or strep zoo).

Strep zoo can be zoonotic, meaning that it can be transferred and cause disease in humans. Strep zoo in horses is an opportunistic commensal bacterium meaning it can normally be found in the respiratory tract and cause disease. Humans who have contact with animals (horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, and cats) or consume unpasteurized milk products can be exposed to these bacteria, although it rarely caused disease. _S. zooepidemicus_ can cause severe and potentially fatal disease in humans.

Until recently, mortality events associated with _S. zooepidemicus_ or strep zoo in swine had not been reported in the United States. This disease has been detected in an aggregating yard in Ohio and slaughtering plants in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee. Earlier this year [2019] it was detected in a Canadian farm.

High mortality at a commercial cull sow slaughter facility in Tennessee confirms this bacterium has the potential to be devastating to a swine herd upon introduction.

Effective [23 Dec 2019] the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has designated _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _zooepidemicus_ (_S. zooepidemicus_) in swine a dangerous transmissible disease. Under the Domestic Animal Law at, 3 Pa.C.S. 2327(a) (relating to disease surveillance and detection), the Department has authority to monitor the domestic animal population of this Commonwealth to determine the prevalence, incidence, and location of transmissible diseases of animals.

This disease has been designated a DTD to protect the swine industry in Pennsylvania, potential infections in swine should be investigated to determine how widespread this organism is in swine and to assist producers in reducing the risk of infection and spread of disease.

The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture in conjunction with USDA VS is currently investigating the loss of a cull sow with heavy growth of _S. zooepidemicus_ having died at an approved livestock market. The adult sow was in poor body condition and debilitated and was consigned by a small livestock dealer/hauler along with 4 other sows in a similar state (of health).

Traceback revealed the sow had passed through a livestock dealer/hauler that had a recent spike in mortality in their holding facility. The livestock dealer/hauler then proceeded to market the surviving sows to a slaughter only livestock auction during which one died. The remaining sows in question have been traced forward and confirmed to have gone to slaughter.

The traceback premises where the sows were held and farrowed are currently under quarantine for _S. zooepidemicus_ and diagnostic samples are pending.

The sows appear to have originated from a single farm having been gradually selling down because the facility was run down and in need of many general repairs. Currently the farm consists of approximately 90 pigs. The 3 most debilitated sows were euthanized on the premises and diagnostic samples are pending. The remainder of swine on the premises will be moved by permit directly to a slaughter facility with no possibility of diversion.

Contact the office of Dr. Kevin Brightbill, state veterinarian, PA Department of Agriculture, at 717-705-1626, with any questions or concerns regarding this threat.

_Strep zoo_ Q&A

What do I need to be on lookout for?
Clinical signs include sudden onset lethargy, weakness, high fever and swift spread among pigs of highly varied sources and rapidly escalating mortality approaching 30 to 50% among affected populations.

What do I need to do?
If you suspect this disease in your herd, you should immediately call your accredited veterinarian. Based on clinical signs and history, a foreign animal disease investigation may be initiated to rule out African Swine Fever and Classical Swine Fever or other disease presenting with similar clinical signs. Your veterinarian will counsel you on disease and treatment options.

How do I prevent introduction of this disease into my herd?
Implementing a daily farm-level biosecurity plan to prevent disease introduction is critical. The basis of a biosecurity plan is establishing a distinct line of separation which requires minimum biosecurity requirements be met in order to enter (clean coveralls, clean boots, boot wash, +/- shower provided by farm, etc.).

Current evidence points to the disease moving through commingling of sows in slaughter channels. Enhanced biosecurity plans paying particular attention to risk associated with moving animals on and off the farm is key.

Pay close attention to how vehicles enter your farm and load and unload livestock. The goal should be to never have the driver enter your facility. They should either remain in their truck or go no farther than their trailer. You should require only clean conveyances enter your farm to avoid the conveyance being a fomite to bring disease on to your farm. Your staff should load cull animals up to and not entering the livestock trailer and then clean and disinfect loading chute.

_Streptococcus_ spp., including _S. equi_, are relatively susceptible to disinfection. Some products commonly used include hypochlorites (primarily household bleach), quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolic compounds, potassium peroxymonosulfate, and accelerated hydrogen peroxides.

Exposure to direct sunlight has been shown to be beneficial, as cultured _S. equi_ was shown to survive less than 24 hours on wood, rubber, and metal surfaces when in direct sunlight.

_Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _zooepidemicus_

Key Points
----------
- Starting on [28 Sep 2019] a high mortality event occurred in a cull sow slaughter plant in Tennessee. A chiller malfunction caused the hold of 22 loads of cull sows. On [30 Sep 2019], Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) reported over 40% of the 2222 sows in holding pens, dead or euthanized when condemned on antemortem inspection. Samples from the affected sows in Tennessee showed _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _zooepidemicus_ (_S. zooepidemicus_).

- Preliminary information suggests that similar events may have occurred at other locations in the United States. This includes a continuous-flow swine aggregating and buying station in Ohio epidemiologically linked to the event in Tennessee. Reports from knowledgeable individuals describe both feeder swine and cull sows as being affected.

- The finding of high mortality rates in cull swine at holding facilities is unusual. The cause of this and similar recent events identified in the United States are under investigation to understand if _S. zooepidemicus_ is the single cause or if the deaths are due to multiple factors.

- The Canada West Swine Health Intelligence Network (CWSHIN) 2019 Second Quarter Swine Disease Report described detections of _S. zooepidemicus_ in sows and gilts that occurred in Manitoba at the beginning of May 2019. In April 2019 and May 2019, Canada noted other similar swine die-offs. Although the Canadian Network watched for additional high mortality events linked to _S. zooepidemicus_, they had not noted any previous trends in swine.

- China has reported significant detections of _S. zooepidemicus_ in swine. The reports emphasize large economic losses to the swine industry affecting sows and replacement gilts and has become a threat to human health. [1-4]

- _S. zooepidemicus_ is a zoonotic organism. Although rare, it can cause severe illness in humans exposed to infected horses or other infected species. This includes exposure through consumption of associated unpasteurized milk products.

Concerns for U.S. Animal Health
-------------------------------
- There is a need to investigate and understand the exposure and the epidemiology of _S. zooepidemicus_ in swine to avoid potential negative economic impacts to the swine industry.

- Identification of effective measures are needed to prevent negative impacts due to _S. zooepidemicus_ infection in swine. Further investigation of this pathogen is required to determine the role, if any, of _S. zooepidemicus_ in high mortality events in swine.

- Current recommended controls to decrease the impact of _S. zooepidemicus_ infection in swine include reducing transportation-related stressors. These include trauma, extreme temperatures, inclement weather, malnutrition, and extended holding times prior to slaughter.

Prevention in swine
-------------------
- Decrease stress related to transport. Stress is a common factor noted in the recent investigations related to the swine deaths at holding facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Canada. Additionally, stress was also observed in a recent report of _S. zooepidemicus_ in dogs in Georgia.

- Avoid holding animals in pens overnight to several days [20]. Proper cleaning and disinfection of pens and equipment before introducing new animals decreases the risk of pathogen transmission [19].

- Avoid commingling groups of transported swine, as direct contact occurs along with other stress factors.

- Minimize or mitigate conditions for swine presenting risks for trauma, including exposure to extreme temperatures, overcrowding, inclement weather, malnutrition, inadequate water supply, or loud noises.

- Early identification of _S. zooepidemicus_ can facilitate appropriate medical intervention and timely epidemiologic surveillance, preventing the spread of a potentially life-threatening pathogen [11].

- There is currently no commercial vaccine available for _S. zooepidemicus_ for any species, though autogenous vaccines may have limited use [22].

[_Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ is a mucosal commensal and opportunistic pathogen infecting several animals and humans. Therefore it is a zoonotic disease. We seem to be seeing more issues with strep. zoo_. We have seen it affect dogs, horses, pigs, rabbits, and humans. Furthermore, it seems like we are seeing it on a boarder scale. The question becomes, are we getting better at recognizing this disease, or is the disease changing or spreading to affect more species?

Strep. zoo can cause sepsis, mastitis, fever, inflammation of thorax, lymph nodes, or abdomen, and bronchopneumonia, and more, depending on the organism it infects. Currently there are recognized 7 different strains of this bacterium.

As we face a new decade, this may be one we will be seeing more. - Mod.TG
