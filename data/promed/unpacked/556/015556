For the 1st time in 35 years, a skunk has tested positive for rabies in Los Angeles County [California].

Long Beach's health officer Dr. Mitchell Kushner tells the Los Angeles Times Monday [30 Jun 2014] that a woman noticed the skunk behaving erratically in her neighborhood and notified animal control. She said she didn't touch it.

Kushner says a state lab is determining how the skunk got the disease, but it may have been bitten by a bat. Bats make up 80 percent of the state's rabies cases.

It's the county's 1st rabid skunk since 1979, but others have been found more recently in central and northern California, including a dead skunk that tested positive in June [2014] in Monterey County.

Skunks with the disease will appear disoriented and have crusty eyes and noses.

[Historically in North America, skunk rabies occurs mainly in 4 geographic regions: (1) southern Ontario and Quebec and upper New York State; (2) the north central United States and the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta; (3) California; and (4) south central United States (Texas and several adjacent states). Although it cannot be ruled out that the skunk may have become infected by exposure to a rabid bat, the virus variants that circulate in skunks are different from those maintained by bats. It is crucial to conduct phylogenetic studies of this virus to assess the significance of this finding.
