Here is the latest official press release from the Fiji Ministry of Health
on dengue fever.
Contact: Dr. A.U. Boladuadua
Director, Primary and Preventive Health Services
The latest reports indicate that weekly cases of dengue are declining
overall nationally. However, there are several areas where dengue appears
to be on the rise, and virtually every area of the country is still
reporting at least some dengue cases each week. There have been 17,779
suspected cases presenting at Ministry of Health facilities since the
epidemic began in mid-December with 901 admissions, primarily for those
with dengue haemorrhagic fever. To date, nearly 2.2% of the population has
been affected, with nearly 5% affected in the Central Division. Western,
Northern and Eastern Divisions all remain at less than 1%. The death toll
remains at 10, with all reported deaths occurring in the Suva area.
Savusavu and Lakeba Island are the latest areas experiencing a sudden rise
in suspected cases of Dengue fever. SDMO Cakaudrove reported that Savusavu
Hospital has seen 179 suspected cases in the past two weeks, and admitted
at least 36 serious cases since January 2. There have been 10 admissions in
the last week alone. On Lakeba island, there were 102 suspected cases in
the last week, more than doubling the total number of suspected cases seen
to date, with at least 3 persons hospitalised to date. At least five
persons tested positive for dengue in the past week, confirming that dengue
is still actively circulating on Lakeba.
In Labasa Hospital, there were at least 12 suspected dengue cases seen in
the last week, with at least four testing positive for dengue. There have
223 suspected cases seen to date, with 21 admissions, and 35 dengue
positives. Cases also appear to be on the rise in the Rewa and Tailevu
subdivisions, though a lower overall rate of admissions in the Central
Division in the last week may indicate that fewer serious cases are being
seen. Overall, the Welcome Virus Lab in Suva has tested 907 serum
samples since the epidemic began in December, or which 219 were either IgG,
IgM or both IgG and IgM positive for dengue. Reports from an arbovirus
laboratory in Brisbane, Australia confirmed that the samples tested have
been positive for type 2 dengue Virus.
