[The Deputy Director-General (Public Health), Datuk Dr Abdul Aziz Mahmood,
of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia, in his reply to a reader's letter
concerning the "Health Ministry's handling of the [recent JE outbreak" has
provided some information on the outbreak and the government's action to
control it. He also stated that the so-called "gag order" mentioned in an
article published by another newspaper on Feb 11, 1999 (see ProMED-mail
post 990118215209) was "based on misinformation." The Deputy
Director-General's letter also answers, at least partly, the points raised
by Mod. JW in the above posting. - Mod.CYC
JE is endemic in Malaysia and cases occur sporadically throughout the year.
Outbreaks of the disease occurred in 1974 in Langkawi (10 cases and two
deaths), in 1978 in Penang (nine cases, four deaths) and in 1992 in Sarawak
(10 cases and three deaths).
The recent outbreak in Ipoh involved 25 cases and claimed 13 lives and in
Seremban it claimed five lives out of seven cases.
When the Health Ministry was informed that patients were admitted to the
hospital due to viral encephalitis, immediate action and investigation were
carried out by health officers in Ipoh to determine the causative agent and
how it spread. A medical team comprising physicians, virologists,
epidemiologists, veterinary experts as well as entomologists was also
involved in the investigations.
Laboratory investigation done by experts at the Institute for Medical
Research (IMR) has confirmed the outbreak was caused by JE virus. Almost
all victims of this outbreak were workers at pig farms and those who
handled the animals.
The outbreak, up until now, has been controlled. It is confined only to the
pig farms in Ulu Piah, Tambun and Jalan Ampang in Ipoh, Perak and a farm in
Sikamat, Seremban.
Local experts in epidemiology, veterinary and virology have met and had
several meetings to formulate an integrated plan of action to control and
prevent the spread of the disease. Other departments such as Department of
Veterinary Services, Ministry of Housing and Local Government, together
with the Health Ministry were also involved in formulating the plan.
Some of the Health Ministry's actions include monitoring the incidence of
JE, vector control activities to reduce the population of _Culex_
mosquitoes in pig farms and their surrounding areas, vaccinating people in
high-risk areas and disseminating health information to the public. More
than 150,000 pamphlets in various languages have been distributed.
Information about the disease has also been publicised in the mass media
through numerous statements from the State Department of Health and the
Health Ministry in television, radio, newspapers and magazines. Health
education has also been given to those working in pig farms and to the
high-risk group.
Fogging has been carried out in 2,307 pig farms and 68,401 houses situated
near the farms. About 110,000 doses of JE vaccine have been given to
workers, farmers, their family members, those handling pigs and some from
the high-risk group staying within two kilometres from pig farms.
The Department of Veterinary Services is responsible for ensuring pigs are
not moved out except to abattoirs. It is also taking steps to reduce the
pig population in the affected farms before they are relocated. Studies on
JE vaccination for pigs to protect them from harbouring JE virus are being
carried out by the department.
The Ministry is aware the country is facing the challenge of emerging
zoonotic diseases through the expansion of the livestock industry.
Surveillance of zoonotic diseases will be stepped up. The Ministry has
strengthened the capability and expertise of the IMR laboratory to detect
zoonotic diseases. Studies on zoonotic diseases have been carried out with
the co-operation of the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA).
