The US Fish and Wildlife Service says feral hogs at Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge are infected with brucellosis and pseudorabies.

The wildlife service said Wednesday [12 Dec 2012] it worked with the US Agriculture Department to collect and test samples from 46 feral swine. The results revealed 10 of the beasts had swine brucellosis and 16 had pseudorabies.

Refuge biologist Rick Eastridge says that shouldn't discourage hunting the animals. But hunters should take appropriate precautions when handling their kills.

The wildlife service says hunters should wear rubber gloves and wash with soap and hot water as soon as possible after handling a feral pig carcass. Meat from feral hogs should be cooked thoroughly before being eaten.

[The rapid growth of the feral swine population in the USA raises concern and entails health risks for humans, domestic animals, and the whole ecosystem.

_Brucella suis_ is a pathogen that can be transmitted to humans and spillover into the domestic population can adversely impact profits. Pseudorabies is an acute, frequently fatal disease with a worldwide distribution that affects swine primarily and other domestic and wild animals incidentally. The pseudorabies virus has emerged as a significant pathogen in the USA since the 1960s, probably because of the increase in confinement swine housing or perhaps because of the emergence of more virulent strains. Pseudorabies is a reportable disease. To see the USDA National Feral Swine mapping system, go to http://128.192.20.53/nfsms/.
