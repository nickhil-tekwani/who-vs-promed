[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but will be available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 44 newly confirmed cases in China, 11 of which were imported and 33 were locally acquired, 31 in Beijing, 1 in Hebei province and 1 in Zhejiang province. No new deaths were reported. No new cases were reported in Hong Kong or in Macau. A total of 1856 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

There were 11 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 4 were imported. There were 6 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time and 2 cases were reported on 14 Jun 2020. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327). More in-depth follow-up information on the ongoing outbreak in Beijing can be found in section [1] of COVID-19 update (262): China (Beijing) superspreaders, WHO, global 20200616.7473860.

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 43 cases and 1 new death, compared with 34 cases and 1 new death during the previous day (15 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 70 consecutive days. Today's (16 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 31 cases were locally transmitted, and 12 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (12), Gyeonggi (11), Daejeon (5). Incheon (2), and Chungnam (1). Imported cases were in quarantine (7), Gyeonggi (2) Seoul (1), Daegu (1), and Jeju (1). Note that 10 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) has updated cluster information and tables and graphs as of yesterday's information (15 Jun 2020-0:00 16 Jun 2020) in notices 377 and 378.
Clusters in Seoul include:
- newly planted churches: 166 cases
- Coupang logistics center, Bucheon-si, Gyeonggi province: 152 cases
- sports facility Yangcheon-gu Seoul: 66 cases
- Seongsim Day Care center: 22 cases
- Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance branch, Gangnam-gu, Seoul: 6 cases
- teacher at Incheon Jeil High School, Gyeonggi positive: 1130 students and staff to be tested
- nurse at National Health Insurance Ilsan Hospital in Goyang-si, Gyeonggi province: epidemiologic investigation and contact tracing under way.

There is a chart showing the community transmitted cases over the past 2 weeks.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super-spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 237 500 cases, including 34 405 deaths, up by 210 cases and 34 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (15 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 303 cases and 26 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 143 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4903_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4903_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (143) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 18 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (8 provinces reported no new cases), with only 2 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Piedmont, 29 cases and Emilia-Romagna, 13 cases).

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 43 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 27 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[As of 16 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 192 439, including 9065 deaths, an increase of 2563 cases and 115 deaths since 15 Jun 2020. The media report above mentions that 10 provinces are classified as 'red zone', up from previous reports of 7 provinces, signs that the increases are spreading geographically within Iran.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. As stated previously, with the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran approximately 4-6 weeks following lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while there was still ongoing major active transmission. This is a tenacious virus with the overwhelming majority of the world still susceptible to it ...

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 208 400, including 119 132 deaths, an increase from 2 182 950 cases and 118 283 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 207 373 as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 16 Jun 2020 including 17 455 confirmed deaths and an additional 4690 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, New York Alabama, and Illinois.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, unchanged from yesterday (15 Jun 2020). California, Texas, and Florida have high daily newly confirmed cases and may well change the ordering of this list over the coming week or so. A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.

In addition, in the MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report) released yesterday (15 Jun 2020), there is a presentation of epidemiologic analyses on the confirmed cases reported in the USA from 22 Jan 2020 through 30 May 2020. As has been demonstrated in other studies, age and chronic diseases were risk factors for serious disease and death. In addition, the data showed racial differences influencing hospitalization, serious disease, and death rates, confirming reports published in the media and in scientific journals, coming from hospitals and states. The article is: Stokes EK, Zambrano LD, Anderson KN, et al. Coronavirus disease 2019 case surveillance -- United States, January 22-May 30, 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 15 Jun 2020; http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6924e2 and is definitely worth reading.
