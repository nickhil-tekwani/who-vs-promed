A recent WHO sponsored international mission visited the Kasai Oriental
region of the Democratic Republic of Congo in October 1997. During active
case searching in the region, 419 suspect cases were identified during this
investigation, with onset of disease between February, 1996 and October,
1997. Two peaks of cases were observed, respectively in August, 1996 and
August, 1997.
Ninety-eight per cent of these cases reported fever, 11% diarrhoea, 41%
cough, 69% cervical lymphadenopathy, 63% sore throat and 50% mouth ulcers.
None reported paralysis. Five cases died (case fatality ratio 1.5%).
These individuals ranged in age from four to eight years and all died
within three weeks of rash onset.
Analysis of epidemiological data and biological specimens is ongoing. A
preliminary report of the mission findings is due to appear in the December
issue of the WER and Eurosurveillance.

[Thanks very much for the much-needed up-date. I suppose that many of us
are keeping a wary eye on the burgeoning epidemiology of monkeypox. BTW:
5/419 = 1.2% case fatality rate. - Mod.CHC
