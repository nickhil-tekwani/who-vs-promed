Foreign Animal Disease Investigation in Arizona
-----------------------------------------------
On Friday, 10 Oct 2003, USDA was notified that Mexico had shut down the
border to all live cattle from the United States based on findings of
lesions in a shipment of approximately 40 cattle that were awaiting export
to Mexico from Nogales, AZ.
Preliminary test results were negative for foot and mouth disease.
Preliminary serologic tests were negative for antibodies to FMD viruses.
Preliminary serologic results were positive for bovine papular stomatitis.
Bovine papular stomatitis is occasionally found in young cattle and is not
a foreign animal disease. It is endemic to the United States and, if
confirmed, would not jeopardize U.S. livestock exports.
Earlier today, USDA contacted our counterparts in Mexico to express concern
about the overly restrictive action they took in shutting down the border
to U.S. livestock. Mexico was in the process of modifying their ban in
favor of a somewhat more measured regulatory response (restricting imports
from only the local area where the cattle originated).
However, in the interim, the test results for a foreign animal disease have
come back negative, USDA has conveyed this to Mexico, and Mexico has now
agreed to allow trade to resume as normal. Sera were negative for VS and
FMD CF antibody on 10 Oct 2003 and for ELISA on 11 Oct 2003. Probang
samples were negative for FMDV CF antigen on 11 Oct 2003.

[Bovine papular stomatitis (BPS) is a benign disease of cattle, endemic in
the Western hemisphere. It is caused by an epitheliotropic double-stranded
DNA poxvirus of the genus _Parapoxvirus_ (PPV), which also includes the
closely related Contagious ecthyma of sheep and goats (Orf, Scabby mouth)
and other diseases. More than 100 "false alarms" due to BPS reach the Plum
Island labs annually for differentiation from other vesicular diseases in
bovines. - Mods.AS/PC]
