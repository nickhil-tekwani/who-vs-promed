SARS-CoV-2 in animals (inf. with), United Kingdom
-------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start on: [9 Jul 2021]
Confirmed: 22 Aug 2021
Reported: 24 Aug 2021
Ended: [9 Jul 2021]
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Event morbidity (%): 100
Event mortality: -
Zoonotic potential: -
Diagnostic details: Laboratory test
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

Outbreak location: Trinity, Jersey
Started: 9 Jul 2021
Ended: 9 Jul 2021
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Dog / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Direct contact with a COVID-19-positive human (person confirmed by PCR test).
Epidemiological comments: A domestic dog from a COVID-positive household was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. The dog was presented to a private veterinary surgeon in a collapsed state on 9 Jul 2021. It was unresponsive to treatment and was humanely euthanised later the same day. Swabbing for SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken post-mortem by a private veterinary surgeon and sent to a private laboratory for testing. On receipt of the result, the private veterinary surgeon notified the Government of Jersey veterinary section. Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) repeated testing of the original sample at the UK National Reference Lab for SARS-CoV-2, by PCR with positive result. There was no other material available to test. Live SARS-CoV-2 virus was not detected in cell culture from the swab wash eluate sample by virus isolation after 7 days. There are no other pets in the household. The case is considered resolved. Conclusions: There is sufficient evidence that the dog was infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate if the dog was clinically affected by the virus and the dog had other significant underlying health conditions. Origin of the infection suspected to be direct contact with person diagnosed with COVID-19. Nota bene: The outbreak location used is that of the Government of Jersey veterinary section to protect any data relating to people.
