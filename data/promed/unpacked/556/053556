[1] USA: cases in children
Date: Thu 09 Sep 2021

For the 1st time during the pandemic, children now account for more than 1/4 of new weekly US COVID-19 cases, according to the latest report from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

Nearly 252 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported for the week ending 2 Sep [2021], the largest number recorded for children during the pandemic, according to the report. Children accounted for 26.8% of reported weekly US cases [https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/].

The AAP said this was the largest number of child cases in a week since the pandemic began.

"After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially, with over 750 000 cases added between 5 Aug [2021] and 2 Sep [2021]," the AAP said.

Hospitalization and death are still rare outcomes in pediatric cases of the virus, the AAP said. But as school starts across the country with the delta (B1617.2) variant surging, more cases in kids are likely.

In Southern states, including Texas, where schools have been in session for weeks, the impact of delta is already being seen.

At least 45 small school districts across the state have been forced to temporarily stop offering in-person classes because of COVID-19 cases during the 1st few weeks of school, the Texas Tribune reports. The closures affect at least 40 000 students [https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/03/texas-covid-school-districts-shut-down/].

"From 23-29 Aug [2021], there were 27 353 new positive COVID-19 cases among students in Texas public schools, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, making it the biggest one-week increase in the entire pandemic," the Texas Tribune wrote.

13 school employees from Miami-Dade County Public Schools have died from COVID-19 since 16 Aug [2021], CNN reports. School started in that county on 23 Aug [2021]; since then at least 147 students and 186 employees have tested positive for COVID-19 [https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/07/us/miami-school-employees-covid/index.html].

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 151 896, according to the Washington Post tracker. In the past week, new daily reported cases fell 5.4%, hospitalizations fell 3.6%, and deaths rose 12.7% [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic].

Yesterday the New York Times reported 152 393 cases, including 1499 deaths. Roughly 100 000 Americans are currently hospitalized for COVID-19.

But cases are still higher in many parts of the country compared to the winter surge. And hospitals in many hot spots are continuing to report full intensive care units.

Public health officials in Idaho announced yesterday that they have activated "crisis standards of care" for the state's northern hospitals, which have more COVID-19 patients than they can handle, the Associated Press reports. The move will allow the hospitals to ration care, in order to treat patients who are more likely to survive [https://apnews.com/article/business-health-public-health-coronavirus-pandemic-idaho-db21f9a14254996144e78aafb1518259].

In related news, healthcare workers in Detroit have filed a lawsuit against the Henry Ford Health System, claiming its vaccine mandate violates the 14th amendment's protection of "personal autonomy and bodily integrity," Axios reports [https://www.axios.com/detroit-hospital-system-sued-covid-vaccine-mandate-8ec6d691-4c08-4ed1-aefe-20ca67c662fa.html].

This is the 2nd time a major health system has been challenged for requiring COVID-19 vaccines. Earlier this summer, a Texas hospital's policy of mandatory vaccination was unsuccessfully challenged in the courts.

[2] WHO: Vaccines - moratorium on boosters
Date: Thu 9 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/who-extends-moratorium-booster-covid-vaccine-doses


At a briefing today, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) called for a global moratorium on COVID-19 vaccine booster doses to be extended until the end of the year [2021] to allow more people in low- and middle-income countries to be vaccinated.

In other developments, the WHO's weekly snapshot of the pandemic shows that global cases and deaths remain at a high plateau, with the Americas standing out as one of the main hot spots.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said today at the briefing that high-income countries have pledged 1 billion doses, but less than 15% of the promised supply has materialized [https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---8-september-2021].

The supply picture hasn't changed much since August [2021], when the WHO first called for the booster dose moratorium until the end of September [2021], Tedros said. He called for an extension until the end of the year [2021] to allow all countries to vaccinate at least 40% of their populations.

"Manufacturers have promised to prioritize COVAX and low-income countries," Tedros said, adding, "We don't want any more promises. We just want the vaccines."

Tedros pointed to a statement yesterday from the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (IFPMA), which said G7 countries now have enough vaccine for all adults and teens, as well as for booster doses for at-risk groups, and that scale-up now should shift to global vaccine equity and dose sharing [https://www.ifpma.org/resource-centre/momentum-of-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-production-scale-up-is-now-sufficient-for-step-change-in-distribution-and-opens-way-for-urgent-political-leadership-and-country-preparedness/].

The IFPMA said international production will reach 7.5 billion doses by the end of September [2021], adding nearly 1.5 billion doses each month. And that by January [2022], there will be enough for every adult on every continent.

He countered that manufacturers and high-income countries have long had the capacity to vaccinate their priority groups while supporting immunization of the same groups throughout the world.

In related vaccine developments, the WHO and its COVAX partners -- the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi -- today released vaccine supply forecasts for 2021 and early 2022 [https://www.who.int/news/item/08-09-2021-joint-covax-statement-on-supply-forecast-for-2021-and-early-2022].

They expect COVAX doses to reach 1.425 billion in 2021, of which 1.2 billion will be available to lower-income countries. The amount is enough to cover 20% of country populations, or 40% of all adults.

The groups said the total won't reach the 2-billion-dose milestone that it had hoped to deliver in 2021 until the 1st quarter of 2022.

Though COVAX has made significant progress, with 240 million doses delivered to 139 countries in just 6 months, they said the global picture is still unacceptable. Only 20% of people in lower- and middle-income countries have received their 1st doses, compared with 80% in higher-income countries.

In its weekly situation update, the WHO said 4.4 million COVID cases were reported last week, marking a stable pattern at a very high level. All regions saw declining or stable cases, except for the Americas, where cases rose 19% over the previous week [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---7-september-2021].

Deaths remained steady globally, too, but they were up by 17% in the Americas and 20% in Europe. The United States, again one of the world's main hot spots, led the world with the most new cases last week, followed by India, the United Kingdom, Iran, and Brazil.

4 more countries reported their 1st delta (B1617.2) variant detections, putting the total at 174.

More global headlines
- The pandemic has had devastating impacts on battles against HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria in 2020, the Global Fund said today in a new report. Though progress was made in some areas, key programs declined for the 1st time in the Global Fund's 20-year history. For example, the number of people treated for drug-resistant TB fell by 19% in countries supported by Global Fund programs, with treatment for extensively drug-resistant TB declining 37% [https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2021-09-08-global-fund-results-report-reveals-covid-19-devastating-impact-on-hiv-tb-and-malaria-programs/].

[3] Neutralization: mu variant
Date: Mon 6 Sep 2021

Citation: Uriu K, Kimura I, Shirakawa K, et al. Ineffective neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 Mu variant by convalescent and vaccine sera. bioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459005

Abstract
On August 30, 2021, the WHO classified the SARS-CoV-2 mu variant (B.1.621 lineage) as a new variant of interest. The WHO defines "comparative assessment of virus characteristics and public health risks" as primary action in response to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants [https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/]. Here, we demonstrate that the mu variant is highly resistant to sera from COVID-19 convalescent and BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals. Direct comparison of different SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins revealed that mu spike is more resistant to serum-mediated neutralization than all other currently recognized variants of interest (VOI) and concern (VOC). This includes the beta variant (B.1.351) that has been suggested to represent the most resistant variant to convalescent and vaccinated sera to date (e.g., Collier et al., Nature, 2021; Wang et al., Nature, 2021). Since breakthrough infection by newly emerging variants is a major concern during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Bergwerk et al., NEJM, 2021), we believe that our findings are of significant public health interest. Our results will help to better assess the risk posed by the mu variant for vaccinated, previously infected and naive populations.

[The Mu variant has been detected in 39 countries as of 30 Aug 2021. The majority of mu variants harbor 8 mutations in the spike. One of these changes, E484K change, has been shown to reduce sensitivity towards antibodies induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. So far, the mu variant doesn't seem to be spreading quickly: It accounts for fewer than 1% of COVID-19 cases globally. In Colombia, where it was first detected, it may be responsible for about 39% of cases. Concern stems from the Mu variant showing a pronounced resistance to antibodies elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. - Mod.LK]

- The Americas region reported 28.8% of daily case numbers and 24.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 85.39 million cases. The USA reported over 98 000 cases in the last 24 hours, followed by Brazil. 8 additional countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, while 1 country reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases. Many countries including Canada, El Salvador, and Haiti did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 33.1% of daily case numbers and 29.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 66.47 million cases. Many countries not reporting cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Spain, Belgium (2 cases), Israel, Switzerland (6 cases), and Kazakhstan, among others. 20 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, and an additional 12 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10.0% of daily case numbers and 13.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 15.02 million cases. Iran reported the highest number of cases (27 138) over the last 24 hours, followed by Iraq, Morocco, Pakistan, Jordan, Occupied Palestinian territory, Lebanon, and Libya. UAE reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The African region reported 0.27% of daily case numbers and 0.17% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 5.74 million cases. Only two countries, Réunion and Mayotte, reported cases over the last 24 hours, while no cases were reported by the remaining countries in the past 24 hours. Clearly, the exact burden of new cases cannot be determined by this consistent pattern of underreporting.

- The Western Pacific region reported 14.6% of daily case numbers and 12.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 7.14 million cases. Malaysia reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours (over 18 000 cases), followed by Philippines, Vietnam, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea, Australia, and Cambodia.

- The South East Asia region reported 13.0% of the daily newly reported cases and 18.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 41.85 million cases. India is dominant reporting over 37 000 cases over the last 24 hours, followed by Thailand (14 176), Indonesia (6731), Bangladesh (2497), and Nepal (1347). Sri Lanka, and Maldives have not reported any cases for the last several days.

[In the past 24 hours, 16 countries including the USA (157 759), India (43 406), UK (38 797), Iran (26 854), Turkey (23 914), Malaysia (19 733), Russia (18 024), Philippines (17 818), Mexico (15 784), Germany (14 863), Brazil (14 430), Thailand (14 176), France (12 828), Vietnam (12 680), and Japan (10 323) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 10 211 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 6 Sep 2021 to late 7 Sep 2021). There appears to be a weekend related drop in the reported case numbers. A total of 62 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 35 of the 62 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 5.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 9.0% decrease in daily reported cases and a 9.8% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 650 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 223.43 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.61 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
