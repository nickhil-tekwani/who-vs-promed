[Is this dengue? What needs to be done to help this situation in a very
remote and mountainous area of PNG? - Leslie]
I have been working in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea [PNG]
since April 1994, when I started my Doctoral Research amoung the Duna; I
spent about 20 months there. Since then I have undertaken close to 2 years
fieldwork among the Bogaia, Yeru, Hewa and Paiela [Southern Highland
Province peoples], working as a consultant for the PJV - Porgera
Gold Mine.
As well as yaws [see: Yaws, re-emergence - Papua New Guinea 980911225040
and Yaws, re-emergence - Papua New Guinea (02) 980915005531], the Bogaia
seem to be suffering from a hemorrhagic fever of some sort. In the [past? -
Mod CHC] 7-8 years, 60 or so people have died from a new disease.
This is in a total population of 262 people. The symptoms, as described to
us, are as follows: the victims arms, legs and stomachs swell up,
they suffer from fever, become jaundiced and bleed primarily from the eyes, ears
and mouth. In the cases we recorded, all the victims were said to have died
within 24-48 hours of the onset of symptoms.
The households worst effected by this disease, were/are those situated at
lower altitudes, below 800-900 meters. Since the time Paul Sillitoe visited
the Bogaia (1983) all lower altitude houses and territories have been
abandoned, bar one house. We do not have any idea what this disease is, but
it appears to be killing people at an alarming rate. The deaths occurred
amongst young to middle aged adults, which is counter to regular deaths
patterns in remote rural areas.
We alerted the IMR [PNG Institute for Medical Research - government
supported, with very dedicated researchers] in Goroka [Eastern Highlands
Province] to both yaws and this other disease, but they said they didn't
have the funds to investigate. I though you might be interested.
The PJV has recently assisted Steve Lutz [Dr Steve Lutz of Mambisanda
Lutheran Hospital] to conduct a health patrol in the Hewa area, but not all
the areas in which we identified yaws were covered by the patrol.

[The first thing to be done is to make an accurate, laboratory-based
diagnosis. While this might be somewhere between difficult and
impossible, given the location and situation, some attempt should be
made to collect blood samples and to send them to an Australian or
other competent laboratory. Without someone knowledgeable on the
ground, someone who could do the proper epidemiologic studies, there
is little hope this disease will be diagnosed. However, if it
continues or spreads and WHO authorities are alerted to the
situation, perhaps a study could be implemented.
I certainly hope this report is not ignored by national and
international authorities. - Mod CHC]
