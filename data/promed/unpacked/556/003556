The Selangor State Health Department (JKNS) informed that another elderly man was confirmed to be infected with rabies in the Kuala Langat district on 22 Apr 2022, making it the 2nd case in the state so far.

Selangor Health Director Datuk Dr Sha'ari Ngadiman said the latest case involved an 85-year-old patient who was admitted to Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital (HTAR) Klang on 20 Apr 2022.

Dr Sha'ari said the victim was first referred to the Telok Panglima Garang Health Clinic due to anemia (pale) before being admitted to HTAR.

He said the victim's family members found that the senior citizen's behavior had changed because he was an active person and able to manage himself. "Examination found that he had a wound on his right leg that had not healed for the past 2 months. For the past 2 weeks, he also complained of headaches and loss of appetite.

"He also has a history of being bitten by a wild dog in his residential area on Carey Island 2 months ago," he said via JKNS' official Facebook.

Dr Sha'ari said a spinal fluid (CSF) sample and a nucleus biopsy of the victim were done on 22 Apr 2022 and confirmed positive for rabies by the Institute for Medical Research (IMR).

The senior citizen is now in stable condition and is still being treated at the HTAR isolation ward, he said.

JKNS on 10 Apr 2022 informed of a death case involving a local man who was confirmed to be infected with rabies on 4 Apr 2022.

[OIE declared Malaysia rabies free in 2012, 3 years after the last earlier event. Unfortunately, in 2015 the disease recurred. This happened on both of Malaysia's main territories: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (composed of the states Sabah, Sarawak, and Labuan or Malaysian Borneo, on the northern part of the island Borneo, which is shared with Indonesia).

Selangor is a state on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, encircling the capital Kuala Lumpur. For a map indicating the location of Selangor within Peninsular Malaysia and presenting also East Malaysia, see <tinyurl.com/4u3tpfr9>.

When the above media report was published (24 Apr 2022), the 85-year-old patient was "in stable condition and being treated at an isolation ward." He had been admitted to hospital on 20 Apr 2022 presenting behavioral changes and was diagnosed on 22 Apr 2022. Information on the evolvement of his condition will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
