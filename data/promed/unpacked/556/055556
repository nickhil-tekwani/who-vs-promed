UAB [University of Alabama] Hospital did not notify state health officials soon enough in a deadly legionellosis outbreak in one of its units that left 2 dead and 7 infected -- and it should have, said the assistant state health officer.

"The reality is that we are working with them where issues occurred and making sure it doesn't happen again," said Dr Mary McIntyre, assistant state health officer.

The state and county health department found out about the legionellosis [outbreak] on [19 May 2014] through the lab UAB used for testing, she said. UAB already knew about the cluster of cases, and from 7 to 9 May 2014 had already treated the water system, which was the culprit in spawning the deadly bacteria in the hematology/oncology unit with cancer patients especially susceptible to the bacteria.

2 people of 9 testing positive for the _Legionella_ bacterium, which can cause an acute pneumonia sometimes called legionnaires' disease, died in early May [2014]. UAB, citing patient confidentiality, won't disclose when they died.

McIntyre said underreporting of "reportable diseases" -- diseases required to be reported to state and federal health authorities -- is a big problem with a lot of hospitals, not just UAB, and the state is beginning a new program to heighten awareness.

Reportable diseases, such as legionellosis, in isolation need to be reported within 7 days and clusters such as the case here, need to be reported within 24 hours, said State Health Officer Don Williamson. "I think once the cluster was recognized -- we'd have liked to have known earlier -- but I think they acted appropriately" in fixing the problem, Williamson said.

She said everything UAB did, without guidance from disease control specialists with the Alabama Department of Public Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was done well and eradicated the problem.

UAB has reported 8 people who have been infected, but the Jefferson County and state health departments say a 9th person -- who was a visitor to the unit and had a compromised immune system -- also has tested positive for the infection. However, there have been no new cases since UAB's 7-9 May 2014 remediation process, which included using 160 deg F [71 deg C] water to flush the system.

Here's some of the timeline: Dr Loring Rue, the hospital's patient safety expert, said there was a legionellosis case back in March [2014], but they have not yet determined whether that one was hospital or community acquired. It did not raise alarm bells because _Legionella_ infection, while infrequent, is certainly not rare. 2 more positive cases, 1 in late April [2014], and 1 in early May [2014], led to efforts to find the problem, which proved to be the water system. From 7-9 May 2014, UAB flushed, shocked, and boiled the water system apparently eradicating the bacteria. No more cases have been discovered after that eradication process. Rue said he's learned that the hospital needs to better communicate with the state. "We can all learn from this in terms of being more communicative," he said.

McIntyre said there were 41 cases [of legionellosis] confirmed last year [2013], all were single cases except for one outbreak.

The Jefferson County Department of Health is working on a statement to the public aimed at easing fears over the deaths of 2 people at UAB Hospital who tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria, which cause an acute pneumonia sometimes called legionnaires' disease.

"It's not like the Ebola virus just hit Birmingham or anything like that," said Dr Mark Wilson, health officer for the county. Wilson said _Legionella_ bacteria are not all that uncommon and that they see "sporadic cases that hit several times a year."

It's also important to note that in these 2 deaths, the victims, who have not been identified, had other health problems that likely compromised their ability to fight it, Wilson said. In all 8 people were infected, all in the same hematology/oncology unit. The source is believed to be the water system specifically tied to floors 5-7 in the Women and Infant building.

UAB says it has made that water safe. The health department wants to stop fears that it may be bigger than an isolated incident, Wilson said. "It is safe to drink the city water -- that's one of the kind of fears we are trying to ease," Wilson said. The hospital is investigating to find any other patients who may have been exposed to the water in that area of the hospital.

Visitors to that area of the hospital are asked to see a doctor if they start having symptoms, Wilson said. "If someone was visiting that section and having symptoms, and was exposed to the water, then they should see a doctor and get it checked out," Wilson said. Citing confidentiality laws, UAB Hospital has declined to release the names of the patients nor the dates of their deaths except to say they occurred in "the early to mid-May range." The health department's statement will likely be released this afternoon, Wilson said.

CDC estimates that between 8000 and 18 000 people are hospitalized with legionnaires' disease in the United States each year.

[The news reports above says that the legionellosis outbreak occurred in a hematology/oncology unit on the 5-7 floors of the Women and Infant building and was tied to the water system in this part of the University of Alabama (UAB) hospital. The 1st case occurred in March 2014 and no additional cases have occurred since remediation of the water system that was undertaken on 7-9 May 2014. There has been a total of 8 or 9 cases; 2 were fatal and 1 involved an immunocompromised visitor to the unit affected.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

UAB Hospital is Alabama's major tertiary care center and a 908-bed modern medical complex, which serves as the teaching hospital for UAB School of Medicine. The hospital is, with 18 750 employees, the largest employer in Birmingham and the 2nd largest employer in Alabama (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAB_Hospital). The US News & World Report has ranked several of its clinical specialty programs among the nation's best.
