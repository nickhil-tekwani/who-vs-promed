[FMD is endemic in Myanmar, according to the Myanmar page on the WRLFMD (World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease) website http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/mya.htm, last updated in 2017, the following serotypes have been recorded there throughout the years:
FMDV-O: 1956-1958, 1971, 1977-1978, 1982, 1989, 1996, 1998-2011, 2015-2017
FMDV-A: 1971, 1978, 2010, 2015
FMDV-Asia 1: 1958, 1971, 1977-1978, 1982, 1989, 1991, 1997, 2000-2001, 2005, 2017. - Mod CRD

Subscribers are referred to the following comments on Myanmar (Pool 1), as published in the last (April 2017) monthly FAO/EC/EUFMD "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation" report:

"The analysis conducted by the WRLFMD on the VP1 sequence data submitted by the OIE Regional Reference Laboratory for FMD in Southeast Asia, Thailand relative to 13 FMDV field isolates collected in April 2017 in Myanmar, confirmed the circulation of Asia 1/ASIA/GVIII, O/ME-SA/Ind2001d and O/SEA/Mya-98 in this country.

"The detection of Asia 1 in a field sample relative to 2017, denotes the re-emergence of the serotype in this area, after its last detection in 2006 in Vietnam and 2009 in China (People's Rep. of) and it's most recent report in 2016 by Cambodia in WAHIS. The most closely related field virus not pertaining to the country is represented by BAN GA Sr-187 2013, with a seq id of 97.6 percent. This virus was isolated in cattle in Bangladesh, country that belongs to Pool 2".

Notably, the guest editor of the April monthly report, Dr Mark Bronsvoort (Roslin Institute and Royal -Dick- School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, UK) commented: "The re-emergence of Asia1 in this region is of concern after several years of not being reported. Given its closeness to an isolate from neighbouring Bangladesh from 2013, it raises many questions about where [whether?] this virus has been circulating undetected in the region or if this represents vaccine escape".

The reported absence of clinical cases in the sampled cattle farm is in line with Dr Bronsvoort's remark, indicating the need to exclude vaccine-sourced virus.
