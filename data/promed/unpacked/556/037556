HISTOPLASMOSIS, RESEARCHERS - ITALY EX ECUADOR: ALERT

We are currently investigating an outbreak of highly probable
histoplasmosis in a group of researchers who went to Ecuador from 19 Jul to
11 Aug 2006 for a scientific project. Of 27 travelers, 10 developed typical
symptoms (such as fever, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat with
oral ulcerations) while abroad, continuing in some cases after return. Four
more severe cases were found to have multiple lung nodules. A 5th case with
similar findings has been admitted to another Infectious Diseases
department in Brescia (according to Prof. Francesco Castelli).
We are collecting serum, urine and other biological material whenever
possible (from symptomatic cases as well as from all other members of the
expedition) for serology and antigen detection in urine. For the latter we
are still making contacts for a suitable laboratory and would welcome any
useful suggestion.
The only site that appears to have been visited by the whole group of
patients is a lodge in the Otonga Rain Forest that is the usual
accommodation of researchers of different countries. We are alerting
locally to take appropriate measures to reduce the contamination of the
site and to warn the next visitors.

[From the CDC website:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/histoplasmosis_g.htm>:
"_Histoplasma capsulatum_ grows in soil and material contaminated with bat
or bird droppings. Spores become airborne when contaminated soil is
disturbed. Breathing the spores causes infection. The disease is not
transmitted from an infected person to someone else. ... Most infected
persons have no apparent ill effects. The acute respiratory disease is
characterized by respiratory symptoms, a general ill feeling, fever, chest
pains, and a dry or nonproductive cough. If symptoms occur, they will start
within 3 to 17 days after exposure; the average is 10 days. The acute form
usually resolves without need for treatment. Chronic lung disease
resembles tuberculosis and can worsen over months or years. The
disseminated form is fatal unless treated [and tends to occur in
immunocompromised individuals]."
Signs of dissemination are infiltration of the liver, spleen, and bone
marrow (with decreased bone marrow function) and gastrointestinal mucosal
ulcers. It is not clear if the oral ulcerations described in this posting
relate to disseminated disease.
Histoplasmosis is one of the dimorphic fungi that can affect humans.
Dimorphic fungi exist in the mold form in the environment, and the mold's
spores can be transmitted by aerosol to humans with subsequent conversion
to a yeast form. The conversion can be demonstrated in the laboratory on
specific media by growing the mold at 37 degrees C. Other dimorphic fungal
diseases include coccioidomycoses, blastomycoses, paracocciodomycoses, and
disease due to _Penicillium marneffei_.
Histoplasma yeast forms are shown in tissue at:

macroconidia of the Histoplasma mold are shown at:

There are a number of reports of travelers returning from equatorial
Ecuador with histoplasmosis (1-5). Some were related to bat cave
exposures. It would be interesting to known what sort of research the
investigators in this cluster of cases were performing. Investigators
visiting this area returning to their home countries and their physicians
should be aware to the Italian cluster.
