The Goa Health Services have intensified fever surveillance and other precautionary measures in areas near North Goa's border, adjacent to Maharashtra's Sindhudurg district, following rise in deaths due to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) or monkey fever, particularly in Banda town of the district.

Dr Utkarsha Betkikar, an Epidermiologist with Goa Health Services, said 9 deaths have been reported in Sindhudurg as of now. On [Mon 3 Apr 2017] evening, he said some KFD cases from Banda, which is adjacent to Pernem (North Goa border), had been admitted at the State-owned Goa Medical College (GMC) Hospital in Bambolim for treatment.

He said the patients had to be admitted to the GMC as a tertiary care facility was not available to them, other than the State-owned Goa North District Hospital in Mapusa or the GMC.

For Goa, he said, all precautionary measures are in place. "Fever surveillance is on in villages near Goa's border adjacent to Banda. Tests are being conducted constantly and no [KFD] cases have been detected so far. Health authorities are also conducting tests at North Goa's Valpoi taluk." He added that the vaccination programme has been going on for quite some time.

Health service authorities said the State has not recorded any deaths due to KDF since last year [2016].

[The KFD virus (KFDV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ and family _Flaviviridae_. It was 1st recognized in 1957, when an illness occurred concomitantly in monkeys (_Semnopithecus entellus_ and _Macaca radiata_) and in humans (http://www.searo.who.int/publications/journals/seajph/seajphv3n1p8.pdf).

As per the media report above, the exact case numbers for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) are not mentioned. However, surveillance of fever cases is being carried out in some villages with no confirmed cases and some suspected patients have been admitted and are yet to be confirmed.

KFD typically occurs during the dry season, from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of nymphs of the ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection. In particular, herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are at increased risk of contracting the disease. In order to prevent KFD in the local population, it is necessary to create awareness in the community on protection from tick bites and ensure availability of KFD vaccination in the affected areas. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are key to prevent KFD. - Mod.UBA
