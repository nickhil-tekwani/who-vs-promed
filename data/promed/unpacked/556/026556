Rotvirus outbreak in Laurinburg
---------------------------
Urging everyone "not to worry," officials at the Scotland Memorial Hospital have reported an increase in cases of sporadic rotavirus [infection] over the past several weeks in the area. "We're seeing an increase in patients presenting with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea," said Dr. Douglas Nederostek, medical director of Scotland Memorial Hospital's Emergency Center.

"What we are seeing is not an infectious bacterial disease outbreak, but a virus infection. It seems the effects are far-reaching, with symptoms appearing in school age kids through middle-aged adults. Where the virus is hitting, it's hitting hard. However, while the symptoms may be uncomfortable, there is nothing to panic about. This is not the Norovirus."

Nederostek said that by mid-week at least 20 percent of the emergency center patients showed up with these symptoms. He said that "all but one" of the cases seen in the emergency center could have been treated by their primary care physician or at Scotland Urgent Care Center. Only one patient required admittance to the hospital.

Scotland Memorial Hospital Karen Gainey said the outbreak was "nothing to be alarmed about, but we did want to let the community know we have been seeing an increased number of cases in the past few weeks."

Nederostek urges anyone who develops symptoms of rotavirus infection to 1st contact their physician or visit the Urgent Care Center. Those patients who are unable to tolerate fluids of any kind or who develop a fever of 102 degrees or greater may consider a visit to the emergency center as they may need to receive IV fluids. Rotavirus [infection] can spread easily among infants and young children, so Nederostek urges family members to wash their hands frequently with soap and water to help stop the spread of germs.

[Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. Rotavirus disease causes severe watery diarrhea, often with vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. In babies and young children, it can lead to dehydration and rotavirus infection is the leading cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. Globally, it causes more than a half a million deaths each year in children younger than 5 years of age.

The outbreak in Laurinburg is atypical in that it is localised and that adults seem to be affected as well as children (although this is difficult to assess in the absence of case numbers). Rotavirus spreads easily among young children. Children can spread the virus both before and after they become sick with diarrhea. They can also pass rotavirus to family members and other people with whom they have close contact.

Effective vaccines are now available . A summarised account of the development of rotavirus vaccines and their deployment in practice can be accessed at the WHO web-site: http://www.who.int/nuvi/rotavirus/en/.
