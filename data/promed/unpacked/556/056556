[1] Cholera, probable - Dominican Republic (Bahoruco Province)

A diarrheal disease initially considered as amebiasis by healthcare workers in San Bartolome Hospital, but diagnosed as cholera by Dr Liz Perez, is currently affecting many persons in Galvan [Bahoruco Province], and more than 50 people have been admitted to the hospital since 25 Dec 2012.

Even though authorities in San Bartolome Hospital considered these cases were a simple outbreak of amebiasis, Dr Liz Perez, attending physician in the Oral Rehydration Unit of this hospital, declared that the gastrointestinal symptoms (watery diarrhea and moderate to severe dehydration) of all cases correspond to an infection caused by _Vibrio cholerae_, which presents as an intestinal infection.

Dr Perez pointed out that, on 24 and 25 Dec 2012, more than 25 cases of this disease were taken care of, and this weekend [29-30 Dec 2012], a similar number of persons are presenting to the hospital with the aforementioned symptoms, and since they have common features, the condition has been defined as 'clinical cholera'.

"Because of their clinical condition and a fall in blood pressure, severe dehydration, foul-smelling and rice-water stools, we think we are facing cholera cases," said Dr Perez, who insisted that authorities should warn citizens about this condition, specifically in Las Piedras, La Zabila, La Guama, and other communities in the high areas of Galvan municipality.

She pointed out that patients are admitted in a special area, where they receive parenteral and oral therapy, as well as some medications, and they are observed in the ward until they are discharged. Dr Perez urged persons living in Galvan municipality to chlorinate water for daily use, especially if they get it from brooks or small streams, in order to prevent the occurrence of more cases of this disease that already has affected more than 50 persons.

She also mentioned that this educational effort must be led and reinforced by the Ministry of Health, in order to prevent further spread of this disease, which although apparently no deaths have been reported (yet), is a very risky condition.

[2] Cholera - Cuba (Havana, eastern provinces)
Date: Wed 26 Dec 2012

A rise in cholera cases in the Cuban capital Havana is being traced back to parts of the country hardest hit by Hurricane Sandy [25 Oct 2012], the worst natural disaster to strike Cuba in half a century. The Cuban government is saying little about reported cases of cholera. But doctors who have recorded new cases of the disease during recent house-to-house inspections say the health ministry has declared a state of alert in the Jesus Maria and Belen communities of Old Havana (Habana Vieja) municipality, a popular tourist area in the city center.

"They've found 47 cases in Habana Vieja municipality," said a doctor, who requested anonymity. "33 of them originate from the eastern provinces." The implication is that the individuals carrying cholera may have contracted it in Cuba's eastern regions as a result of the flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012. Standing water is an ideal breeding ground for cholera, an intestinal disease transmitted by contaminated liquid and food, and many cases have been reported in provinces like Holguin, Santiago de Cuba, Las Tunas, and Guantanamo.

The authorities have taken steps to address the new cases in Havana by setting up specialized hospital wards, cleaning up streets, and buildings in the Jesus Maria and Belen communities, and distributing medicines that prevent dehydration. Health staff have been driving around Old Havana issuing notifications by loudspeaker, telling people what precautions to take, urging them not to try to cure themselves, and announcing training sessions where medical staff will be taught how to contain the "epidemic."

The authorities are also taking action to stop sales of food that fall short of health and hygiene standards, according to a health worker involved in the cholera identification and public information campaign in Habana Vieja municipality. All the same, the health worker said, he feared "rising numbers of cases." A local doctor said he suspects the government is holding off on officially announcing a cholera outbreak because it might deter tourists from visiting Havana's old town.

In 3 provinces -- Santiago de Cuba, Las Tunas, and Guantanamo -- residents say some municipalities have been placed under quarantine. "The public health ministry is here in Guantanamo because it placed the La Tinta community under quarantine 3 days ago, following a new outbreak of cholera," Juan Luis Bravo Rodriguez, a correspondent for the Hablemos Press Information Centre in Guantanamo City, said.

In eastern Cuba, the authorities are continuing to take steps to deal with cholera. In Holguin province, doctors at the Vladimir Lenin Hospital say they are admitting 3 to 5 new cases a day. The rising incidence is a cause for concern for Holguin residents, one of whom says that while the health authorities are acting to curb the spread of cholera, they are not providing enough information to the public.

He said the authorities have placed 2 of Holguin's municipalities, Mayari and Moa, under quarantine because of the number of cholera sufferers in need of medical help. They are also imposing large fines on black-market traders in seafood and vegetables, as substandard products can help the disease spread. One eyewitness spoke of police and security-service officers are guarding infectious disease wards at clinics and hospitals to prevent news of the scale of infection leaking out.

After visiting his wife at the Ernesto Guevara Hospital in Las Tunas, a man said, "The serious cases are taken to the observation ward in Guevara, where there are more than 20 cases. They post a police or security officer at the door to the ward so that no one can enter and leave with information."

[The cases in Havana have already been posted on ProMED but there certainly seems to be continued cholera activity in a number of the eastern provinces where the outbreak in Cuba originally began.

[3] Diarrhea, fatalities, indigenous population - Colombia (Risaralda)
Date: Mon 31 Dec 2012

More than 15 indigenous children in Risaralda died because of diarrhea and febrile disease. The Health Secretary mentioned that they have not acknowledged this situation affecting the Embera Chami ethnic group, which, together with malnutrition has also taken the lives of 8 adults.

Delfin Arce, a member of the Embera ethnic group and main officer of the Regional Indigenous Council of Risaralda, said -- after traveling along the Purembara area within Mistrato District -- that many people in the affected area are quite ill because of this fever and diarrheal disease.

Children are the most affected group, followed by adults among which 8 deaths have been reported. No support has been received yet from Risaralda healthcare facilities, whose jurisdiction includes the Mistrato District.

Mr Arce declared he was quite disconcerted by this occurrence, which, together with malnutrition, greatly affects the health of Embera Chami people living in this area of the country.

On the other hand, Lina Beatriz Rendon-Torres, Risaralda health secretary, who declared she had no information about the situation reported by Mr Arce, immediately ordered the implementation of a healthcare team to be sent to Purembara and its surrounding areas, in order to control this outbreak.

[The etiology of this outbreak among an indigenous people in west central Colombia is not clear. With fever, disease due to salmonellosis or shigellosis should be considered but the differential diagnosis is substantial.
