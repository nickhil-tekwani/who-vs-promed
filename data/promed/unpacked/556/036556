A suspected case of a deadly dog disease has been reported in the borough [Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, Greater Manchester, North West England].

Fears that Alabama rot may have returned to the area have been sparked following the death of a dog at the weekend [9-10 Apr 2016], which had suffered signs similar to that of the mystery disease.

It comes 2 years after several cases were confirmed in the Leigh and Tyldesley areas of the borough. Tyldesley Veterinary Centre has said they are waiting for test results to confirm the cause of death but have warned owners to be careful in the meantime.

In a statement, the centre said: "Some very sad news, our colleagues have informed us they have had a suspected case of Alabama rot this weekend.

"The animal in question was walked along the old lines parallel to Squires Lane (Tyldesley). At this time it is only suspected, as our colleagues await the results.

"Alabama rot (otherwise known as cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy or CRGV ) is a serious disease which has only recently been recognized in dogs in the UK."

The disease can cause lesions on the skin and occasionally in the mouth that may look like bites or sores. The disease can lead to dogs developing kidney failure.

"We recommend bathing any area of your dog which becomes wet or muddy on a walk, however at this stage we do not know if this is necessary or of any benefit," the centre said.

"Unexplained redness, sores, or swelling of the skin (particularly on the paws or legs but also the body, face, tongue, or mouth) are often the 1st sign of this disease.

"It is important to remember that most of the time a skin problem will not be caused by CRGV however, the lesions in CRGV can be difficult to distinguish from cuts, wounds, stings, or bites so if in doubt seek veterinary advice.

"Even if the skin changes are caused by CRGV, many dogs will not develop kidney problems and will recover fully."

This comment is borrowed from my colleague Mod.AS:
Similar cases in dogs from various locations in England, some of them referred to as the "New Forest disease," have been addressed by ProMED-mail in several postings since September 2011, referred to as "undiagnosed." In April 2015, a team of 9 authors, consisting of 6 British and 3 Americans, have published the results of their common investigations (Ref 1), leading them to believe that the disease is Alabama rot (cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy), a condition which has been seen in the USA in greyhounds for almost 30 years. While there have been occasional reports of the disease in individual dogs outside of the USA, this is the 1st report of a series of cases occurring in England. None of the 30 dogs in this English series of cases were greyhounds and evidence of the disease was found in 15 different breeds of dog.

The paper includes information on dogs that had presented at 53 English veterinary practices between 1 Nov 2012 and 31 Mar 2014 with skin lesions, acute kidney injury of no identifiable cause, and histopathology showing evidence of blood clots in the small vessels of the kidney (renal thrombotic microangiopathy). Cases were identified both from searches of the practice records and the memories of vets working at the practices.

A total of 71 possible cases occurred during the study period, but 41 were excluded due to limited investigations or because medical records were incomplete.

The 30 dogs that met all 3 criteria fell into a variety of breeds: English springer spaniel (5 dogs), crossbreed above 20 kg (4 dogs), flat coated retriever (4 dogs), whippet (3 dogs), border collie (2 dogs), Jack Russell terrier (2 dogs), Doberman (2 dogs), and one each of Labrador retriever, cocker spaniel, Staffordshire bull terrier, Hungarian vizsla, Weimaraner, Dalmatian, Tibetan terrier, and crossbreed below 20 kg (44 lb).

The dogs were located in multiple areas of northern and southern England (the biggest cluster in the New Forest National Park), visiting woodlands shortly (4 hours to 14 days) before developing skin lesions and/or becoming unwell.

Most of the dogs had been taken to the vet by their owners because of skin lesions. Some dogs were already unwell, but in others systemic clinical signs (tiredness, loss of appetite, vomiting and fever) generally developed a few days later. No evidence of _E. coli_ Shiga toxin, which can cause sudden onset kidney damage in humans as part of a disease called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), was found in the kidneys or faeces of affected dogs. 24 the 30 dogs died or were put to sleep because of the disease, and 6 were put to sleep at their owner's request.

Acute kidney injury in these dogs was caused by damage to the small blood vessels of the kidney (renal thrombotic microangiopathy). In their discussion the authors indicate that renal thrombotic microangiopathy is relatively rare; the pathology is also found in another rare disorder affecting dogs and humans -- haemolytic uraemic syndrome -- which results in acute kidney injury and anaemia, but which is not associated with skin lesions.

The authors say that it is unclear whether canine haemolytic uraemic syndrome and cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy [Alabama rot] are 2 distinct diseases. They conclude that continued detailed clinical, pathological, and epidemiological evaluation will improve understanding of the disease and help to identify possible triggers and the best management options. Currently it is unclear whether this is an emerging disease or one that was previously present but unrecognised. The etiology remains to be unravelled.
