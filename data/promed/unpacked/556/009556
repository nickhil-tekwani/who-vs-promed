The diagnosis of yellow fever has been confirmed by the Oswaldo Cruz
Institute in Rio de Janeiro in 3 of the 9 fatal cases & in 2 patients under
treatment. The cases come from the central-west part of Minas Gerais State,
in the region of the Valley of the Rio Para.
The first suspect case occurred on 23 Jan 2001, but was not recognized until
a second case died 4 days later in the same area with the same symptoms of
acute fever, yellow skin & eyes.
Approximately 1 million people live in the general area of the outbreak,
but 74%
have been vaccinated in previous campaigns.

[Since the major cities of Brazil are infested with _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes, there is a serious threat of urbanization of the disease. The
International Health Regulations require that even an unconfirmed, suspect
case of yellow fever be reported to WHO Geneva within 24 hours. This
outbreak could have been announced on 27 Jan 2001. Valuable vaccinating
time has been lost, but vaccine is now being supplied to the area. - Mod.JW
