From 2 deaths every 3 minutes to having the highest tuberculosis burden in the world, most surveys related to TB in India throw a startling number. And here is one more: close to 9 percent of all paediatric tuberculosis patients are resistant to rifampicin, one of the 1st-line drugs used in the treatment of the infectious disease. This is 6 percent more than what was previously estimated, a study covering 4 metros in the country has found.

The project, initiated last year [2014] by the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP), found that 8 percent of the 22 000 suspected paediatric TB cases (0-14 years) tested positive, of which nearly 9 percent were resistant to rifampicin. The study covered 4 cities -- Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Delhi.

"Our survey showed a staggering 9 percent, which is quite high. It's surprising because many of them haven't been exposed to antibiotics before, which means they are acquiring the infection in the MDR [multidrug-resistant] form at the time of transmission," he said.

Among the 4 metros, TB incidence was highest among children in Delhi at 12.2 percent and the least in Chennai at 5.4 percent. Rifampicin resistance was seen most in Kolkata at 12 percent. Chennai had the least number of cases at 2.9 percent.

Diagnosis of TB in children is complicated, as the [disease caused by the bacterium] _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ can mimic many other common childhood diseases, including pneumonia, general bacterial and viral infections, and respiratory infections. "Children also find it hard to cough up the sputum for the samples. They tend to swallow instead," said Dr K Sachdeva, Additional Deputy Director General, Central TB division. "So accuracy in the traditional tests is often ambiguous," he said.

The study was initiated to test the efficiency of a WHO-endorsed automated real-time DNA amplification technology that identifies the DNA of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Clinicians say the technology has helped diagnose TB in infants and children, in particular, as they face difficulty expectorating the sputum needed for analysis. It was done free of cost through samples sent from different hospitals in the four metros, both private and government.

"While the traditional smear test requires at least 10 000 bacilli in one ml of sputum to be detected under the microscope, in the present test even 50 bacilli can be detected," said Dr Shah. Although the test costs more than the smear test, experts say this is only need-based and doesn't have to be used for all TB patients.

The tests found that between the 0-14 years age group, resistance to rifampicin was highest for children between 5-9 years, followed by 10-14 years and less than 5 years.

Doctors said the study was just the tip of the real tuberculosis scene in India. "Definite diagnosis in children with the infection is hard and takes a long time. We need more in-depth surveys to assess the real burden of the infection among children," said TB specialist Dr Manjula Datta. Experts say rapid diagnosis of TB, followed by the correct treatment, is critical in stopping progression in the individual and spread to others.

[Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) plus rifampin, the 2 most potent 1st-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Rifampin resistance is used as a surrogate marker for MDR-TB, because 95 percent of the strains resistant to rifampin are also resistant to INH. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a form of TB resistant to INH and rifampin, as well as resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of the 3 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

Drug-resistant TB requires more extensive chemotherapy, involves drug therapy over more extended periods of time, is more often unsuccessful, is more expensive, and is more often fatal than drug-susceptible TB.

Inadequate or improper use of the anti-TB medications favor the emergence of drug resistant organisms. Drug-resistant TB is also more common in people who develop TB disease again after having been treated for TB disease in the past, or come from areas of the world such as India where drug-resistant TB is common. The source for drug-resistant tuberculosis in children is most frequently a family member with contagious drug-resistant TB. Pulmonary TB in young children is considered to have a low bacillary load, and children do not ordinarily generate the forceful cough required to be contagious. Control of MDR-TB in children will thus require control of drug-resistant TB in adults in India.

The diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB is even more difficult in children than in adults, especially because children do not readily expectorate a sample from the lungs for microbial analysis. This makes the initial diagnosis and monitoring microbial response to therapy difficult. The recommended treatment regimen is the combination of at least 4 drugs to which the organism is susceptible. Children need to be closely monitored for the development of adverse reactions to these multiple drugs. Testing for some adverse drug reactions such as ototoxicity and visual toxicity is problematic in children. Drug dosing, which must be tailored to the physiologic and metabolic needs of children, is a problem in children as these drugs are not available in pediatric formulations. All these problems were nicely delineated in a prior ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis, XDR - USA (02): (MD) ex India, child, remission 20151117.3797741. - Mod.ML
