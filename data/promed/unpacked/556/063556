A similar pathology as the one which affected camels in the horn of Africa
in 1995 and 1996 has affected, during the last semester of 1997, young
camels in the Afarland and the Somali region in Ethiopia. In 1996, we found
morbilliviruses, peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRv) strains, and
_Streptococcus_ sp. infections: PPR antigen detection by immunocapture and
positive PCR for 2 different PPRv strains; PPR seroconversion (C-ELISA
test) between 3 groups: before during and after the outbreak;
_Streptococcus equi_ subsp. _equi_ was also isolated (apparently the first
isolation of this bacterium in the camel; in Vet. Record, 1997, 140) but we
assume that the etiologic factor is a virus.
We are preparing an experimental reproduction of PPRv on camels, as well as
in sheep and goats, with strains belonging of two genetic groups existing
in Ethiopia. I am looking for information about similar epizootic
respiratory diseases in camels, in Africa as well in Asia.
According to the ProMED-mail messages on the circulating epizootic of RVF,
it seems that other diseases are spreading among the livestock. Reports,
especially on camels, are not in accordance with RVF symptoms (notably
Hemorrhagic disease - Kenya (15) [cited above. We can remark that clinical
bluetongue has been suspected on camels in the past in Chad. Is a
rinderpest-like-disease suspected?
