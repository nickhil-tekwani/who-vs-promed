[1] USA (Alaska): cruise ship travel alert
Date: Tue 14 Aug 2018

A teenager visiting Alaska on a cruise ship last week [week of 6 Aug 2018] had the measles, health officials say, prompting concern that passengers may spread the rarely-seen disease further.

A group of passengers who may have contacted the patient disembarked in Seward, [Alaska], from the Norwegian Jewel on [Mon 13 Aug 2018]. On [Tue 14 Aug 2018], the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services warned healthcare providers to look out for measles symptoms like rashes, runny noses, fevers, and red eyes from passengers who may have contracted the disease.

Health officials called the risk of secondary cases low. The patient was at the tail end of infectiousness when she boarded, officials said, and was placed in medical isolation shortly after boarding the ship in Vancouver, British Columbia, on [Mon 6 Aug 2018].

"The reason why we notify healthcare providers in a situation like this, even though it's a low risk, is that measles is so highly contagious," state epidemiologist Dr. Joe McLaughlin told the Empire in a [Tue 14 Aug 2018] phone interview. "It spreads through the air in respiratory secretions: coughs, sneezes."

The ship docked in Ketchikan, Juneau, Skagway, and Glacier Bay before the cruise ended in Seward.

Several days prior to the cruise, the patient reported waking up with a rash, fever, and cold-like symptoms after a trip to Thailand, according to DHSS. The patient's parents, traveling with her, reported that she had never received the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

On [Wed 8 Aug 2018], the patient, a 16-year-old non-U.S. citizen whose name is being withheld, was transferred to PeaceHealth Ketchikan Medical Center for care. Doctors diagnosed her with measles on [Fri 10 Aug 2018], several hours after her discharge from the hospital. At that point, she was no longer considered contagious.

Though the disease is highly contagious, the risk of passing it on is very low after 4 days after the onset of a rash, according to DHSS. Health officials believe the patient boarded the ship the 4th day after rash symptoms began, giving them reason to believe she wasn't highly contagious while in contact with anyone who may still be in Alaska.

The disease has a 7-21-day incubation period. The 1st day a passenger may show symptoms would have been [Mon 13 Aug 2017], 7 days after encountering the measles patient. Anyone who contracted the virus is expected to show symptoms before 27 Aug 2018.

Thanks to vaccines, measles were declared eliminated from the USA in 2000, McLaughlin said. It's rare now to see a case that doesn't originate from outside of the country.

The last 2 recorded cases of measles in Alaska both occurred in middle-aged people, McLaughlin said, who may not have been vaccinated for measles (MMR vaccines weren't required until 1957). In 2000, a middle-aged Anchorage resident contracted a case. In 2015, a middle-aged Fairbanks resident was diagnosed after a trip to Mongolia

Alaska's MMR vaccination rates for measles are below the national average. The CDC recommends routine vaccination with a 2-dose series of MMR: the 1st at 12-15 months and the 2nd at 4-6 years.

According to the latest numbers, from 2016, 86 percent of Alaska children age 19-35 months had received one or more doses of the MMR vaccine. The national average is 91 percent. Alaska requires 2 doses of the vaccine for school entry at kindergarten, though there are religious and medical exemptions. In 2016, 89 percent of Alaska kindergartners had received 2 MMR doses. The national average is 94 percent.

Earlier this year, Alaska suffered an outbreak of mumps, another illness the MMR vaccine has been showed to prevent.

McLaughlin stressed that measles, though considered eliminated in the USA, can be very dangerous. Out of 1000 people who contract the virus, 2-3 will die from it. A higher rate will experience life-changing complications.

Officials say 2 more cases of measles have been diagnosed in a Florida county where an unvaccinated child came down with the illness earlier this week [week of 13 Aug 2018].

The Florida Department of Health said [on Wed 15 Aug 2018] that the 2 individuals live in the same household and weren't immunized. The 1st individual lives in a separate household.

The new cases bring the number of individuals with measles to 3 in Pinellas County, along Florida's Gulf Coast.

Laboratory testing confirmed a case of measles in an individual who traveled for a week throughout the Portland, [Oregon], metro area on Sat [11 Aug 2018]. Oregon Health Authority is working with local public-health agencies to notify individuals of their potential exposure and to inform them of steps to take should they become ill.

"The bad news is that measles is a serious disease; the good news is that if you've been vaccinated, you're well protected,'' Paul Cieslak, MD, medical director for Communicable Diseases for the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division said. "This is the 2nd time this summer that someone arrived in the Portland area sick with measles."

At this point, no additional cases of measles have been identified, OHA said.

Officials confirmed the case on [Fri 10 Aug 2017] in a person who was infectious and spent time in the Portland metro area from 30 Jul to 6 Aug [2018].

Public-health officials said they are working directly with area businesses where the sick individual spent time.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 107 people from 21 states, including Florida, have reported contracting measles between 1 Jan to 14 Jul 2018.

In the state of Florida, 7 people have reportedly contracted measles, 3 of which are in Pinellas County, according to the Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County.

"We continue to encourage parents to fully vaccinate their children," said DOH-Pinellas director Dr. Ulyee Choe, an infectious-disease specialist. "Measles is a highly contagious disease that can have serious complications for babies and children."

Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to measles may be excluded for up to 21 days from public places such as school and work where they could infect others.

According to the CDC, states with measles include Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and District of Colombia.

There's a possibility you may have been exposed to measles if you took a flight in or out of Vancouver in late July or early August [2018].

Someone with the infection flew in from Tokyo, made a trip to Portland, and took a cruise from Vancouver to Alaska.

Travellers are being alerted to one case of measles at Vancouver International Airport on [Mon 30 Jul 2018] and [Mon 6 Aug 2018].
