Nepal (Dhading, Province 3)
Date: 28 May 2017
From: Anup Bastola <docanup11@gmail.com> [edited]

A 25 years old male from Kalleri-2 Dading (Province 3) was admitted with fever, arthalgia, myalgia and retro-orbital pain on [26 May 2017] in Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (Province 3). His laboratory tests revealed thrmbocytopenia with normal white blood cells counts. Serology for dengue NS1 was positive. Serological tests for leptospira and brucella were negative with no growth in blood culture. He has a past history of having traveled to Bhaisepati, Kathmandu (province 3) on and off.

Dengue is not common in Dhading (province 3) and detection of dengue in this raining season is quite unusual. Vector control is one of the major steps in prevention of a dengue outbreak. Responsible organization should carry out the field investigation and search and destroy method to prevent people from getting sick from dengue.

This year [2017] too, out of the 2203 cases reported in the State so far (till 28 Apr 2017), Thiruvananthapuram has chalked up 1486 cases. Public health experts also point out that the urban environment and climatic conditions in Thiruvananthapuram cannot be any different from that in other districts like Ernakulam or Kozhikode. In fact, one would expect that the case load from plantation districts would be more because mosquito control in the wild is a tough proposition. "The high case load in the district is because of the robust fever surveillance and reporting systems and the excellent diagnostic facilities in place here. It is nothing but gross under-reporting that shows the other districts as showing a lesser case load," a senior official says...

Bangladesh
- Dhaka. 22 Apr 2017. The capital is yet again experiencing an early outbreak of dengue and untimely rains may be to blame. Like last year [2016], _Aedes_ mosquitoes, transmitter of the dengue virus, have bred early this year [2017] alarming authorities and city dwellers and health officials say there are chances their number would be larger. This year [2017], there have been frequent rains during January and April before the start of monsoon. This outbreak comes after a record number of dengue cases last year [2016] and an outbreak of chikungunya last winter. Chikungunya is spread by the same mosquito. At least 126 people were infected with dengue between 1 Jan and 19 Apr 2017, a number highest since 2000 for the same period, shows data from the health directorate.

In Bangladesh, most of the dengue cases are reported during June and October as intermittent rains and high temperature and humidity during the months create the ideal breeding conditions for Aedes. However, the authorities last year [2016] saw a new trend of early dengue infection. During January and April 2016, at least 71 dengue cases were reported in the capital. At least 14 of them died. The total number of dengue cases that year was 6020, the highest since 2002.

- La Réunion Island, Indian Ocean. 2 May 2017. 15 cases were reported including 6 in Saint-Paul Dengue is in circulation on the island. The district of Bois Rouge in Saint-Paul is considered an active center of circulation of the virus: 5 patients have been identified in this sector. The other situations are on the side of Saint-Leu, Saint-Louis and Sainte-Marie. Since the beginning of the year [2017], 10 indigenous dengue cases have been identified confirming the establishment of a circulation of the virus on the territory. In order to limit the spread of the virus, the services of the Indian Ocean Health Agency (ARS OI) have put in place reinforced surveillance and vector control measures. In this season, weather conditions are still favorable to the development of mosquitoes, the Agency reminds the population of the necessary preventive measures.

Epidemiological situation
-------------------------
Since the beginning of the year 2017, 15 cases of dengue have been reported in Reunion: 5 imported cases (returning from travel) and 10 indigenous cases (contracted in Reunion). The surveys carried out by the ARS OI identified 4distinct contamination situations, 3 of which could be related to an imported travel case. The 1st 3 situations identified in the communes of Saint-Leu, Saint-Louis and Sainte-Marie concerned only a few sporadic cases and seem to be at this stage contained. The 4th situation, located in the Bois Rouge district of Saint-Paul, is now considered an active focus of virus circulation with 6 identified cases.

The number of cases of dengue remains limited for the moment and the circulation of the virus seems moderate. It may, however, intensify at a time when meteorological conditions are still favorable to the development of mosquito vectors. In addition, ARS OI has decided to activate level 2A of the ORSEC dengue control device: "Identification of an indigenous moderate viral circulation - appearance of one or more clusters of cases or sporadic cases."

This update details progress of the operation from start, 26 Jan 2017 to 4 April 2017, and extends the operation by approximately 6 weeks (from 26 April 2017 until 31 May 2017) to allow monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and lessons learnt activities to be finalized without haste, also considering that the Cat 2 Tropical Cyclone Cook passed over Vanuatu on 9 Apr 2017, even if impacts are considered minor. As expected however, the Vanuatu Red Cross Society (VRCS) staff and volunteers have been involved in assessments and an elevated risk of increased incidence of vector borne disease due to the amount of rainfall and flooding exists in some areas...

- Fiji. 27 Apr 2017. Fiji has recorded 913 laboratory confirmed positive cases of dengue fever from 1 Jan to 2 Apr 2017 with the bulk of the cases coming from the Central Division. According to the Health and Medical Services Ministry, there was an average of 6 hospital admissions weekly with an average length of stay of 4 days being reported from the Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva. The ministry also recorded 1 dengue fever-related death at the CWM Hospital Intensive Care Unit this month. The dengue fever cases were high between the age group of 10 to 29 years with more males contracting the fever, the ministry said. The ministry's overview of dengue fever cases noted that the trend from 1 Jan to 4 Apr 2017 implied a continued increase in the incidence rate despite the best efforts to control the situation. The ministry said interventions such as subdivisional clean-up programs, perifocal spraying and awareness activities were carried out.

- New Caledonia. 18 Apr 2017. Dengue fever kills seven in New Caledonia. Some 2400 dengue cases have already been reported and the peak has not been reached. A 57-year-old woman died after contracting dengue fever in New Caledonia. She is the 7th victim of the disease since the epidemic began in January [2017], the government said on Tue 18 Apr 2017.The patient was hospitalized on 12 Apr 2017 and died 3 days later after "complications of dengue" and "previous pathologies" which have weakened her, said the executive. Since the beginning of January [2017], 7 people, several of whom had no medical history, succumbed to this viral disease, transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes Aegypti_. A week after cyclone Cook, the authorities renew their call to vigilance and the fight against the breeding sites, which multiplied due to the torrential rains. The current epidemic has so far caused 2400 reported cases of dengue, according to the New Caledonia Department of Health and Social Affairs. [In French trans. Corr.SB]

- National. 7 May 2017. Mombasa County health officials have issued an alert over an outbreak of potentially fatal Dengue Fever after 150 cases were diagnosed with the mosquito-borne tropical disease in several health centers across the county. The County Healthy Chief Officer Dr Khadija Shikely said the disease has spread and affected all the 6 sub counties with 119 cases confirmed in major private hospitals by Sun 7 May 2017. Health officials in the county have now enhanced health surveillance and precautionary measures against the disease. Dengue Fever is more prevalent in areas that are crowded and unhygienic. Heavy rains in the region are said to have created new breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which are the vectors transmitting the disease to humans. "A total of 119 cases were confirmed by Rapid Diagnostic Test Kits in the major private hospitals, Aga Khan, Mombasa Hospital, Al Farouk, Jocham and Seyyid Fatima," she said. She said that in total, 150 people have been taken ill with Kisauni reported to have the highest cases at 37 followed by Mvita which has reported 25 patients. Hospitals in Changamwe had by Fri 28 Apr 2017 also confirmed 21 cases and a similar number in Likoni. The disease was 1st detected in Mombasa in 2013 by medical research experts from the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) in Kilifi.

Doctors are failing to pick up warning signs for a severe form of dengue fever and in 1 in 5 cases are prescribing medicine that would make the patient's condition worse, new research has found. The Australian study of 208 patients hospitalised between January 2012 and May 2015 found doctors were struggling to recognise symptoms associated with severe dengue, which in extreme cases could be deadly. In more than 20 percent of cases patients were prescribed the common painkiller ibuprofen, exposing them to unnecessary risk of haemorrhage. Cairns couple Mena and Ron Crew contracted dengue fever simultaneously and warn of the dangers of the mosquito-borne disease during the wet season in the far north.

Queensland Health data available online shows there have been 129 cases of dengue diagnosed in the state so far this year [2017] and 447 cases confirmed last year [2016]. Local outbreaks were identified in Cairns, Innisfail, Townsville, Masig (Yorke) Island, and Boigu Island during the 1st 3 months of the year [2017], but the number of cases reported was dwarfed by those brought back from overseas.

Monash Health infectious diseases physician Alex Tai said far north Queensland doctors were generally more familiar with dengue that those in the rest of the country. The study, published in the Medical Journal of Australia today [9 Apr 2017], found Australian travellers most often acquired dengue in Indonesia and Thailand.

[3] Vaccine
Philippines
Date: 16 Apr 2017

http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/finally-a-vaccine-for-dengue/


Dengue is a serious public-health concern in the Philippines. It can affect anyone, no matter what the age or social status. It is an illness caused by a mosquito bite. Dengue is normally not fatal, but it could be. In the last 5 decades, dengue has spread from a handful of countries to over 128. The incidence has increased 30-fold in this period.

This has been blamed on factors such as unprecedented urbanization and globalization, which has resulted in large mosquito populations living in places with big human populations. This has led to an increased transmission and geographic spread of the virus. Other factors, such as inadequate housing, water, sewage and waste-management systems, have contributed to an increase in the populations of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which is responsible for dengue.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 3.2 million cases were reported in 2015 across the Americas, Southeast Asia and Western Pacific. In 2015 the Philippines reported over 169 000. This represented a 59.5 percent increase from the previous year [2014]. Last year [2016] over 200 000 cases were reported in the country. The Philippines was 7th in the world and 4th overall in Asia Pacific for incidence of dengue from 2004 to 2010.

Dengue is scary. There are 4 strains of the virus. My cousin has been infected with 3 of those strains. A doctor has warned that a 4 infection could be fatal.

Now for some good news: Health and beauty chain Watsons has announced the availability of dengue vaccination (Dengvaxia) in select stores nationwide. The dengue vaccination was launched in the country by the Department of Health (DOH), together with the Department of Education (DepEd). It was later made available in medical clinics last year [2016]. Watsons is the 1st retailer to offer it in the Philippine market. "As part of our commitment to improving the lives and health of Filipinos by making health care more accessible to them, we decided to offer dengue vaccination in our select stores nationwide. Dengue is a recurring epidemic in the country, and that's why we recognize the importance of protecting Filipinos against this deadly disease through the vaccination," said Danilo Chiong, Watsons Trading Health director.

Dengvaxia was created by Sanofi Pasteur, a leading multinational pharmaceutical company and an expert in the development of vaccinations. It took more than 20 years to develop and has been thoroughly tested based on WHO guidelines. Studies of the vaccine included more than 41 000 people and were carried out in 15 countries, including the Philippines. The results were fully reviewed by a committee of independent experts, and the vaccine has also been recommended by the WHO.

In the Philippines the DOH, together with the DepEd, launched the much-awaited administration of the dengue vaccine via a school-based immunization approach. The dengue vaccine has also gotten the endorsement of the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and the Philippine College of Physicians.

According to a study by the University of the Philippines National Institute of Health, the vaccine is expected to reduce dengue cases in the country by over 24 percent in a span of 5 years. The dengue vaccination, to be taken in 3 doses at 0-6-12 months interval, can protect the individual from all 4 strains of the dengue virus. This can be administered to people age 9 to 45. It will cost P 4000 [USD 80] per dose, or P 12 000 [USD 240] for all 3 doses.

The first scheduled dengue vaccination will be on 30 Apr 2018 (1st dose), 29 Oct 2018 (2nd dose) and 29 Apr 2018 (3rd dose); while the 2nd scheduled dengue vacation will be on 14 May 2018 (1st dose), 12 Nov 2018 (2nd dose), 13 May 2018 (3rd dose). This will be available in more than 100 stores nationwide.

Malaysians should not be too worried about getting severe dengue symptoms from the use of the dengue vaccine because it is not allowed for use by a susceptible age group here, the Malaysian Paediatric Association (MPA) said. Committee member Datuk Dr Zulkifli Ismail said the vaccine, the 1st introduced in the world by Sanofi Pasteur, was only allowed for individuals aged 9 to 45 and not in younger children, who could develop such symptoms after vaccination.

He said the phenomenon described by dengue expert Dr Scott Halstead many years ago in patients who had secondary dengue infection was not seen in those who had received the vaccine. Dr Halstead, who 1st identified the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon, said infection with 1 of the 4 strains of the virus allows a 2nd dengue infection to cause severe illness, including dengue haemorrhagic fever. His ADE theory holds that the longer the interval between infection with different dengue strains, the more severe the disease.

ADE was observed following a study on mice and later in Cuba when a less serious outbreak of the type 1 dengue virus was followed by a more severe wave of type 2 dengue cases 1 to 2 decades later. A similar phenomenon was seen in babies born to mothers infected with the dengue virus. It significantly increases the likelihood of the children contracting a severe case of the disease.

Dr Zulkifli, who is also the Asia Pacific Paediatric Association secretary-general, was commenting on a recent statement by Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah that one of the possible adverse effects of dengue vaccination was that people could develop severe dengue or get dengue shock syndrome.

The National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency had announced on its website recently that the vaccine was approved for a post-registration (phase 4) study in Malaysia by the Drug Control Authority for two years and may be used in those aged 9 to 45.

Using Sanofi Pasteur's data from phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccine, Dr Halstead and fellow researcher Dr Philip K. Russell showed that - during year 3 of the trial - the dengue hospitalisation rate was higher among children aged 5 or younger who received the vaccine than in the control groups that did not. The trials involved more than 35 000 children in 10 dengue-endemic countries. The data showed that 54.2 percent of the children were seronegative, which means their blood tested negative for the virus, upon enrolment in the trials.

Dr Halstead and Dr Russell published their findings in the journal Vaccine in February last year [2016]. Dr Russell had said the company did not directly address the ADE phenomenon nor provided a good explanation for the high risk of hospitalisation among seronegative children. While the company maintained that it only vaccinated children over age 9, Dr Russell said age was "only a surrogate here for being dengue naive (not exposed to dengue previously). They need to directly address ADE in phase 4 studies."

Dr Zulkifli argued that there may be many other reasons for the presumably dengue-naive children getting severe dengue as children are not, and should never be, regarded as "little adults" physiologically. He said the only way to have proper results on the vaccine's effectiveness on the ground is for it to be used in line with what was approved by the regulatory authorities, and with proper monitoring.

Our patient with DENV-4 infection developed new acute neurological symptoms of confusion and expressive aphasia at day 6 of her acute dengue illness. CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with a positive CSF dengue IgM and IgG. Testing for other pathogens in CSF was negative. She had not travelled to areas endemic for other flaviviruses. Although DENV-4 has been reported to potentially cause encephalitis, those cases were fatal, with multiorgan involvement and dengue haemorrhagic fever [6,7] By contrast, our patient had no other features of severe dengue, such as severe plasma leakage, bleeding, or other organ impairment. This is the first known case of DENV-4 encephalitis with complete recovery.

Optimum Temperature for Mosquitoes
Date: 4 May 2017
Source: CCTV News, a Xinhua report [edited]
http://english.cctv.com/2017/05/05/ARTIeLzDanxIExbQUIeGIVOQ170505.shtml


A group of researchers at Stanford University have found that 29 deg C [84 deg F], is the best temperature for mosquito to spread disease. According to a report of PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, when temperatures were cooler or warmer, the traits for mosquito to spread diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika, were lower. Temperature controls several factors that underlie the time it takes for a virus to be transmittable to humans, including how long it takes for a mosquito to ingest a virus during one feeding and then be ready to inject it in a later feeding; the length of the mosquito's life cycle; and how often mosquitoes bite.

"All these traits rely on temperature, but they tend to be nonlinear," study lead author Erin Mordecai, an assistant professor of biology, was quoted as saying in a news release. "They increase to a point and then drop off."

Before this study, there was a wide range of temperature predictions from other researchers, Mordecai said. And knowing the optimal temperature for disease transmission is critical for predicting future disease rates. "Dengue epidemics have been on the rise in the past couple decades so there's been a growing effort trying to understand why we're seeing more dengue, and what the relationship is between dengue transmission and climate," she explained.

The information can help predict how and where disease might spread with climate change, especially in countries that have lower socioeconomic levels, according to Mordecai, as "concentrated urban poverty is really where you see a lot of vector-borne disease transmission." With the new model, researchers are expected to better predict when and where transmission of the next Zika might happen, and allow enough time to prepare for the event.

Abstract
A high number of dengue cases are reported annually in Bali. Despite the endemicity, limited data on dengue is available for Bali localities. Molecular surveillance study was conducted to explore the clinical and virological characteristics of dengue patients in urban Denpasar and rural Gianyar areas in Bali during the peak season in 2015. A total of 203 adult dengue-suspected patients were recruited in a prospective cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical information were obtained, and dengue screening was performed using NS1 and IgM/IgG ELISAs. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from patients' sera for serotyping using conventional RT-PCR and Simplexa Dengue real-time RT-PCR, followed by genotyping with sequencing method. We confirmed 161 patients as having dengue by NS1 and RT-PCR. Among 154 samples successfully serotyped, the DENV-3 was predominant, followed by DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4. Serotype predominance was different between Denpasar and Gianyar. Genotyping results classify DENV-1 isolates into Genotype I and DENV-2 as Cosmopolitan Genotype. The classification grouped isolates into Genotype I and II for DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. Clinical parameters showed no relationship between infecting serotypes and severity. We observed the genetic diversity of circulating DENV isolates and their relatedness with historical data and importation to other countries. Our data highlights the role of this tourist destination as a potential source of dengue transmission in the region.
