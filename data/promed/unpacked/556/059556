The World Health Organization [WHO] recently announced that tuberculosis [TB] cases found in Moldova, Belarus, and Russia display the highest levels of drug-resistance known.

The WHO, however, said that its data remain somewhat incomplete. Africa and India are thought to have higher TB rates, but were not included in their entirety in a newly released study. Experts said that rates of multi drug-resistant TB remain unknown or are unclear in many parts of the world, according to USA Today.

Research published in Bulletin, the WHO's medical journal, reported that in some places in Russia, 29 percent of new TB cases are drug resistant. Rates of MDR-TB [multidrug resistant tuberculosis] in Minsk, Belarus, are thought to be approaching 50 percent of cases, but the WHO warned that reliable surveillance data is lacking, a situation it called "highly worrisome," USA Today reports. The TB situation in Moldova is becoming increasingly more troubling. WHO research found 65 percent of previously untreated TB patients are infected with strains that are resistant.

The WHO's Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance was launched in 1994 and has generated what the WHO considers to be the most reliable TB drug-resistance estimates available for 127 countries.

Experts agree that continued surveillance will be critical in fighting MDR-TB, especially as the growing reservoir of resistant cases start to pose a challenge to national TB programs.

[This news report refers to an article published in the February 2012 edition of the WHO Bulletin (Zignol M, van Gemert W, Falzon D, et al: Surveillance of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in the world: an updated analysis, 2007-2010. Bull World Health Organ 2012; 90: 111-9D. Available at http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/2/11-092585.pdf) and an accompanying editorial (Matteelli A, Centis R, D'Ambrosio L, Migliori GB: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis today. Bull World Health Organ 2012; 90: 78. Available at http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/2/11-097360.pdf).

The study found that TB drug resistance data are available for 2 thirds of all countries in the world. Cases of MDR-TB (that is, tuberculosis that is caused by a strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ that is at least resistant to 2 of the most effective drugs used to treat TB, isoniazid (INH) and rifampin) have been reported in 80 countries, in some instances in almost 30 percent of all newly diagnosed cases and some countries reporting MDR-TB in more than 65 percent of patients who have been previously treated for TB. High rates of drug resistance were reported in Belarus, Estonia, the Russian Federation, and Tajikistan. However, national representative data are lacking in many large countries with high TB burden, including India and several African countries. Routine drug susceptibility testing of all confirmed TB cases should be the goal, but there are very few laboratories to diagnose MDR-TB in developing countries, and only 34 countries and settings have a system in place to routinely test all patients with MDR-TB for 2nd-line anti-TB drug resistance. - Mod.ML]
