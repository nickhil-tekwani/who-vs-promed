In Durango, this Mon 21 Nov 2022, the 9th death due to aseptic meningitis caused by a fungus was recorded. [The number of] confirmed cases [remains] 59 in total. Gabriel García Rodríguez, general director of epidemiology of the Ministry of Health at the national level, reported that the agent that causes fungal meningitis is very aggressive and dangerous. Therefore, it was decided to address the situation to investigate both diagnosis and treatment.

He explained that there is a follow-up with experts not only Mexican but at an international level, in addition to permanent surveillance by medical personnel. "We have already had tables of experts, panels of experts, with national experts, including international ones, who have given us their opinion, first, on the protocolization of treatment and on the possible outcome. The treatment is being as effective as possible. It is appropriate to the possible pathogen that we have identified. It is being approved by national institutes and highly specialized hospitals. In addition, it is being held because it is a disease that we do not know much about; It is a serious disease for these patients so that human capacity is completely overturned."

[He] held that the work will be carried out with fluidity in the information, to give a solution to this outbreak of meningitis due to fungus which is already treated in 58 patients. For her part, Irasema Kondo, secretary of health in Durango, announced that this week an in-depth evaluation is expected of the progress that the antifungal treatment given to infected patients has had.

A total of 8 women have died from aseptic meningitis in the Mexican city of Durango, located in the state of the same name in the north east of the country, while 57 other cases have been reported, as a result of a fungus present in a local anesthetic, bupivacaine.

The latest victim was a 28 year old woman who was treated for the first time in August [2022] and her increasing discomfort required specialized medical attention, although in the end her life could not be saved, according to the newspaper 'Milenio'.

Aseptic meningitis inflames the tissues of the brain and spinal cord and is usually caused by a viral infection, however, on this occasion the origin is a fungus, according to the Durango Health Secretariat (SSD). Patients often present with symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and neck stiffness.

According to the same media report, 4 hospitals are already under the custody of the Durango State Attorney General's Office. In addition, medicines have been seized and interventions involving the application of local anesthesia in private hospitals in the state have been suspended, according to 'El Financiero', since several of the victims had been operated on in these centers.

[Durango City (population 654 876 in 2015) is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Durango, located in north western Mexico (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango_City).

The latest news report above says that there are now a total of 59 patients, including 9 deaths, of fungal meningitis at several different hospitals in Durango City in the Durango State of Mexico, as a postoperative complication. From details in prior ProMED posts, most of the affected patients are women who underwent some type(s) of surgeries that involved epidural anesthesia. We are now told in the news reports above that the cause of the meningitis is a "fungus" that contaminated the anesthetic bupivacaine, but we are not told specifically which fungus is the cause.

An epidural injection is delivery of a drug between the dura mater and the vertebral wall. Epidurals can be used during labor and childbirth, during and after some types of surgery, and to treat pain due to sciatica or a slipped disc. Fungal contamination of a drug administered epidurally caused the large, multistate invasive fungal infection outbreak associated with contaminated methylprednisolone injections in late 2012 and 2013 in the US (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669562/) and another fungal meningitis outbreak in 2002 (ProMED post Fungal meningitis, contaminated drug - USA (03) 20021212.6046).

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
