LIONS, FATAL ILLNESS - EAST AFRICA (3)
======================================
I just received this feedback from Craig Packer, Professor, Dept. of
Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the University of Minnesota:
"The Brazilian report is completely inaccurate. There was only one
outbreak. It occurred in 1994 and killed 1000 lions. No further deaths
have occurred from canine distemper since late 1994. The chain of infection
in the 1984 was from domestic dogs, not wild African hunting dogs.
I am the head of the long-term lion study, so I am in the best
position to comment on the current state of the Serengeti lions.
The Brazilian report sounds like a very poor translation of the news
releases that reported on our Nature paper which appeared 1 February 1996
issue."
