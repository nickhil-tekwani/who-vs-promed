Katie Nelson from Mesa County Public Health stopped by the KREX 5 News Studios to tell us about the vaccinations that can prevent pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Last year [2017], there were 46 cases of whooping cough, and this year there have already been 13.

Mesa County Public Health offers DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis] and Tdap [booster] immunizations and accepts all major health insurance plans. They do have programs for those without insurance, and they said cost should not be a barrier to protecting your family. To learn more, visit Mesa County Public Health's immunization section of their website (https://health.mesacounty.us/services/family/immunizations/#1485903122632-690d846f-da4d).

Following a pertussis outbreak at Scarborough High School [Cumberland county], parents are urged to keep kids home if they have a cough and to update family vaccinations. An outbreak of whooping cough at Scarborough High School last month [October 2018] has health officials warning parents to take precautions.

Three high school students had confirmed cases of pertussis in October [2018], but none of the cases appeared to be connected, Superintendent Julie Kukenberger said. "We obviously want to be hyper-vigilant so families can be aware and take steps to protect their children," she said. Pamela Gill and Lisa Verzoni, both registered nurses, sent an email Friday morning [2 Nov 2018] to the Scarborough school community on behalf of the health services staff. "Students attending the high school may have been exposed," the nurses wrote. "It is important to inform the entire school community of the recent pertussis cases."

Schools in neighboring York county reported a spike in the highly infectious disease in September [2018], according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. While cases reported statewide are down so far this year [2018] -- 262 through September compared to 317 during the same period last year -- 97 cases this year [2018] were in York county alone, and 25 of those cases were reported in September [2018].

The nurses recommended keeping children home from school and other activities if they have a cough and may have been exposed to pertussis. Other recommendations included making an appointment with a health care provider as soon as possible and informing them if a child has been exposed to pertussis. They also urged everyone to make sure their families' vaccinations are up to date.

York county continues to be a hot spot for the infectious disease, also known as whooping cough, and low vaccination rates are thought to be a factor.

Pertussis cases in Maine ballooned in October [2018], and with 64 cases reported statewide it was the worst month so far this year [2018] for the infectious disease, which produces a violent cough.

The October figures bring the total number of pertussis cases to 332 for the 1st 10 months of 2018, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Maine consistently has among the highest rates of pertussis -- also known as whooping cough -- in the nation.

The state is on pace to nearly match the 410 pertussis cases in 2017, which was the most since 557 cases were recorded in 2014. Maine's pertussis rate of 27.7 cases per 100 000 population was the worst in the nation in 2017 and more than 5 times the national average, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Scarborough, Biddeford, and Kennebunk schools reported pertussis outbreaks this fall [2018], and on [8 Nov 2018] the Middle School of the Kennebunks canceled its annual community Thanksgiving dinner to avoid potentially exposing the community, especially babies and senior citizens, to the disease. An outbreak is defined as 3 or more cases in one location, such as a school, day care facility, church or workplace.

York county has been a hot spot for pertussis, with 37 of the 64 cases in October [2018] recorded in Maine's southernmost county, including an outbreak at Ninny's House Childcare in Buxton.

Health experts cite 3 major reasons why Maine is vulnerable to pertussis infections: parents opting their children out of school-required vaccines; the waning effectiveness of the vaccine, which requires a booster shot; and Maine being late to adopt a required booster shot for middle school students. The state didn't establish the requirement until the 2017-18 school year.

Dr Laura Blaisdell, a Yarmouth pediatrician and vaccine researcher, said the high rates of pertussis are "most likely related to low vaccination rates. We can and should do better.

Vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and research has proved that they do not cause autism, but myths that the vaccines are contributing to autism have persisted since the late 1990s.

Maine typically has one of the highest rates of parents opting out of school-required vaccines for children entering kindergarten. Opt-out rates increased for the 2017-18 school year to 5 percent of kindergartners for non-medical reasons, on philosophic or religious grounds. Democratic lawmakers have said they intend to introduce bills that would make it more difficult for parents to forgo vaccines for schoolchildren, after Gov.-elect Janet Mills assumes office in January [2019]. Mills has said she's open to bills that would improve "Maine's disturbingly low rates of vaccination in some parts of the state." Outgoing Gov. Paul LePage vetoed an attempt to make it more difficult to opt out, and a Legislature override effort fell 5 votes short.

There has been an increase in the number of cases of pertussis reported. So far this year [2018], 90 cases have come in to the Health Department -- the highest number reported since 2014, when the state saw 109 cases. The most affected counties include Edmunds (19), Brown (15), Minnehaha (13), and Hughes (12).

"Pertussis is a very serious illness so it is important to take precautions like ensuring you and your children are current with all recommended vaccines," said Dr Joshua Clayton, state epidemiologist for the department, in a press release.

More information about pertussis and its control can be found on the department's website at http://doh.sd.gov/diseases/infectious/diseasefacts/Pertussis.aspx.

An outbreak of whooping cough in the Rosthern, Wakaw, Hague, Hepburn, and Waldheim areas in recent weeks prompted the Health Authority to run special drop-in immunization clinics in Rosthern the last 2 days.

The Saskatchewan Health Authority said in an email to paNOW, the majority of children are not up to date or only partially immunized against pertussis.

The cluster of cases since [1 Oct 2018] had seen a total of 22 people with the disease, and one infant had been hospitalized. Over half of the cases were among children under the age of 5. 36 per cent of the cases involved children between 5 and 14 years, with the remainder between 15 and 19 years.

There was no specific number on the amount of people who attended the special drop-in clinic in Rosthern Thursday and Friday [8, 9 Nov 2018] although Dr Chokani said things had been "steady."
