Another horse confirmed with Hendra in another area in south east
QLD
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests on a horse at Park Ridge in Logan City have confirmed that the
animal died of Hendra virus overnight.

Biosecurity Queensland is currently assessing the need to quarantine
properties in the immediate area as there are horses on neighbouring
properties. There was only one horse on the Park Ridge property.
Community engagement teams from Biosecurity Queensland and Queensland
Health are currently door knocking neighbours to gather information on
their animals and give them information about Hendra virus.

Preliminary assessment has confirmed that 2 people had contact with
the horse. The total number of people across all cases is currently
17.

Three properties in the Beaudesert area and one property at Mt Alford
remain under quarantine. There are 28 horses on these properties,
which are still undergoing testing rounds for Hendra virus.

The latest testing returned negative results for the remaining 7
horses on the Mt Alford property. Biosecurity Queensland staff, in
conjunction with the horse owners, continue to closely monitor all
horses.

If you suspect Hendra virus, please contact Biosecurity Queensland
immediately or contact the Emergency Disease Watch Hotline.

Hendra claims 6th horse near Brisbane
-------------------------------------
Tests have confirmed a horse that died near Brisbane on Monday [4 Jul
2011] is the 6th victim in a worrying escalation of the Hendra virus.

The horse fell ill and died at Park Ridge, south of Brisbane, on
Monday night, not far from where other Hendra cases have been
confirmed. Initial tests produced conflicting results. But results
from further tests, returned late on Tuesday [5 Jul 2011], confirmed
the animal had Hendra virus.

The horse's owner and a vet who had contact with the animal have
joined the list of people waiting to learn if they've contracted the
potentially deadly virus. They now number 17 in Queensland (QLD) and 7
in NSW.

Queensland's chief veterinary officer Rick Symons said there was only
one horse on the Park Ridge property, which was now under quarantine.
"However there are horses on neighbouring properties so we are
currently addressing the need to quarantine properties in the
immediate area," he said.

Since 20 Jun 2011, 6 horses have died or have been put down after
contracting Hendra virus -- 5 in southern Queensland and 1 in northern
NSW.

Park Ridge is about 70 km [43.5 mi] from Mt Alford and 50 km [31 mi]
from Kerry, where other Hendra cases have been confirmed.

A total of 6 properties are now under quarantine -- 5 in southern
Queensland, including the Park Ridge site, and one at Wollongbar, in
northern NSW.

Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said 17 people
in the state were now undergoing tests for Hendra virus. She revealed
one is a Biosecurity Queensland vet who suffered a needle stick injury
on the weekend [2-3 Jul 2011], while responding to Hendra cases at Mt
Alford in the state's south. The vet, who was wearing double gloves
and following procedure, was being closely monitored in hospital, but
was considered to be at low risk, Dr Young said.

Dr Symons said the recent cases in Queensland and NSW pointed to an
increased Hendra risk for horses but the cause was a mystery.
"Certainly something is happening out there and for some reason the
chances of horses getting Hendra have increased." He said as many as 5
suspect horse samples a day were coming in for assessment from
locations across Queensland. "This reflects the heightened awareness
among vets and horse owners about the ever-present danger of Hendra
virus infection," he said.

He again urged vets to properly protect themselves when dealing with
sick horses, and owners to take precautions.

"Fruit trees are flowering at the moment and there is a lot of flying
fox activity," he said. "Horse owners are reminded that they should
not place feed or water under trees where flying foxes gather." Flying
foxes carry the Hendra virus and can pass it to horses via their
bodily fluids.

In a limited number of cases, sick horses have infected people. Of
the 7 people who have contracted the Hendra virus since 1994, 4 have
died.

[Both communications above confirm that there now appears to be a 4th
event in progress: another spillover event, this time at Park Ridge,
Logan City. This is north of the previous outbreaks but essentially in
the same general area.

Government press release on 4th event "Update: Hendra virus infection
confirmed at Park Ridge" http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/30_20582.htm

Media reports on 4th event
http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3261753.htm,
http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/07/05/3261942.htm (includes
discussion about sampling of infection rates in a fruit bat colony),
and
http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/hendra-claims-sixth-horse-near-brisbane-20110705-1h04h.html.

This is the 18th spillover event of Hendra virus experienced. Since
the 1st event in 1994, there have been 14 outbreaks and now 4 in less
than a month. It is not clear why this is happening now although there
are suggestions that the flooding that affected SE Queensland and
Northern NSW in December 2010 and January 2011 may be having an
impact. As the actual mode of transmission between bats and horses has
not been determined it is not clear what, if any, factors can increase
the chance of infection in horses.

Discussion of factors that may have an impact on a spillover event:

"Are Humans making Hendra Worse?" Interview with bat biologist
http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2011/07/are-humans-making-the-hendra-virus-worse.html

At all of these events an equine vet is reported to have been
exposed. 2 of the 4 people who have died from Hendra virus infection
were vets and a 3rd was the partner of a vet who assisted at a
necropsy of an infected animal. There has been extensive work with
various industry bodies about the need for personal protective
equipment when working with sick horses. Below is press release about
some of these efforts.

by horse owners and vets:

danger" http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/30_20575.htm

Once again, I extend appreciation to Storm Standford
<storm.stanford@gmail.com> for assistance and for summary tables.

We sincerely hope the exposed people remain healthy and that there
are no human deaths. Veterinarians and horse owners are on the front
lines of defense with this disease, are those most at risk, and most
often the first exposed - Mod.TG]
