Singapore suspends all poultry imports from US after avian influenza outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Singapore has suspended all imports of poultry products from the United
States effective immediately.
The move comes after officials in the US state of Delaware confirmed the
outbreak of avian influenza and ordered the culling of some 12,000 chickens.
US officials said the flu strain was different from the one that has spread
to humans in Asia. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) said
Singapore's chicken supply would not be severely affected, since imports
from the United States account for only about 9 percent of total consumption.
Brazil now supplies over 50 percent of Singapore's frozen chicken meat. AVA
is encouraging affected businesses to import poultry from its list of 11
approved countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.
The AVA is banning US imports of all live birds, day-old chicks, and frozen
poultry.

Flu Fears Force Killing of Delaware Birds
-------------------------------------------------
A flock of 12 000 chickens in Delaware was destroyed on Saturday in a bid
to prevent the spread of avian flu, and state agriculture officials
hastened to say the virus differs from the one that has killed people in Asia.
The chickens were slaughtered on a farm in southern Kent County, Delaware,
at 11:30 a.m. after 2 birds tested positive for the virulent H7 virus on
Friday, Delaware agriculture secretary Michael Scuse said.
The virus is different from the H5N1 virus in Asia, Scuse said. That strain
has forced the slaughter of millions of birds there and killed 18 people in
Thailand and Viet Nam who had come into direct contact with them.
"The virus that is in Asia is a mutation of H5," Scuse said. He said the H7
strain found in Delaware is fatal to poultry but does not transmit to humans.
Scuse said he was "fairly confident" the virus had not spread. As a
safeguard, however, other flocks within a 2-mile radius of the infected
farm would be tested, and the outcome of that process would probably be
known by Tuesday, he said.
If the virus is found in any of the other flocks, the testing area would be
extended to 5 miles, he said.
The slain flock's carcasses will be composted at the farm, which has been
quarantined, he said.
South Korea, which is battling a deadly outbreak of the virus, reacted
swiftly to reports of the discovery in Delaware, immediately halting
imports of U.S. poultry.
Poultry is a multibillion-dollar industry in the Delmarva Peninsula where
the infected farm is located, and is the mainstay of the local economy. The
Delmarva region, which lies between the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic
Ocean, consists of parts of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. The farmer
did not supply chickens to Purdue or any other commercial poultry company,
said Anne Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Agriculture Department.
Officials declined to release the precise location of the farm or its
owner, saying that quarantine regulations required a minimum of traffic in
the area.

[Avian influenza has various strains. H7 is a poultry strain and -- unlike
the H5 strain -- has not been shown to cross to humans and cause severe
illness except in very rare instances (see 20030501.1092 in the see alsos).
H7 has caused conjunctivitis and other upper respiratory tract symptoms in
humans (see 20030501.1092 in the see alsos). However, Avian influenza is
considered a serious disease in the poultry industry.
It is interesting to note that in posting 20040206.0432, a representative
of Elanco Animal Health went to the farm. This could imply that upon
initial investigation, there was some thought it could be a drug reaction
from an Elanco product. - Mod.TG/DK]
