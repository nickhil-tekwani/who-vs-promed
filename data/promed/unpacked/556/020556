Hand foot and mouth disease outbreak worsens in Viet Nam
--------------------------------------------------------
The number of children in Ho Chi Min (HCM) City coming to hospitals
with hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has been increasing steadily
in the last 2 weeks, according to doctors. Dr Truong Huu Khanh, head
of the infectious and neurological diseases ward at the Paediatric
Hospital No.1, said the number of children being hospitalised every
day has almost doubled the average 20 in the recent past. On Thursday
[7 Apr 2011] alone, 35 were admitted, he said, 5 in serious condition
and requiring a respirator. One child died a few days ago due to
severe complications after being admitted to hospital late, he added.

The Paediatric Hospital No.2 admitted 27 children on Thursday. Dr
Nguyen Dac Tho, deputy head of the city Preventive Medicine Centre,
said from an average of 30 per day in the last 2 weeks, the number has
increased to 80. So far this year, out of the 600 children who
contracted the disease -- mostly belonging to the City -- 3 had died,
he said.

Doctors are worried since usually there are no fatalities in the
early part of the year. Normally the disease peaks between October and
December though there are also many cases in the period from March to
May.

There is no vaccine against HFM disease and the best preventive
method was keeping the environment, food, and drinks hygienic, he
said. He urged local preventive medicine centres to strengthen
preventive measures against this and other infectious diseases,
especially at schools, including propaganda about preventive methods.
The Department of Education and Training has also ordered
kindergartens to carry out preventive measures against HFM and other
infectious diseases.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease is caused usually by viruses that
belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This group of viruses includes
polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and enteroviruses.
Coxsackievirus A16 has been a common cause of HFMD in North America,
whereas enterovirus 71 have been associated often with HFMD outbreaks
in South-east Asia. HFMD is common throughout South-East Asia and
predominantly, but not exclusively, associated with poor standards of
hygiene and child care. The majority of such reports originate from
the different province of China and being Chinese language reports
unfortunately remain largely unrecorded by ProMED-mail.
