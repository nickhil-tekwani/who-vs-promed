New diseases that are killing thousands of pigs and for which there are
no known cures could prove devastating to the industry, according to
farmers. Stewart Houston, chairman of the National Pig Association,
said last night: "The effect of these new diseases is likely to be tragic
and really could sound the death knell for the pig industry. So many
people are now really struggling and they will have to decide whether
to stay or quit the industry."
The disease takes 2 forms -- pigs suffer a sudden death and are found
in their pens, or they become listless, gaunt, and physically waste away.
Some also have a purple rash on their skin.
Farmers are desperate to find ways to protect their stock from the
disease, for which there are no cures or treatments. Meat industry
experts believe that about 300 000 pigs could die from the disease.
Vets insist, however, that there is no threat to human health.
The disease, which was first recognised in England in the South West 2-
&-a-half years ago, is spreading quickly throughout the country. Last
year the disease was confined to outdoor pig units in East Anglia, but
has now been found at indoor units and spread as far north as
Yorkshire and Humberside. Farmers and vets believe that the surge
could be related to the outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) in East
Anglia last year.
Pig producers in Scotland, where there has been one suspected case,
are so concerned that they have banned pigs from the south crossing
the border, although foot-and-mouth movement controls remain in
place for the moment anyway.
The 2 linked diseases are known as post-weaning multi-systemic
wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis nephropathy
syndrome (PDNS).
PMWS appears to affect pigs aged 6-14 weeks. Pigs are normally
reared for 20 to 23 weeks before going to slaughter.
PDNS affects pigs of 12 to 14 weeks. Once the virus is present in a
herd it can take 2 years to eradicate.
About 60 per cent of the country's producers have experienced high
rates of pig mortality. The cost in lost pig meat sales to the country is
estimated at GBP 21 million [in 2oo1. But the cost to the industry is far
higher, as farmers must still pay for feed, vets, and carcass disposal,
even though they receive no income from the dead animals. Pigs from
farms with the diseases are unlikely to be sold as breeding stock.
Bob Stevenson, a veterinarian and pig adviser to the British Veterinary
Association, said last night that there was near panic among farmers
who were free of the diseases. "They worry about buying new stock
because breeding companies cannot give assurances about the healthy
state of their pigs. In disease terms it really is a big fear, especially as
the disease is so new to the UK." However, he said that although some
farms had experienced up to 30% mortality, some pigs appeared to
recover with nursing and good stockmanship.
Government vets are planning a survey of private vets to establish the
number of cases in the country this year and to see if there are similar
patterns of pig behaviour.
Mr Houston will meet Elliot Morley, the Animal Health and Welfare
Minister, next month to press the Government to fund new research
into the diseases. Ministers and government vets know of the threat to
the pig industry, but have been concentrating on wiping out CSF and
foot-and-mouth. Mr Houston said that the real concern for farmers was
that they did not know how best to protect their animals, and that there
was no treatment on offer.
Vets believe that the diseases are linked to circovirus, which is found in
pigs, but they do not know what triggers the virus to cause sudden
death from the wasting condition. Some experts think the disease is
spread by birds, rats, and mice. Farmers have been told to maintain
strict pest control on their farms. Another theory is that the disease may
be passed through semen. Stress is also thought to be a factor. Farmers
are now reducing the number of pigs held in pens, cleaning out pens,
replacing straw and water more frequently and ensuring that pig feed is
free from mould.

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is found in the lesions of both diseases,
PMWS and PDNS. As far as is known, the 2 diseases only affect pigs.
They sometimes occur concurrently on affected farms, but can occur
separately.

Sporadic cases of PDNS and PMWS have been recognised in Britain
for at least 2 decades, but in 1999 epidemics of cases appeared, initially
in the East Anglia region of the United Kingdom, then gradually
becoming more widespread throughout the pig-producing regions of
England. In recent years many major pig-producing countries have also
encountered these emerging problems, particularly PMWS.
Surveys indicate that most pig farms are infected with PCV2,
irrespective of whether or not these diseases are present. Virologists
have been unable to detect any new strain of PCV2, so the reason for
the epidemics is elusive; aetiology appears to be multi-factorial.
Inoculation of PCV2 alone causes little or no disease, but lesions can
be precipitated if other antigenic insults are combined with PCV2.
A reading list on these diseases, plus more background information, is
