An outbreak of lumpy skin disease [LSD] among cattle has been reported in many districts of this northeastern border province, local media reported.

In Na Kae district alone, almost 500 cattle were reported to have been infected with the disease in 12 tambons, particularly in tambon Phiman, where 200 cattle were infected and 6 died. [A tambon is a 3rd administrative subdivision level in Thailand, below amphoe (district) and Changwat (province)].

LSD is an infectious disease in cattle caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae. The disease is characterised by fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes, and multiple nodules on the skin and mucous membranes.

The government said on Sunday [23 May 2021] that more than 6700 cows and buffaloes in 35 provinces had been affected.

Local media said the outbreak in Nakhon Phanom, which began about 3 months ago, had caused economic problems to farmers already affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

BK, 56, a farmer in Don Pattana village, said many of her 20 beef cows had been infected. Not knowing how to cure the disease, she decided to sell them, but while they usually fetched 40 000-50 000 baht [USD 1275-1593] each, she could get only 10 000 baht [USD 319] per head. She now has only 14 cows left, all infected, 2 in serious condition.

[In addition to the data on LSD's clinical signs, it deserves to be underlined that its transmission is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient. It causes a considerable economic losses since it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and death due to secondary bacterial infections.

Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats.

Lumpy skin disease is endemic in most African and Middle Eastern countries. In 2015 and 2016, the disease spread to southeast Europe, the Balkans and the Caucasus. In 2019, it spread east-northwards into Asia, reaching, among other countries, China and the world's largest cattle population in India.

LSD's introduction into Thailand was initially notified to the OIE on 9 Apr 2021, reportedly starting on 29 Mar 2021. According to a report of 12 May 2021, it was then already circulating in 18 provinces; the figures on Sun 23 May 2021 rose to 35 provinces with more than 6700 affected cows. (Thailand is divided into a total of 77 provinces).

The Thai LSD control policy has been declared to be mass vaccination. - Mod.AS
