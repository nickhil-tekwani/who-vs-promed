COVID-19 data show sewage monitoring could be vital in infection control
----------------------------------------------------------------
A pilot study's analysis of schools' wastewater shows its potential as an early warning system for public health teams

Schools may have had more COVID-19 infections before Christmas [2020] than previous research showed, according to data from a pilot study that senior public health experts believe could provide a crucial early warning system against future outbreaks. COVID-19 was present in the sewage of 80% of 16 primary and secondary schools in England during December [2020], and researchers detected the virus about a week before community testing, according to Mariachiara Di Cesare, a senior lecturer in public health at Middlesex University who led the study.

"In the earlier weeks, it was around 20% [of schools]," she said. "Starting from the end of November [2020], we saw an increase in the percentage that returned positive. And that was in line with a lag of a week before what was happening in the community." Di Cesare and other researchers from Term, a collaboration involving universities and the Joint Biosecurity Centre, saw a steady increase to 50% then 80% of schools taking part in the project, at a time when cases nationally seemed to be falling. "We were really worried, but the samples were consistent in the school and in other schools in the area, so we could see the virus was circulating," she said.

Di Cesare was keen to emphasise that the study, which took samples every 5 minutes from each school's wastepipe for 8 hours a day, had been attempting to show that wastewater could be used to discover COVID-19 outbreaks, rather than their scale or how transmission might be occurring. "This is not data we would expect to be used to close a school," she said. "One of the problems we are working on is how to communicate the data to public health teams."

The small sample size also means the study may not be representative of schools across England. A study by the Office for National Statistics of 105 schools in November [2020], using PCR testing, found the virus in 55% of schools in one day of testing, although it also said the data could not be used to extrapolate to the whole of England. However, because wastewater seems to provide earlier signs of COVI19 infection, public health officials believe it is better and cheaper than relying on PCR or lateral flow testing.

Maggie Rae, the president of the Faculty of Public Health, said having an effective early warning system in place was vital for preventing further outbreaks. "Test and trace is not cost effective and it's not an early warning system," Rae said. "Testing doesn't tell us how many people have got the virus, just those who have come forward for a test," she added. "Wastewater could give you a very, very good sense of unknown infections that you can then track." Local authority public health teams could potentially identify an area where COVID-19 may be about to break out, and go door-to-door offering advice, support and testing equipment, she said.

The water supply and sewerage systems have been used for public health ever since John Snow, a London physician, proved in 1854 that cholera was spreading from a well in Soho. The National Wastewater Epidemiology Surveillance Programme [N-WESP] began looking last summer [2020] at whether COVID-19 could be reliably detected in sewage, taking samples at 96 treatment plants in England, Wales, and Scotland. Andrew Singer, who leads N-WESP, said they were able to detect COVID-19 in the sewer system when at least one in 10 000 people is infected -- about 15 people in a city the size of Oxford.

The growth of new COVID-19 variants is also detectable, he said. "You can get an early insight into variants of interest and quickly assess how worried we should be about them."

The programme is being expanded to more than 200 sites in England, covering 80% of the population. Sewage is routinely monitored in Australia to detect COVID-19 outbreaks, and before the pandemic wastewater analysis was part of polio and norovirus detection in the UK. "We have the oldest sewer network in the world, practically. When you compare that with Australia's, which has pipes that are 20 years old, and documentation that shows where they are -- to be honest, I'm envious how easy it is."

[The benefits of testing sewage (wastewater) for RNA from SARS-CoV-2 were discussed in ProMED-mail 4 Nov 2020: COVID-19 update (470): USA contact tracing, sewage, WHO, global 20201104.7915703 and 20 Jun 2020 COVID-19 update (272): Italy sewage, Germany slaughterhouse, WHO, global 20200620.7490347. Both posts demonstrated the value of sewage testing for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 presence in the population. This approach to testing would allow schools to feel confident no one is infected. Similarly, it would work well for the military, prisons, nursing homes, and other groups of people. - Mod.LK]

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/wastewater-surveillance.html


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in collaboration with agencies throughout the federal government, are initiating the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data generated by NWSS will help public health officials to better understand the extent of COVID-19 infections in communities.

CDC is currently developing a portal for state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to submit wastewater testing data into a national database for use in summarizing and interpreting data for public health action. Participation in a national database will ensure data comparability across jurisdictions.

Data from wastewater testing are not meant to replace existing COVID-19 surveillance systems, but are meant to complement them by providing:
- an efficient pooled community sample;
- data for communities where timely COVID-19 clinical testing is underutilized or unavailable;
- data at the sub-county level.

What are the advantages of wastewater infectious disease surveillance?
- Sewage testing has been successfully used as a method for early detection of other diseases, such as polio.
- SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the feces of individuals with symptomatic or asymptomatic infection; therefore, wastewater surveillance can capture data on both types of infection.
- Nearly 80 per cent of United States households are served by municipal sewage collection systems.
- Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 measurements in untreated sewage can provide information on changes in total COVID-19 infection in the community contributing to that wastewater treatment plant (that area is known as the "sewershed".)
- Depending on the frequency of testing, sewage surveillance can be a leading indicator of changes in COVID-19 burden in a community.
- SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in sewage serves as a COVID-19 indicator that is independent of healthcare-seeking behaviors and access to clinical testing.

Abstract
--------
A cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in Danang, Viet Nam, began [25 Jul 2020], and resulted in 551 confirmed cases and 35 deaths as of February 2021. We analyzed 26 sequences from this cluster and identified a novel shared mutation in nonstructural protein 9, suggesting a single introduction into Viet Nam.

----
Viet Nam experienced 2 clusters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections during [23 Jan-15 Apr 2020] (270 cases, 163/270 imported) (1-4). After 99 days without community transmission, a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections of unknown origin was detected in Danang; it was found in Danang General Hospital on [25 Jul 2020] in a 57 year old male patient (DN001) experiencing pneumonia who had no travel history. During a subsequent round of contact tracing, 14 additional SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were detected both in the community (n=3) and Danang hospitals (n=11). Viet Nam then initiated large-scale contact tracing and quarantining. A total of 551 confirmed cases were reported from 15 cities and provinces across the country; 540 (98%) either were related to major hospitals in Danang or were in patients who had visited Danang during [25 Jul-3 Sep 2020]. This cluster included 35 COVID-19 fatalities, most (32) hospital-acquired and associated with concurrent conditions or old age (2,5). Danang General Hospital, the epicenter of the outbreak, reported 246 cases among inpatients, caregivers, and healthcare workers. Strict prevention measures of contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation were again implemented nationally, and the outbreak was successfully contained. We describe the molecular epidemiology of this cluster.

We performed sequencing of 26 nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens that were sent to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (Hanoi, Viet Nam) for diagnostics; all were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had cycle threshold value less than 30 by real-time reverse transcription PCR (6-8). Of those specimens, 18 were collected from patients in hospitals and communities in Danang and the rest from outside Danang: Ha Nam (1), Quang Nam (1), Thanh Hoa (1), Hanoi (2), Lang Son (2), and Hai Duong (1). We uploaded sequences to the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org; accession nos. 759869-91 and 766029-31).

All 26 sequences belonged to lineage B.1.1 and clustered together in the global tree, with the exception of DN013 (Figure, panel A). DN013 contains an additional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), C835T, that is also present in sequences from India and that artifactually clusters with those sequences in the global tree (Figure, panel A). A novel SNP at position 12772 (A>C) was found in all 26 sequences; it represents a nonsynonymous mutation in nonstructural protein 9 resulting in a leucine to phenylalanine change at amino acid site 4169 in open reading frame 1ab. This SNP was not reported in any other sequences collected globally and has no known associations with virulence or transmissibility. Sequences further clustered into 3 groups based on additional SNPs: cluster 1, a hospital cluster from the 2 largest hospitals in Danang (n=9); cluster 2, a simultaneously detected community cluster within the center of Danang (n=14); and cluster 3, a community cluster in the Son Tra district of Danang, detected August 6-8 (n=3).

A synonymous mutation, C18687T, defines cluster 1 (Figure, panel B). Cases belonging to cluster 1 were mostly hospital-related (inpatients, caregivers, and workers). This mutation was later also found in 2 sequences (DN016 and DN017) from Lang Son Province in patients who had recently traveled to Danang but were not linked to the hospitals. Sample size and availability of clinical metadata are limited and therefore no conclusions about transmission route and associations with severity can be drawn.

Cluster 2 is a community cluster detected in the center of Danang and among epidemiologically linked cases across the country (Hai Duong, Ha Nam, Thanh Hoa, Quang Nam); sequences carry only the unique A12772C mutation associated with this outbreak. This cluster also contains case-patient DN013, with the additional C835T SNP. An epidemiologic link between the index patient, DN001 (cluster 1), and cases of cluster 2 has not been confirmed.

Cluster 3 is defined by an additional mutation, A8588G (K2775E in open reading frame 1ab), which was found in cases DN021, DN018, and DN025. Neither of these mutations was found among B1.1 sequences in the GISAID database.

The nonsynonymous A12772C mutation that all sequences shared, which acted as a biomarker to determine the relatedness of cases found within and outside of Danang, was not found in the GISAID database or elsewhere. This finding suggests that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 of unknown origin with potential undetected circulation in the community before detection in case DN001 was responsible for this cluster.

The lack of community cases found in Viet Nam for 99 days before this cluster, the observed high level of nucleotide identity (99.96% minimum, 99.97% median), and the presence of a unique shared mutation indicate that this virus was unlikely to have been circulating undetected in the community since April 2020 or that this outbreak was caused by multiple importations. Given the very low circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and restricted entry, contact tracing and quarantining of contacts on the basis of exposure rather than symptoms remain effective measures to prevent and contain circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Viet Nam.

[Quarantining of individuals who have had contact with infected individuals seems like a good approach, since a number of the exposed may be asymptomatic, but still capable of spreading virus.

Viet Nam has handled the pandemic very well. It has been suggested that the central reason for this is perhaps the way the government has depoliticised the pandemic, treating it purely as a health crisis, allowing for effective governance. There was no political motive for government officials to hide information, as they don't face being reprimanded if there are positive cases in their authority area that are not due to their mistakes. The government has also been clear that public health cannot be entangled with commercial interests.

The 2nd reason is that Viet Nam learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003 that there might be more in China than was at first apparent. In January 2020, when Wuhan announced the 1st death, Viet Nam tightened its border and airport control of Chinese visitors. This wasn't an easy decision, given that cross-border trade with China accounts for a significant part of the Vietnamese economy. When the first COVID-19 cases were announced in Viet Nam -- a father and son from China -- it took precautionary measures above and beyond World Health Organization recommendations, including health declaration and temperature screening at every border entry point and stopping flights to and from Wuhan. Preparations for a pandemic were implemented a week before the outbreak was officially a public health emergency of international concern, and more than a month before WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.

The government also decided to embrace freedom of information on COVID-19-related matters. Although the Vietnamese media is state owned, featuring ideological control similar to that of China, they are free to report about the pandemic. When a member of the central theoretical council of the central committee, the brain of the Communist party of Viet Nam, contracted the virus on a trip to the UK, and risked infecting the minister of planning and investment who was on the same flight as him, his whereabouts were published for contact tracing. This was another lesson learned from the experience of SARS (excerpted from (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/20/vietnam-covid-economic-growth-public-health-coronavirus). - Mod.LK]

[Comparatively, the current number of cases (425) of the "20 Feb 2021 community transmission" is far more than those of the 2 previous community transmissions on 3 No 2020v and 28 Nov 2020, respectively. However, lessons learned from the previous community transmissions have paved the way for a well-informed and targeted approach to the evolving situation. School closures are now in effect in Phnom Penh, Kandal, and Preah Sihanouk provinces. - Mod.ST]
