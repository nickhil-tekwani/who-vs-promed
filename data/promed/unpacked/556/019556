[1] FDA: expanded recall
Date: Thu 28 Feb 2008

Baxter International Inc. announced today [28 Feb 2008] that the
company is proceeding with the voluntary recall of all remaining lots
and doses of its heparin sodium injection multi-dose, single-dose
vials, and HEP-LOCK heparin flush products.

The company initially recalled 9 lots of heparin sodium injection
multi-dose vials on 17 Jan 2008 as a precautionary measure due to a
higher than usual number of reports of adverse patient reactions
involving the product and suspended production earlier this month
[February 2008].

Given the widespread use of this blood thinner and the impact a
product shortage would have on operating rooms, dialysis centers, and
other critical care areas, the FDA and Baxter concluded that removing
additional lots and doses of Baxter's heparin from the market earlier
would have created more risk to patients requiring heparin therapy
than the increased potential for experiencing an adverse reaction.
Accordingly, the FDA and Baxter decided not to recall all Baxter
heparin vial products at that time. The FDA has now concluded that
there is sufficient capacity on the part of other suppliers that
Baxter's recall will not jeopardize access to this drug, and has told
Baxter that the company can now proceed with recalling its remaining
heparin sodium injection and heparin flush products.

Although the vast majority of the reports of adverse reactions have
been associated with the multi-dose products, Baxter is taking the
precautionary step of recalling all remaining heparin sodium
injection and heparin flush products that are currently on the
market. In addition to the previously recalled lots of heparin sodium
injection 1000 units/mL 10 mL, and 30 mL multi-dose vials, Baxter's
recall will now include the remaining lots of those products and
heparin sodium injection 5000 units/mL, 10 mL multi-dose vials,
heparin sodium injection 10 000 units/mL 4 mL multi-dose vials,
heparin sodium injection 1000 USP units/mL, 5000 USP units/mL, and 10
000 USP units/mL single-dose vials, and all HEP-LOCK and HEP-LOCK
U/P, 10 USP units/mL and 100 USP units/mL vials, both preserved and
preservative-free.

This recall does not involve Baxter's heparin pre-mix IV solutions in
bags: heparin sodium in 5 percent dextrose injection and heparin
sodium in 0.9 percent sodium chloride injection.

"We have assurance from the FDA that there is an adequate supply in
the market to meet the demand for these critical and lifesaving
drugs," said Peter J Arduini, president of Baxter's Medication
Delivery business. "The safety and quality of our products is always
our highest priority, and we will continue to collaborate with the
FDA as we work to determine the cause of the increased rate of
adverse reactions and resolve this issue."

Nearly all reported adverse reactions have occurred in 3 specific
areas of product use: renal dialysis, invasive cardiovascular
procedures, and apheresis procedures. Reported adverse patient
reactions have included: stomach pain or discomfort, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, decreased or low blood pressure, chest pain, fast
heart rate, dizziness, fainting, unresponsiveness, shortness of
breath, the feeling of a strong or rapid heartbeat, drug
ineffectiveness, burning sensation, redness or paleness of skin,
abnormal sensation of the skin, mouth or lips, flushing, increased
sweating, decreased skin sensitivity, headache, feeling unwell,
restlessness, watery eyes, throat swelling, thirst, bleeding
tendencies, and difficulty opening the mouth. Some of these
reactions, particularly profound and refractory hypotension, may be
severe or life threatening.

Customers have been instructed to discontinue use and segregate the
recalled product from the rest of their inventory. Customers should
then contact Baxter to arrange for return and replacement product.
Customers with recalled product purchased indirectly should contact
their wholesaler or distributor for return and replacement product.

[2] New York Times report
Date: Fri 29 Feb 2008

<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/us/29heparin.html?em&ex=1204434000&en=16faab828e4f9ebf&ei=5087>


Amid indications that more people may have died or been harmed after
being given a brand of the blood thinner heparin, federal drug
regulators said Thursday [28 Feb 2008] that they had found "potential
deficiencies" at a Chinese plant that supplied much of the active
ingredient for the drug.

The FDA said the number of deaths possibly associated with the drug,
made from pig intestines, had risen to 21 from 4. But it cautioned
that many of those patients were already seriously ill and that the
drug might not have caused their deaths.

Baxter International, which makes the brand of heparin associated
with the problems, and buys supplies from the Chinese plant,
announced that it was expanding a recall to include virtually all its
heparin products. Though Baxter produces much of the heparin used in
the USA, regulators said the other major supplier would be able to
meet the demand.

The FDA emphasized that it had yet to identify the root cause of the
problem, and that it had not concluded that the Chinese plant was
responsible. The agency also said it was investigating 2 Chinese
wholesalers, also called consolidators, that supplied crude heparin
to the Chinese plant, Changzhou SPL, as well as those that sold raw
ingredients to the consolidators.

The New York Times reported Thursday [28 Feb 2008] that at least one
of the consolidators received supplies from small, unregulated family
workshops that scraped mucous membrane from pig intestines and cooked
it, eventually producing a dry substance known as crude heparin.

The FDA admitted this month [February 2008] that it had violated its
own policy by failing to inspect SPL, located west of Shanghai,
before the factory began shipping the heparin ingredient to Baxter in
2004. China's drug agency also did not inspect the plant. Last week
[18-24 Feb 2008], the FDA sent inspectors to the plant. Among the
potential problems they found was a failure to properly follow the
steps for identifying impurities and deficiencies related to
manufacturing equipment. According to a redacted inspection report
released by the agency, the SPL plant appeared to have made at least
some heparin with "material from an unacceptable workshop vendor."
The vendor was not identified.

"We at the FDA understand how unsettling this whole situation with
heparin is," said Dr Sandra Kweder, the agency's deputy director,
Office of New Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "We are
determined to get to the root cause."

The FDA estimates that more than one million multidose vials of
heparin are sold per month in the USA, about half of which are
manufactured and distributed by Baxter. The problems with heparin,
which is used to prevent blood clotting during dialysis and after
some surgery, were first reported in January [2008] at a hospital in
Missouri. Since then, the number of reported adverse reactions has
risen to 448, the FDA said. "Yes, we have gotten more and we are
continuing to evaluate those reports," Dr Kweder said.

At first, the agency said it believed that 4 people had died after
allergic reactions to the drug. On Thursday [28 Feb 2008], officials
said as many as 17 more people may have died, but they described the
links to heparin as more tenuous. The adverse reactions have included
decreased or low blood pressure and fast heart rate. Not all of them
are known to involve Baxter products, but the drug agency did not
issue warnings involving any other products.

The Chinese heparin market has been in turmoil over the last year, as
pig disease has swept through the country, depleting stocks, leading
some farmers to sell sick pigs into the market and forcing heparin
producers to scramble for new sources of raw material. As a result,
even big companies have been turning increasingly to small village
workshops, which are often unsanitary. In interviews this week at
some of these workshops, employees told The Times that they had not
been inspected by the government.

The FDA has already finished inspecting one of the consolidators and
is still looking at the 2nd one, an agency spokeswoman said. The
agency also plans, if necessary, to look at some of the small
workshops that supply the consolidators.

"We will go where the investigation takes us," an agency official said.

[The thread has been reopened since the circumstances around this
outbreak continue to unfold with higher numbers of possible affected
individuals. It is also still uncertain what the pathophysiology of
the reactions were, that is, was this a reaction to a contaminant in
the heparin such as endotoxin, a true allergic reaction to a presumed
contaminant, or another mechanism.
