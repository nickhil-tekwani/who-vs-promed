Measles outbreak declared in South Sudan
----------------------------------------
On [23 Feb 2022], a measles outbreak was declared in South Sudan in east/central Africa. As of early March [2022], a total of 209 measles cases and 2 deaths (CFR = 0.9%) have been reported. Most cases are children under 5 years old (59.3%).

The outbreak has so far affected 3 counties of Torit, Maban and Tambura.

These 3 counties are from Eastern Equatoria, Upper Nile and Western Equatoria States, respectively.

Sporadic cases of measles have been reported in South Sudan since late 2021.

The ongoing measles outbreaks are attributed to suboptimal measles routine immunization coverage in Eastern Equatoria and Upper Nile States. Improvement in vaccination coverage is highly recommended to reduce the risk of future outbreaks. Apart from measles, rubella outbreaks have also been confirmed in Gogial West and Cueibet counties.

Fears 'imported' flu and measles could add strain to health system over winter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials have serious concerns about low measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rates among children as border openings usher in new illnesses, including seasonal flu.

Childhood vaccinations have been steadily declining but have dropped more sharply during the pandemic. Last year [2021] 250 000 measles vaccines -- more than half of the doses ordered -- had to be thrown out before they could be used in a catch-up campaign following 2019's deadly outbreak.

Director of Public Health Dr Caroline McElnay said the Ministry of Health was "very concerned" about low childhood immunisation rates, particularly for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine among babies and young adults. It was urgently focusing on increasing rates, she said during a COVID-19 briefing in Wellington.

Imported influenza and measles viruses will add further strain to a health system dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of other winter illnesses, when the border is gradually opened to tourists in the coming months.

"It certainly would put pressure, added strain onto the system and we're doing everything that we can to make sure that we're not in that situation," she said.

"We are very aware that as we continue to open the borders that measles in particular is something that we don't have in New Zealand. It only ever comes into New Zealand across the border, so we need to be prepared and as protected as we can be for that."

McElnay also announced 34 people had died with the virus, with 17 148 new community cases and 842 people in hospital -- 26 in intensive care.

Officials didn't fully understand why childhood immunisations rates were declining, she said, but families keeping children at home or not wanting to see their GP contributed to it. Rates for babies aged 12 and 15 months needed to pick up, as did the rate for young adults.

"We have a taskforce that's been put together at the ministry to advise on what needs to happen to get those rates back up. That is something that has been seen in other countries and has been one of the unintended outcomes of lockdown."

Canterbury was the centre of the worst measles outbreak in 2 decades in March 2019, after more than 2000 people caught the disease and nearly 800 were hospitalised.

The flu virus is also an imported virus, and officials are monitoring how it is moving overseas.

"It doesn't seem at this point in time that there's been a huge amount of flu. The UK didn't have a lot of flu, but that's absolutely no guarantee that we won't see it in the Southern Hemisphere," McElnay said.

"We're looking to see how we can have early warning systems."

Vaccinated tourists from Australia can come to New Zealand without isolating from [13 Apr 2022], and from [2 May 2022] visitors from visa waiver countries and those holding valid visitor visas will be able to return.

It will be the first time some international visitors have been able to freely enter the country in 2 years.
