Cattle sickness heads south with the rain
-----------------------------------------
Animal health authorities in New South Wales (NSW) are tracking the
rapid southern spread of a potentially fatal cattle disease that's
endemic in warmer Queensland, but not often seen in the cooler south.

It's been 40 years since bovine ephemeral fever, or 3-day sickness,
reached Bega on the NSW far south coast, after floods similar to
those of recent weeks.

Affected cattle have high temperatures, and can't stand up for several days.

Livestock vet Ian Lugton says the disease is likely to spread into
Victoria's north and east.

"Having more rain and winds forecast today, there is certainly a fair
chance that the mosquitoes carrying this infection have not got all
the way down the coast, and they may well do after these weather
events that are coming," he says.

And if there are any Victorian listeners, don't think you are immune
either, as it has got over the Victorian border in the past and I
know it has been recognised in the Temora and Wagga areas at the
moment but cooler weather temperatures may be limiting."

Authorities say there's no risk from consuming beef or milk from
cattle with 3-day sickness.

[Bovine ephemeral fever appears to be transmitted by arthropods. The
vector or vectors are not known, but BEFV has been isolated from a
mixed pool of Culicine and Anopheline mosquitoes, as well as
_Anopheles bancroftii_, in Australia, and from _Culicoides_ (biting
midges) in both Africa and Australia. Mosquitoes are suspected to be
the most important biological vectors. The disease can also be spread
by intravenous inoculation of small amounts of blood. Bovine
ephemeral fever is not transmitted by close contact, body secretions,
or aerosol droplets. The virus does not seem to be transmitted in
semen and it is rapidly inactivated in meat. Carriers are not known to occur.
