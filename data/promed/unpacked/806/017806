and not indigenous cases. Since the last update on Tue 16 Sep 2003
the number of probable or confirmed cases has increased dramatically
from 419 to 742. Most of the new cases occurred in Saskatchewan (199)
and Alberta (46) In all, 81 percent (602/742) of the cases have
occurred in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West
Nile virus infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus.
All the deaths and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec,
in contrast to the situation in 2003, when few cases have been
reported from Ontario and Quebec. - Mod.CP]
