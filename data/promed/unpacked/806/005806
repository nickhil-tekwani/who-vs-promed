A highly pathogenic strain of avian flu has been confirmed in New Hampshire. Fish and Game Department officials said 20 wild mallards have tested positive in Rockingham County.

State veterinarian Steve Crawford said the avian flu has not been detected in any domestic birds, but he said farms and bird owners should take steps to protect their flocks. "This kills a lot of domestic birds when it infects them," Crawford said. "Our recommendation to domestic bird owners are to keep your birds away, fully separated from wild waterfowl, from their feces, from their dander."

The state Department of Agriculture said it is ramping up testing. Officials said the strain of avian flu is unlikely to affect humans.

[2] Nebraska (Lincoln): wild goose

The Nebraska Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Wildlife Services and USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a wild goose near Holmes Lake in Lincoln. This is the state's 1st confirmed case of HPAI since 2015.

"While Nebraska has not seen HPAI in a backyard or commercial poultry flock within the state this year [2022], the finding of this single goose adds Nebraska to a long list of states with confirmed cases of HPAI," said State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. "Infected wild birds can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, so we encourage backyard poultry and commercial poultry flocks to continue to remain vigilant, practice good biosecurity and report sick or dying birds immediately."

The Nebraska Department of Agriculture and the Kansas Department of Agriculture's (KDA) Division of Animal Health encourage poultry owners to take steps to protect their commercial and backyard flocks from avian influenza by monitoring their birds for symptoms and by implementing biosecurity practices.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys, and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death. HPAI has been identified in backyard flocks as well as commercial operations in neighboring states; it has not been detected in Kansas.

"Protecting the poultry in the state is a high priority, and we need all poultry owners to be part of the effort to prevent the spread of disease in Kansas," said Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith. "Our best defense is to follow strict biosecurity practices and vigilantly monitor birds for any signs of illness."

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

For more information about HPAI, including current status of the confirmed cases in other states as well as more information about biosecurity for your flock, go to the KDA's avian influenza webpage at <agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza> or call 785-564-6601.

[3] New Brunswick (Albert County): great black-backed gull

New Brunswick has detected a case of the avian flu in a great black-backed gull in the Riverview area [Albert County]. In a release, the province's Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development said the Canadian Wildlife Service confirmed the bird had tested positive for the highly-pathogenic avian influenza, also known as H5N1.

The strain of avian flu, which is a viral infection that can spread easily among birds, has been detected in every Atlantic province.

The release said there are several different types of avian influenza. Some wild bird species, like ducks, might carry the virus and infect other birds without getting sick themselves. Meanwhile, other wild or domestic bird species can become severely ill or die after infection.

"Although the chances of people getting sick from avian influenza are extremely low, people who work around birds should take extra care," the release said.

Those who encounter a sick or dead bird should contact the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development at 1-833-301-0334, the release said.

The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 in the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, although the finding of an infected wild goose in Nebraska shows that the virus is already moving westward.

It is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB]
