Woman is treated for the plague
-----------------------------------
A Los Angeles woman is being treated for bubonic plague, the 1st case
of the age-old pestilence in the county since 1984, health officials
announced Tue 18 Apr 2006.
The infected patient, whose identity was withheld, came down with
symptoms last week and continues to be treated in a hospital for the
disease, which is characterized by swollen lymph nodes, officials
said. She may have contracted the disease from fleas in the area
around her Country Club Park neighborhood.
Although the disease is "rare, it is important to remember that this
still can happen," said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, director of public
health for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.
Traps have been set out for squirrels and other wild animals in the
area to determine the extent of exposure, officials said. Neighbors
are being warned to avoid contact with dead animals and fleas from
rodents and pets.
Although human cases of the plague are uncommon, it is endemic to
ground squirrels and some rodents in parts of the Angeles National
Forest, Tehachapi, Lake Isabella and Frazier Park.
The last major urban epidemic in the USA occurred in Los Angeles in
1924, resulting in dozens of deaths. On average, about 5 to 15 people
get the plague annually around the country, mostly in rural areas,
according to the CDC. [Most of the cases are in the southwestern part
of the USA in the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. - Mod.LL]
Bubonic plague is primarily transmitted through flea bites or direct
contact with infected open wounds or sores.

[Bubonic plague is the classical form of _Yersinia pestis_ infection,
representing 85-90 percent of clinical presentations. Individuals
present with fever, chills, headache and the painful bubo. The
process arises as a result of a bite from an infected flea or by
contamination of an open skin lesion. Local bacterial proliferation
is sometimes evident (4-10 percent of cases) in the form of an
abscess or ulcer at the site of infection (1).
Symptoms of fever and malaise develop 2-6 days after exposure. The
bubo generally occurs in the groin lymph nodes (90 percent), more
commonly in the femoral than inguinal nodes. Axillary and cervical
lymph nodes may be involved reflective of the location of the
fleabite. Usually heralded by very severe pain within 6-8 hours after
the onset of constitutional symptoms, the bubo becomes evident within
24 hours. It has been said (1) that the bubo may be so tender that
semicomatose patients will posture in a way to attempt to decrease
pressure on the swelling. The bubo may not be evident in the 1st few
days of symptoms. Furthermore, involvement of deeper lymph nodes may
not be visible. In these cases, abdominal pain suggestive of
appendicitis, colitis, enteritis or cholecystitis may be described.
In such cases, tenderness upon abdominal palpitation will be
misleading and may result in hazardous exploratory surgery and a
potentially lethal delay in specific antimicrobial therapy.
The mechanism of transmission of plague from flea to mammalian host
is as follows:
Fleas become infected upon feeding on the blood of a rodent suffering
from bacteremic infection. The bacteria are restricted to the
alimentary tract of the flea, where they multiply in the midgut. The
bacteria may form large brown clumps that extend throughout the
midgut, esophagus and proventriculus, a valve-like chamber situated
between the esophagus and the midgut. The clumps increase in mass
over a few days until the proventriculus is blocked.
The "blocked" flea then feeds on blood, but the meal is unable to
pass into the stomach. The flea continues to attempt to feed, but as
it futilely sucks blood from the host, the blood meal, mixed with
bacteria from the foregut, is regurgitated into the mammal. As many
as 24 000 bacilli may be transmitted in a single attempted feeding (2).
