Epidemiological Alert: New Confirmed Cases of Saint Louis Encephalitis
in Capital City and Province of Buenos Aires, Risk of Viral
Circulation (31 March 2010)

The Ministry of Health of Argentina has confirmed new cases of Saint
Louis Encephalitis (SLE) virus infection. Up to 29 March 2010, 4
confirmed cases of SLE infection had been reported in the nation?s
capital city and in Buenos Aires province.

The SLE virus had previously caused outbreaks in the central part of
the country (mainly in the provinces of Cordoba and Entre Rios), and
this is the first time that it has been detected in Buenos Aires.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Since less than one percent of SLEV infections are clinically
apparent, these 4 cases suggest that some 400 individuals have been
infected by the virus, most with mild or no symptoms. The case
fatality rate ranges from 5 - 30 percent, with higher rates among the
elderly.

Because there is no vaccine to prevent St Louis encephalitis virus
infection, the USA CDC recommends avoiding exposure by preventing
mosquito bites
<http://www.cdc.gov/sle/general/qa.html>, specifically:

- Use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of
lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing. The
repellent/insecticide permethrin can be used on clothing to protect
through several washes. Always follow the directions on the package.

- Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits.

- Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.

- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from
flower pots, buckets, barrels, and other containers. Drill holes in
tire swings so water drains out. Empty children's wading pools and
store on their side after use.
