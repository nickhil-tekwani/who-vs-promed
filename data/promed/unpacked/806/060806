West Nile virus surveillance - some relevant questions
------------------------------------------------------
The reports of dead crows and occasional virus-positive dead crows raise
some questions that I have not seen discussed in any detail. Thousands of
crows seem to be dying in the affected area. But only a few (we don't get
numerators positive with denominators usually) are scored as West Nile
virus-positive. Does this mean that the virus-infected birds are only a
tiny fraction of nature's harvest each year prior to the new agent, or is
the diagnosis difficult to make on dead birds that often may have begun to
decay, whilst most of them were infected?
And if most of the crows ARE West Nile virus-infected, does this mean that
this species is a powerful virus amplifier (viremia data are needed here)?
Or are the crows dead-end hosts, much as are equines for Eastern equine
encephalitis virus?
Answers to some of this would be helpful in beginning to figure out what
dead and infected crows are really telling us, beyond the fact that the
virus has been active somewhere within an unknown radius of site where the
bird died.
