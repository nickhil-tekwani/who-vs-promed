Molecular Characterization of a Begomovirus Associated with Tomato Leaf Curl
Disease in Uganda.
--------------------------------------------------
S. L. Shih, S. K. Green, and W. S. Tsai, AVRDC, The World Vegetable Center,
Shanhua, Tainan 741, Taiwan, Republic of China; C. Ssekyewa, Faculty of
Agriculture, Uganda Martyrs University, P.O. Box 5498, Kampala, Uganda. Plant
Dis. 90:246, 2006; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-90-0246A. Accepted for
publication 5 Nov 2005.
During the summer of 2003, leaf curl symptoms were observed in tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) plantings in the Iganga District of Uganda.
Begomoviral infection was suspected.
12 symptomatic samples were collected. Begomoviral DNA was extracted and
amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the begomovirus-specific
degenerate primer pair PAL1v1978/PAR1c715 (4). The expected 1.4-kb PCR
products were obtained from 11 of 12 samples. The 1.4-kb PCR product of one of
the samples was cloned and sequenced. Based on the sequence of the 1.4-kb DNA
product, specific primers were designed to complete the DNA-A sequence. The
DNA-A consisted of 2747 nucleotides (GenBank Accession No. DQ127170) and was
found to contain 7 predicted open reading frames (ORFs V1, V2, C1, C2, C3, C4,
and C5). A BLAST analysis was conducted with geminivirus sequences available
in the GenBank database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(Bethesda, MD), and MegAlign (DNASTAR, Inc, Madison, WI) software was used for
further comparisons. The DNA-A sequence of the virus associated with leaf curl
of tomato from Uganda showed less than 79 percent sequence identity !
with cassava mosaic viruses from Uganda (GenBank/EMBL Accession Nos. AF126800,
AF126802, AF126804, AF126806, and Z83257), the only begomoviruses from the
country so far in the public domain. Highest sequence identity (83 percent)
was with Tomato leaf curl Mayotte virus from Dembeni, Mayotte, Comoros Islands
(ToLCYTV-[Dem], EMBL Accession No. AJ865341). Pairwise comparison with ToLCYTV-
[Dem] showed 60, 88, 91, 82, 84, 86, and 80 percent sequence identities in the
intergenic region, V2, V1, C1, C2, C3, and C4 ORFs, respectively. Only low
sequence identities (ranging from 71 to 82 percent) were obtained with other
tomato begomoviruses reported from Africa (GenBank/EMBL Accession Nos.
AF261885, AJ865337-AJ865340, AY044137-AY044139, AY502934, AY502936, AY594174,
AY736854, and U73498). There was no evidence for the presence of DNA-B or DNA-
beta using PCR with the DNA-B specific primer pairs DNABLC1/DNABLV2 and
DNABLC2/DNABLV2 (2) and the DNA-beta primer pair Beta01/Beta02 (1), respe!
ctively. Detection of possible recombination was by RDP2 software (3) using
DNA-A sequences of begomoviruses from Uganda and tomato begomoviruses from
Africa. The DNA-A was found to contain a small recombinant fragment from
ToLCYTV-[Dem] in the 411 to 969 nucleotide position with 92 percent sequence
identity. Based on DNA-A sequence comparisons, the tomato leaf curl virus from
Uganda most likely constitutes a distinct new begomovirus.

Molecular Characterization of Pepper yellow leaf curl virus in Leaf Curl and
Yellowing Diseased Tomato and Pepper in Indonesia.

as DOI: 10.1094/PD-90-0247B. Accepted for publication 14 Nov 2005.
Yellowing and leaf curl symptoms were observed in tomato and pepper fields
near Bogor, Java, Indonesia in 2000. Samples were collected from one diseased
tomato (_Lycopersicum esculentum_) and three diseased chili pepper (_Capsicum
annuum_) plants. Viral DNA was extracted (2) and tested for the presence of
geminiviral DNA-A, DNA-B, and associated satellite DNA using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) with previously described primers (1,3,4). The begomovirus DNA-
A general primer pair PAL1v1978/PAR1c715 amplified the predicted 1.4-kb DNA
fragment from the tomato and 2 of the chili samples. DNA-B and satellite DNA
were not detected using PCR with DNA-B general primer pairs (DNABLC1/DNABLV2
and DNABLC2/DNABLV2) and satellite detection primer pair (Beta01/Beta02). The
amplicons from the tomato and from one of the chili samples were cloned and
sequenced. On the basis of the 1.4-kb DNA sequences, specific primers were
designed to complete the DNA-A sequences. Following sequence assembly!
, the full-length DNA-A nucleotide sequences were determined as 2744 nt
(GenBank Accession No. DQ083765) for the tomato- and 2743 nt (GenBank
Accession No. DQ083764) for the chili-infecting begomoviruses. Sequence
comparisons and analyses were conducted using the DNAMAN sequence analysis
software (Lynnon Corporation, Quebec, Canada). The DNA-A of both begomoviruses
contained 6 open reading frames, including 2 in the virus sense and 4 in the
complementary sense, and the geminivirus conserved nanosequence-TAATATTAC in
the loop of the hairpin structure of the intergenic region.
Because of their high nucleotide sequence identities of 99 percent, the tomato-
and chili-infecting begomovirus are considered the same virus. When compared
by using BLAST with available geminiviral sequences in the GenBank database,
the DNA-A sequences of the tomato and the chili isolates showed highest
nucleotide sequence identity (95 percent) with the partially sequenced Pepper
yellow leaf curl Indonesia virus (GenBank Accession No. AB189849) in the 1842
nt to 660 nt region and in the 1841 nt to 659 nt region, respectively.
Comparisons with full-length DNA-A sequences of begomoviruses available in the
GenBank database indicated high sequence identities of 76 and 77 percent for
the tomato and chili isolates, respectively, with an eggplant isolate of
Tomato yellow leaf curl Kanchanaburi virus (GenBank Accession No. AF511530)
from Thailand. According to our knowledge, this is the 1st report of full-
length DNA-A sequence of the Pepper yellow leaf curl Indonesia virus and its
na!
tural occurrence in tomato and pepper in the Bogor area of Indonesia.

1st Report of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus in South Carolina.
---------------------------------------------------
K. S. Ling and A. M. Simmons, USDA-ARS, U.S. Vegetable Laboratory, Charleston,
SC; R. L. Hassell and A. P. Keinath, Clemson University, Coastal Research and
Education Center, Charleston, SC; and J. E. Polston, Department of Plant

2006.
Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a begomovirus in the family
_Geminiviridae_, causes yield losses in tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_
Mill.) around the world. During 2005, tomato plants exhibiting TYLCV symptoms
were found in several locations in the Charleston, SC area. These locations
included a whitefly research greenhouse at the United States Vegetable
Laboratory, 2 commercial tomato fields, and various garden centers. Symptoms
included stunting, mottling, and yellowing of leaves. Utilizing the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and begomovirus degenerate primer set prV324 and prC889
(1), the expected 579-bp amplification product was generated from DNA isolated
from symptomatic tomato leaves.
Another primer set (KL04-06_TYLCV CP F: 5(prime)
GCCGCCGAATTCAAGCTTACTATGTCGAAG; KL04-07_TYLCV CP R: 5(prime)
GCCGCCCTTAAGTTCGAAACTCATGATATA), homologous to the Florida isolate of TYLCV
(GenBank Accession No. AY530931) was designed to amplify a sequence that
contains the entire coat protein gene. These primers amplified the expected
842-bp PCR product from DNA isolated from symptomatic tomato tissues as well
as viruliferous whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_) adults. Expected PCR products were
obtained from 8 different samples, including 3 tomato samples from the
greenhouse, 2 tomato plants from commercial fields, 2 plants from retail
stores, and a sample of 50 whiteflies fed on symptomatic plants. For each
primer combination, 3 PCR products amplified from DNA from symptomatic tomato
plants after insect transmission were sequenced and analyzed. All sequences
were identical and generated 806 nucleotides after primer sequence trimming
(GenBank Accession No. DQ139329). This sequence had 99!
percent nucleotide identity with TYLCV isolates from Florida, the Dominican
Republic, Cuba, Guadeloupe, and Puerto Rico. In greenhouse tests with a total
of 129 plants in 2 separate experiments, 100 percent of the tomato plants
became symptomatic as early as 10 days after exposure to whiteflies previously
fed on symptomatic plants. A low incidence (<1 percent) of symptomatic plants
was observed in the 2 commercial tomato fields. In addition, 2 symptomatic
tomato plants obtained from 2 different retail garden centers tested positive
for TYLCV using PCR and both primer sets. Infected plants in both retail
garden centers were produced by an out-of-state nursery; this form of "across-
state" distribution may be one means of entry of TYLCV into South Carolina. To
our knowledge, this is the 1st report of TYLCV in South Carolina.

[The crop plant tomato, _Lycopersicon esculentum_, is susceptible to the
disease leaf curl, caused by the tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV)
(family: _Geminiviridae_, genus: _Begomovirus_). TYLCV can cause serious loss
when it affects fruit yield severely, and is the main limiting factor in
tomato production in many parts of the world. Tomato plants are severely
stunted with shoots becoming erect. Leaflets become reduced in size and
pucker. Leaves curl upwards, become distorted, and have prominent yellow
margins. Flowers wither or appear normal, and the fruits that set either show
no symptoms from the viral infection or they may be small, dry and unsaleable
when infections come early in the season. The disease is found around the
world where the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B is present (see map
below and the "see also" section). While it is impractical to completely
eradicate a vector-borne viral disease, a combination of production practices
may minimize the i!
mpact of the disease. These include using disease-free transplants, roguing
the infected plants (early in the season), and managing whitefly populations
using various insecticides or reflective mulches.
The investigators in the 3 reports in this update used similar approaches to
obtain viral genome sequences, and describe 3 viruses each with close sequence
relatedness to different known strains of TYLCV. The Ugandan virus is similar
to TYLCV from Dembeni, Mayotte, Comoros Islands but differs from other African
strains. The Indonesian virus is similar to pepper yellow leaf curl Indonesia
virus and an eggplant isolate of TYLCV from Thailand. The USA - South Carolina
virus is similar to TYLCV isolates from Florida, the Dominican Republic, Cuba,
Guadeloupe, and Puerto Rico. The combination of reports points out the genetic
diversity of this virus family. The USA find in South Carolina seems to be an
example of the introduction of a virus from another state on transplanted
seedlings, in this case tomato and pepper.
