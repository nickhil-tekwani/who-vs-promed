It is expected that the other individuals with positive MERS-CoV currently in isolation in hospitals will likewise soon test negative and be able to go home. They are being tested daily to check on their positive status.

HAAD also announced one new individual with MERS-CoV. The new case was admitted to Hospital on 16 Apr 2014 with fever, cough, and diarrhoea, and was found to be positive for MERS-CoV. The medical status of the patient is stable and they are receiving appropriate medical care. The patient is known to have kidney disease on dialysis, and had just returned from a visit to Saudi Arabia, where [the patient] had received 3 sessions of dialysis.

HAAD confirmed that it is coordinating with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other Authorities in the country, and has taken all necessary measures as per international standards and recommendations from the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The MOH stated that the WHO confirmed the virus is not a concern for public health at the moment, and that the current situation does not require a travel ban to any country in the world, screenings at different ports, or any restrictions on trade.

The MOH confirmed that it is monitoring the situation closely to ensure the health and safety of everyone.

[The number of newly confirmed infections with MERS-CoV today (21 Apr 2014) is 18. It is noteworthy that the case reported by the UAE (whose gender and age were not available at the time of writing of this report) had a history of kidney disease and was on dialysis, and had recently returned to the UAE from Saudi Arabia where this individual had 3 sessions of dialysis. It would be of interest to know if this individual underwent dialysis at any of the medical facilities in Saudi Arabia known to have MERS-CoV infected individuals.
