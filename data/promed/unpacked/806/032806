During routine baggage checks in the Vienna-Schwechat airport, the Austrian Customs discovered, on 6 Jun 2013, a consignment of smuggled birds (of different species of parrots and birds of paradise). The 60 birds were packed, in tubes, into 2 travel bags. The destination was the Czech Republic. The birds were brought immediately to the quarantine station of the Schonbrunn Zoo [Vienna]. A total of 39 of them were already dead. All dead birds were delivered to AGES (The Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety) to determine the cause of death and carry out further investigation into possible animal diseases. The 1st intermediate results indicated the presence of a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in one dead bird. This was immediately communicated to all concerned (border-control customs, Schonbrunn Zoo, official veterinarian of the City of Vienna and provincial health directorates).

The surviving animals were killed on 11 Jun 2013 under supervision of the border veterinary service. They have been investigated in the meantime by AGES. All 60 birds have already been examined; the HPAI H5N1 virus could be clearly demonstrated in 4 other birds [in addition to the 1st case], including 2 that were alive upon arrival in Austria. The investigations are still continuing.

As a precautionary measure, all people who were suspected to have had contact with the birds while unprotected were informed; they have been treated with an antiviral drug (Tamiflu/oseltamivir) for prophylaxis. This included one border veterinarian and 7 customs officials.

The 2 people who smuggled the animals are citizens of the Czech Republic. For this reason, the Czech authorities were immediately informed to take any further steps.

In view of the fact that only a few birds were infected and that all birds were kept constantly since arrival under strict quarantine, the veterinary and human medical experts regard the hazard potential to be low.

[Additional information on the incident, including a picture of the birds packed in cardboard rolls, has been published by the Austrian daily Kurier on 11 Jun 2013 (German; available at http://tinyurl.com/mot9g6m). According to their information, the 2 smugglers from the Czech Republic had been on holiday in Bali. "During a visit to a bazaar we bought the birds," she told the customs inspectors. Their excuse: "The seller told us that the birds were standard and that we did not need papers." Among the birds were endangered species. The route was from Bali via Doha to Vienna-Schwechat, where the birds were discovered by customs dogs.

Illegal transportation of wild and ornamental birds has been reported from several countries in the past; it may be assumed that undetected consignments outnumber the detected ones. The Austrian authorities' success in the described case is commendable.
