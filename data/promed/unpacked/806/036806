Re-emergence of tainted dairy triggers alarm over food safety
-------------------------------------------------------------
The resurfacing of melamine-tainted dairy products in central China has
triggered alarm once again over food safety in the aftermath of the 2008
dairy scandal that rocked China's dairy industry.

Last week [week of 15 Nov 2010], market regulators in Xiangfan, in the
central province of Hubei, asked local businesses to trace 50 packages of
corn-flavored dairy drink that are believed to contain melamine, a toxic
chemical normally used in manufacturing plastics. Each package contained 15
bottles.

Sample tests showed the melamine level in the beverage measured as high as
4.8 milligram (mg) per kg, suggesting that the chemical was deliberately
added during the production process to fabricate higher protein content.
Further investigations indicated that the drink was produced in a dairy
firm in the southern neighboring Hunan Province. Earlier this year [2010],
Xiangtan Yuanshan Dairy Industry Company, the producer, bought a 25 kg [55
lb] bag of Dongyuan-branded milk powder, along with 2 kg [4.4 lb] samples,
from its long-term supplier as raw material for the dairy beverage.

The producer did not conduct a check over the milk powder as the raw
material supplier had offered all required quality reports. However, a test
conducted by the Hunan administration of quality supervision and inspection
showed that the melamine content was as high as 68 mg per kg, far exceeding
the national standard. [According to FAO and WHO, the maximum amount of
melamine allowed in powdered infant formula is 1 mg/kg and the amount
allowed in other foods and animal feed is 2.5 mg/kg. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
Moreover, after a thorough probe by the quality watchdog, the quality
reports provided by the supplier were proved to be fabricated.

In July 2010, the Dongyuan-brand of milk powder, produced in west China's
Qinghai Province, was exposed for containing excessive levels of melamine.
The dairy company, Xiangtan Yuanshan, claimed that it bought the raw
material without knowing it was tainted with melamine.

However, in a July 2010 inspection by the local food safety watchdog, the
company concealed the fact that it was using milk powder to produce dairy
beverages. Production in Xiangtan Yuanshan has since been halted and a
local food safety watchdog has placed the case on file for further
investigation and prosecution. The dairy firm is likely to face legal
charges for breaking food safety laws, the local administration of quality
supervision and inspection said on Tuesday [23 Nov 2010].

This latest revelation in Hunan Province added to a spate of discoveries of
melamine-tainted dairy earlier this year [2010]. In March, several Shanghai
company executives were held responsible for the chemical misuse and
sentenced to jail terms.

In July 2010, police arrested 4 suspects who allegedly added melamine to
milk formula and seized 76 tonnes of tainted milk powder and dairy products
in north west China's Gansu and Qinghai provinces in a crackdown on food
safety crimes. Dairy products tainted with melamine were also found in
Jilin and Zhejiang provinces.

Tainted dairy products resurfaced despite the Chinese government stepping
up their efforts in cracking down on food safety crimes since the Sanlu
scandal in 2008 that resulted in the deaths of 6 infants and sickening 300
000 children across the country.

In September 2010, the Chinese government called for an oversight of sales
of melamine and dairy firms were required to keep records of all raw
materials purchased. In the meantime, dairy firms were required to conduct
melamine tests on all products before putting them on the market.

The re-emergence of tainted dairy products again sent chills through
Chinese parents. Some have chosen to purchase imported milk formula ever
since the 2008 dairy scandal.

Loopholes in the administrative supervision and manipulative manufacturers
trying to get away with unqualified products are to blame for
there-emergence of melamine-tainted products, said Sang Liwei, a
Beijing-based food safety lawyer and representative of a nonprofit
organization, the Global Food Safety Forum.

Though the government has required that dairy firms install melamine
testing equipment themselves, the order was rarely implemented in some
small dairy businesses, as the 400 000-yuan (USD 60 000) equipment is too
heavy a burden, said Li Hongwei, director with the Xiangtan Quality and
Technical Supervision Bureau.

Li's deputy, Chen Weihua, attributed the misuse of melamine in dairy
products to the over competitive market that lacks effective supervision.
According to Li, many small dairy firms prefer to purchase raw materials
from low-end suppliers to cut costs. This, he said, increased the quality
risks.

Dai Xiang, board chairman of the dairy firm Xiangtan Yuanshan, complained
that it was easy to fabricate a quality report but difficult for his
company to identify the authenticity. In his case, Dai said he had trusted
the quality reports from the raw material supplier, which proved to be
falsified. "We are also the victim," Dai said.

[For those small dairy owners who find the cost of the melamine testing
equipment too expensive, perhaps a diary cooperative could maintain the
equipment and several nearby small dairies would use it. I do not know the
region so this may or may not be a practical suggestion.

The resurfacing of this problem highlights the difficulty of recalls on
products. It also highlights the victims and the unscrupulous practices. It
heightens fear for the producer, the end user, and all in between on the
supply line. - Mod.TG
