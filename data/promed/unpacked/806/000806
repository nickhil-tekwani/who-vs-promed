At least 90 people have been affected and 3 have died in a major _Listeria_ outbreak in Italy.

The Ministry of Health (Ministero della Salute) said the most recent patient was reported in mid-September [2022]. Deaths occurred in December [2021] and March and June [2022] in Lombardy, Piedmont, and Emilia Romagna. The patients were immunocompromised or particularly vulnerable to infection. One woman lost her baby in the outbreak. Patients live in Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Liguria, Umbria, Tuscany, Calabria, Lazio, Puglia, Valle D'Aosta and Abruzzo.

The Ministry of Health created an outbreak working group, which includes the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità), National Reference Laboratories, and regional agencies that met in August [2022] and were made official in September [2022].

There are also sporadic cases in other countries but the major burden is in Italy, where recalls and investigations have been undertaken, said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Investigations in Italy previously revealed a connection between patients and the presence of _Listeria_ in sausages made with poultry meat produced by Agricola Tre Valli, after sampling at the plant in Verona. _Listeria_ was also detected during environmental sampling at the factory.

Authorities have identified the same type of _Listeria_ in some patients and the recalled products but have not been able to link all patients to one product.

Positive batches with codes 1785417 and 01810919 plus all items produced before [12 Sep 2022] were recalled. It included the AIA Wudy and Pavo brands with expiration dates through [5 Dec 2022].

Chicken and turkey sausages with cheese were distributed to 30 countries mostly across Europe including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Data from the National Institute of Health shows cases of listeriosis decreased by more than 27% in 2020 compared to 2019, but have been increasing again in the past 2 years.

An earlier statement from Agricola Tre Valli said the voluntary withdrawal involved some hot dogs with the CE mark IT 04 M but production was continuing.

"The cooperative company has started this procedure in a precautionary way in agreement with the Italian authorities because the incorrect storage of the products and the non-compliance with the instructions on the labeling could make the food not suitable for consumption from a microbiological point of view," said the company.

"The company also specifies that it has always operated in full compliance with the laws in force. These procedures have been followed also for the batches that are involved in the current withdrawal."

[In Sep 2022, ProMED posted on a listeriosis outbreak in Italy attributed to _Listeria_ that was detected in several packages of Wudy and Pavo brands of sausages manufactured in Italy and distributed in Spain (ProMED post Listeriosis - Europe (04): Spain ex Italy, sausage, recall, alert, RFI 20220927.8705806).

_Listeria_ was also detected in the environmental sampling carried out at the Agricola Tre Valli manufacturing facility in Verona, Italy. Consequently, as a precautionary measure, all the products manufactured in this facility have been withdrawn as they are considered potentially affected (Wudy Clásico, Wudy Queso, Wudy Parti, Wudy Happy Hour, Wudy Maxipack Clásico, and Pavo Hot Dog brands). However, we were not told in that prior ProMED post the details about the outbreak in Italy or if genotyping has been done on isolates from patients, food, or the manufacturing facility.

The above news report says that at least 90 people have been affected in Italy, 3 have died in multiple regions of Italy, and one woman lost her baby in the outbreak. There are also cases in "other countries", although the major burden is in Italy. Positive batches of Wudy and Pavo brands of sausage with expiration dates through [5 Dec 2022] and codes 1785417 and 01810919 plus all items produced before [12 Sep 2022] were recalled.

In the USA and Europe, a common source is presumed for a cluster of cases of listeriosis if the clinical isolates of _Listeria_ have the same genotype. A certain food is confirmed to be the source if the genotype of _Listeria_ isolated from that food matches that of the clinical outbreak strain.

More information on the outbreak in Italy and genotyping would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
