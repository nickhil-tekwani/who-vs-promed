Poliomyelitis in Indonesia - Update 6, 27 Jun 2005
-----------------------------------------------
On 26 Jun 2005, 10 new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia,
bringing the total number of cases to 65. The cases are from Western
Java and Banten provinces.

The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 31 May 2005, just
before the immunization "mop-up" campaign held on 31 May to 2 Jun
[2005]. This campaign covered West Java, Banten and Jakarta provinces
to reach 6.4 million children under the age of 5 years. Planning is
under way for the 2nd round campaign (to be held on 28-29 Jun [2005])
for the same provinces.

One case was reported on 22 Jun [2005] from Demak district in Central
Java, a hitherto unaffected province and outside the area where the
"mop-up" campaign was held. A large outbreak response immunization,
targeting 76 000 children aged less than 5 years, is being
implemented around the case in Central Java. The province will be
included in the next phase of the large-scale immunization campaigns
which will start from August [2005].

[According to this current update, there have been 14 new cases
confirmed since our last update (see ProMED-mail archives listed
below). In our last update (20 Jun 2005), there was mention of a case
in Demak district in Central Java Province. The above update mentions
the case in Demak district, Central Java having been reported 2 days
following our last update, but the present update is worded such that
it appears as though it is referring to the same case and not to a
2nd case in the same area. As a reminder, the date of report of a
case does not mean the date of onset of illness. Hence, the statement
that the most recent case had onset on 31 May 2005, just preceding
the mop-up campaign, is not an inconsistency, but rather a comforting
item that there have not been new cases following the immunization
campaign. There is no information as yet on the number of suspected
cases (acute flaccid paralysis -- AFP -- cases) still pending
laboratory results in the affected provinces, including Central Java,
to know how much potential spread has occurred. - Mod.MPP]
