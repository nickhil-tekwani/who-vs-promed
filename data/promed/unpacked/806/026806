The strain of bluetongue virus detected in one cow near Ipswich,
Suffolk has been identified as Serotype 8. This is the strain found
in Belgium, France Germany, Luxembourg and Netherlands since August 2006.
This is not a confirmed outbreak unless further investigation
demonstrates that disease is circulating, and this could take days or
weeks to assess. The premises where bluetongue was detected remains
under restrictions, and epidemiological investigations are being
carried out to assess the situation.
Debby Reynolds, Chief Veterinary Officer, said: "It remains vitally
important that farmers maintain vigilance for this disease and report
any suspect cases, particularly as clinical signs may be similar to
foot and mouth disease. I would like to thank the owner, Animal
Health and the Institute of Animal Health for their rapid response in
helping to detect bluetongue in this single animal."

The strain of bluetongue virus detected in a British cow is the same
as that found recently in northern Europe, the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said today [23 Sep
2007]. Serotype 8 has been found in Belgium, France, Germany,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands since August 2006.
The virus, which cannot be transmitted [directly] from animal to
animal [but] only through midge bites, affects ruminants including
sheep, cows, deer and goats but has not so far posed a threat to humans.
Bluetongue has been discovered for the 1st time in the UK in one cow
at Baylham House Rare Breeds Farm, in Baylham, and will not be
considered an outbreak unless further investigation demonstrates the
virus is circulating. Officials are today [23 Sep 2007] testing
midges to establish the extent of the infection.
Restrictions have been placed on animal movements from the farm, and
the infected cow is expected to be culled today [23 Sep 2007].
The Government's deputy chief veterinary officer, Fred Landeg, said
all the other animals on the Suffolk farm will also be tested for
evidence of the bluetongue virus.
If the disease is shown to have spread, a 20 km control zone will be
placed around the farm banning the movement of livestock in or out of the area.
The disease, carried by midges, has been gradually spreading north
from the Mediterranean. Signs of infection are high fever and
swelling of the face and tongue, which takes on a blue appearance.
[Cyanotic tongue may be seen at times in BTV-infected animals;
certainly not in all cases. - Mod.AS]. It can be fatal to livestock,
but farmers also fear the economic consequences of quarantine zones
and restrictions on animal movements that may follow if the disease
is found to be spreading.
In the past year, cases of bluetongue have been found in Holland,
Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg [and northern France], and traffic
through the ferry port of Harwich will come under suspicion. In
Holland, the government banned all export of live sheep, cattle and
goats. Farmers within a 170 km exclusion zone were ordered to spray
insecticide on their land [in case this information is accurate,
details will be appreciated. - Mod.AS].
Yesterday [22 Sep 2007], Mr Landeg said contingency plans had been
drawn up after bluetongue was found for the 1st time last year [2006]
in northern Europe, leading to serious outbreaks in France, Germany,
the Netherlands and Belgium [see commentary].
"We knew that there was the possibility that infected midges could
possibly be blown across the sea to areas like Kent and East Anglia,"
the deputy chief veterinary officer said. He warned that the effects
of the disease could be particularly devastating for sheep. "In
certain cases, it can be very serious in the sheep industry and cause
quite high mortality, sometimes up to 70 per cent."
Defra had said it considered there was a low but increased risk of
spread to the UK from the affected areas of northern Europe. There
was a low likelihood of the virus being introduced to the UK through
legal trade in susceptible livestock from known affected areas
(imports from bluetongue restricted zones are not permitted) or which
went through restricted zones.
The likelihood of wind-borne infected insects reaching the UK was
said to be difficult to predict, but the chance would increase if the
wind direction was from the affected areas. [We are grateful to Susan
Baekeland who kindly sent us the following reminder: "Ipswich is just
up river from the Ferry port(s) of Felixstowe and Harwich. I believe
there is a ferry which goes to Zeebrugge on the Belgiam/Dutch coast.
Any lorry, car etc. could have transported _Culicoides obsoletus_ or
_C. dewufi_ from Belgium, as BVT-8 is rife in those countries." - Mod.AS].
David Abbey, 73, owner of 250 sheep at New Barns Farm, in Harlow,
Essex, said: "This could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.
It is another piece of very bad news for farmers." Geoffrey Copas,
who part owns Copas Farms in Cookham Dean, Berkshire, said: "I have
been aware of its spread through Europe and feared it was only a
matter of time. The real problem lies in the restriction of movement
following a case of bluetongue. An outbreak will cause huge financial burden."
Prime minister Gordon Brown held a conference call with Debby
Reynolds, the chief veterinary officer, and Hilary Benn, the
environment secretary, when he was informed about the infection at
the start of the Labour party conference in
Bournemouth. Earlier, he had held an emergency cabinet meeting to
discuss the latest case of FMD, discovered on a farm on the
Surrey-Berkshire border. Beaumont Farm lies close to Windsor Great
Park, which is now closed to the public.
The Government is considering the culling of millions of sheep
trapped on hills by the livestock movement ban imposed after the
recent FMD outbreaks. That could mean a return of the pyres of
cremated animals seen in the 2001 outbreak.

[Once the existence of local circulation (host-vector-host) of the
bluetongue virus (BTV) is established, vaccination becomes the main
and apparently only effective BTV control and prevention measure.
This can be deduced also from Defra's "UK Bluetongue Control
Strategy," available at
