Caribbean Coral Catch Disease From Sewage
-----------------------------------------
Human beings occasionally get diseases, such as swine flu, rabies and
anthrax, from animals. A new study finds that humans can also spread
disease to wildlife, with grim results. A bacterium from our guts is
now rampaging through coral reefs in the Caribbean.

Those reefs were already in slow decline, but they took a huge hit
starting in 1996, when a disease called white pox appeared in the
Florida Keys. "Since that time, elkhorn coral -- the species it
affects -- has declined 88 percent in the Florida Keys," says Kathryn
Sutherland, a reef ecologist at Rollins College in Florida. "And we've
seen similar declines elsewhere in the Caribbean."

The coral is named for its resemblance to elk antlers, and is among
the most important reef-building species in the Caribbean. Sutherland
and her colleagues soon found a culprit for the die-off -- a bacterium
called _Serratia marcescens_. It also happens to cause disease in
human beings, notably hospital infections. But the scientists couldn't
prove cause and effect.

In the past 15 years, almost 90 percent of elkhorn populations in the
Florida Keys have died, landing this once-common coral on the
endangered species list. "In 2002, we could only speculate that human
waste was the source of the pathogen because the pathogen is also
found in the guts of other animals," such as deer, Sutherland says.

So she and some colleagues exposed the coral in the laboratory to
bacteria extracted from sewage. As they report in the journal PLoS
ONE, the coral got the pox within days.

"That gave us definitive evidence that white pox disease is caused by
a pathogen found in human sewage."

An 'Evolutionary Triple Jump'
-----------------------------
Traditionally, we think of diseases moving from animals to us, but
"this is almost a man-bites-dog story," says James Porter at the
University of Georgia, a co-author of the study.

"This is a very rare and unusual evolutionary triple jump," Porter
says. The bacterium "went from humans to the lower invertebrates --
coral. It went from the terrestrial environment to the marine
environment. And then it went from the anaerobic [low oxygen]
conditions of our stomach to the fully oxygenated conditions on the
reef."

Porter says they are still trying to explain exactly how the bacterium
makes coral sick, and why white pox appeared so suddenly and
viciously. The good news is those answers aren't needed to protect
coral. You can just keep the germ away. And, happily, that's been
happening along the Florida Keys. Jay Gewin, utilities manager in the
city of Key West, says residents there voted to upgrade their leaky
sewer system. It was not done to save coral per se, but to get rid of
health warnings that were keeping the tourists away.

World's Coral Reefs Facing Serious Threats
------------------------------------------
Overfishing, local pollution and other human activities are putting
the ecosystems at risk. "In the early 2000s when this was such a
problem, every single beach in the city of Key West would have an
advisory," Gewin says. Those health warnings on the beach are now
rare, thanks to a sophisticated new wastewater system that cost the
city more than USD 70 million.

"The wastewater is treated to the highest level in the state of
Florida, and then it goes into a deep injection well, where the
treated final water product is sent thousands of feet down into the
ground," Gewin says. Eventually it may seep back up into the ocean,
but he says by then it's clean. The biologists say that since the new
system was installed, there haven't been any further die-offs of
elkhorn coral around Key West. Other towns along the Keys are now in
the process of cleaning up their act, too.

"But this is a problem Caribbean-wide," Sutherland says, "and there's
a widespread lack of wastewater treatment in the wider Caribbean
region." And that's bad news for the elkhorn coral. Due largely to the
disease spreading from humans, it's been tagged as vulnerable on the
endangered species list.

[This seems to be further confirmation of the the ProMED-mail post 20101024.3861. It may also be an extension of the coral problem. It
has been identified in the past in parts of the USA, and in the
Caribbean and attributed to various other causes. All of these causes
may play a role in this disease.

Coral is an essential part of the ocean ecosystem. This is a serious
issue and finding a way, as mentioned in this article to prevent it is
critical. - Mod.TG]
