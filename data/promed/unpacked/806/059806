US NIH: 2000 Influenza Virus Genomes Completed and Now Available
-----------------------------------------------
2000 influenza virus genomes now completed and are publicly
accessible, information critical to developing treatments and vaccines.
The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project, funded by the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), announced today [21 Feb 2007]
that it has achieved a major milestone. The entire genetic blueprints
of more than 2000 human and avian influenza viruses taken from
samples around the world have been completed and the sequence data
made available in a public database. "This information will help
scientists understand how influenza viruses evolve and spread," says
NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D., "and it will aid in the
development of new flu vaccines, therapies and diagnostics."
"Scientists around the world can use the sequence data to compare
different strains of the virus, identify the genetic factors that
determine their virulence, and look for new therapeutic, vaccine and
diagnostic targets," says NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D.
The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project, initiated in 2004, has been
carried out at the NIAID-funded Microbial Sequencing Center managed
by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) of Rockville, Maryland.
The project is currently directed by David Spiro, Ph.D., and Claire
Fraser, Ph.D., at TIGR and Elodie Ghedin, Ph.D., at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Recently, growing sequencing capacity
has enabled the production rate to increase to more than 200 viral
genomes per month. Eclipsing today's milestone of 2000 genomes, the
microbial sequencing center will continue to rapidly sequence more
influenza strains and isolates and will make all the sequence data
freely available to the scientific community and the public through
GenBank, an Internet-accessible database of genetic sequences
maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) at NIH's National Library of Medicine, another major
contributor to the project.
Seasonal influenza is a major public health concern in the United
States, accounting for approximately 36 000 deaths and 200 000
hospitalizations each year. Globally, influenza results in an
estimated 250 000 to half a million deaths annually. Seasonal flu
shots are updated every year to target the latest strains in
circulation. Developing such vaccines is challenging, however,
because the influenza virus is prone to high mutation rates when it
replicates, and these mutations can alter the virus enough that
vaccines against one strain may not protect against another strain.
An even greater concern is the potential for an influenza pandemic
caused by the emergence of a new, highly lethal virus strain that is
easily transmitted from person to person. Influenza pandemics have
occurred 3 times in the last century, the most lethal of which was
the pandemic of 1918, which caused an estimated 40 to 50 million
deaths worldwide.
"A few years ago, only limited genetic information on influenza
viruses existed in the public domain, and much of the sequence data
was incomplete," says Maria Y. Giovanni, Ph.D., who oversees the
NIAID Microbial Sequencing Centers. "The Influenza Genome Sequencing
Project has filled that gap by vastly increasing the amount of
influenza sequence data and rapidly making it available to the entire
scientific community. Subsequently, there has been a marked increase
in the number of scientists worldwide depositing influenza genome
sequence data into the public domain, including scientists at St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention."
Along with NIAID, TIGR and NCBI, other collaborators on the project
include the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of
Health in Albany, NY; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta; St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, TN; the
World Organization for Animal Health / Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (OIE/FAO) Reference Laboratory for
Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza in Padova, Italy; Ohio State
University in Columbus, OH; Children's Hospital Boston; Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston; and Canterbury Health Laboratories in
Christchurch, New Zealand.

To help analyze and interpret the large quantity of sequence data
generated by the Project, NIAID has funded the BioHealthBase
Bioinformatics Resource Center, which is being developed by
researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at
Dallas and developers at Northrop Grumman Information Technology's
Life Sciences division in Rockville, Maryland. This Center provides
the scientific community with bioinformatics and software tools and a
robust point-of-entry for accessing influenza genomic and related
data in a user-friendly format. BioHealthBase has recently
established a collaboration with the Influenza Sequence Database at
Los Alamos National Laboratory to provide influenza researchers with
computational data management and analysis resources to assist in
interpreting the genetic data. Data from the Influenza Genome
Sequencing Project, as well as all other publicly available influenza
sequence data, are also available through NCBI's Influenza Virus
Resource, which includes a host of analysis tools, such as sequence
alignment and building "trees" that show evolutionary relationships.

tools can be accessed at
