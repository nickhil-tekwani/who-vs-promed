State animal health officials say a 2nd beef cattle herd has tested positive for bovine tuberculosis in southeastern Indiana.

The Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) announced Tuesday [27 Dec 2016] that the beef cattle herd with the animal disease is in Franklin County. Those animals have been placed under quarantine.

Another beef cattle herd tested positive for bovine TB in April 2016, also in Franklin County.

The newly identified infected herd is within an existing 10-mile surveillance zone. That means no new cattle herds nearby need to be tested as a result of the new discovery.

Indiana won't lose its TB-free status thanks to the terms of a federal order issued in 2010. But the State Board of Animal Health must submit its TB plan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture by mid-February 2017.

[The animal found in Franklin county, Indiana in late April 2016 was a trace-out from a herd in Pennsylvania. Indiana has been following up on this particular case by placing a 10-mile [16 km] quarantine circle and tracing all animals into (trace-ins) and out of (trace-outs) the Indiana index herd.

It is possible this 2nd animal is a trace-out from the 1st Indiana herd, so, clearly, there will be an effort towards locating all the trace-ins and trace-outs. The plans mentioned in the article will also have to be produced, so the folks at BOAH will be busy in the next few weeks.

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease that affects primarily cattle, but can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal. TB is difficult to diagnose through clinical signs alone. In the early stages of the disease, clinical signs are not visible. Later, signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present. Cattle owners who notice these signs in their livestock should contact their private veterinarian. - Mod.TG
