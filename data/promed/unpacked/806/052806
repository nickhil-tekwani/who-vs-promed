Has the species of _Mycobacterium_ involved been determined?

There have been quite a few outbreaks in cattle in Bavaria due to _M. caprae_, supposedly transmitted from red deer (_Cervus elaphus_).

[A response from Ireland to Dr. Klee's query will be welcomed.

According to chapter 2.4.7 ("Bovine tuberculosis") of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (updated 2009), _M. caprae_ is "known to be zoonotic in central Europe identified as a common cause of bovine tuberculosis. Disease caused by _M. caprae_ is not considered to be substantially different from that caused by _M. bovis_, and the same tests can be used for its diagnosis" (see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.07_BOVINE_TB.pdf).

The epidemiology of _Mycobacterium caprae_ in Austrian and German cattle in the alpine region was discussed in 20160311.4085658. - Mod.AS
