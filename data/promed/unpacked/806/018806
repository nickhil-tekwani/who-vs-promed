[1] Cholera - Uganda (Northern Region)

The number of cholera cases in Moroto district has reached the 100 mark despite several interventions by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO).

On Fri 15 May 2020, WHO delivered several items to the district, comprising beds, drugs and water purification tablets among others to help combat the spread of the waterborne disease. The Health Ministry also handed over 8 vehicles to assist with disease surveillance, sensitization, and case management in communities. Despite the efforts, Loputuk isolation center continues to receive more cases each day. Phillip Lotee, the in charge of Loputuk health centre III says cholera cases in the district have hit the 100 mark.

On Sun 17 May 2020, 18 new cases were admitted to the facility, increasing the number to 102 cases. Of these, 67 have been discharged, and 33 are still on admission. Three persons died last week. Health workers say that although the treatment center is doing its best to treat the cases, containing the outbreak could remain a challenge because most communities still lack access to clean water. Lotee says that unless community engagement is done right, the fight against cholera could take a little longer, as the disease spreads to more villages due to lack of clean water.

At Natapara-Kocuk village, where an index case was reported, our reporter established that a section of the community still uses water from the stream for domestic chores, mainly washing and cooking. This is due to the slow response on clean water provision by the district authorities and partners on the WASH project.

Michael Erito, a resident of Natapara-kocuk has urged the local authorities to prioritize clean water provision to the over 2000 residents who do not have access to clean water. Mark Lotuk, the Natapara-kocuk village secretary, says that owing to the mass sensitization campaigns, the community has since improved on sanitation, but clean water access remains an issue.

Last week, Corporation and Development [C&D] repaired the borehole they built in Natapara-Kocuk village in Nadunget sub county. However, the water was also found to contain the bacterium that causes cholera. The C&D Field Coordinator, Kul Chandra said they have temporarily closed the water source until it's disinfected. The Moroto District Water Officer, Musa Lowot says his department is mapping boreholes that should be repaired immediately with support from partners. However, health officials say they have distributed aqua tablets to all households in the 14 affected villages.

Researchers have estimated that each year there are 1.3 million to 4.0 million cases and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths worldwide due to cholera.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Marsabit, Turkana counties)
Date: Thu 21 May 2020

13 Kenyans have died from cholera with 550 confirmed as suffering from the disease by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Thu 21 May 2020.

"We have lost 13 Kenyans to cholera, 12 from Marsabit County and one in Turkana," he announced. "70% of the deaths are of children aged 10 years and below," he added.

Speaking at Afya House during the daily Covid-19 briefing, the CS assured Kenyans that the national government was working hard to curb the outbreak that has so far been registered in the 2 counties. "We are exposed to disease because of the ongoing rains and floods," he said. The CS detailed the spread of the disease from Garissa through Wajir, Turkana and Murang'a, before it was reported to have hit Marsabit.

Of the 550 cases, 268 were recorded in Marsabit, while the remaining 222 were currently undergoing treatment in Turkana. On 30 Apr 2020, 7 people died following an outbreak of the disease in North Horr, Marsabit County. The County Health Executive, Jama Wolde, revealed that 2 people died while undergoing emergency treatment, while the other 5 died in different villages, adding that a child was among the casualties.

"We can confirm that the illness that has killed 7 people in Illeret Ward is cholera, after carrying out rapid tests," he stated at the time.

Cholera is typically spread through infected water supplies and induces acute diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and often resulting in death. The risk of death is greatest among people with compromised immune systems, such as malnourished children or those living with HIV. However, even among healthy adults, cholera can be fatal within a matter of hours.

The Sustainable Development Goals and Kenya's blueprint for development, Kenya Vision 2030, highlighted the access to sanitation facilities and clean water for all by 2030 as one of the high priority projects However, the country continues to be affected by cholera, a disease that is usually associated with low socio-economic status.

[3] Diarrhea - Brazil (Sergipe state)

More than 500 residents of the city of Pinhao, in the central region of the state, ended up in health posts and hospitals in the city with the same symptoms of gastroenteritis: diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. According to the city's Municipal Health Secretariat, patients began seeking help on Sun 17 May 2020 with mild or moderate symptoms. Some residents needed to be hospitalized.

The Municipal Health Secretary of Pinhao, Ivonei Lima, says that all measures to identify the causes of the outbreak have already been taken, and the city is working on 3 hypotheses: rotavirus, dengue and contaminated water.

"It is an outbreak of gastroenteritis, that is, episodes of diarrhea, vomiting, and some cases with abdominal pain. We made collections of water samples, an inspection also at the Sanepar water treatment plant, and we are trying to find out whether the poisoning was due to the consumption of water or food. We are also looking to see whether it could be rotavirus, and we are taking samples to see whether it could be dengue; however, we have no [answer], but we are trying to find out by excluding some diseases," said the secretary.

Sanepar reported that the analyses carried out on the water in Pinhao confirm that the city's water is within the potability standards defined by the Ministry of Health. A tent was set up in front of the city's health post so that people with the symptoms can be screened. Also, according to the Secretary of Health, there is no connection between the outbreak and Covid-19.
