Brucella suis biovar 2 in cattle: Follow up
-------------------------------------------
An outbreak of Brucellosis due to _Brucella abortus_ and affecting Belgian cattle was 1st notified on 5 Mar 2012 and is currently investigated. In the context of a bulk tank milk screening aimed at controlling this outbreak, a sample from a farm near Florennes (Province of Namur) was found ELISA positive by the local 1st-line laboratory (ARSIA). Subsequent individual serum testing of all (155) lactating animals of this herd identified a single 4-year old cow (born on the farm and not pregnant) that tested positive by ELISA and sero-agglutination. This animal displayed no clinical symptom of brucellosis and was slaughtered on 23 Apr 2012.

Bacteriological tests were conducted at the national reference laboratory (CERVA-CODA) on lymph nodes, spleen and uterus. The lymph nodes were found negative, but colonies of a _Brucella_ sp. were isolated from both the spleen and the uterus and were unexpectedly identified as _Brucella suis biovar 2_ (_B. suis bv2_) using both biochemical and molecular typing methods. A B. suis-specific real-time PCR test (Ref 1) turned positive on DNA extracted directly from the uterus, ruling out a possible cross-contamination in the laboratory. Molecular typing of this cow isolate demonstrated a genetic profile highly related to the profile of _B. suis bv2_ strains normally retrieved from wild boars in Belgium. None of the other animals in the herd was found positive for Brucella.

Authorities have ordered a one-month hunting campaign in the surroundings of Florennes [which] started on 19 May 2012 with the aim of reducing urgently the local wild boar population while providing an opportunity to investigate _B. suis_ carriage in these animals. A key issue will be achieved by comparing the genetic profile of the cow isolate to that of the local wild boar strains, if those turn out to be carriers of _B. suis bv2_.

Wild boars and hares are known to be infected by _B. suis bv 2_ in many European countries. A case of cattle infection by _B. suis bv2_ probably transmitted from an infected wild hare was reported in Denmark in 1995 (Ref 2). In the present case, contaminated wild boars are the most probable source of infection. The wild boar population of the Walloon region in Belgium is known to be steadily increasing since the last 2 decades, with a concomitant risk of introducing swine brucellosis in pig farms, especially when pigs are raised outdoors. However, the way _B. suis bv2_ can be passed from wild boars to cattle as reported here remains elusive.

Contaminated viscera from a hunted animal or aborted material left over in a pasture are possible contamination sources. It should be reminded that harvested viscera and carcasses of wild boars shot dead by hunters represent a potential contamination risk for susceptible animals and [should] not be left over in the natural environment, especially in the vicinity of pastures or farming areas.
