A child who attends the YMCA Early Learning Academy housed at Chesterton Middle School has tested positive for Legionnaires' disease, officials from the Duneland School Corp. [DSC] and the Porter County Health Department said Friday [11 Oct 2019]. The health department has asked school officials to track student and staff absences to determine whether anyone else has contracted the illness, according to a release.

The case marks the 2nd from the school corporation within a week after a school employee self-reported a confirmed diagnosis to school officials earlier this month [October 2019].

In a statement posted on the school corporation website late Thursday [10 Oct 2019] from the schools and the health department, officials said the parent of a child who attends the academy had symptoms of the illness, and she had her child tested Monday [7 Oct 2019]. "On Thu 10 Oct 2019, DSC officials were notified that test results indicate a presumptive positive for the presence of _Legionella pneumophila_, suggesting a current or past infection," the statement said.

On Oct 4 2019, the school corporation closed the middle school, Chesterton Intermediate School and the central administration office because of the employee's confirmed diagnosis. The school corporation took immediate action to test the water at various buildings.

The disease, Maria Stamp, a medical doctor and health officer for the Porter County Health Department has said, is transmitted through the lungs by aerated water, including from decorative fountains, showerheads, hot tubs, and water cooling and heating systems.

Traces of _Legionella_ bacteria were present in the hot water system at Chesterton Middle School and in the cooling system tower on the roof of Westchester Intermediate School according to preliminary testing, school officials said in an email to families and staff at the time. The bacteria were not found in any water lines that supply drinking fountains.

Based on the preschool child's test results, school officials reviewed actions taken over the past week to ensure compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidance, the statement said. Stamp has reviewed the testing of the preschool student as well as school corporation remediation efforts completed on 6 Oct 2019, the statement said. "All remediation efforts demonstrate that the water systems are currently operating at temperatures that prohibit _Legionella_ bacteria to grow, thus DSC water systems are safe," according to the statement. "Dr. Stamp is confident there is no reason for DCS schools to be closed related to this more recent diagnosis."

Stamp further recommended the school corporation follow OSHA recommendations to review absence patterns of staff and students, the statement said. People at high risk for Legionnaires' disease are those who smoke tobacco, the elderly, have underlying lung disease or have compromised immune systems. "In general, people do not spread Legionnaires' disease to other people."

Students or staff who have recently missed 3 or more consecutive days at the middle school, the preschool and the central administration office will be contacted to determine whether they experienced fever, cough, shortness of breath and headache symptoms. Anyone affected will be recommended to seek a medical evaluation, officials said.

All of the school corporation's buildings opened as normal Monday [date?] after checking water temperatures for the heating and cooling systems, flushing water lines, removing water faucet aerators, and checking or rechecking water supplies for bacteria levels, among other measures.

School officials have said the corporation conducts periodic water system checks, and going forward, the corporation will work with local and state agencies as well as an environmental engineering company to develop a formal water testing management plan.

Efforts are being coordinated through the health department, and updates will be sent via email to families and staff and posted on the corporation website, officials said.

This statement is being released as a joint update by the Porter County Health Department, Duneland School Corporation (DSC), and YMCA Early Learning Academy.

As previously released [https://www.duneland.k12.in.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=2325&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=9170&PageID=1], a DCS employee self-reported a positive test for Legionnaires' disease. As a result, DSC closed both the Middle School and Westchester Intermediate on Fri 4 Oct 2019 upon receipt of elevated water testing results. Based on this information, a parent of a child who attends the YMCA Early Learning Academy (housed at Chesterton Middle School) who was having symptoms, had her child tested for _Legionella pneumophila_ on Mon 7 Oct 2019. Today [Thu 10 Oct 2019], DSC officials were notified that test results indicated a presumptive positive for the presence of _Legionella pneumophila_, suggesting a current or past infection.

Based on these test results, DSC reviewed actions taken over the past week to ensure compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidance. Dr. Stamp, Porter County Health Officer (Porter County Health Department), has reviewed the testing of the YMCA preschool student as well as DCS remediation efforts completed on 6 Oct 2019. All remediation efforts demonstrate that water systems are currently operating at temperatures that prohibit _Legionella_ bacteria to grow, thus DSC water systems are safe. Dr. Stamp is confident there is no reason for DCS schools to be closed related to this more recent diagnosis.

Dr. Stamp has further recommended that DCS follow OSHA recommendations to review absence patterns of staff and students. Persons at high risk to or for Legionnaires' disease are those who smoke tobacco, elderly, have underlying lung disease or are immunocompromised. In general, people do not spread Legionnaires' disease to other people.

Students or staff who have recently missed three or more consecutive days at Chesterton Middle School, YMCA Early Learning Academy, and Duneland Central Administration will be contacted to determine if they experienced fever, cough, shortness of breath and headache symptoms. If such symptoms have occurred, affected persons will be recommended to seek a medical evaluation.

Once again, efforts are being coordinated through the Porter County Health Department. Updates will be sent via email to families and staff and posted on the DSC website.

[The Duneland School Corporation (DSC) is the public school system that serves several townships in Porter County, Indiana, United States (https://www.duneland.k12.in.us). A map showing the location of Porter County can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Porter+County,+IN. DSC, which serves Chesterton, a town in 3 of the 12 townships (Westchester, Jackson and Liberty townships) in Porter County, closed the Chesterton Intermediate School and the central administration office on 4 Oct 2019 because of an employee's confirmed diagnosis of legionnaires' disease. Westchester Intermediate School was also closed on 4 Oct 2019, because _Legionella_ were found both in the cooling system tower on the roof of Westchester Intermediate School, as well as in the hot water system at Chesterton Middle School.

Within a week of the closures, a 2nd case of legionnaires' disease was presumably diagnosed in a child who attends the YMCA Early Learning Academy that is housed at the Chesterton Middle School. The Chestertown Middle School and the DSC's central administrative center is located on W. Morgan Avenue in Chesterton and the Westchester Intermediate School is located on S. 5th Street in Chesterton. A map showing the location of these 2 schools, about 1.3 miles apart, can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/search/chesterton+intermediate+school/@41.6043292,-87.0646346,15z/data=!3m1!4b1.

Molecular typing of clinical isolates of _Legionella_, if available, can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

It is not completely clear from the news reports above whether legionnaires' disease or Pontiac fever (the non-pneumonic form of legionellosis) has been diagnosed in the child. Legionnaires' disease is uncommon in children. Infected children have usually had many of the same risk factors for legionellosis as have adults. Most reported cases have involved children with malignancies, severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease, organ transplantation, and prolonged treatment with corticosteroids, or who have preexisting respiratory disease (1,2).
