An Edmonton elementary school student with a compromised immune system has been diagnosed with a rare and potentially deadly diphtheria infection yet again. Edmonton Public Schools sent home a letter to families of Evansdale School students, alerting them to a confirmed case of diphtheria. This is the same north Edmonton school where, in 2017, a student was confirmed to have the disease.

The 11-year-old boy was the student who had diphtheria last school year, and on Monday [10 Jun 2019], [his mother] confirmed he had become infected again. [The mother] said [her son] is up to date on all of his vaccinations. She doesn't know how her son contracted the disease again but says he has battled severe eczema since he was 5 months old, and that makes him more susceptible to certain illnesses.

In both cases, she said the infection was diagnosed after he developed open sores that were not healing. [The boy] was swabbed and the infection was confirmed. [His mother] said he is now on antibiotics and in quarantine. She said the rest of the family is also under restrictions until their swabs come back.

About one in 10 people who get diphtheria die, according to Alberta Health Services (AHS). Diphtheria can be easily spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and also through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person.

The letter sent home from the school said the affected student had cutaneous diphtheria, which AHS says primarily causes skin infection. According to the Mayo Clinic, skin (cutaneous) diphtheria causes the typical pain, redness and swelling associated with other bacterial skin infections. Ulcers covered by a gray membrane also may develop in cutaneous diphtheria.

[The mother] said [her son] is in good spirits, and she hopes someone can help find out where the diphtheria is coming from and why her son keeps getting infected. She wants the public to be educated and hopes speaking out will help her son be connected with a specialist who could help manage the eczema, which causes red, itchy patches and inflammation on the skin. There is no cure for eczema.

[Her son] has been bullied, [the mother] said, adding people make rude comments and assumptions based on her son's appearance. "People think he has scabies or that I abuse him, or that he needs to see a doctor or that he shouldn't be in public," [the mother] said. She said when he was younger, some parents wouldn't let their kids play with [him] because they didn't understand he has eczema and it is not contagious.

[His mother] said [he] is in pain daily. "His condition makes life difficult some days, as there are times it's painful for him to walk and run and makes him miserable." She added he has missed school due to being hospitalized and his latest quarantine started on Friday [7 Jun 2019]. "It will be 14 days [until] his next swab and then we need 2 consecutive negative swabs and then he can go back," [his mother] said, adding they are hoping [he] doesn't miss his Grade 6 graduation.

AHS said it was contacting a small group of people who may have had close contact with the student as a precautionary measure, but no other cases have been identified.

[Another mother], whose son is [a classmate] at Evansdale School, said her child stayed home from class on Monday [10 Jun 2019] as a precaution after being swabbed by AHS staff at the school last week. [She] said healthcare workers, dressed in protective masks and gowns, arrived at the classroom to test the students on Friday [7 Jun 2019]. "My son said he knew as soon as he saw the door," she said. "He said when the door open and the lady walked in dressed like that, he knew because that's what had happened in 2017 when they came to our house and did the same thing."

She said she spent the weekend angry and frustrated, wondering how long officials knew a student was infected before testing the class. "I'm just worried because it is a skin thing, so any of the children could become a carrier and not even know they're a carrier, right?" [The 2nd mother's] main concern is how AHS will handle potential future diphtheria infections. "The poor little guy that is sick -- is this going to continuously happen? That would be my next question and they had no answer for that, because they couldn't answer it for me."

In Alberta, diphtheria vaccine is offered, free of charge, through Alberta's publicly funded immunization program. Dr. Chris Sikora, a medical officer of health with AHS, said Alberta sees about one to 2 cases of diphtheria per year. "It is vaccine preventable. We have a very safe, very effective vaccine," Sikora said. "Thankfully, we do have fairly high immunization rates. But we always take this as an opportunity to remind parents that immunization is a good, safe and effective intervention for themselves and their kids."

AHS says for children, adequate immunization is 3 doses of diphtheria-containing vaccine before one year of age, and booster doses at 18 months and between 4 and 6 years of age. Children will also be offered a dose of diphtheria-containing vaccine in Grade 9 at school during routine scheduled immunization rounds. For adults, a booster dose of diphtheria-containing vaccine is recommended at 10-year intervals after the Grade 9 dose.

[Diphtheria became nationally notifiable in Canada in 1924, and that year, 9057 cases were reported, the highest annual number of cases ever recorded in Canada (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/diphtheria/health-professionals.html).

The diphtheria vaccine was introduced in 1926. Routine immunization in infancy and childhood has been widely practiced in Canada since 1930. By the mid-1950s, routine immunization had resulted in a remarkable decline in the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Another steep decline in cases occurred in 1980, which has been attributed, in part, to a change in case definition to exclude carriers from reported cases in all provinces and territories. Since 1993, a total of 19 cases have been reported with a range of 0 to 4 cases annually (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/diphtheria/health-professionals.html).

The WHO case definition for reporting diphtheria only includes clinical respiratory diphtheria. However, the Canadian case definition includes both respiratory diphtheria and infection at another site (e.g., wound, cutaneous) (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/reports-publications/canada-communicable-disease-report-ccdr/monthly-issue/2009-35/definitions-communicable-diseases-national-surveillance/diphtheria.html). In the USA, the case definition for reporting to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System includes only respiratory diphtheria (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/diphtheria/case-definition/2010/). Although no longer reportable, cutaneous diphtheria still occurs in the USA; it has also been most often associated with homelessness, poor sanitation, poverty, and crowded living conditions (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html).

Cutaneous diphtheria is contagious and can be a source of both respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts, and acquisition of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, the cause of diphtheria, can occur even in vaccinated contacts, as vaccine-induced immunity is anti-toxin. This may explain why the Canadian boy described in the news report above has had cutaneous diphtheria twice. Also, eczema may be a risk factor for the development of cutaneous diphtheria or may be a site for chronic colonization by _C. diphtheriae_ and other microorganisms (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/181/Supplement_1/S121/838072).
