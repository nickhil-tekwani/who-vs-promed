In Bulgaria 125 000 people struggle with post-COVID syndrome
------------------------------------------------------------
Almost 80% of people who have been exposed to the coronavirus need further examinations and tests, told the Bulgarian National Radio Director of the Bulgarian Cardiac Institute and Director of the Department of Cardiology at the Heart and Brain Hospital in Pleven Assoc Prof Yana Alexieva.

She explained that 1600 patients have so far taken part in the free screening and treatment campaign, Life After COVID-19, for helping post-COVID patients. In her words, a Swiss national survey found that 1 in 4 recovered patients had post-COVID syndrome. Of those who were hospitalized, 40% had complaints months after falling ill. Alexieva stated that such are the data for the hospital in Pleven.

Having in mind how many people in Bulgaria have been exposed to the virus, 125 000 patients are currently struggling with post symptoms, she said, adding that people who have been hospitalized are affected more frequently than others. However, the people who had a mild form of the disease were no exception, same as the young people who practiced sports.

Dr Alexieva stressed that post-COVID syndrome is associated with many different symptoms, and this is also very worrying. "It affects the human body from head to toe. The patients complain of headache, hair loss, difficulty moving, inability to perform your previous duties, dizziness, impaired concentration, forgetfulness, brain fog, impaired hearing, palpitations, hypertension, cholesterol spike, sugar, metabolic disorders, problems with all other organs -- pain in muscles and legs and back.

There are also cases of patients with a clinical picture of acute myocardial infarction," the medic explained. She also said that medical professionals do not know how to treat these patients because this type of infarction is different from other heart attacks.

Dr Alexieva recommended interdisciplinary teams to work with the patients in question. According to her, there should also be a separate clinical path for the rehabilitation of patients with coronavirus. The proposals have already been sent to the Health Ministry.

[2] Re-infection with mutated virus
Date: Sat 6 Feb 2021 1:33 AM GMT+1

More than 100 million people have been infected with the coronavirus, but they may not be completely protected against new variants.

A trial of an experimental coronavirus vaccine detected the most sobering signal yet that people who have recovered from infections are not completely protected against a variant that originated in South Africa and is spreading rapidly, preliminary data presented this week suggests.

The finding, though far from conclusive, has potential implications for how the pandemic will be brought under control, underscoring the critical role of vaccination, including for people who have already recovered from infections. Reaching herd immunity -- the threshold when enough people achieve protection and the virus can't seed new outbreaks -- will depend on a mass vaccination campaign that has been constrained by limited supply.

Anthony S Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted that it appears a vaccine is better than natural infection in protecting people, calling it "a big, strong plug to get vaccinated" and a reality check for people who may have assumed that because they have already been infected, they are immune.

In the placebo group of the trial for Novavax's vaccine, people with prior coronavirus infections appeared just as likely to get sick as people without them, meaning they weren't fully protected against the B.1.351 variant that has swiftly become dominant in South Africa. The variant has been detected only a handful of times in the United States, including a case reported Friday [5 Feb 2021] in Virginia [USA], which became the 3rd state to identify the presence of the virus variant.

The preliminary finding from the South African vaccine trial, based on a data set with limitations, stirred debate and concern among researchers as results first hinted at in a news release last week were revealed more broadly this week.

"The data really are quite suggestive: The level of immunity that you get from natural infection -- either the degree of immunity, the intensity of the immunity, or the breadth of immunity -- is obviously not enough to protect against infection with the mutant," Fauci said.

Even if they don't agree on the scope of the threat, scientists said reinfection with new variants is clearly a risk that needs to be explored more. There is no evidence that 2nd cases are more severe or deadly, and a world in which people may have imperfect protection against new versions of the virus is not necessarily a world in which the pandemic never ends.

"I worry especially that some of these premature sweeping conclusions being made could rob people of hope," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security. "I worry the message they may receive is that we're never going to be rid of this. When in fact that's not what the data suggests."

She and others emphasized the apparent lack of severe health repercussions from reinfection -- and the lack of evidence that reinfection is common.

When Maryland biotechnology company Novavax first disclosed results from 2 international vaccine trials last week, the company noted in its news release that some people in the trial with earlier infections had become reinfected, probably with the variant B.1.351, which had become dominant during the trial.

On Tuesday [2 Feb 2021], details of the Novavax trial were presented at the New York Academy of Sciences.

About 30 percent of the people in the South African trial had antibodies in their blood at the start of the trial showing they had recovered from an earlier infection.

But that previous exposure didn't necessarily appear to afford protection. Among those who got saltwater shots, the people with a prior infection got sick at the same rate as study participants who had not been previously infected -- a surprise because they would have been expected to have some immunity. Nearly 4 percent of people who had a previous infection were reinfected, an almost identical rate to those with no history of infection.

"It's awful strong data," said Larry Corey, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who is co-leading the federal clinical trial network testing coronavirus vaccines in the United States. "Basically, it's saying vaccination actually needs to be better than natural immunity. But vaccination is better than natural immunity."

The study found that 2 shots of the experimental vaccine did provide protection against the variant.

The reinfection result was incidental to the main objective of the study, which was to determine the vaccine's efficacy and safety. It was not designed to test the likelihood of reinfection, and others argued that it can't be used to draw firm conclusions and cautioned against assuming that the previous infection provided no protection.

The study backs up recent laboratory data from South African researchers analyzing blood plasma from recovered patients. Nearly half of the plasma samples had no detectable ability to block the variant from infecting cells in a laboratory dish. In a separate study, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York took blood plasma from people who had been vaccinated and found that vaccine-generated antibodies were largely able to block mutations found on the B.1.351 variant.

Novavax did not provide a breakdown of mild, moderate, and severe cases, but severe cases of COVID-19 were rare in the trial, suggesting that reinfection is unlikely to send people to the hospital.

"It is not surprising to see reinfection in individuals who are convalescent. And it would not be surprising to see infection in people who are vaccinated, especially a few months out from vaccine," said Michel Nussenzweig, head of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology at Rockefeller University. "The key is not whether people get reinfected, it's whether they get sick enough to be hospitalized."

Reinfection has always been a possibility, but scientists who design disease models had assumed that natural infection would convey some level of immunity for at least a few months. That figured into some earlier calculations for how America could start approaching herd immunity by this summer or fall [2021]. Even with limited vaccination supply and delays in distribution, the hope was that people previously infected would factor in the drive toward herd immunity.

If it turns out that previously infected people could be susceptible to reinfection by variants, that could have implications for when the nation reaches herd immunity.

"Everyone's still trying to digest this and asking, is this really what's happening? Because the implications are pretty huge," said Chris Murray, who leads the modeling team at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. "If the data hold true, it means we will need to walk the public back on the idea of how close we are to the finish line for ending this pandemic."

Others are less sure. Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, said he couldn't draw clear conclusions from the data because it remains limited and preliminary.

"The pace has been dizzying, and several times today, I have learned new things that significantly change my view of those data," Lipsitch said.

Projections created by data scientist Youyang Gu -- whose pandemic models have been cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- suggest that about 65 percent of America's population will reach immunity by [1 Jun 2021]. But built into that 65 percent is roughly 20 percent having immunity from past infections only. Scientists are unsure how the potential for reinfection might influence their projections. They are eager to see if other vaccine trial data in coming weeks will corroborate the trend from the Novavax trial.

"The sample size so far is small," Gu said. "We need much more data before we can draw conclusions."

More data from South Africa will help clarify how common reinfection is and whether it results in severe disease. Researchers are following up with certain groups, such as health-care workers, to quantify reinfection, said Anne von Gottberg, co-head of the Center for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis at South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases.

"Several individual cases of reinfection have been confirmed," Gottberg said in an email. "We may be able to learn from seasonal coronaviruses and the fact that reinfection for these viruses are not uncommon, and start to occur 6 to 12 months after the previous infection."

The good news is that vaccine trials from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax show that vaccines can work -- even against the B.1.351 variant, and particularly in preventing severe illness.

"I think the fact that we ... now have data from 2 vaccines indicating that we can prevent serious disease, even against the new variant, is hopeful," Penny Moore, a scientist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, said in an email. "We need to keep monitoring sequences as these won't be the last lineages."

A future concern needing close monitoring is whether the reformulation of vaccines to keep up with the evolving virus could drive the virus to continue evolving. There is also a concern that subpar immunity could allow new resistant variants to emerge. That possibility, Nussenzweig said, is one reason that people should get both doses of a vaccine, on time.

[The potential for reinfection with COVID variants is a problem that must be taken into consideration in 1) models predicting when herd immunity will take effect, 2) vaccine design, and 3) behavioral changes around personal protection instituted to protect individuals from infection and transmission. But it is reassuring that 2nd infections appear to be rare and generally not severe.

It is important to gather data on the proportion of severe and mild cases that lead to 2nd infections, and their subsequent severity. And, importantly, whether the virus is transmissible following reinfection. - Mod.LK]

[3] USA: variant spreading
Date: Sun 7 Feb 2021
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/health/coronavirus-variant-us-spread.html


A new study bolsters the prediction by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the so-called B.1.1.7 variant will dominate COVID-19 cases by March [2021].

A more contagious variant of the coronavirus first found in Britain is spreading rapidly in the United States, doubling roughly every 10 days, according to a new study [see ref 1 below].

Analyzing half a million coronavirus tests and hundreds of genomes, a team of researchers predicted that in a month this variant could become predominant in the United States, potentially bringing a surge of new cases and increased risk of death.

The new research offers the 1st nationwide look at the history of the variant, known as B.1.1.7, since it arrived in the United States in late 2020. Last month [January 2021], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that B.1.1.7 could become predominant by March if it behaved the way it did in Britain. The new study confirms that projected path.

"Nothing in this paper is surprising, but people need to see it," said Kristian Andersen, a co-author of the study and a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. "We should probably prepare for this being the predominant lineage in most places in the United States by March [2021]."

Dr Andersen's team estimated that the transmission rate of B.1.1.7 in the United States is 30 percent to 40 percent higher than that of more common variants, although those figures may rise as more data come in, he said. The variant has already been implicated in surges in other countries, including Ireland, Portugal, and Jordan.

"There could indeed be a very serious situation developing in a matter of months or weeks," said Nicholas Davies, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was not involved in the study. "These may be early signals warranting urgent investigation by public health authorities."

Dr Davies cautioned that US data is patchier than that in Britain and other countries that have national variant monitoring systems. Still, he found results from some parts of the United States especially worrisome. In Florida, where the new study indicates the variant is spreading particularly quickly, Dr Davies fears that a new surge may hit even sooner than the rest of the country.

"If these data are representative, there may be limited time to act," he said.

Dr Andersen and his colleagues posted their study online [see ref 1 below] on Sunday [7 Feb 2021]. It has not yet been published in a scientific journal.

When the British government announced the discovery of B.1.1.7 on [20 Dec 2020], Dr Andersen and other researchers in the United States began checking for it in American coronavirus samples. The 1st case turned up on [29 Dec 2020] in Colorado, and Dr. Andersen found another soon after in San Diego [California]. In short order, it was spotted in many other parts of the country.

But it was difficult to determine just how widespread the variant was. B.1.1.7 contains a distinctive set of 23 mutations scattered in a genome that is 30 000 genetic letters long. The best way to figure out if a virus belongs to the B.1.1.7 lineage is to sequence its entire genome -- a process that can be carried out only with special machines.

The CDC contracted with Helix, a lab testing company, to examine their COVID-19 samples for signs of B.1.1.7. The variant can deliver a negative result on one of the 3 tests that Helix uses to find the coronavirus. For further analysis, Helix sent these suspicious samples to Illumina to have their genomes sequenced. Last month [January 2021] Helix reached out to Dr Andersen and his colleagues to help analyze the data.

Analyzing 212 American B.1.1.7 genomes, Dr Andersen's team concluded that the variant most likely first arrived in the United States by late November [2020], a month before it was detected.

The variant was separately introduced into the country at least 8 times, most likely as a result of people traveling to the United States from Britain between Thanksgiving [26 Nov 2020] and Christmas [25 Dec 2020].

The researchers combined data from the genome sequencing with Helix's overall test results to come up with an estimate of how quickly the variant had spread. It grew exponentially more common over the past 2 months.

In Florida, the scientists estimate that more than 4 percent of cases are now caused by B.1.1.7. The national figure may be 1 percent or 2 percent, according to his team's calculations.

If that's true, then a 1000 or more people may be getting infected with the variant every day. The CDC has recorded only 611 B.1.1.7 cases, attesting to the inadequacy of the country's genomic surveillance.

In parts of the country where Helix doesn't do much testing, it is likely delivering an underestimate of the spread, Dr Andersen cautioned. "I can guarantee you that there are places where B.1.1.7 might be relatively prevalent by now that we would not pick up," he said.

"There's still a lot that we have to learn," said Nathan Grubaugh, a virologist at Yale University who was not involved in the study. "But these things are important enough that we have to start doing things now."

It's possible that chains of B.1.1.7 transmission are spreading faster than other viruses. Or it might be that B.1.1.7 was more common among incoming travelers starting new outbreaks.

"I still think that we are weeks away from really knowing how this will turn out," Dr Grubaugh said.

The contagiousness of B.1.1.7 makes it a threat to take seriously. Public health measures that work on other variants may not be enough to stop B.1.1.7. More cases in the United States would mean more hospitalizations, potentially straining hospitals that are only now recovering from record high numbers of patients last month [January 2021].

Making matters worse, Dr Davies and his colleagues at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine posted a study online [see ref 2 below] on Wednesday [3 Feb 2021] suggesting that the risk of dying of B.1.1.7 is 35 percent higher than it is for other variants. The study has yet to be published in a scientific journal.

Communities can take steps to fight variants like B.1.1.7, as Dr Grubaugh and his Yale University colleagues recently described in the journal Cell [see ref 3 below] . For instance, they said, health officials should reinforce messaging about wearing effective masks, avoiding large gatherings, and making sure indoor spaces are well ventilated.

The scientists also urged governments to require sick leave for people diagnosed with COVID-19 to stop workplace spread. "Such measures could help to significantly reduce community transmission," Dr Grubaugh and his co-authors wrote.

Vaccinations can also be part of the strategy to fight B.1.1.7. In Israel, where the variant is now predominant, new cases, severe illnesses, and hospitalizations have already dropped significantly in people over 65, a group that was given top priority for vaccines.

"What we need to do with the current vaccines is get them into as many people as we can as quickly as possible," Dr Andersen said.

Driving down B.1.1.7 will also reduce the risk that the variant will evolve into something even worse. Already in Britain, researchers have found samples of B.1.1.7 that have gained a new mutation [that is, E484K mutation] with the potential to make vaccines less effective. It's not clear whether these viruses will become common. But they demonstrate that the coronavirus has a lot of evolutionary space left to explore.

"We should expect them to crop up here," Dr Andersen said. "Whatever was true elsewhere is going to be true here as well, and we need to deal with it."

Understandably, there is a great deal of attention being paid to the variants in circulation. It will be important to determine what level of protection the existing vaccines provide against the variants (see report [2] above on Novavax) and also read https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/7/astrazeneca-covid-jab-less-effective-against-s-africa-variant on Astra Zeneca vaccine, stating "The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the variant of the coronavirus [found initially in South Africa, B.1.351]..." It also is important to determine the prevalence of the variants.

It is critical that extensive sequencing of COVID case isolates be conducted to follow virus genetics and determine how best to proceed. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (91 767), Brazil (26 845), and France (19 715) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 7870 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 6 Feb 2021 to late 7 Feb 2021). Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, among others, did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Russia (16 048), the UK (15 845), Mexico(13 209), India (11 673), Italy (11 640), and Indonesia (10 827). A total of 46 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 47 countries are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 15.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 20.7% decrease in daily reported cases and a 11.8 % decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases over 400 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 106.6 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.32 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.UBA]
