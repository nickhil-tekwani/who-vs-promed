Republic of the Congo: Death Toll Reaches 100
---------------------------------------------
The deadly Ebola virus has killed 100 people in the remote forests of Congo
Republic and wiped out nearly 2/3 of the gorillas in a reserve. "We have
reached the fateful figure of 100 dead," Congo's Health Minister Alain Moka
said on Tue 11 Mar 2003 at a ceremony to accept donations to help fight the
outbreak. The latest Ebola epidemic to hit the central African country
struck in January 2003 in the dense forest region of Cuvette-Ouest about
440 miles north of the capital Brazzaville. "The government has already
spent 300 million CFA francs (USD 507 000) to put in place the logistics
needed to help stricken people but the state alone cannot help," Moka said.
"We must have the support of everybody and the international community."
Monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas started dying in large numbers toward
the end of 2002, and primatologists say the impact has been devastating on
the Lossi park in Cuvette-Ouest. At an Ebola conference in Brazzaville last
week, primatologist Bermejo Magdalena told Reuters that gorillas had been
disappearing at an alarming rate where she works in the Lossi sanctuary,
which covers 123 square miles. "In the sanctuary of about 1200 gorillas we
are now down to just 450 gorillas. We have recorded the disappearance of
600 to 800 gorillas," she said, adding the outbreak could spread to the
nearby Odzala park and might then contaminate forests in Gabon. "If Odzala
is also contaminated by the epidemic, that's nearly 20 000 gorillas under
threat. That's very serious, catastrophic," she said.
Ebola killed 73 people in Gabon and the same area of Congo in an epidemic
from October 2001 to February 2002, but experts fear this outbreak is more
virulent. The disease takes its name from a river in the Democratic
Republic of Congo where Ebola was discovered in 1976. The worst outbreak
was there in 1995 when more than 250 people died.
