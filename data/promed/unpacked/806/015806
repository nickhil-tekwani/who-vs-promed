Medical sources have reported 5 suspected cases of yellow fever [YF] in Central Congo province and have reported 2 deaths. According to the provincial medical inspector Dr Oscar Mavila, all reported cases have come from neighboring Angola.

The source asked the public not to be alarmed. Samples were taken from the patients and sent to the National Institute of Biological Research (INRB) in Kinshasa for testing.

[Angola and DR Congo share a vast border. There is a YF outbreak in Angola [currently] where there has been a vaccination response. If these suspected cases in the DRC are from Angola, the area where the disease occurs, it is likely that these cases are genuine cases of YF. The country should not wait for the test results and must put emergency measures in place as if it were an epidemic; this is to avoid unpleasant surprises. Anyone reporting to the national and international community about the situation in the DRC would be welcome.

[Mod.BM's advice to treat these cases as if they were the beginning of a YF outbreak is prudent. Surveillance should be initiated at the localities where these cases occurred. If no further cases are detected, the response can stand down. If, however, there is evidence of ongoing transmission, surveillance with laboratory support and a vaccination effort can be initiated quickly. In YF outbreaks, response time is of the essence. - Mod.TY]

[Central Congo province is also known as Bas Congo (formerly Bas Zaire), and can be found on a map available at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/dr_congo_map.htm. It borders with Angola on its south and west, the Republic of Congo on its north, Kinshasa to its northeast, and Bandundu to its east. - Mod.MPP
