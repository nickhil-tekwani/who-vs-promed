(Date of previous outbreak of Newcastle disease in Greece reported to
the OIE: June 2005).
Immediate notification report
Information received on 9 Nov 2005 from Dr Vasilios Stylas, Head,
Animal Health Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Athens:
Report date: 9 Nov 2005.
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease
or infection in a country following a report declaring the
outbreak(s) ended.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 7 Nov 2005.
Date of start of the event: 2 Nov 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Details of outbreak:
First administrative division: Central Macedonia
Lower administrative division (prefecture): Thessaloniki
Type of epidemiological unit: farm
Name of the location: Diavata-Sindos
Species: avi
Number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
3100 / 3100 / 324 / 2776 / 0
Description of affected population: vaccinated layer hens raised
under a conventional system. The farm consists of one building with 2
cage rows and the total capacity is 3100 layers. At the time of the
outbreak, 1600 layers were 18 months old and 1500 layers were 4
months old.
Diagnosis:
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: national reference
laboratory for Newcastle disease, Athens
Diagnostic tests used:
- virus isolation in embryonated fowl eggs;
Date: 7 Nov 2005
Results: positive
- haemagglutination test;
Date: 7 Nov. 2005
Results: positive
- haemagglutination inhibition test.
Date: 7 Nov. 2005
Results: positive
According to the information collected during an on-the-spot check
made by the veterinary authority of Thessaloniki on 2 Nov 2005, the
first signs to be observed were respiratory. Blood and tissue samples
were collected and sent to the National Reference Laboratory for
Newcastle disease (ND) in Athens on 3 Nov 2005. According to
information supplied by the above laboratory on 7 Nov 2005, brain
samples tested positive for ND in embryonated eggs and blood samples
showed high titres for ND. All samples tested negative for avian
influenza. As regards the vaccination status of the flock, the owner
claims that the older hens were vaccinated against ND with a LaSota
vaccine in their drinking water in August 2005, and the younger hens
were vaccinated with the same type of vaccine and method of
administration by the supplier around early September 2005.
The isolates are to be sent as soon as possible to the OIE and
European Union Reference Laboratory for ND (Weybridge, United
Kingdom) for an intracerebral pathogenicity index test.
Source of outbreak: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- stamping out;
- zoning;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
- dipping/spraying;
Due to the fact that a significant number of deaths (around 50
birds/day) was observed, a prefectural decision was officially issued
on 2 Nov 2005 for the implementation of appropriate measures in the
case of suspected ND, in accordance with European Union Council
Directive 92/66/EEC.
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/1992-66-CE-A.pdf>
Vaccination prohibited: no.
Other details/comments: investigations are already taking place in
neighbouring farms, with
negative findings so far.
Final report: no.

[Newcastle disease is caused by a paramyxovirus and was formerly
referred to as Viscerotropic Velogenic Newcastle Disease (VVND) or in
some places Exotic Newcastle Disease (END). Because it causes only a
mild conjunctivitis in humans, it has been overlooked in comparison
to Avian Influenza.
However, it is probably the most serious disease of poultry worldwide
and can cause mortalities of almost 100 percent in susceptible
flocks. Moreover, it cannot generally be clinically distinguished
from AI, and therefore good post mortem investigations must be
carried out.
Many countries in the region have had Newcastle Disease recently.
Please note that Greece and Turkey had outbreaks of Newcastle in
2004. France, which reports only suspicion of the disease in this
instance, had been free of Newcastle Disease since 1999 prior to this
year's outbreak in pheasants (see below). - Mod.PC]
