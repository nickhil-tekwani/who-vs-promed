A horse in Gloucester County was humanely euthanized on 3 Oct 2015 after contracting West Nile virus, a viral disease transmitted by a mosquito bite that affects a horse's neurological system.

The 10-year-old gelding, who became ill on 27 Sep 2015, was the 1st reported equine case of the virus in the state in 2015.

Another risk to horses from mosquitoes is eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), which causes inflammation of the brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile virus infection.

This year [2015], there has been one case of EEE, in Gloucester County, and in 2014, New Jersey had 4 cases of EEE. Camden County reported the year's 1st West Nile virus case.

"Vaccinated animals are much less likely to contract deadly diseases, such as West Nile virus," said New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher. "We urge horse owners to be vigilant in vaccinating their animals against diseases spread by mosquitoes."

Horse owners should contact their veterinarians if their horses are not already up-to-date on their vaccinations against both WNV and EEE. Effective equine vaccines for WNV and EEE are available commercially.

WNV and EEE infections in horses are not a significant risk factor for human infection because horses (like humans) are considered to be "dead-end" hosts for the virus.

Viral diseases such as West Nile and EEE must be reported to the state veterinarian at (609) 671-6400 within 48 hours of diagnosis.

The New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory is available to assist with WNV and EEE testing and can be reached at (609) 671-6999 or via email at <jerseyvetlab@ag.state.nj.us>.

[Horses should not have to suffer and/or die from this mosquito-borne virus when a very effective vaccine is available. It is usually combined with eastern equine encephalitis, and the vaccine is very effective in preventing the disease.

There are also mosquito repellants especially developed for the horse. They work well when used, but the key is to use them, and in the summer months, the sweat may affect the spray, so it is important to use both products, spray and vaccine, to protect your horse.

Vaccines should be given annually (every year), as skipping a year puts equines at severe risk of this disease.

WNV is regarded as endemic in southern Canada southward through the sub-tropical and tropical countries of the Western Hemisphere. - Mod.TG
