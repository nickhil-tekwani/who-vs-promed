The French Government has admitted it is baffled by the continuing spread
of BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or mad cow disease) in France.
The number of cases is rising and France's agriculture minister has spoken
of a mysterious third way of transmitting the disease.
Until recently, French officials were confidently predicting that BSE would
be eradicated by 2001. And now one of France's senior food safety advisers
said BSE will continue to be a problem until 2010. Marc Savey, the head of
animal health at the French food safety agency, said BSE would remain in
the country for at least another decade.
His prediction follows a steady rise in the number of cases in France this
year, a trend no one has been able to explain.
A few days ago, the agriculture minister, Jean Glavany, suggested there
could be a mysterious third way of BSE transmission other than the 2 known
methods of contaminated feed and mother to calf infection.
One other explanation is France has been lax in applying the ban on using
meat in bone meal in cattle feed, introduced in 1996. According to the
government's chief BSE expert, contaminated feed is still the most likely
source of infection.
