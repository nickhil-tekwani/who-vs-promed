can be expected to occur throughout the virus transmission season,
ProMED-mail will be reporting only newly detected virus and human cases in
the US states and Canadian provinces for the current reporting period.
Those wishing to see the complete summary for virus detection in birds,
mosquitoes, sentinel animals, and equines as well as a breakdown of human
disease cases for 2008 can access that information on the following sites:
