[The 3 outbreaks addressed in the above follow-up report No 1 in Arrabeh, Ajjah and Jabai are all located in the northeastern part of the Jenin governorate, along the Nablus-Jenin road 60. The previous, 1st outbreak within the current event in the PAT, which was reported as an "immediate notification" to the OIE on 20 Jun 2018, was located in Silat-a-Dhahr, similarly in the Jenin governorate (though in contrast with the current event, which affected sheep and goats, it involved cattle). The locations of all 4 not yet serotyped foci in the Jenin governorate can be seen on the OIE summary map of the event at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26989.

It may be assumed that the serotype of the 4 Jun 2018 FMD outbreaks in the PAT are homologous or closely related to the FMDV serotype O, which has been reportedly circulating in northeast Israel since April 2018, genotyped O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15). This assumption is underlined by the recent identification of the said strain in sheep in the Israeli village Baqa al-Gharbiyye, situated on the demarcation line ("green line") separating Israel from the Jenin governorate of PAT's West Bank (map at https://tinyurl.com/yddufa3v). The aerial distance between Baqa al-Gharbiyye and Arabbeh (outbreak No 1 in the follow-up report) is 15 km.

In the past, PAT submitted samples for serology to a regional FMD laboratory.

Israel's most recent follow-up report on the current continuing event dates back to 29 Apr 2018. Several outbreaks are said to have taken place since then, including the current one in Baqa al-Gharbiyye, with west-southwards spread of the virus closer to central Israel; the route of spread could have been through PAT territory.
