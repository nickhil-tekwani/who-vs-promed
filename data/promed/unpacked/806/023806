Disease of wheat a threat to harvest
------------------------------------
Disease has joined drought in threatening the chances of central west
NSW farmers in 2008.

Leaf rust has been found in a wheat sample from Dunedoo, prompting
the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) to call for
action. "This issue should not be taken lightly as it has the
potential to devastate the Australian grains industry," GRDC manager
of crop protection Rohan Rainbow said.

University of Sydney plant pathologist Colin Wellings says growers
should plan for control strategies. "One sample from Marombi wheat at
Dunedoo was infected with leaf rust and a sample of stripe rust was
taken from Tobruk triticale at Young," he said. "This is a notably
early occurrence for rust diseases in commercial fields."

Dr Wellings said a wet summer had contributed to survival of rust
pathogens and, depending on seasonal conditions for crop growth in
2008, he expected rusts would be widespread and potentially damaging.
"Crops now well established from early seeding will need to be
inspected immediately," he said. Foliar fungicides combined with
strategic grazing should be considered, he said, with due attention
paid to withholding periods.

Growers support the Australian Cereal Rust Control Program through
the GRDC. Dr Rainbow said current GRDC-supported trials showed the
use of fungicides at seeding for main season and late-planted wheat
provided early crop protection. "Selection of rust-resistant
varieties, teamed with control of the green bridge of volunteer
plants over summer and strategic fungicide use, are the 3 clear
strategies we need growers to take on board," he said

[Leaf rust, also called brown rust, on wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia recondita_. It reduces the photosynthetic potential of the
plant and can cause serious yield losses of over 40 percent in
individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves,
stems, and later on heads. As the crop ripens, spores are produced.
Infection of the host can occur in as little as 4 hours in favourable
conditions. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and
may appear to "explode" suddenly during favourable weather. It is not
soil-borne and spores are spread by wind and mechanical means.

Wheat stripe rust (also called yellow rust) is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly
in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants, and reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield
losses may vary from 40 up to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some
barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of
grass species. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the
cropping season. Since the fungus interferes with seed development,
infection early in the crop cycle is more damaging than infection
after seed fill has concluded.

Both rust fungi need living tissue to survive between seasons and
cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer wheat, barley,
and certain wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing
inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on
timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars and control
of volunteer wheat plants. Early discovery of infection at any stage
of the crop cycle is important so action can be taken to limit the
spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.

The emergence of new strains of cereal rusts is being monitored in
Australia. Surveys of rust pathotypes in 2003, for example,
identified 6 pathotypes each of stripe and leaf rust as well as 9
pathotypes of wheat stem rust (_P. graminis_).
