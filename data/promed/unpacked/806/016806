A disease that can devastate prairie dog colonies has been confirmed on the Fort Pierre National Grassland in South Dakota. District Ranger Ruben Leal says the bacteria that cause sylvatic plague was found in fleas collected from prairie dog colonies.

Sylvatic plague was first detected in South Dakota in 2004. The disease has been migrating north and west. It also has been detected on the Buffalo Gap National Grasslands, in Badlands National Park, and on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation.

There have not been any confirmed cases of the plague in people in South Dakota.

[There are 2 parts to this comment: 1) comments regarding transmission to domestic animals and 2) issues regarding prairie dogs (_Cynomys_) and the black footed ferret (_Mustela nigripes_).

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in your pet.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.

Sylvatic plague is a bacterial disease of wild rodents that is transmitted by fleas. It can afflict numerous species of mammals, including humans. Prairie dogs are highly susceptible to plague and are the primary food source of the highly endangered black-footed ferret, which is also susceptible to the disease. Sylvatic plague can decimate prairie dog colonies, with mortality rates of 90 percent or more, resulting in local extinctions and population reductions. Because of the susceptibility of prairie dogs to sylvatic plague, coupled with the potentially devastating effect the disease can have on black-footed ferrets, plague control is a vital concern for ferret recovery programs and conservation efforts.

Scientists at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC), in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Wisconsin, state agencies, and other Federal agencies, have tested the feasibility of vaccinating black-footed ferrets and prairie dogs against sylvatic plague infections. The plague vaccine was developed for humans by the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Disease and is being tested for use on animals at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center. Vaccination of ferrets by injection was shown to be highly successful both in the laboratory and in the field. However, injectable vaccines are not practical for field use in free-ranging animals, such as prairie dogs. Ultimately, management of the disease in ferrets will depend on managing the disease in prairie dogs.

Currently, efforts to halt the spread of plague rely on dusting individual prairie dog burrows with pesticides that kill plague-infected fleas, but pesticide application is labor intensive, costly and difficult to sustain over time.

Sylvatic plague vaccine (SPV)
-----------------------------
Immunizing entire populations of free-ranging prairie dogs and other rodents is highly challenging, but preliminary NWHC studies indicate prairie dogs can be successfully immunized by voluntarily eating vaccine-laden baits. These studies suggest that plague in prairie dogs could be managed through oral immunization, which would be especially useful in areas where black-footed ferrets reside and in populations of prairie dogs of conservation concern.

The Sylvatic Plague Vaccine Subcommittee of the Black-footed Ferret Recovery and Implementation Team is acting to coordinate efforts to complete development and delivery of SPV as a management tool to combat plague in grassland ecosystems. Currently, the NWHC is working with USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics to register SPV for use in the field. Field safety trials with SPV are scheduled to begin in summer 2012 in Colorado. Field efficacy studies for free-ranging prairie dog populations are planned to begin in 2013. Ultimately, SPV would be used as a plague management tool to reduce the occurrence of plague outbreaks and thus to enhance ferret recovery and prairie dog conservation in targeted areas.
