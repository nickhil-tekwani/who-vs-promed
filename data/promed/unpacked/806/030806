Cambodia reported 7890 malaria cases in the 1st 4 months of this year [2013], a 54 per cent drop from 17 043 cases over the same period last year [2012], the National Center for Malaria's report showed on Tuesday [28 May 2013].

During the period January-April 2013, the disease killed only 3 people, far fewer than the 24 deaths that occurred in the same period of last year [2012], the report said. Dr Char Meng Chuor, director of the center, attributed the remarkable decline to last year's mosquito net distribution and broad awareness campaigns. He said last year, more than 1 million mosquito nets were given free-of-charge to vulnerable groups of people throughout the country.

"We have achieved good results in the fight against the disease and will continue our efforts to reach the elimination of the death from the disease by 2015 and the complete elimination of the disease by 2025," he told Xinhua [News Agency]

Malaria is a mosquitoborne infectious disease. In Cambodia, the disease is often found in the rainy season and mostly happens in forest and mountainous areas, particularly provinces along the border. Last year [2012], the country recorded 45 553 cases of malaria, killing 45 people, the report said.

[Cambodia has previously reported a reduced susceptibility to artemisinins, the main drugs used for treatment worldwide. It is therefore good news that the distribution of impregnated bed nets has reduced the incidence of malaria, and this may help to reduce the reservoir of parasites with resistance to artemisinins. - Mod.EP
