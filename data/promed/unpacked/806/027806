Avian influenza: 40 000 birds killed
------------------------------------
Despite restrictions imposed on infected holdings, avian influenza is
spreading in North Rhine Westphalia [NRW]. In the Gutersloh region 16
000 laying hens from 3 holdings in Rietberg have to be killed in
addition to 6000 turkeys from a holding in Rheda-Wiedenbruck. Earlier,
20 000 birds from a farm in Rietberg had to be destroyed. Laboratory
tests confirmed that the birds in Ostwestfalen are infected with the
virus. The virus has been confirmed as H7 and is not H5N1, which can
cause severe disease in humans. The Gutersloh and Paderborn districts
have a 72 hours standstill for susceptible birds in place.

The outbreak of avian influenza has caused a row between North Rhine
Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The Minister of Agriculture of Lower
Saxony, Gerd Lindemann, accused the Ministry of NRW of not releasing
the relevant information in due time.

According to Lindemann there have been rumours that avian influenza
was circulating for at least 3 weeks. Because of the delay, 115 000
chickens from the now infected farms had been delivered to 3 holdings
in Lower Saxony. A speaker for the NRW Ministry dismissed the
accusation. Suspicion of avian influenza was only raised on Tuesday
last week [24 May 2011]. "In case Mr Lindemann had earlier information
we are wondering why he didn't contact us immediately."

[Earlier in May 2011, an outbreak of LPAI H7N7 was reported by
neighbouring Netherlands, in Gelderland (see follow-up report 2 at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10630).
It will be interesting to note if the German strain is similar to the
Dutch one with the reservoir to be found in wild waterbirds. -
