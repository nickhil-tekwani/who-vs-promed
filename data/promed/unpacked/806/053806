HPAI H5N1 Virus Infection in Animals: update
---------------------------------------------
1. H5N1 infections in European Union countries
During the first few months of 2006, 13 of the 26 European Union (EU)
countries have already reported confirmed cases of avian influenza H5N1
almost entirely in wild birds. These are Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden
and United Kingdom. All of these are in wild birds apart from France,
Germany, Sweden and Denmark. In Germany, at least 3 cats and one
stone-marten were confirmed infected with the H5N1 strain of avian
influenza last March.
This pulse [rate?] of infection in wild birds in Europe in the early spring
was associated with infected wild birds that travelled west from Russia and
Central Asia. This seems to have passed. There was a steep decline towards
the end of April, but unfortunately, [as] OIE reports, [there is a] first
case of H5 bird flu virus in poultry in Denmark. The virus was found in a
farm in Hundslev, on Fyn Island in the centre of the country. According to
the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DFVA), all the birds have
been destroyed and zones of protection (3 km) and surveillance (10 km) have
been set up around the area where the infected birds were found. A very few
people could have been exposed; however there is no sign of infection in
any of these though they were offered antivirals. Denmark had reported a
number of cases of H5N1 avian flu in wild birds, but this is the first
report of the H5 virus in poultry.
Concern had been expressed that more infections could come north from
Africa. The decline in the reports in Europe is casting doubts on this and
[on] the role that the northward spring migration may play in the arrival
of infected birds to the EU. This will be discussed during a meeting in
Rome next week, organised by FAO, OIE, and their partners. The next period
of vulnerability may be in the autumn and winter as birds move out of the
areas where birds are known to be infected in Russia.
2. H5N1 infections in non-European Union Countries
Countries with wild birds infected with H5N1, with the date of latest
reports to OIE in brackets, are Bulgaria (12 Feb 2006), Croatia (12 Apr)
and Switzerland (16 May).
Affected countries with poultry positive to H5N1, with date of latest
reports to OIE in brackets, include Serbia-Montenegro (15 Mar), Kazakhstan
(21 Mar), Georgia (27 Mar), Israel (4 Apr) Azerbaijan (10 Apr), Albania (12
Apr), Jordan (16 Apr), Turkey (20 Apr) and Romania (16 May).
Romania, after having declared eradicated the disease on 21 Apr 2006,
reported new outbreaks affecting poultry on 16 May in the district of
Brasov, where for the first time in Romania, an industrial farm was
affected. An unspecified amount of poultry meat, already distributed, is
being recalled from the market. Media reports cases in 14 villages, and
nearby districts: one million domestic birds might be culled to avoid the
spread of the disease. Quarantine measures were taken in Bucharest, where
outbreaks were reported in the eastern part of the city. The Romanian
authorities have now asked for assistance and a multidisciplinary team is
being assembled to travel to Romania to assist on both the animal and human
sides. Though some people have been investigated for possible human
infections none have been detected to date (24 May 2006].
In Russia, an outbreak has been reported in a production farm in
Novosibirsk (Western Siberia), for the first time in 2006; though as
specimens are not shared with external laboratories, these infections
cannot be regarded as confirmed. Other outbreaks reported in the Siberian
region have been reported but not confirmed by external laboratories.
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malaysia, India, China, Cambodia, Burma and Vietnam
are among the countries where there have been confirmed infections in the
past but there are no recent reports.
In Indonesia, in the same village of Northern Sumatra where this week 6
human deaths have been confirmed in a single family, 10 of 11 pigs samples
have tested positive for avian influenza according to media reports. These
animals are apparently seropositive to H5 antigen on HI testing but these
results need to be verified. Serology in animals is difficult and even if
positive do not provide information on whether these animals actually
carried the virus or infected people. The latest report to OIE of positive
birds [dates back to] 20 Apr 2006.
In Laos, a duck has been tested positive to H5N1 in a farm located at 20 km
to the South of Vientiane. It is the first isolation after the reports of 2004.
A total of 8 African countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Niger,
Nigeria, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire and Djibouti) have been reporting infections
in poultry to OIE. [re: Djibouti, see further].
For Cote d'Ivoire, confirmation of the OIE reference laboratory in Padua
(Italy) is still awaited. In Nigeria, a new outbreak has been confirmed in
an industrial farm of Kano.
In Djibouti, 3 chickens have been confirmed as H5N1 by the laboratory of
NAMRU in Cairo. [The avian cases in Djibouti have not yet been notified to
the OIE. - Mod.AS]. It is reported that farmers are hampering the process
of culling, because they are not satisfied that they will be compensated
immediately.
It is suspected by some authorities that trade (legal or otherwise) of
infected poultry and poultry products, combined with weak biosecurity and
veterinary infrastructures, rather than wild birds, have been mostly
responsible for either the appearance or at least the spread of the
infection in Africa. This would be a similar picture to the early phases of
the H5N1 epidemics in some South East Asia countries.
