Nova Scotia: Blue Jay Tests West Nile Virus-positive
----------------------------------------------------
Health officials suspect a bird found in Dartmouth is positive for
West Nile virus. "Test results from the Health Canada lab in Winnipeg
indicate this is a presumptive positive case of West Nile Virus,"
said Dr. Maureen Baikie, Associate Medical Officer of Health for the
province. "A presumptive positive result means we need a further test
to confirm if the bird is infected with West Nile Virus."
The blue jay was collected as part of the ongoing provincial
surveillance program for the virus. "The public should not be alarmed
by this news," said Dr. Baikie. "We have said we would not be
surprised to see the virus here at some point, and given the activity
across the rest of Canada and the Northeastern United States, it was
reasonable to assume that we would see West Nile Virus someday."

The risk of illness for any individual remains low. New populations
of mosquitoes are less likely to be infected at this time of year.
