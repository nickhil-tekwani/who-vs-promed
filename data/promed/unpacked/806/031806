A gas leak at a steel parts factory in eastern China has killed 10 people and left 7 others hospitalized with poisoning.

The Zouping County government said the leak at the Shandong Fukai Stainless Steel Company occurred at around 5:50 p.m. on Saturday [28 Nov 2015] and poisoned 17 people. Five of the victims died immediately, and 5 more died early Sunday [29 Nov 2015]. The other 7 remain in the hospital in stable condition.

The cause of the leak is under investigation. Satellite images show the factory next to warehouses and low-rise residential homes in a village about 60 km (40 miles) east of Jinan, the Shandong provincial capital.

According to local reports [link in Chinese], the municipal government set up an emergency meeting on Monday [30 Nov 2015] morning with 78 of the city's gas and energy companies to get them to be more vigilant against similar occurrences.

The deadly leak is the latest industrial accident in China, where authorities are under pressure to improve work safety after a huge chemical blast in Tianjin killed at least 140 people and left a swath of the port city in smoldering ruins.

[Welding requires and produces a number of gasses. However, this article mentions "a gas leak," perhaps implying that it was not a gas produced in the welding process. This event could have been caused by natural gas for heating the welding facility. Workers may have not noticed a smell, assuming that the natural gas is treated to produce a smell for the purposes of sensing leaks. Either natural gas or fumes produced during the process of welding could potentially have terrible consequences.

We do not know whether the workers had any type of respiratory protection or whether there was any gas extraction apparatus in the welding plant.

Without more information, it is difficult to know to which gas or gasses the workers may have succumbed. - Mod.TG
