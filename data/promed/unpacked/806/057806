A human rabies case has been confirmed in Vacas municipality, Arani
province, in the Cochabamba Alto Valle, which led the health
authorities to declare a red alert.

Just in Punata daily, 3-5 cases of dog bites are registered, obliging
the health and zoonoses authorities of the local municipal government
to initiate a campaign to capture stray dogs.

A Punata councilwoman, Silvia Jardin, confirmed this extreme measure
and is preparing this Sunday [21 Aug 2011] to join the massive
national vaccination campaign against this fatal disease. "We received
the bad news that a dog bite to an older person has tested positive
[for rabies virus transmission], so far confirmed by laboratory tests.
Vacas is a neighboring municipality of Arani and Punata, which obliges
us to take precautions and declare a health emergency and red alert in
the entire Alto Valle, where it is estimated that there are 100 000
dogs," she said.

Jardin announced that, starting with the confirmation of this positive
rabies case, aggressive campaigns will be initiated in Punata and the
Alto Valle municipalities by means of courses, seminars and prevention
workshops for protection against lethal human rabies.

[Vaccination of dogs will prove much more effective than attempts to
eliminate stray dogs, which may elicit aggression between those that
remain as they establish new territories, leading to the risk of more
rabies transmission.
