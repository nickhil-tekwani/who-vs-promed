It does not indicate if the case is connected to the one in the Lake
Victoria but here there is an indication of pesticide contamination.

At least 33 people have died in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo
Delgado since mid-September as a result of acute diarrhoea and vomiting
caused by the consumption of fish contaminated with pesticides. Statistics
provided by the provincial health directorate showed a further 327 people,
suffering from symptoms of the same poisoning, have been treated in the
provinces' health units. Laboratory tests have proved the pesticide
contamination.
According to health officials, fishermen increased their catches by using
pesticides in the fishing grounds. This resulted in the death of huge
numbers of fish: more than the fishermen could carry away. Other people
came along and picked up the dead fish, regarding them as a free meal. They
ate them or, in some cases, sold them.
This chemical poisoning has occurred at several points along the Cabo
Delgado coast. There are fears that the death toll could be considerably
higher, since some victims will not have been able to reach any hospital or
health post.
The health authorities are urging citizens not to purchase or consume any
fish that may have come from the contaminated waters. The health ministry
has alerted the authorities in the neighbouring provinces to exercise
strict control over trade in fish from Cabo Delgado. Deputy National Health
Director Avertino Barreto said that criminal investigations are now under
way to identify and bring to justice those responsible for the poisoning.

[The coincidence with the poisoning in Lake Victoria would hint at a
widespread East African problem. Similar cases may well be occurring in SE
Tanzania, e.g., Lind, or even in the northern waters of Lake Malawi, and in
Lakes Tanganijika and Rukwa. Does anyone know which pesticides are involved
outside the Lake Victoria region? Additional damage is being done in fresh
waters by it preferentially affecting tilapia and sparing Nile perch, an
ecologically expensive fish. Also this Mozambique report quotes "fishing
grounds", typically a marine term, so apparently we now have coastal
damage. - Mod.MHJ
