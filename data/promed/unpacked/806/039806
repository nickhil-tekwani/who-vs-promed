Re: Undiagnosed deaths, camels - Saudi Arabia: RFI
-----------------------------------------------------
I read this report and I wondered has anyone being spraying against
locust hoppers in the area where this fodder came from? Those
anti-locust sprays are very toxic for camels and other livestock who
eat forage, etc., that has been sprayed accidentally or otherwise.
Much of the spraying for locusts is done by spray planes so all types
of vegetation get sprayed.
Many camels lost their lives in Mauritania through anti-locust spraying.

[Many sprays for locust are likely organophosphate-based. As the
article does not tell us of clinical signs, nor what toxicology
testing was (hopefully) done, we are left to guess. Since locust on
the fodder can be a problem in the region, it is entirely possible
that this may be the cause for the animals' demise.
Camels have very efficient water retaining capability through
specialized kidneys. As such, any toxin may be concentrated more than
is anticipated in the camel's system. This would apply to
aflatoxicosis or any chemical which may be eliminated through the
kidneys.
It is difficult to know what toxin or disease may be affecting the
animals when there is so little information provided. - Mod.TG]
