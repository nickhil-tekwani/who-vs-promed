A Reply From Drs. Johan Neyts, Robert Snoeck and Erik De Clercq
---------------------------------------------------------------
[The following comments have been received from Drs. Neyts, Snoeck and De
Clercq regarding the ProMED-mail post "Smallpox, cidofovir activity (02)"
posted on Frid 30 23 Aug 2002].
Our brief review on the activity of cidofovir was a reply to a ProMED
message (Smallpox Vaccine Hazards 20020817.0580) in which concern was raised
about the possible complications of vaccination with vaccinia against
smallpox. From that particular message it appeared as if the status of
cidofovir was at the present time nothing more than that of a compound that
is active against "mousepox," and that no clinical efficacy of this compound
had ever been shown in the treatment of viral infections in man.
We do not claim that cidofovir is an established therapeutic modality for
the treatment of complications of vaccination with vaccinia (or for the
treatment of monkeypox or smallpox). The reality, however, is that cidofovir
is currently the only drug that has shown very good activity against
infections by poxviruses in man. There is currently (with the exception of
the vaccinia immunoglobulin, which may not be all that effective) no
treatment available to treat severe and often lethal complications of
smallpox vaccination in the immunodeficient host.
Cidofovir is indeed nephrotoxic, but this toxicity is manageable [as it is,
for example, in children following long-term (8-month) treatment (Hoffman et
al. 2001)]. Instructions on how to avoid nephrotoxicity have been formulated
and the compound has been used since it was licensed in 1996 in many
patients. We believe that it may be preferable -- in particular when
vaccinia immunoglobulin would not be very effective -- to treat a patient
with a drug such as cidofovir (that indeed requires good hydration,
combination therapy with probenicid, and monitoring of renal functions)
rather than to allow the vaccinia infection to progress and to result in a
possible lethal outcome. Given the pharmacokinetics of cidofovir, treatment
of complications from vaccination may not require more than one or 2
infusions. When given according to the recommendation for intravenous use of
cidofovir, this should not result in nephrotoxicity.
So far cidofovir has been used successfully in the clinical setting for the
treatment of infections with viruses as diverse as herpes simplex virus
(type 1 and type 2, wild type and drug-resistant), varicella-zoster virus
(wild type and drug-resistant), Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus,
adenovirus, papillomavirus, polyomavirus, and, as already mentioned in our
message (20020823.5116) molluscum contagiosum and ecthyma infectiosum (orf).
A concern of Dr. Henderson is that cidofovir may not be active against
already established infections with poxviruses. As long as there are no
patients with complications of vaccinia or patients with smallpox (and
hopefully the situation will not change) we will of course not know. There
is however a large amount of evidence (i) from animal models that the
compound is effective when treatment is initiated several days after
infection and also (ii) that the compound is effective against established
infections with other poxvirus infections (molluscum contagiosum and orf) in
patients.
Animal studies
---------------
1. In the first report on the vivo activity of cidofovir against poxvirus
infections [Neyts J, De Clercq E. Efficacy of
(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine for the treatment of
lethal vaccinia virus infections in severe combined immune deficiency (SCID)
mice. J Med Virol. 1993 Nov;41(3):242-6.], cidofovir caused a very marked
(and significant) delay in vaccinia virus-induced mortality in SCID mice
when treatment was first initiated at day 2, 4, or 6 post infection
[untreated animals died already at 12 days post infection]. At the time that
treatment was initiated a high virus titer was already detected in several
organs (lungs, kidney, liver, and brain) of untreated animals.
2. In a study by Smee and Sidwell [Smee DF, Bailey KW, Wong M, Sidwell RW.
Intranasal treatment of cowpox virus respiratory infections in mice with
cidofovir. Antiviral Res. 2000 Sep;47(3):171-7.] a single treatment with
cidofovir at day 2 post infection resulted in 95 percent protection, start
of treatment at day 3 post infection in 85 percent protection, and start of
treatment at day 4 post infection in 60 percent survival, when a single dose
of 40 mg/kg was given. In a more recent study by Smee [Smee DF, Sidwell RW,
Kefauver D, Bray M, Huggins JW. Characterization of wild-type and
cidofovir-resistant strains of camelpox,cowpox, monkeypox, and vaccinia
viruses. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2002 May;46(5):1329-35.] a single
treatment given as late as 4 days after infection proved 80 percent
protective. (3) In a study by Bray and Huggins [Bray M, Martinez M, Smee DF,
Kefauver D, Thompson E, Huggins JW. Cidofovir protects mice against lethal
aerosol or intranasal cowpox virus challenge. J Infect Dis. 2000 Jan; 181
(1):10-9.] one inoculation of 100 mg/kg cidofovir given on day 0, 2, or 4,
with respect to aerosol infection with cowpox, resulted in 90-100 percent
survival. The compound was also shown to be prophylactic. One inoculation of
100 mg/kg on day -6 to -2 protected 80-100 percent of the infected animals;
one inoculation on day -16 to -8 was partially protective.
Human studies
---------------
Dr. D.A. Henderson is correct that there are, as yet, no published data that
demonstrate that cidofovir is, or would be, effective in treating a
cutaneous vaccinial infection. To the best of our knowledge, no patient has
indeed ever been treated for this condition. The reason for this is that
since the time that cidofovir has been licensed, very few people have been
vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine.
Cidofovir is very effective (given intravenously or topically) in the
treatment of patients with severe established molluscum contagiosum. Many
patients have now been treated (including children), and the results are
often spectacular. Cidofovir was also very effective in the treatment of an
orf (sheep pox) lesion in an immunodeficient patient (in this case the
compound was given topically). We have recently seen a second case (patient
of Dr. R. Snoeck) of an even more severe orf. This lesion disappeared
completely following treatment with cidovir. These lesions are thus
established infections with a poxvirus in the skin of patients that all
responded very well to cidofovir. The fact that vaccinia is in cell culture,
and in animal models, very much susceptible to cidofovir, taken together
with these clinical data, in our opinion, constitutes evidence that
cidofovir may also be effective in the treatment of other poxvirus
infections in man such as complications of vaccination.
Another concern has been the predictive value of mouse studies. We agree
that it is of the utmost importance to evaluate further the efficacy of
cidofovir in the treatment of several poxvirus infections in other animal
models (monkeys, cows, rabbits.). Cidofovir would, however, never have been
tried, and found to be effective, in the treatment of molluscum and orf in
patients if activity in mice had not been demonstrated. The activity of
cidofovir in the mouse models was thus certainly predictive of the efficacy
of the compound in humans against molluscum and orf.
Given
(i) the efficacy of cidofovir against vaccinia (and other poxvirus
infections) in animal models and
(ii) the proven efficacy of cidofovir against other poxviruses (molluscum
and orf) in man, under conditions where no prohibitive toxic side effects
were observed (also following intravenous administration of the compound),
(iii) and the fact that the nephrotoxicity of cidofovir is very well
manageable (even in children following long-term therapy);
it may be advisable to consider the use of cidofovir in the treatment of
patients with complications of smallpox vaccination, should these occur.

correspondents listed above.
The bottom line is that cidofovir, in its present formulation, may be useful
in certain cases where the patient can be monitored over a prolonged period
for renal complications, but is impractical in epidemic situations for those
same reasons. We look forward to the development of a safer, oral
formulation. This thread is now closed. - Mod.JW]
