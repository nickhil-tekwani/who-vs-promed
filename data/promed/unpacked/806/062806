On 13 Sept [2004], after passage of the recommended time necessary to
conduct follow-up serology [convalescent], blood was collected in order to
verify seroconversion to IBR and to diagnose vesicular diseases in the
animals involved in the initial suspected [outbreak] of vesicular diseases
in the District of Villa Ygatimi, Department of Canindeyu, reported by the
Official Veterinary Service.
The results of the serology conducted are presented below, confirming that
the outbreak was not due to FMD, but was due to IBR [infectious bovine
rhinotracheitis].
The specimens from esophagopharyngeal secretions for Probang testing
resulted negative in 3 passages in BHK cells. The technique used for the
diagnosis was indirect Sandwich ELISA.
With respect to the suspected vesicular disease announced in the District
of Capiibary, the diagnostics conducted for vesicular diseases were
negative for FMD. Nevertheless, the Service is currently in the process of
following up the suspected cases, in order to conduct testing on
convalescent blood in approximately 20 days in order to confirm the initial
results. Similarly, on 27 Sep 2004 esophagopharyngeal secretions from the
animals suspected to have vesicular disease from to 2 properties whose
animals presented with lesions compatible with vesicular disease, will be
processed.
It is necessary to point out that the Service had from the outset
communicated the suspicions of vesicular disease to all pertinent reference
organisms and adopted appropriate measures in the field to handle the
health situation.

involved have been previously vaccinated against FMD. - Mod.PC]
