----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of individuals involved in this die-off indicates that it is unlikely to involve a wild population, and could involve a disease outbreak associated with the dumping of carcasses from a captive breeding farm ["fur farm"], or an outbreak from a recent mass escape. This species is farmed commercially for it's fur in China, Russia, and some other countries.

Raccoon dogs are non-gregarious territorial canids with exclusive home ranges in the wild, so a natural aggregation even at a favored regional "garbage dump" feeding area of the size reported in the media article that Dan found seems unlikely given that population densities of 0.37 and 2.0 individuals per square kilometer are reported for wild populations in Europe (Kauhala & Kowalczyk, 2011).

Raccoon dogs are apparently susceptible to high mortality from canine distemper (Macida et al 1993), which could conceivably cause catastrophic mortality in an outbreak associated with a fur-farm type environment.
