Health officials in St Catherine have identified 2 additional cases
of malaria in the Ferry community, which borders St Catherine and St Andrew.

A source at the St Catherine Health department told our news centre
that the cases were discovered Thursday [18 Sep 2008] during a visit
to the area by health workers.

The 2 new cases bring to 3 the number of persons from the area to
have contracted the disease in recent weeks.

It is reported that as a result of the discovery, health officials
have taken blood samples from relatives of the affected persons and
have sent them to the national laboratory for analysis.

Since RJR news broke the story of the initial case of malaria last
Thursday [11 Sep 2008], the Health Department has drastically
intensified its vector control programme in the community.

[There are now 3 cases of malaria identified in St. Catherine parish,
Jamaica. Last year (2007), there was a significant outbreak of
malaria documented in Kingston (see prior postings listed below). One
can't help but wonder whether there has been low level local
transmission since last years' outbreak to explain this new
geographic cluster of cases or whether this represents another
importation with transmission locally following the initial imported case.

St Catherine is the next parish to the West of Kingston (see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/jamaica_pol_2002.jpg>).

More information on the findings of an investigation, including
speciation of the organism involved, would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
