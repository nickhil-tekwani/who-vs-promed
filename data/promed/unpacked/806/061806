POLIO - MEXICO (3)
==================
Concerning the query about polio in Mexico:
The last confirmed case of paralysis due to wild poliovirus in
Mexico had onset on 18 October 1990 in Jalisco state. Type 3 wild
poliovirus was isolated from a stool specimen obtained from
this patient.
The last confirmed case of polio in the American region had
paralysis onset on 23 August 1991 in Peru.
In September 1994 after carefully evaluating regional acute flaccid
paralysis and wild poliovirus surveillance data, the International
Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication declared
that wild poliovirus had been eradicated from the Region of the Americas.
Please let me know if you need any further information.
