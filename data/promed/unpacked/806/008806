[1] Cholera - Congo (Pointe-Noire Department)

A cholera epidemic, plaguing Congo's commercial city of Pointe-Noire [Pointe-Noire Department] since November 2012, has killed 16 people out of the 1054 cases recorded, according to a report issued by health officials here Thursday [13 Jun 2013].

The report calls for a new reinforced plan to respond to the scourge with a focus on resources mobilization advocacy, the identification of all heath and social communities, sanitation, the reinforcement of the warning mechanism and the medical treatment.

Cholera hit Pointe-Noire following the 17-18 Nov 2012 torrential rains which claimed the lives of scores of people and caused heavy material damage, leaving many others homeless. Their return to their infected houses triggered the resurgence of diarrhea and other waterborne diseases.

Pointe-Noire is a poorly sanitized city with people using unsafe water and eating unhealthy food.

[2] Diarrhea, fatal - South Africa (Northern Cape Province)
Date: Mon 3 Jun 2013

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that an outbreak of diarrhea, which started 2 weeks ago, has killed 5 children so far in Upington town in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. NAN also reports that the number of patients that have been treated at Gordinia Hospital has risen to 450. Medical authorities in the province said that the epidemic is the worst in 30 years.

Dr Mark Atkins, Northern Cape Paediatric surgeon, said that they are trying to establish the cause of the epidemic. "We basically see a large number of children coming in for treatment daily and we treat them for what we diagnose from the laboratory. "We treat the symptoms and we are sending in all the necessary samples to the laboratory to try and establish what is causing the diarrhea," Atkins said.

He said the National Health Department has intensified its search for the source of the diarrhea outbreak. "We are still waiting for the results of water and stool samples that have been sent to the University of Pretoria for laboratory test." He urged the residents of the area to take precautionary measures to prevent the disease from spreading.

At least 151 people have been admitted to Durban hospitals in the past 3 months suffering from diarrhea, resulting in the deaths of 2 children. The deputy head of eThekwini metro's communicable disease service, Dr Ayo Olowolagba, said in a statement that most of those treated were children, half of whom came from Durban's Inanda area. Other reported cases were in Amaoti, Ntuzuma, Mayville, and KwaMashu [all in KwaZulu-Natal Province].

He said the city was trying to identify the cause, while at the same time educating local populations on hygiene. An eThekwini metro spokesman said he could not immediately confirm when the 2 deaths had taken place.

[4] Cholera - Nepal (Banke District)

An outbreak of a disease symptomatic of cholera has affected local residents of Nepalgunj [Banke District] and the town's adjoining areas, downing more than 200 people as of Sunday [2 Jun 2013].

Ram Bahadur Chand of the Banke Distric Public Health Office (DPHO) said they were waiting for a lab report from the National Public Health Laboratory to confirm the disease. "We suspect that polluted drinking water may be the primary cause for the disease but we are not quite sure if it is cholera," Chand said.

The cholera-like disease has mostly affected the residents of 6 wards in Nepalgunj. It has also been reported in Fattepur and Indrapur VDCs. As of Sunday [2 Jun 2013], the Bheri Zonal Hospital received 290 patients suffering with the disease, said Dr Sarwesraj Sharma.

A cholera epidemic 3 years ago in Nepalgunj afflicted more than 1500 people and claimed 8 lives.

[5] Diarrhea, Syrian refugee camp - Jordan (Mafraq Governorate)

The Za'atari camp for Syrian refugees has witnessed a sharp increase in cases of epidemic diarrhea and gastrointenstinal infection symptoms among registered refugees in the past weeks, a health official said. The infection cases reached unprecedented numbers as hundreds of cases are being treated at local health clinics and hospitals near the camp in Mafraq [Mafraq Governorate], in north eastern Jordan.

The diarrhea and gastrointenstinal infections may be caused by consumption of polluted water and poor sanitary conditions in the camp that are exacerbated particularly in hot weather conditions in the summer.

Ministry of Health director of health care Dr Bassam Hijjawi warned of the dangers of the spread of the infections among refugees particularly in the summer, and called for more intensive health monitoring measures in the camp.

Hijjawi told Ammon News that hundreds of cases of infection are being registered every month of refugees suffering from the symptoms. On the causes of the infection, Hijjawi noted the crowded conditions in the camp, possible spoiled foods, and lack of health monitoring by international health agencies contribute to the spread of the illness.

[Camps of internally or externally displaced people from civil wars and natural disasters are prime breeding grounds for illnesses, particularly gastrointestinal ones due to overcrowding, poor nutrition and the lack of both potable water and adequate sanitation.
