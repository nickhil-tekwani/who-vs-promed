Passengers on board Southwest flight 730 from Tampa to Milwaukee
describe a scary scene while flying home from Florida. Some
passengers couldn't breathe, others had flu like symptoms. There was
one nurse on board who told Today's TMJ4 that she tried to help
mid-flight. "The stewardess came on and asked was there a nurse or a
doctor on the plane. And I'm a nurse, so I raised my hand," Terry
Zeuske said. Zeuske didn't have any medical tools or medicine, but
did what she could to help after several people got sick mid flight.
She said one was: "Blue around the lips; his fingertips were blue. He
said he was having trouble breathing. So we got oxygen and put that
on him," Zeuske said. "And while I was doing that, they wanted me to
go to someone else who was kind of having the same symptoms."

Elizabeth Orr-Bell wore a surgical mask on the plane to stay safe.
She and a group of friends went on a cruise from Tampa to Cozumel,
Mexico. One of her friends got very sick after spending time on the
beach in Cozumel. "He was running a high fever and was dehydrated. So
we took him down to the ship doctor; they ran some tests on him, gave
him some antibiotics, and once we boarded the plane, he wasn't
breathing too well," Orr-Bell said.

Ambulances, the haz-mat team, and the Milwaukee Health Department
were waiting when the plane landed. Two of the sickest passengers,
including Orr-Bell's friend, were taken by ambulance to the hospital.
The other passengers were quarantined in the International Arrivals
Terminal while health officials investigated. Southwest said the
plane was sterilized and is back in use.

About a dozen passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight from Tampa to
Milwaukee were complaining of flu-like symptoms Monday [7 Feb 2011]
afternoon, according to an airline spokesman.

Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said 2 of the sick passengers
requested oxygen on the flight. The plane's captain declared a
medical emergency, and Mitchell air traffic controllers sent the
flight to an international gate.

Two of the passengers were taken to area hospitals, and the other ill
passengers did not require medical attention, Hawkins said.

The Southwest flight landed at 4:45 p.m. A bystander reported that
there were at least a dozen ambulances at the airport at 5 p.m. The
Milwaukee Fire Department hazardous materials team responded, and the
Health Department was notified, airport spokesman Ryan McAdams said.

[The correspondent has offered the following diagnosis: "I suspect
burning hydraulic fluid, brake fluid or over-heating of insulation..."

It is difficult to asses whether the illnesses of some passengers are
coincidental occurrences or whether there is a common factor. Further
information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
