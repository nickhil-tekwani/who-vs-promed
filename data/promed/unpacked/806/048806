A Centre for Health Protection (CHP) spokesman said that CHP's
sentinel surveillance networks detected a mild increase of
influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community. During the week ending
26 Jan 2008, consultation rates for ILI in private doctors and GOPC
[General Out=Patient Clinics] were 50.7 and 3.8 per 1000 consultations
respectively, as compared with 44.5 and 3.7 in the previous week. He
added that laboratory surveillance found an increasing number of
influenza virus detections recently; 42 influenza viruses were
isolated in the week ending 26 Jan 2008 as compared with fewer than 20
detections in mid December 2007.

With reference to a report that a proportion of A/H1N1 flu viruses in
circulation this winter [2007-2008] in Europe were resistant to the
antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu), the spokesman said the Public
Health Laboratory Centre has been monitoring the local situation
closely and recently detected 4 such viruses out of 45 isolates
tested in January 2008. He said there had been no indication from
overseas authorities so far that these oseltamivir-resistant viruses
were associated with more severe illness. These viruses are sensitive
to other antiviral drugs against influenza [the other
anti-neuraminidase drug zanamivir (Relenza), and the adamantadines -
Mod.CP]. CHP will continue to monitor H1N1 viruses for oseltamivir
resistance.

He called on members of the public to be vigilant against influenza.
"Members of the public who were at higher risk of complications from
influenza should be vaccinated against influenza if they have not
already done so. The vaccine for seasonal influenza being used in
Hong Kong also provides protection against the oseltamivir-resistant
A(H1N1) viruses. Those who are eligible for free influenza
vaccination under the Government Influenza Vaccination Program (GIVP)
can visit appropriate venues promulgated by the Government," he noted.

DH has ordered a total of 300 000 doses of influenza vaccines for the
2007-08 GIVP, of which, about 268 000 had been administered to the
eligible target groups since the programme started on 5 Nov 2007. To
prevent influenza and other respiratory tract infections, the public
is advised to adopt a healthy lifestyle and adhere to the following
health advice:

* To build up good body immunity by having a proper diet, regular
exercise and adequate rest, reducing stress and avoiding smoking;

* To maintain good personal hygiene, and wash hands after sneezing
[or] coughing, and wear a mask when developing symptoms of respiratory
infections;

* To maintain good ventilation [in enclosed places]; and

* To avoid visiting crowded places with poor ventilation, especially
during peak flu season.

Members of the public, particularly children, elderly people and
those with chronic diseases, should wear face masks and consult their
doctors for medical advice promptly if they develop symptoms of
respiratory tract infection. More information on the preventive
measures can be found in CHP's website at

[Oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 influenza viruses have been reported
from several European countries, Canada, the USA, and now China (Hong
Kong S.A.R.), in fact, everywhere surveillance has been carried out,
except in the case of Japan. The presence of oseltamivir-resistant
viruses circulating in several European countries (Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and United
Kingdom) is in marked contrast to the previous winter seasons of
2004/2005, 2005/2006, and 2006/2007, when oseltamivir resistance was
detected in less than 1 per cent of circulating strains from 24 countries.

To date, oseltamivir-resistant viruses have been detected in 9
European countries; in particular, 26 of 37 (70 per cent) in Norway,
15 of 87 (17 per cent) in France, 3 of 43 (7.0 per cent) in Germany
and 8 of 162 (5 per cent) in the United Kingdom. These resistant
viruses carry the same mutation, causing the substitution of histidine
by tyrosine at residue 274 (H274Y) of the neuraminidase protein. In
North America the frequency of isolation so far has been 6.25 per cent
in Canada and 5 per cent in the USA, similar to that currently being
detected in the Hong Kong S.A.R.

The frequency of oseltamivir resistance in H1N1 viruses in the
current influenza season is unexpected, and the reason why a higher
percentage of these viruses are resistant is currently unknown. -
