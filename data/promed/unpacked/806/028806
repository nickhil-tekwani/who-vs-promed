The Center of [Sanitary-Epidemiology? surveillance of the Orenburg
province (oblast) has registered 124 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) this year in the province. For the same period of 1999
there were only 4 cases registered. Local epidemiologists explain this
year's outbreak [as due to a sharp increase (by reasons unknown) of wild
rodents, which are the main carrier of the HFRS. [This occurs every four
or so years and 2000 is such a year. According to specialists, the disease
will break out seriously in the nearest future. At present the most of
patients are from the Severnyi, Matveevsk, Tyulgansk and Buguruslansk
regions of the province.

[Undoubtedly such changes in rodent population densities are the result of
ecologic differences from year to year. Analysis of precipitation,
temperature, habitat alterations, and the effects of human activities could
provide some enlightenment, and the accumulated data perhaps could be used
to provide warning signs. - Mod.CHC
