I appreciated your comments in reference to the apparent outbreak of
norovirus infection aboard the RCCL ship Freedom-of-the-Seas [see
ProMED-mail post: Norovirus, cruise ship - Caribbean (02)
20061204.3419]. I think it should be underscored that due to the
voluntary CDC/industry "regulation" and inspection program, all
diarrheal diseases are the subject of significant surveillance on
cruise ships, unlike any land-based facilities or institution. In
fact the Master of the Vessel (Captain) must report to the CDC if 2
percent of the passengers or 2 percent of the crew experience GI
symptoms [13.4.1 Vessel Satiation Program Operations Manual, August
2005]. Once a report is received, the CDC will decide if and how to
investigate.
If we applied the same surveillance criteria to resorts or
institutions such as schools, colleges and universities, or health
care facilities I am certain that significant morbidity would be
reported. I agree that the cruise industry is doing a stellar job in
preventing and containing cases and cluster of disease, which are
truly community based, and spill over and can be amplified on a
cruise ship or other institutional setting. In general, the cruise
ship environment is the cleanest facilities that the public will
encounter. Personally, I am more concerned about food and ice
handling on the airplane on the way to the cruise, that any public
health issue on the cruise itself.

The following is a chronology extracted from the Gideon Database
(<http://www.GideonOnline.com>) of significant outbreaks of viral
gastroenteritis reported aboard ships. Approximately 60 such
episodes, involving 10 000 to 11 000 passengers, have been reported.
[Primary references are available from Professor Berger on request].
Unless otherwise indicated, outbreaks affected ships embarking from
the United States.
1986 - Outbreaks (392 passengers and 30 crew -- in 2 outbreaks) were
reported during 2 one-week Caribbean ship cruises -- Norwalk virus
presumed and source not established.
1986 - An outbreak (119 cases) of SRSV (probably norovirus) infection
was reported aboard a British cruise ship.
1994 (publication year) - An outbreak (217 cases) of Norwalk virus
infection aboard a cruise ship in Hawaii was traced to contaminated ice.
1995 (publication year) - An outbreak (585 cases, approximate) was
reported aboard an aircraft carrier.
1997 - An outbreak (450 cases reported; true number estimated at
1806) of probable [norovirus] infection occurred on an American
aircraft carrier off the coast of Japan in 1997 - source unknown.
1999 - Outbreaks (587 cases total - 162 + 425 cases) were reported
among military ships following port visits in Southeast Asia.
2001 - A total of seven outbreaks were reported on U.S. cruise ships.
2002 - Outbreaks (2098 cases in 24 outbreaks) affecting 18 ships were
reported. These figures included a Disney cruise ship in Florida (2
outbreaks encompassing approximately 185 cases). Other sources
reported 29 shipboard outbreaks of diarrhea during 2002.
2002 - An outbreak (300 cases) was reported aboard an aircraft carrier.
2002 - An outbreak (250 or more cases) of norovirus infection
affected over 250 passengers on a cruise ship in Alaska -- source
unknown. A 2nd outbreak (218 cases) occurred on the same cruise ship
two weeks later; and a 3rd outbreak (183 cases) the following month.
2003 - An outbreak (247 cases) was reported on a cruise ship from Los
Angeles to Hawaii.
2003 - An outbreak (150 cases) was reported on a cruise ship in New Orleans.
2003 - An outbreak (500 or more cases) of norovirus infection was
reported aboard a British cruise ship to the Mediterranean.
2003 - An outbreak (340 cases) was reported on a north Atlantic cruise ship.
2003 - An outbreak (300 cases) of norovirus infection was reported
aboard a Danish cruise ship.
2004 - An outbreak (39 cases) of suspected norovirus infection was
reported on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.

was reported among passengers on a cruise ship from Seattle,
Washington to Alaska.
