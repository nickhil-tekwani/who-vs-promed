Measles outbreak in a holiday camp at Faye d'Anjou (49) - July 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
On 14 Aug 2008 a general practitioner in St-Malo reported to the
DDASS [Direction departementale des Affaires sanitaires et sociales]
d' Ille-et-Vilaine four cases of measles in the same family belonging
to another Department. Preliminary investigations by DDASS 35 [DDASS
d' Ille-et-Vilaine], established that one child of this family had
attended a holiday camp.

This camp was organised at Faye d' Anjou (49) [Department
Maine-et-Loire] between 12 and 21 Jul 2008 and attended by 66
participants (53 children and 13 supervisors) belonging to 39
families from 17 Departments of France. When contacted the organisers
of the camp revealed that 2 other children had been ill (with a
generalised rash) during the camp.

The families of these 2 children when contacted by DDASS 35 also
reported illness among siblings with clinical signs of measles
following the return of their sick children from the camp.

On 20 Aug 208 following a conference call between the DDASS and other
relevant organisations an investigation into the measles cases
associated with the outbreak at the camp in Faye d' Anjou was
initiated. The objectives of this investigation were 1st to determine
the rate of transmission of measles virus among those attending the
holiday camp; and 2nd to establish the extent of the spread of the
infection in the families of the children attending the camp.

Method of the investigation
---------------------------
A list of the participants (children and supervisors) was obtained
from the organisers of the holiday camp. A questionnaire and a
covering letter explaining the purpose of the investigation were sent
to all the families involved. In the case of families with
unvaccinated children additional enquiries were conducted to
establish the reason for the absence of vaccination.

Preliminary Results
-------------------
A total of 39 implicated families were identified from the
information supplied by the camp organisers. At the present time 29
of these 39 families have completed questionaires, involving a total
of 191 persons. These 191 persons include 49 who attended the camp
(36 children and and 13 supervisors) and 142 of their family members
including 87 children and 55 parents. Altogether 51 cases of measles
were diagnosed: 17 cases among camp participants and 34 cases in
their families.

The camp participants
---------------------
Average age of the children attending the camp was 10 years (7 to 13
years of age). Average age of the supervisors was 23 years (15 to 47
years). Measles vaccination coverage was 49 percent (24/49): 18 with
2 doses, 3 with a single dose and 3 for which the number of doses of
vaccine was unknown. 5 participants had contracted measles
previously. Among the 49 camp participants, there were 17 cases of
measles (16 children and a supervisor). 10 were male (sex ratio M/F =
1.4). The cases involved 9 Departments of France. The main clinical
signs were generalised rash (100 percent), fever (38 degrees or above
- 100 percent), conjunctivitis (81 percent), rhinorrhea (81 percent)
and cough (94 percent). One hospitalisation was required, and 4 cases
were not serious enough to require medical attention.

Table of Attack rate
--------------------
Category / Number / Cases of measles / Attack rate

Vaccinated / 24 / 0 / 0 percent
Unvaccinated / 23 / 16 / 69 percent
Unknown status / 2 / 1 / 50 percent
History of measles / 5 / 0 / 0 percent
Unknown history / 21 / 15 / 71 percent
Total / 49 / 17

The date of detection of the 1st case was 14 Jul 2008 and the last
case was observed on 7 Aug 2008. 3 cases occurred during the course
of the camp (on 14, 18 and 19 Jul 2008) and had been exposed
previously in their families. The remaining 14 cases developed
subsequent to the camp. [In the original text this information is
displayed graphically. The reader can access this figure via the URL

The participants families
-------------------------
The average age of the children of the families of the camp
paricipants is 12 years (1 to 47 years of age). These families
comprised 111 individuals with an average of 5 children per family
(minimum one, maximumum 9). Difficulties were encountered in
establishing the vaccinatuon status of some family members and the
disease history of the parents.

Altogether, 51 cases of measles occurred in 13 families. 16 families
had no cases. The vaccine coverage of the children was 48 percent: 86
percent in the families without a previous case (48/56) and 22
percent in the families with at least one case of measles previously
(18/80). There were 16 cases that had not consulted a doctor (34 percent).

Table of attack rate
---------------------
Category / Numer / cases of measles / attack rate

Vaccinated / 66 / 0 / 0 percent
Unvaccinated / 62 / 44 / 72 percent
Unknown status / 8 / 7 / 100 percent
History of measles / 8 / 0 / 0 percent
Unknown history / 62 / 51 / 82 percent
Total / 136 / 51

The time course of the measles epidemic in the families of the camp
participants is illustrated graphically in the original text,
together with a figure illustrating the time course of intra-family
transmission among the families of the camp participants. [It is
recommended that the reader consult the original text to view these
illustrations, using the URL at the begining of this report. - Mod.CP]

Measles virus genotype
----------------------
2 isolates of measles virus from this epidemic have been sequenced.
Both have been assigned to the D5 genotype, the genotype that has
been responsible for recent outbreaks in Pas-de-Calais and Bourgogne.

Motivation for non-vaccination
------------------------------
Information is available for 9 of the 11 families with unvaccinated
children. In 3 families a bad reaction to vaccination in a child of
one family dissuaded the parents from vaccinating their other
children. In 2 other families vaccination was declined on the basis
of personal convictions, and in 2 other families the mild nature of
the disease and absence of obligation were factors in avoiding
vaccination. A preference for homeopathy was the reason in one
family, and peer pressure influenced another family.

Conclusion
----------
This investigation illustrates the risk of wide dissemination of
measles infection in a population with insufficient vaccine coverage.
In families where there was poor vaccine coverage (22 percent), at
least one case of measles was observed. This study confirms the
extreme contagiousness of measles virus with an attack rate of 82
percent in the case of susceptible individuals during the 15 days
following exposure to the index case.
