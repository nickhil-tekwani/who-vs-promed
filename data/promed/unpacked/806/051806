Authorities say a skunk that bit a 5-month-old baby several times in the face in Morrison County has tested positive for rabies.

Sheriff Michel Wetzel says officials at Community Animal Hospital in Little Falls gave him that word on Wednesday [24 Jul 2013]. Wetzel says the baby's family has been advised and will get medical treatment for the infant.

Sheriff's officials say the baby was outside in a child seat with several other children when the skunk approached Tuesday [23 Jul 2013] at a residence near Little Falls. The home owner retrieved a gun and shot and killed the skunk. The baby was treated at St. Gabriel's Hospital in Little Falls.

Five people being treated for rabies exposure in The Colony are not expected to fully contract the virus, city and state officials said Tuesday [23 Jul 2013].

The 5 have not shown any symptoms of infection since their exposure to a rabid family dog in the past 2 weeks. Three, including one child, were bitten by the dog in its owner's home in the 6800 block of Curry Drive.

The dog, listed as a 4-month-old Blue Heeler/shepherd mix, was taken to a veterinarian Thursday [18 Jul 2013], and tests came back positive for rabies Friday [19 Jul 2013].

Patricia Barrington, manager of The Colony's Animal Services department, said they believe the dog contacted the virus from feral neighborhood cats. The Texas Department of State Health Services does not track exposures that don't result in infection, but they occur "from time to time," spokesman Chris Van Deusen said.

The last reported Texas human infection was a 17-year-old Harris County girl in 2009, Van Deusen said. The most recent recorded case of rabies in a dog in Denton County came in June 2012, according to a department database.

The incubation period, or the time it takes for the virus to take hold and cause symptoms, is typically 3 to 4 months for rabies, Van Deusen said. The World Health Organization's website says that period is typically 1-3 months, but can vary from less than a week after exposure to more than a year.

Before the virus emerges from dormancy, it can be treated through a series of vaccinations.

"Once the symptoms do develop, it's almost always fatal," Van Deusen said. Barrington said they've identified the people who could have been exposed in this case, and she hasn't seen a domestic animal with rabies in The Colony since she started in the department in 2005.

The infected dog was euthanized as part of the rabies test, she said. Police did not cite the dog's owner, who was not identified.

Rabies vaccinations for pets will be offered for at the city's animal shelter, 4720 E. Lake Highlands Drive.

The fox that bit a man on Cypress Road Saturday [13 Jul 2013] morning was "presumed to have been rabid," according to a Wednesday [17 Jul 2013] release from the town. The man killed the fox with electric hedge clippers right after he was bit in the boot, according to the police report. He said the bite did not break his skin, but he later fainted, police said.

The Arlington Police Department and Department of Health and Human Services are now urging all residents to take precautions around wild animals. Here are some steps to take from the town:

* Vaccinate your pets. State law mandates all dogs, cats and ferrets be vaccinated against rabies. If your pet was previously vaccinated, check with your veterinarian to be sure the vaccination is current.

* Keep your garbage securely covered at all times. Open garbage will attract wild animals.

* Do not feed or approach any wild animals. Monitor your pets at all times when outdoors.

* Immediately report any animal that displays the signs of rabies to the Arlington Police Department.

Rhode Island health officials say anyone who had contact with a black-and-white calf in Tiverton should contact health officials because the animal may have had rabies.

The department said Thursday [25 Jul 2013] that the calf bit a Massachusetts resident on 15 Jul 2013. The animal was quarantined the next day and was found dead on Sunday [21 Jul 2013?].

Local animal officials did not notify the state for 3 days after the death, however, and by that time the remains were too decomposed to test for rabies.

[Mammals of any age are capable of carrying the rabies virus, calves, foxes, kittens, horses, canines and other animals.

Odd behavior of any animal should send a signal of a possible problem. If you suspect the animal may have rabies, please notify the authorities immediately so that appropriate testing may be performed. It may save you the distress of worrying whether you have encountered rabies, and it may save your life to get appropriate treatment in a timely fashion.

People of any age can be exposed to animals. Unfortunately, our unvaccinated pets may be exposed and then come into the home to expose us. Keeping our animals vaccinated is extremely important for our safety and for theirs.
