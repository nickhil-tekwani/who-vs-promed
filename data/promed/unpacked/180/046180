The US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS) is issuing a public health alert due to illnesses from _Salmonella
enterica_ serotype Newport associated with fresh ground beef products
contaminated with multi-drug resistant salmonellosis that may have been
ground and sold at Safeway supermarkets in Arizona, California, Hawaii,
Nevada and New Mexico between 19 Sep and 5 Nov 2007.
This public health alert was initiated after epidemiological investigations
and a case control study conducted by the California Department of Public
Health, Arizona Department of Health Services and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that there is an association
between the fresh ground beef products and 38 illnesses reported in Arizona
(16), California (18), Idaho (1), and Nevada (3). The illnesses were linked
through the epidemiological investigation by their rare PFGE pattern found
in PulseNet, a database maintained by CDC.
This alert is being issued after an exhaustive and continuing investigation
whereby FSIS could not identify specific establishments, lots and products
that would be subject to a recall. FSIS has no reason to believe that these
products are still available for sale in commerce. Consumers that may have
purchased these fresh ground beef products between 19 Sep and 5 Nov 2007
and stored them in the freezer should look for and discard or destroy these
products if they find them.
FSIS would like to remind consumers of the importance of following food
safety guidelines when handling and preparing raw meat. Ground beef should
be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 160 F.
This particular strain of _Salmonella_ is resistant to many commonly
prescribed drugs, which can increase the risk of hospitalization or
possible treatment failure in infected individuals.
USDA recommendations for preventing salmonellosis
-------------------------------------------------
- wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and
after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes and
utensils with hot soapy water.
- clean up spills right away.
- keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be
cooked.
- use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and
cooked foods.
- cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating.
The safe internal temperature for meat such as beef and pork is 160 F (80
C), and 165 F (83 C) for poultry, as determined with a food thermometer.
- refrigerate raw meat and poultry within 2 hours after purchase (one hour
if ambient temperatures exceed 90 degrees F (36 C)).
- refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within 2 hours after cooking.
