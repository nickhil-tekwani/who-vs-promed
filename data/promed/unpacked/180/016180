Salmonellosis outbreak linked to British eggs
---------------------------------------------
Almost 40 people are part of a _Salmonella_ outbreak traced to eggs from the United Kingdom. A spokesman for Public Health England told Food Safety News that it does not have information on the date of onset of illness for all the patients. "There have been 38 reported cases linked to this incident through analysis of whole genome sequencing data. Cases range in age from 6 months to 85 years; 19 are female and 19 are male. We are aware of 2 cases having been hospitalized," the spokesman said.

A notification on the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) portal from early July 2020 shows that eggs contaminated with _Salmonella_ Enteritidis were subjected to physical or chemical treatment in the Netherlands, which was a commercial decision by the producer.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA), Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and PHE were involved in the outbreak investigation, which began in May 2020. Analysis of whole genome sequencing data identified the same strain of _Salmonella_ from farm samples and in infected people.

British Lion Brand eggs account for about 90% of UK egg production. The British Lion mark on eggs means that they have been laid by hens vaccinated against _Salmonella_. All eggs with this mark have been produced under requirements of the British Lion Code of Practice.

Vaccination to prevent _Salmonella_ in healthy animals is only partially protective. Control of infection also depends on careful administration of the vaccine via drinking water and good farm management to minimize risk of contamination.

Eggs from infected farms are restricted until they are sent for processing or disposed of as animal by-products. They cannot be sold as fresh table eggs. Farmers voluntarily culled the birds on site or sent them for slaughter following testing as arranged with the FSA. "On 20 May 2020, eggs from Lion Code flocks which had been identified as possibly containing _Salmonella_ were exported to the Netherlands for pasteurization. This process destroys the _Salmonella_ and avoids destruction of all eggs," said a Food Standards Agency spokesperson. "Control measures have been taken at the farm affected to ensure that _Salmonella_ is no longer present. We informed both the European Commission and Dutch authorities about this situation."

Farms are fully cleansed and disinfected by the owner before they are allowed to re-stock. Environmental samples are taken after these measures to check for _Salmonella_. The re-stocked poultry flocks are then sampled by APHA in line with National Control Plan requirements.

The outbreak is not related to reports of salmonellosis linked to British eggs revealed last year by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism and The Guardian. Their investigation found there were at least 100 cases recorded in the past 3 years, and 45 since January 2019 traced to contaminated poultry farms. Following this incident, the British Egg Industry Council said it had introduced additional, enhanced testing and auditing to minimize the risk of it happening again.

The UK also has the most confirmed and probable cases as part of a _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to Polish eggs, that has been ongoing since 2012 with 688, according to figures from January 2020 as reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and the UK have recorded 1656 infections since 2012. The public are advised to follow good hygiene and egg handling practices such as storing eggs in the fridge until use, using them by the best before date, cleaning surfaces and kitchen equipment effectively after use, and washing hands thoroughly before and after handling them.

[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
