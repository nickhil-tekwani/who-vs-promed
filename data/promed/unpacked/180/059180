Banana growers on alert for bunchy top
--------------------------------------
The northern New South Wales region's backyard banana growers are
being urged to have their trees inspected for bunchy top disease. A
new campaign has begun to eradicate the disease, which is currently
confined to the far north coast [of NSW] and parts of south-east
Queensland.

Program coordinator David Peasley says all commercial plantations in
the region will be inspected but backyard operations are more
difficult to identify. He says if the public cooperates the disease
could be eradicated within 3 years. "We're going to make a decision at
the end of 3 years whether eradication is to continue or we're just
going to continue with a control program," he said.

"The whole of the banana industry wants to be rid of this disease
because if it ever got into north Queensland, where 90 percent of
Australia's bananas are grown now, it would be absolutely devastating.
It's the most devastating virus disease of bananas in the world."

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the only member of the genus
_Babuvirus_ (family _Nanoviridae_) and only affects _Musa_ species. It
causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of
chlorosis, stunting, and death of the host plant. The virus is
spreading in Africa, Australasia, and the Pacific Islands. BBTV is
transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a
persistent manner and is probably retained when the vector moults.
Infectious insects may be spread on plant material. The virus is also
spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical
means (such as cutting tools).

Disease management is extremely difficult and includes vector control,
removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material, and frequent
scouting for new outbreaks. Planting tolerant varieties will enable
some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars may still
support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs. Once
established, eradication of BBTV would be considered impossible under
most circumstances. However, Australia has had previous success with
eradicating citrus canker (ProMED-mail post 20090206.0528), and the
opportunity to use a similar approach as well as available public
support provides a promising base for an eradication attempt.
