[1] Immunity following "mild" infections

Scientists who have been monitoring immune responses to the coronavirus for months are now starting to see encouraging signs of strong, lasting immunity, even in people that developed only mild symptoms of COVID-19, a flurry of new studies has found. Disease-fighting antibodies, as well as immune cells called B cells and T cells capable of recognizing the virus, appear to persist months after infections have resolved -- an encouraging echo of the body's robust immune response to other viruses.

"This is exactly what you would hope for," said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington and an author on one of the new studies, which is currently under review at the journal Nature. "All the pieces are there to have a totally protective immune response."

"This is very promising," said Smita Iyer, an immunologist at the University of California, Davis, who is studying immune responses to the coronavirus in rhesus macaques and was not involved in these papers. "This calls for some optimism about herd immunity, and potentially a vaccine."

Research on the coronavirus is proceeding so quickly, and in such volume, that the traditional review process often cannot keep pace. For the studies discussed here -- as with un-peer-reviewed studies in general -- The Times arranged for several experts to read and evaluate them. Although researchers cannot forecast how long these immune responses will last, many experts consider the data a welcome indication that the body has a good chance of fending off the coronavirus if exposed to it again.

"Things are really working as they're supposed to," said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona and an author on one of the new studies, which has not yet been peer reviewed. Protection against reinfection cannot be fully confirmed until there is proof that most people who encounter the virus a 2nd time are actually able to keep it at bay, Dr Pepper said. But the findings could help quell recent concerns over the virus's ability to dupe the immune system into amnesia, leaving people vulnerable to repeat bouts of disease.

Summary
-------
SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19. We here systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust, broad, and highly functional memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.

Abstract
--------
While the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively studied in blood, relatively little is known about the mucosal immune response and its relationship to systemic antibody levels. Since SARS-CoV-2 initially replicates in the upper airway, the antibody response in the oral cavity is likely an important parameter that influences the course of infection. We developed enzyme linked immunosorbent assays to detect IgA and IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (full length trimer) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) in serum (n=496) and saliva (n=90) of acute and convalescent patients with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 ranging from 3-115 days post-symptom onset (PSO), compared to negative controls. Anti-CoV-2 antibody responses were readily detected in serum and saliva, with peak IgG levels attained by 16-30 days PSO. Whereas anti-CoV-2 IgA antibodies rapidly decayed, IgG antibodies remained relatively stable up to 115 days PSO in both biofluids. Importantly, IgG responses in saliva and serum were correlated, suggesting that antibodies in the saliva may serve as a surrogate measure of systemic immunity.

Abstract
--------
The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently causing a global pandemic and cases continue to rise. The majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity. Thus, we performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 to determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory against the virus. We found that recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B and T cells that not only persisted but in some cases increased numerically over 3 months following symptom onset. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral immunity: memory T cells secreted [Interferon‚Äêgamma] and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, while memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as antibodies. These findings demonstrate that mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity.

Abstract
--------
Background
Characterizing the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and developing accurate serologic assays are needed for diagnostic purposes and estimating population-level seroprevalence.
Methods
We measured the kinetics of early antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 259 symptomatic North American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (up to 75 days after symptom onset) compared to antibody levels in 1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic.
Results
Between 14-28 days from onset of symptoms, IgG, IgA, or IgM antibody responses to RBD were all accurate in identifying recently infected individuals, with 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 97%, 91%, and 81% respectively. Although the estimated median time to becoming seropositive was similar across isotypes, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with most individuals estimated to become seronegative again by 51 and 47 days after symptom onset, respectively. IgG antibodies against RBD lasted longer and persisted through 75 days post-symptoms. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies targeting the S protein. No cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies was observed with several known circulating coronaviruses, HKU1, OC 229 E, OC43, and NL63.
Conclusions
Among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, RBD-targeted antibodies can be indicative of previous and recent infection. IgG antibodies are correlated with neutralizing antibodies and are possibly a correlate of protective immunity.

Abstract
--------
CD4 T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are important for the generation of long-lasting and specific humoral protection against viral infections. The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 infection generates Tfh cells and stimulates the germinal center response is an important question as we investigate vaccine options for the current pandemic. Here we report that, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, adult rhesus macaques exhibited transient accumulation of activated, proliferating Tfh cells in their peripheral blood on a transitory basis. The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a Th1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection. We also observed the generation of germinal center Tfh cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies but delayed or absent IgA antibodies. Our data suggest that a vaccine promoting Th1-type Tfh responses that target the S protein may lead to protective immunity.

Abstract
--------
We conducted an extensive serological study to quantify population-level exposure and define correlates of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. We found that relative to mild COVID-19 cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated authentic virus-neutralizing titers and antibody levels against nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 region of spike protein. Unlike disease severity, age and sex played lesser roles in serological responses. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. RBD- and S2-specific and neutralizing antibody titers remained elevated and stable for at least 2-3 months post-onset, whereas those against N were more variable with rapid declines in many samples. Testing of 5882 self-recruited members of the local community demonstrated that 1.24% of individuals showed antibody reactivity to RBD. However, 18% (13/73) of these putative seropositive samples failed to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of the neutralizing, but only 1 of the non-neutralizing samples, also displayed potent reactivity to S2. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays markedly improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the viral antigen. In contrast to other reports, we conclude that immunity is durable for at least several months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The known experience with the SARS-CoV-2 is relatively short in duration (since December 2019 although earlier dates of identification of probable infections are being identified). That translates into 7.5 months of experience with PCR documented infections, with the studies above (and others cited in the bibliographies of each of the papers above). This further translates into studies looking at duration of immunity, predominantly 2-3 months in duration from onset of infection (or symptoms). While it is very promising that there is documented evidence of cell mediated immunity with documented anamnestic response, the studies to date are only through 2-3 months. Looking at vaccine induced immunity, an important variable will be the duration of immunity and appropriate timing to recommend booster doses of the vaccines if the goal is to create herd immunity of the population. - Mod.MPP]

[2] UK: REACT serosurvey results
Date: Thu 13 Aug 2020

More than 100 000 people across England have tested themselves for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at home as part of a major national research programme supported by staff at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Led by Imperial College London, the REACT (REal Time Assessment of Community Transmission) study is using antibody finger-prick tests to track past infections and monitor the progress of the pandemic. It's the first nation-wide antibody surveillance study to be rolled out across England using self-testing at home and the first findings provide an initial insight in to trends in infection across the country.

REACT has been commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, and is being carried out in partnership with Imperial College London, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Ipsos MORI. The 1st findings to be published from the study, which has been submitted for peer review, suggest that slightly under 6% of the population may have antibodies for the virus by the end of June -- an estimated 3.4 million people. The presence of antibodies indicates that they were likely to have previously been exposed to COVID-19. London had the highest number of people with antibodies, at over twice the national average (13 per cent), while the South West had the lowest (3 per cent).

To develop a reliable and accurate antibody test for the study, researchers assessed 11 different tests for accuracy and ease of use at home. Around 300 staff from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust who previously had a positive PCR swab test initially volunteered to trial the different tests to assess how easy they were to use and their accuracy. These volunteers also donated a blood sample which was analysed in the laboratory using a test developed by Imperial researchers.

The team went on to carry out a large public engagement exercise with more than 14 000 people to improve usability of the tests, called lateral flow tests (LFTs). LFTs are inexpensive and can be taken at home without a healthcare professional, making them well-suited for large-scale population studies where costly laboratory testing isn't possible. The best performing test was then rolled out to a nationally-representative sample of 100 000 members of the public, who were randomly selected, between [20 Jun 2020] and [13 Jul 2020]. The tests use a drop of blood from the finger and give a result in just 15 minutes, which participants read themselves and upload via an online survey.

Whilst it is currently unknown whether having antibodies to the virus provides immunity against getting COVID-19 again, understanding trends in past cases, and how these vary by geography and demographics, will help guide local public health responses. It will also help identify groups who may be at increased risk and inform actions to control the disease. All REACT study participants are asked to continue to follow Government guidelines, regardless of their result.

Professor Graham Cooke, consultant in infectious diseases at the Trust and research lead at Imperial College, said: "There are still many unknowns with this new virus, including the extent to which the presence of antibodies offers protection against future infections. Using the finger-prick tests suitable for large scale home testing has given us clearest insight yet into the spread of the virus in the country and who has been at greatest risk. These data will have important implications for decisions around ongoing control measures in England."

The study findings also show that the overall infection fatality ratio -- the proportion of infected people who died -- was calculated to be 0.9 per cent, similar to other countries such as Spain.

Antibodies were found in almost all (96 per cent) of those tested who had a previous infection confirmed by a PCR swab test. People who had severe symptoms from the disease were twice as likely to have antibodies as those with no symptoms when they were diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19 (29 per cent vs 14 per cent). The highest numbers of positive antibody results were in people who reported confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in March and April, and were shown across all regions of England.

Key workers in care homes and health care were among those most likely to have already been infected with the coronavirus. And Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals were between two and three times more likely to have had Covid-19 compared to white people. Evidence of antibodies was found in more than 16 per cent of care home workers with client-facing roles and 12 per cent of healthcare professionals that have direct patient contact. In non-key workers, the rate was around 5 per cent.

For Black, Asian, and other ethnicity individuals, the rates of positive results were 17 per cent, 12 per cent, and 12 per cent, respectively, compared to 5 per cent for white individuals. The gap was reduced after the researchers took into account factors such as age and key worker status, but rates were still higher overall for BAME individuals. Other factors not explored in this study could, therefore, be behind the higher likelihood of previous infection in this group, such as transport use and behaviour.

Trends were also observed with age, where young people aged 18-24 had the highest rates (8 per cent) and were more than twice as likely to test positive than older adults aged 65 to 74, who were least likely to have had the virus (3 per cent). In addition, the researchers found links with deprivation and household size. People from the poorest areas were more likely to have had Covid-19 (7 per cent) compared to those from the least deprived (5 per cent). And people living in households of more than 7 people were more than twice as likely to have been infected than those living alone or with one other person (13 per cent vs 5 per cent).

The study will be repeated in autumn, testing 200 000 people, and research on the accuracy of different LFTs is ongoing to ensure that the best available test is used in the REACT programme as it continues.

Professor Helen Ward, lead author for the study of population prevalence from Imperial College London, said: "Thanks to the contribution of tens of thousands of members of the public, we have been able to show how the virus which causes COVID-19 has spread across England. We have shown that it is possible to do a large scale study with home tests, and this is an efficient way of improving our understanding.

"We found that people working in care homes and healthcare are at particularly high risk of being exposed to the virus, as are those from Black, Asian, and other minority ethnic groups. We need to do far more to protect people from any future waves of infection."

Professor Paul Elliott, senior study author from Imperial College London, said: "Finding out who has been infected by the virus, where and when is vital to be able to understand the pattern and extent of transmission in the community. This study gives a very detailed picture of the pandemic as it unfolded in England in the period prior to and during lockdown." Health Minister Edward Argar said: "Large scale antibody surveillance studies are crucial to helping us understand how the virus has spread across the country and whether there are specific groups who are more vulnerable, as we continue our work to drive down the spread of the disease. "We don't yet know that antibodies provide immunity to coronavirus, but the more information we can gather on this virus, and the easier we can make it for people to participate in these studies, the better equipped we will be to respond. The British public have already played a massive part in helping to keep the country safe and I'd urge them to consider signing up to one of the many vital surveillance studies taking place over the coming months as part of our national testing effort."

Kelly Beaver, Managing Director-Public Affairs, Ipsos MORI said: "The thorough and rigorous work carried out by Imperial College London has allowed us to find a robust at home finger prick test for COVID-19 antibodies. This is the springboard for developing a far greater understanding of COVID-19 antibodies and how prevalent they are in the population through our large-scale antibody study, conducted with over 100 000 members of the public."

[A massive undertaking with not totally unexpected results. The identified high prevalence groups by ethnicity and by profession are similar to what has been seen in the USA. The use of a home-based self-test is a credit to the improved technologies being developed. As a segue to the preceding section on duration of immunity, it will be interesting to see the fall/autumn studies which will hopefully address longer durations from time of infection. - Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is beginning. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mod.MPP]

[Once again there is weekend artifact with key active countries not reporting over the weekend, or partially reporting (countries where not all reporting units are reporting). The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

The Philippines, Japan, Australia, and now South Korea continue to have elevated transmission, and Viet Nam continues to report cases in the wake of the Da Nang outbreak, 21 reported in the past 24 hours.

- The South East Asia region reported 25.8% of the global newly reported cases and 17.2% of globally reported deaths. India reported 91.9% (63 490) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 3.8% (2644), Indonesia 3.4% (2345), and Nepal 0.72% (498). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region but Bangladesh and Indonesia continue to report more than 2000 cases each daily, and Nepal remains active with almost 500 cases reported in the past 24 hours.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (58 108), followed by USA (36 843), and Brazil (22 365) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (52.9%). There were 4355 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (since 15 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, Russia, Mexico, Iraq, and South Africa. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3692 to 58 108. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Philippines, France, Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia, Chile, Bangladesh, Ukraine, Morocco, and Panama; their range of reported new cases is 1275 to 3335. There are 26 countries reporting more than 1000 cases each in the last 24 hours of which 10 are in the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change in the average number of daily reported cases (an increase of 0.47%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 5.5%. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind! -- I feel like a broken record here...). Reports seem to suggest that in many countries, the number of tests is decreasing on a daily basis.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.MPP]
