Hundreds of workers at a Hong Kong-owned garment factory in Viet Nam which makes lingerie for labels like Victoria's Secret and Wacoal have been hospitalized with food poisoning, state media reported today, 29 Dec 2015.

More than 2/3rds of the 650 victims, mostly female workers at Regina Miracle International Vietnam Co. Ltd, were rushed on Mon 28 Dec 2015 to hospitals and clinics in Hai Phong City, 100 km (60 miles) from Hanoi, Thanh Nien newspaper said. Most of them suffered from dizziness, stomach pain and headaches after eating a lunch of rice, fish, meat, vegetables and yoghurt in the factory canteen.

"By Tuesday [29 Dec 2015] noon, 223 workers remained in hospital, but with minor symptoms (of food poisoning)," Pham Thu Xanh, director of Hai Phong's health care department, said in an interview with state-run Viet Nam Television. The Thanh Nien report said authorities were investigating what had made the workers sick, while the food company has been temporarily suspended from operations until the results are known.

Officials in Hai Phong and at the factory's Viet Nam and Hong Kong offices could not be reached for comment. On its website, Regina Miracle says it employs between 15 000 to 20 000 workers "manufacturing a variety of lingerie, shoes and sporty apparel of well-known fashion branches such as Victoria's Secret, Wacoal, and Under Armour."

Food poisoning outbreaks, especially in factory canteens, have become increasingly common in Viet Nam, which has seen record foreign investment in recent years and impressive factory growth.

[There is not enough information in the posting to easily assess the etiology of this rather large outbreak of foodborne illness. In general, in addition to the food ingested, the incubation period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, what symptoms are present, including the presence or absence of fever, and the length of illness are useful in this regard. - Mod.LL

More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP
