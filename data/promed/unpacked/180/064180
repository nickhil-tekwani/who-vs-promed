PSEUDOMONAS MASTITIS, DAIRY SHEEP - ISRAEL

During the last 2 years we have witnessed in Israel at least 8 severe
outbreaks of acute mastitis in dairy sheep, from which _Pseudomonas
aeruginosa_ is the most prevalent pathogen. The incidence may rise up to
30-40% of the milking ewes population with mortality rate of up to 15%. The
clinical symptoms may vary from mild (mere changes in the consistency
and/or of the colour of the milk) mastitis to acute gangrenous one which
ends with the death of the animal.
As expected in _Pseudomonas_ infections, antibiotics are useless either as
treatment or as a preventive measure. In one outbreak _Pseudomonas_ seems
to have contaminated the water pipeline which feeds the water troughs and
the milking parlour cleaning system, but this pathogen could not be
detected in the environment of the other flocks that have suffered the
outbreaks.
The affected flocks are of the "Assaf" diary sheep breed and run according
to the best management standards. They are fed intensively (zero-grazing,
indoors feeding based on grain/concentrates and hay), reproductive cycle is
synchronized, milking is in milking parlours with modern milking equipment.
Milking hygiene seems to be impeccable. Milking technicians have been
called to inspect the milking equipment in the affected flocks, but in no
case could they pinpoint a major milking machine breakdown. Repairs of
small failures and general tuning-up of the milking equipment do not solve
the problem.
At present we recommend that ewes carrying _Pseudomonas_ in their udders
(both clinical and non-clinical shedders) be culled immediately from the
population, that the whole milking population be dried-off until next
lambing season, and that a routine (fortnightly?) bacteriological testing
of milk samples from all the udders be installed in the affected flocks. Do
other ProMED-mail subscribers have experienced this kind of udder infection
and can supply us with brilliant ideas on how to stop these mastitis waves?
