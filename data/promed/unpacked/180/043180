Health Department: Fox that bit woman had new rabies strain
-----------------------------------------------------------
Health officials say tests indicate that a fox that bit a woman in southern New Mexico had a new strain of rabies. The 78 year old woman was bitten in Lincoln County on [20 Apr 2015]. She then got rabies vaccinations that prevented her from developing rabies, which is often fatal.

The state Department of Health says genetic testing of the virus was done at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta [Georgia].

New Mexico health secretary Retta Ward says the new strain is related to other rabies strains found in bats. Ward says state and federal officials are going to collect dead foxes and bats in Lincoln County to test them for rabies.

Health officials advise that children should be advised to never touch a bat or other wild animals.

[Obviously this fox found a sick moribund bat, and ate it. In all these southern US states it is drummed into children's heads that when you find a bat on the ground, you leave it there. You do NOT TOUCH it! This fox forgot what its mother had told it, just as cats will do. And the more rabies viruses you genetically identify, the greater the likelihood of finding a new strain. Presently in central Texas, 'raccoon' rabies is raging, affecting raccoons, dogs, and foxes. Finding an effective oral vaccine for raccoons is proving difficult. - Mod.MHJ
