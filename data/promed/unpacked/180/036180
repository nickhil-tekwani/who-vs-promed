Taiwan reports 1st case of canine rabies infection in years
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Central Epidemic Control Center confirmed on Tuesday [10 Sep 2013] that a pet dog in Taitung County, eastern Taiwan has been infected with rabies after being bitten by a rabid Formosan ferret-badger. It is the 1st time the deadly disease has been found in dogs in Taiwan since a rabies outbreak was reported among ferret-badgers in mid-July [2013] after a hiatus of more than 5 decades. Before this case, all infections have been confined to ferret-badgers except for one case involving an Asian house shrew, the Center stated.

It urged dog owners to get their dogs aged over 3 months old vaccinated and not to allow dogs younger than that to have contact with wild animals. It said the 6-week old puppy being raised in Haiduan Township was bitten by the rabies-infected ferret-badger on 14 Aug 2013 and the owner sent it to the Taitung County Animal Disease Control Center the following day. The Center noted that during the observation period, the puppy started to show symptoms of no appetite and extreme depression by 6 Sep 2013 It was put down after displaying signs of near collapse 2 days later. The carcass was then sent for testing, which confirmed on 9 Sep 2013 that it had been infected.

A Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Tuesday [10 Sep 2013] that the disease is well under control. Chang Su-san, director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, noted that the dog was only 6 weeks old and had not been vaccinated. The epidemic control center urged people to keep their distance from wild animals and to make sure their pets are vaccinated. The vaccination rate among dogs and cats is now over 90 percent, it said. If pets display erratic behavior such as appetite loss, restlessness, or aggression, owners should alert animal disease control centers immediately, the center said.

The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) indicates that the Council of Agriculture Animal Health Research Institute reported rabies in a dog sent in by the Taitung Animal Disease Control Center on September 9 [2013]. The dog was confirmed to have rabies after direct immunofluorescent testing and RT-PCR. The dog belonged to a resident in Haiduan, Taitung, and was bitten by a rabid ferret-badger in the evening of August 14 [2013]. On August 15 [2013], the dog owner sent the dog to the Taitung Animal Disease Control Center for quarantine and observation. On September 6 [2013], the dog began to show symptoms of decreased appetite and depression, and had paralysis on September 8 [2013]. After the dog was sacrificed on September 8, specimen were sent to the Animal Health Research Center. COA indicates that all warm blooded animals are susceptible to rabies. The said dog was only 1.5 months old, and fairly small. COA suspect that the puppy was more susceptible to attacks by ferret-badgers. The puppy was quarantined based on the protocol from Kansas, which prescribes quarantining dogs bitten by another animal for 6 month.

[This the 1st report of a domestic animal contracting rabies virus infection from a wild ferret badger in Taiwan. Up till now there has been little apparent contact between domestic animals and ferret badgers. Fortunately protective immunisation of domestic animals (dogs and cats) now exceeds 90 percent, and this canine case will remain a rare event. However, this case suggests that rabies-virus infected ferret-badgers are becoming more aggressive than is their usually habit. Consequently the human population should avoid contact with any ferret badgers they might encounter. Facilities for post-exposure prophylaxis should be made available widely.

This report does not indicate the fate of the ferret badger responsible for this attack, and it seems likely that such encounters will occur with increasing frequency. It also suggests that rabies virus infection is on the increase in the ferret badger population of Taiwan, rather than existing in a balanced state which kept the disease from becoming apparent. - Mod.CP
