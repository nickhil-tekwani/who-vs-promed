PRACTICAL PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTIVES
==================================

Subject: Practical Public Health Directions

Stimulated by the recent post concerning vague directives for the public
to follow I have a few more comments.
It is all too evident not only in public health, but in other areas, the
ones who make policy, never have to follow their directives themselves,
otherwise they would rephrase them. I did a post-doc concerning the
epidemiology of E. coli O157:H7 in which I was fortunate enough to have
several veterinarians to sample the cows at the slaughterhouse. I gave
simple and "practical" information for them to follow. Luckily I decided to
try it myself with one of the vets. In less than 5 minutes it became clear
that what I wanted them to do was not at all practical and 5 more minutes to
find a practical way. By taking this small amount of time to test my
directives, I probably saved a lot more time.
Another example concerns refrigerators and food safety. Anyone who has
ever tried to clean a refrigerator is aware that those who design them never
had to clean one themselves. It would suffice a manufacturer to have someone
from the street or the clerk in the mailroom to clean one (or clean one
him/herself) to discover how to build one that is easy to clean. This method
is a simple and time/cost effective method to test one's directives and
products.
For those of you who give information and directives to the public or
know of someone who does, test them on someone (family, friends, office
personnel, etc.). Just have them read your directive and ask them what they
understood as well as what they would do and how they would follow
them......... You'll be surprised.
