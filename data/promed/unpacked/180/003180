Equine rhinopneumonitis, New Zealand
-------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 31 Jan 2014 from Dr Matthew Stone, Director Animal and Animal Products, Standards Branch, Ministry for Primary Industries, Wellington, New Zealand

Summary:
Report type: Immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 9 Jan 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 22 Jan 2014
Report date: 31 Jan 2014
Date submitted to OIE: 31 Jan 2014
Reason for notification: Unexpected increase in morbidity or mortality of a listed disease.

Summary description: On 22 Jan 2014, a veterinary pathologist reported to the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) findings from a thoroughbred stud where neurological signs in horses had 1st been detected on 9 Jan 2014. The report was based on observation of histopathological lesions of vasculitis on examination of brain tissue and a history of clinical signs consistent with a neurological condition. Over the course of the outbreak, 8 mares on the stud farm were affected clinically. Four animals have been euthanized due to recumbency and paresis [weakness]. The 4 remaining clinically affected animals had varying degrees of ataxia [lack of coordination] and bladder atony [dilated urinary bladder that does not empty].

Movements of the stud in the period from 10 days prior to the detection of clinical signs have been investigated, and no cases have been identified on other properties. Equid herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is present in New Zealand, and cases of abortion and respiratory disease have been recorded in the past. Previous work has confirmed a relatively high sero-prevalence of antibodies to EHV-1 in the New Zealand horse population arising both from natural exposure and vaccination. This disease event is the 1st confirmed occurrence of the neurological presentation of EHV-1 in New Zealand.

Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Equid herpesvirus 1
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The change in morbidity from 0 to 2 percent of animals affected with clinical neurological signs is estimated on the farm under investigation. The result of the VNT testing is reported as inconclusive, as testing of paired sera is still being performed. EHV-1 PCR testing was positive on a range of tissues from 2 of the euthanized horses.

Increased distribution
Disease impact:
Increased / Region / Species / Change
Morbidity / Waikato / _Equidae_ / 0 percent to 2 percent

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (supportive treatment of affected individuals)

Measures to be applied: no other measures
Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Investigation and Diagnostic Centre (IDC), Wallaceville (National laboratory) / _Equidae_ / antibody detection ELISA / 27 Jan 2014 / Positive
Investigation and Diagnostic Centre (IDC), Wallaceville (National laboratory) / _Equidae_ / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 31 Jan 2014 / Positive
Investigation and Diagnostic Centre (IDC), Wallaceville (National laboratory) / _Equidae_ / virus neutralisation test (VNT) / 27 Jan 2014 / Inconclusive
New Zealand Veterinary Pathology (NZVP) (Private Laboratory) _Equidae_ / histopathological examination / 22 Jan 2014 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is another name for the neurologic disease associated with equine herpesvirus (EHV) infections. EHV-1 is the primary cause of EHM.

Neurological signs appear as a result of damage to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord associated with EHV infection. Interference with the blood supply leads to tissue damage and a subsequent loss in normal function of areas in the brain and spinal cord.

To date, 9 EHVs have been identified worldwide. Three of these -- EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV- 4 -- pose the most serious health risks for domesticated horses and can have significant economic impacts.

EHV-1: Can cause 4 manifestations of disease in horses, including a neurological form, respiratory disease, abortion, and neonatal death. EHM is most often due to mutant or neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1, so called because of a particular mutation in the genome.
EHV-3: Causes a venereal disease called equine coital exanthema that affects the external genitalia.
EHV-4: Causes a nonfatal upper respiratory tract disease in foals and is uncommonly associated with abortion and rarely with neurologic disease.

Signs of EHM include: fever preceding neurologic signs (either in a horse diagnosed with EHM or in horses that have been exposed to a horse diagnosed with EHM); decreased coordination; urine dribbling; loss of tail tone; hind limb weakness; leaning against a wall or fence to maintain balance; lethargy, and inability to rise.

The information above was derived from APHIS's brochure "Equine herpesvirus (EHV) myeloencephalopathy - A Guide To Understanding the Neurologic Form of EHV Infection," available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/ehv/equine_herpesvirus_brochure_2009.pdf.

Recommendations for international trade for EHV-1 (abortigenic and paralytic forms only) are spelled out in chapter 12.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.12.8.htm. - Mod.CRD
