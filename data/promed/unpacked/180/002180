RABIES VACCINATION, BOOSTERS

Rabies among bats is increasing in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, not
only _D. rotundus_ but also non-haematophagous bats. As technicians and
researchers monitoring and controlling roosts, we get in close contact with
these mammals, and used to have our antibody levels checked every year,
with a booster when titer is lower as 0.5 IU. It has been discussed that
the Fuenzalida-Palacios vaccine, which we use normally, is less
immunogenic, and would protect less, than the human diploid cell vaccine.
The latter should also give better protection against other genotypes than
the genotype 01.
Is it possible to comment on the subject?

May I cheat a little and address this answer to the question of protection
of staff vaccinated with Fuenzalida-Palacios vaccine against risk of rabies
through an increase in the number of vampire and also non-vampire cases
handled and/or submitted to the laboratory? I am cheating because I cannot
give a definitive answer, but I would like to say Hallo to Phyllis, a
friend of long standing, and also to pass the question to Alex Wandeler in
Canada, who may not only be able to give a better answer but whom I believe
may be interested in looking at the genetics of some of the
non-haematophagous bat viruses.
The first point I would make is that Phyllis says that she and her staff
"used to have antibody level checked every year". Does this mean that it is
no longer tested? If that is the case, I would suggest having antibody
level measured as soon as possible and then every six months and boost when
the titre falls to 0.5IU.
The second point I would make is that I believe diploid cell vaccine to be
superior to all others BUT I do not know what the consequence of following
F-P vaccine with HDCV would be, perhaps Alex may be able to answer.
I also copy this to Paulo Roehe, another old friend, who may also be
interested in the genetics of the non-haematophagous bat viruses.
So, forgive me please for cheating, but I've done my best!

Rabies in bats has caused increased levels of interest, with respect to
both pre and post-exposure treatment, due to the level of human rabies
deaths associated with documented or suspect bat exposure. At the Texas
Department of Health, laboratory personnel and others working in high risk
areas with bats (or any suspect rabid specimen) have their antibody level
checked every year. A booster is given when the titer is lower than 0.5 IU.
0.5 international units of neutralizing antibody is considered by WHO as
evidence of adequate pre-exposure immunization regardless of the vaccine or
route. New generation high potency vaccines may elicit higher antibody
titers and immunize a higher percentage of recipients with fewer side
effects than do mouse brain vaccines, but 0.5 iu is still an adequate
response. Furthermore, there is no evidence that those persons immunized
with newer vaccines and maintaining 0.5 iu of antibody are protected
against a broader range of rabies viruses or non-rabies lyssavirus than
those immunized with mouse brain vaccines and maintaining 0.5 iu of
antibody. One could even argue the converse (with no supporting data,
however), since there are three different rabies viruses included in the
seed virus for the mouse brain vaccine while only one rabies virus is used
as the seed virus for the new generation vaccines. Booster immunizations
are necessary for all pre-immunized persons exposed to rabies virus or
non-rabies lyssaviruses, regardless of pre-exposure immunization.
