Poliovirus weekly update, 15 May 2019, WHO
------------------------------
New wild poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 4
Environment: 5

New cVDPV poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 0
Environment: 0

Headlines
- On 9 May 2019, the WHO received notification of the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from an environmental sample collected on [20 Apr 2019], in Seestan and Balochistan province, Iran. The virus collected is an environmental sample only, and no associated cases of paralysis have been detected. Genetic sequencing confirmed it is linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan - 4 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases and 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples; and
- Iran - 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. There are 7 WPV1 cases reported in 2019 from Afghanistan. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 21.
- The Technical Advisory Group for polio eradication (TAG) met on [15-16 Jan 2019] to assess the progress made towards polio eradication in Afghanistan in 2018 and made recommendations for the way forward in 2019.

Pakistan
- 4 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been confirmed: 2 from Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; 1 from North Waziristan district in KPTD; and 1 from Larkana district in Sindh province. The cases have onset of paralysis on [18, 26, 22, and 17 Apr 2019], respectively.
- 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 from Landhi in Karachi district, Sindh province; 1 each from Killa Abdullah and Quetta districts in Balochistan province; 1 from Lahore district, Punjab province. The samples were collected between [16-20 Apr 2019].

Iran
- There is a confirmed detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-positive environmental sample in Seestan and Balochistan province. The sample was collected on [22 Apr 2019]. The virus was detected in the environmental sample only, and genetic sequencing confirms it is related to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

Nigeria
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in the past week. There are 7 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- No cVDPV2-positive environmental sample were reported this week.
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported in the country since the one detected from Borno state with a date of onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 (multivalent oral polio vaccine type 2) response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week. One cVDPV2 was isolated from a healthy community contact in Magaria, Zinder state. The sample was collected on [16 Mar 2019].
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [5 Dec 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). So far, 1 cVDPV case has been reported in DRC in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20.
- DRC is affected now by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga, Mongala, Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri, and Kasai.

Horn of Africa
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week. So far, 1 cVDPV2 case has been reported in Somalia in 2019.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both AFP cases and environmental positive samples.
- Somalia has reported a total of 13 cVDPV cases (6 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks.
- The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province, with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018].
- Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- The Papua New Guinea Polio Outbreak Response Report 2018 is online. The report summarizes the accomplishments of the government of Papua New Guinea, with support from the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Rotary, the government of Australia and New Zealand and other partners and donors in responding to the polio outbreak.
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 Supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

[The 4 newly confirmed cases this week reported from Pakistan have all been covered in previous ProMED-mail posts, having been reported on the End Polio Pakistan website and in media reports. In fact, in the past 24 hours there have been an additional 2 cases reported from Pakistan as seen on the End Polio Pakistan website.

Additional major news this week is the confirmation of a WPV1-positive environmental sample identified in Iran, genetically related to the WPV1 circulating in Karachi Pakistan. Seestan and Balochistan province in Iran borders to its east with Baluchistan, Pakistan (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistan_and_Baluchestan_Province#Geography_and_culture and https://geology.com/world/pakistan-satellite-image.shtml for maps of the area.) As stated in the GPEI commentary, fortunately Iran has a robust AFP and poliovirus surveillance system combined with high vaccination coverages, and thereby felt to be at low risk for continued circulation of the WPV1. That being said, the identification of the WPV1 in an environmental sample is a reminder of how the virus does travel and how there continues to be the threat of cases of polio outside of the endemic countries.

[3] Pakistan, new case in Karachi, Sindh province - media report
Date: Thu 16 May 2019

Pakistan confirmed on Thursday [16 May 2019] that 2 new cases of polio had emerged in the country, raising the 2019 total to 17.

"Two new polio cases from Karachi and North Waziristan have been confirmed by the National Institution of Health [NIH]" anti-polio program head Babar Atta told Anadolu Agency. Despite government efforts, polio cases have steadily been increasing in the country. Some 40 cases have been reported in the country since 2016.

"There are many factors behind the polio virus's existence in Pakistan, including [a lack of] law and order, attacks on polio [inoculation] teams, gaps between communities, public mistrust, parents refusal to vaccinate their children, and the overlooking of some children during anti-polio campaigns," Atta pointed out. Pakistan is home of 39.4 million children below the age of 5.

On Thursday [16 May 2019], the NIH has confirmed that another 6-month-old child had been paralyzed in Karachi due to the family's refusal to vaccinate. Atta warned that more cases could emerge in the coming 3-4 months.

Pakistan is among 3 countries in the world, including Afghanistan and Nigeria, where polio still exists, and the country remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2014, the WHO made it mandatory for all people traveling from Pakistan to carry a polio vaccination certificate.

Armed assailants belonging to militant groups have frequently targeted polio vaccinators and their security details in several parts of Pakistan. The groups link anti-polio campaigns to anti-Muslim conspiracies, and often issue death threats to vaccinators for administrating the vital shots to children. According to Pakistani officials, around 90 people associated with the drive have been killed across Pakistan since December 2012.

[4] Pakistan, new case in North Waziristan KPTD
Date: Thu 16 May 2019

https://www.dawn.com/news/1482590/another-polio-case-reported-from-n-waziristan


Despite the government's claims that all-out efforts are being made to eradicate polio from the country, another case was reported on Wednesday [15 May 2019] from North Waziristan tribal district. The tally of cases for the current year [2019] has reached 16.

During the last 15 days, 8 polio cases have been reported, which was the total number of cases reported in 2017 and 2/3 of the 12 cases reported last year [2018].

The recent case has been reported from Zeraki Baadshah Kot village of Mirali UC, where a 42-month-old child was diagnosed with polio.

An official of the Polio Virology Laboratory at the National Institute of Health (NIH), requesting anonymity, said that samples were collected on [26 Apr 2019], and it was confirmed that the child was paralysed due to poliovirus.

"According to the father, the child was suffering from a high-grade fever for 2 days and was taken to a dispensary in the village, where she was administered an injection. Next morning, on [26 Apr 2019], the child was limping on her left leg," he said.

Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio Babar Bin Atta, while speaking to Dawn, confirmed that another child had been diagnosed with poliovirus.

It is worth mentioning that Pakistan remains to be one of the 2 last countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio cases are still being reported.

So far this year [2019], a total of 16 polio cases have been reported: 6 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 5 from tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 3 from Punjab, and 2 from Sindh [with the newly confirmed case today, 16 May 2019, from Sindh, the total for Pakistan since 1 Jan 2019 is 17, and from Sindh province, 3 cases. - Mod.MPP].

[Information on the vaccination history of this child was not available, but I would not be surprised if the child was not completely vaccinated. A curiosity is the mention of an injection having been administered in the period preceding the onset of paralysis. What is not mentioned is whether the injection was administered in the leg noted to be involved with paralysis. One of the previously reported cases from Bannu district, Khyber Paktunkwa, also had a history of intramuscular (IM) injections preceding the onset of paralysis.

In the distant past there was much discussion of this phenomenon, especially related to the administration of injectable vaccines during the polio transmission season. Reviewing the literature, this was referred to as provocation poliomyelitis (see Ref. 1 below). In the closer past, it was noted that Romania had a much higher than expected rate of vaccine associated poliomyelitis. Strebel PM, et.al. did a case control study with 31 children and 151 controls with vaccine-associated polio, which demonstrated that 27 (87%) had received one or more IM injections within 30 days before paralysis onset, compared with 77 of the controls (51%) (with a matched odds ratio of 31.2). Interestingly, nearly all of the injections were antibiotics. There was a strong relationship with injections given after the OPV vaccine, with an attributable risk of IM injections of 86% (see Ref. 2 below).

Gromeier and Wimmer studied this in animals and observed that the skeletal muscle injury induced by an intramuscular injection leads to a retrograde axonal transport of the poliovirus into the central nervous system, with impact and progression of the spinal cord damage seen with poliovirus infections.
