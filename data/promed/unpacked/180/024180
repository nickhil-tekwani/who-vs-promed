Two cases of leptospirosis have been ascertained in the hospital in Eboli. These are 2 foreign workers who work in buffalo farms in the Piana del Sele. The 2 workers were hospitalized in the medicine ward.

Once the analyses were carried out, the response from a Neapolitan specialist center arrived. At that point, the workers were transferred to the infectious disease ward and are in isolation.

The news was transmitted to the ASL [regional health department], which will start the sanitation checks in the 2 companies. Doctors do not seem worried about the health conditions of the 2 patients. However, the infection represents a serious complaint of the poor working conditions in which foreign workers find themselves.
