YELLOW FEVER IN ASIA (6)
========================
1.There has been a very long trading realation between East Coast of
Africa and Indian Subcontinent tracing back to more than 2000 Years
so the Slave Trade Theory could be wrong.
2. In the 1970's there was a long term research program by the
Indian Council of Medical Research on this topic. It was bogged down
in an international controversy when the vectors for Dengue were
reported to a foreign agency having links with the U.S. Army. I am
not aware if the results of the research were published.

[- Of course it is not the first time that that particular agency has
been blamed for such activities. However, some of us might entertain
serious doubts as to the ability of said agency to even consider what
they are accused of. MH-J Promed Acting Moderator -]
