Dis. 85:679, 2001; published on-line as D-2001-0419-01N, 2001. Accepted for
publication 26 Mar 2001.
Severe mosaic symptoms resembling those reported for a blotch isolate of
Peanut stripe virus (PStV) (1) were observed in ... 1998 in Suwon,
[Republic of Korea, on several peanut cultivars. The incidence of the
virus was as high as 100 [percent in cv. Daekwang. The virus was seed
transmitted to varying degrees depending on the cultivar and a maximum seed
transmission of 15.7 [percent was observed in cv. Aul.
Electron microscopic examination of leaf dip preparations showed flamentous
rods having modal length of 720 nm. Viral inclusion bodies in infected
cells were of pinwheel, scroll, and laminated aggregates. The 3' terminal
region of the viral genome was amplified using degenerate primers (2) and
the resulting approximately 700 bp fragment was cloned and sequenced.
GenBank searches using the 709 nucleotides consisting of the complete
3'-untranslated region and a part of the coat protein gene showed that the
virus shared 98% sequence identity with ... currently known PStV isolates.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of PStV in the Republic of Korea.

[Potyviruses which were formerly grouped in serotype A of Bean common
mosaic potyvirus (BCMV) are now considered isolates of a separate potyvirus
species, Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV). Other strains of BCMNV
include: Azuki bean mosaic virus, Blackeye cowpea mosaic virus, Cowpea
(aphid-borne) mosaic virus, Cowpea (blackeye) mosaic virus, Cowpea
vein-banding mosaic virus, PStV, Peanut blotch virus, and some isolates
from soybean. Isolates formerly called PStV include peanut chlorotic ring
virus, peanut mild mottle virus, peanut mosaic virus, and sesame yellow
mosaic virus. BCMNV-peanut strain is transmitted by aphids, is seedborne,
and is reported to occur in China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,
Taiwan, Thailand, USA and, with this report, Republic of Korea. A good
reference on the taxonomy of BCMNV can be obtained in the following
reference: McKern, N.M. et al., PHYTOPATHOLOGY 83:923. Other references on
diseases caused by the peanut strain are: Guzman, P. et al., 1997. PLANT
DISEASE 81:831. Flores-Estevez, N., 2000. PLANT DISEASE 84:923.
Note: The original text of this abstract referred to the outbreak of PStV
in South Korea. However, the authors refer to that political entity as the
Republic of Korea (see title of the abstract, the addresses of the authors
as well as in the last sentence of the abstract), the official name of the
political entity commonly referred to as South Korea. - Mod.DH
