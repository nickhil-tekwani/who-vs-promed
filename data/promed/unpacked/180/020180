2000/026 First report of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus in Mexico
(edited)
In Mexico, since the introduction of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) into Cuba and later Florida (US), tomato and
sweet pepper-growing areas of Yucatan Peninsula are being monitored for
this virus. Other Geminiviridae such as pepper huasteco, Texas pepper and
tomato mottle begomoviruses are also surveyed (using PCR techniques), as
they can cause similar symptoms. From December 1996 until March 1999, in
most cases diseased samples of tomato or pepper were infected by pepper
huasteco or Texas pepper begomoviruses. However, in March 1999, 3 tomato
samples collected during 2 seasons (winter 1996 and 1997) in Dizdzantun and
Yobain counties (north-east of Merida, Yucatan) were found infected by
tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (isolates similar to TYLCV-Is). This is
the first report of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus in Mexico. It
appears that the current incidence of the disease is low and that the virus
is spreading slowly, as since this first finding only two more infected
samples have been found. However, it is stressed that further studies are
needed to confirm the actual distribution of tomato yellow leaf curl
begomovirus in Yucatan.

[The authors suggest that the apparently slow spread of the disease may be
characteristic of the agriculture system in Yucatan Peninsula which
consists of small, disperse plots or the presence of other geminiviruses
which impede spread of TYLCV. - Mod.DH
