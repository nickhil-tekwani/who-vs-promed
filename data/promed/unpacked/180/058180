----------------------------------------------------------------------
The spread of _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ appears to me to be among the largely unrecognized side effects of the introduction of neuter/return feral cat control in the early 1990s, combined with the explosive rise of backyard bird-feeding during the same time frame.

Neuter/return was formally introduced to the US in 1991-1992, after successful use in feral cat control in Britain, Kenya, and South Africa and several experimental projects in various parts of the US, one of the largest of which I helped to coordinate as part of a raccoon rabies control effort in Connecticut. Several different organizations participated in introducing neuter/return, but 2 of the first were Alley Cat Allies, of Washington DC (which now has a significant national presence), and Alley Cat Rescue, of Maryland.

The net effect was that animal shelter admissions of cats, especially of kitten litters found at large, fell nationally by about 75 percent between 1992 and 2002. Roadkill surveys found about a 90 percent decline in recoveries of cat carcasses during the same time frame. The US feral cat population dropped from a range found by various studies one from 1908 to 1992 as 25 to 40 million, to near 9 million on year-round average today.

(Many people throw around much higher numbers, including the authors of a much-publicized recent literature review, but those higher numbers are projections from older projections, not based on the findings of people who actually go into a variety of representative habitats and count cats, or droppings, or carcasses.)

Other urban and suburban predators who formerly shared the rodent prey base with cats became markedly more numerous from circa 1991-1992 to today, corresponding with the decline of feral cats: notably coyotes, foxes, fishers, hawks, owls, and eagles.

Unlike cats, relatively few of these predators hunt in the vicinity of bird feeders.

For cats, the major attraction of bird feeders is often that rodents congregate beneath them to eat spilled birdseed. But most cats will grab a sick or injured bird, and when any infectious disease cripples birds, the vicinity of feeders is where those birds are most easily found.

It is important to realize that most cats don't have the vertical visual acuity to grab a healthy bird who is able to take flight. This can easily be tested with a wad of paper taped to a string. Every cat can catch the wad when it is dragged horizontally as a mouse runs; only about one in 10 will catch the wad if it is suddenly jerked vertically like a bird startling into flight. Many will not even see where the wad went.

While feral cats were in steep decline, bringing about an abrupt transformation of the urban and suburban wildlife ecology, the popularity of backyard bird-feeding soared from circa 35 million people actively feeding birds as of 1980 to more than 70 million people feeding birds as of 2008, and probably many more now. This created an entire industry of neighborhood stores serving bird-feeders.

The post-1994 explosion of _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ was first observed around Washington DC in many of the same locations where neuter/return caught on first. _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ then spread up and down the east coast and to other places more-or-less following by several years the rise of big neuter/return programs.

The explanation, in short, is that historically sick birds have been killed by predators, especially cats in urban and suburban habitats, and sick birds around feeders were the most vulnerable.

When the outdoor cat population dropped, fewer sick birds were killed, but there were more feeders and birds congregating around feeders to become infected, and that gave the infected birds far more opportunity to spread _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ before the disease itself felled them.

Incidentally, I was apparently the first to identify _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ here on Whidbey Island, during the 1st week of May 2001, about 5 years after moving here from upstate New York, where I saw a lot of it. I mentioned this to one of the then-ProMED moderators, but I don't believe my observation was posted. Feral cat neuter/return had begun in the vicinity in 1998, and around the same time a bird feeder supply store opened about half a mile away from where I found the 1st 3 cases -- all birds who had apparently been blinded and had then flown in front of cars.
