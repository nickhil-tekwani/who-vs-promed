The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) comprehensive
investigation of Canada's latest case of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) is nearing completion.
CFIA investigators have confirmed the animal was born in 2000 and was
at least 6.5 years old at the time of its death, based on dental
analysis, DNA testing, and information provided by the producer.
Information collected through the investigation also indicates the
animal was born and raised on the farm where it was found. The CFIA
has directed all necessary resources toward the tracing of cattle
that may have been exposed to the same feed as the affected animal
during the early part of their lives.
The investigation also includes a thorough examination of the
formulation, production, transportation, and storage of a number of
feed sources used on the birth farm at the time.
This case is consistent with [the agency's] understanding of BSE in
North America. The CFIA has maintained that more cases could be
found, especially considering that [it] is testing cattle most at
risk of having BSE. More than 150 000 cattle have been tested since
BSE was 1st detected in 2003. All of Canada's cases have been
detected through the surveillance program.
These findings provide undisputable proof that [CFIA's] targeted
testing regime is effective and working as intended to closely
monitor the health of Canada's cattle herd. Under Canada's enhanced
feed ban, which comes into effect on 12 Jul 2007, BSE should be
eliminated from the national cattle herd within approximately 10
years. The CFIA expects the periodic detection of a limited number of
cases to continue as the level of BSE continues to decline.
