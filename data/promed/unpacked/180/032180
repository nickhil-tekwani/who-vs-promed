Investigation at Fat Duck restaurant - update
---------------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) is aware of reports in the media
about norovirus being linked to the outbreak of diarrhoea and
vomiting illness associated with the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray,
Berkshire. [This restaurant is one of only 3 in the United Kingdom
and Ireland that have received a 3-star Michelin Guide rating. In
2005, it was named as the best restaurant in the world by Restaurant
magazine. - Mod.CP]. The in-depth investigation into what has caused
529 people to date to report being ill after eating at the restaurant
is continuing and so far, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has
detected norovirus infection in 6 staff and 8 diners and weaknesses
in how staff sickness was identified and dealt with.

Based on staff interviews, sickness records and samples taken, it is
clear that staff worked while still infectious with norovirus. HPA
guidance* states that people should not work in food preparation
while they have symptoms/are infectious as a result of diarrhoea and
vomiting, to avoid the risk of passing the infection to others. Advice
given to the restaurant by the HPA and environmental health officers
from the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead prior to its
reopening last week [week of 9 Mar 2009], included guidance on the
identification and management of staff illness.

When the Health Protection Agency's investigation is complete, a full
report will be published.

Diarrhoea and vomiting can be caused by infectious or non-infectious
agents. All cases of gastroenteritis should, however, be regarded as
infectious unless good evidence suggests otherwise.

All cases of gastroenteritis should be regarded as potentially
infectious and should normally be excluded, from work, school, or
other institutional settings, until at least 48 hours after the person
is free from diarrhoea and/or vomiting. It is particularly important
to assess infected people who belong to one of the 4 [sic] groups for
whom special action should be considered:

Group A: any person of doubtful personal hygiene or with
unsatisfactory toilet, hand-washing, or hand drying facilities at
home, work, or school.
Group B: children who attend pre-school groups or nursery.
Group C: people whose work involves preparing or serving unwrapped
foods not subjected to further heating.

illness can be found on the HPA website at

infections: guidelines for public health physicians and environmental
health officers"

Gastrointestinal Infections, December 2004

[Norovirus is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis
(diarrhoea and vomiting) in England and Wales. The illness is
generally mild and people usually recover fully within 2-3 days;
there are no long term effects that result from being infected.
Noroviruses are named after the original strain "Norwalk virus,"
which caused an outbreak of gastroenteritis in a school in Norwalk,
Ohio, in 1968. Currently, there are at least 4 norovirus genogroups
affecting humans (GI, GII, GIII, and GIV), which in turn are divided
into at least 20 genetic clusters.

The incubation period for norovirus-associated gastroenteritis in
humans is usually between 24 and 48 hours, but cases can occur within
12 hours of exposure. Norovirus infection usually presents as
acute-onset vomiting, watery non-bloody diarrhea with abdominal
cramps, and nausea. Noroviruses are transmitted primarily through the
fecal-oral route, either by consumption of fecally contaminated food
or water or by direct person-to-person spread.

Environmental and fomite contamination may also act as a source of
infection. No evidence suggests that infection occurs through the
respiratory system.
