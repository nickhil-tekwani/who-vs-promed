Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Uganda - WHO Update 9
-------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 25 Oct, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported 176 cases of
Ebola hemorrhagic fever, including 64 deaths [compared with the 165 cases
and 60 deaths, reported 24 hours earlier on Tue 24 Oct 2000.
There have been suspected cases reported from several settlements for
internally displaced persons in Gulu district and mobile teams of health
care workers and volunteers are carrying out case finding and contact
tracing in these settlements. The focus is also on increasing public
awareness of the disease and its containment. A Radio Communications Centre
has been established in Gulu. Twenty hand-held radios with a dedicated
frequency have been dispersed to the mobile teams who are now able to inform
the Centre quickly of suspected cases and contacts, request transport for
ill persons and request burial teams.
To date, the National Task Force for the Control of Viral Haemorrhagic
Fevers has not confirmed any cases outside Gulu district in Uganda. WHO
supports enhanced surveillance but does not recommend any special
restrictions on travel or trade with Uganda.
