The recent ProMED posting on the game bird (cockfighting) industry in
California reinforces the comments made previously by Dr Richard
Breitmeyer of the California Department of Food and Agriculture
(ProMED 6 Feb 03), i.e., that END will certainly be maintained as an
endemic disease in the backyard and game-fowl population in
California and elsewhere.
Law enforcement has not been able to eliminate or even reduce the
popularity of cockfighting in the 98 years of having legislation on
the books. Therefore it is not likely that they will be able to do so
now, even in the face of a disease crisis. When I worked on Saipan -
where cockfighting is legal - it was big business, very big business,
especially the betting. I suspect the same is true here.
Therefore, continuing to pursue a "traditional" program of detection
and slaughter to control a disease which is present in a population
of animals that is used for illegal activity, would seem to be
ignoring reality. (Please note, I am opposed to cockfighting and do
think it should be eliminated.)
In light of this, has there been any movement on the part of the
poultry industry or the regulatory agencies toward using quarantine,
limited depletion, and intensified vaccination as recommended by Dr
Breitmeyer?
Actually, I would put biosecurity at the top of the list of things to
do. I worked in England for 60 days on the Foot and Mouth Disease
outbreak in 2001. Those farmers that appealed their depopulation
orders and won their appeal, did so based on their demonstrable
biosecurity measures. None of those farms became infected, and some
were eventually the only ones left in a landscape devoid of livestock.
Regulatory agency resources might be better utilized to assess,
recommend, and supervise (i.e., enforce) farm-level biosecurity. Be
it END, foot and mouth disease, or anything else for that matter,
strict and ongoing biosecurity programs aimed at preventing the
movement of disease agents to or from a farm are critical for the
survival of animal agriculture in the 21st century.

[Dr. Allen's letter highlights the need for other measures, such as
education of the animal owners, or perhaps trainers and fighters. To
that end, the following article from the Ponca City News follows
appropriately. Lastly, there are the questions regarding
vaccinations/quarantines, which are addressed later in this post
through an inquiry and response from the USDA. - Mod.TG]

Lack of Reporting Complicates Outbreak of Foreign Diseases
--------------------
It appears reports associated with the foreign animal disease
outbreak of Newcastle Disease in California and Nevada were
complicated by non-commercial animal owners who did not take their
birds to vets or a lab until after hundreds in the general [bird]
population died.
This is said to be one of the factors that inhibited a rapid
diagnosis, complicating the scope of containment and control of the
outbreak. Education initiatives that target non-commercial animal
owners represent a significant need nationwide. This is especially
important in the context of bioterrorism, agricultural security, and
emergency preparedness (Agricultural Security and Emergency
Preparedness:
Protecting One of America's Critical Infrastructures:
<http://www.humanitarian.net /biodefense/papers/ASEP-2001-12.html>
In the case of New Castle Disease, if an outbreak is not defined in
its early stages, complex variables could accompany the infectious
agent being firmly established prior to its recognition.
(APHIS Fact Sheet:
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/fs_ahend.html>)
The seriousness of this discussion has been demonstrated by the rapid
demographic spread of West Nile Virus throughout North America via
migratory bird patterns (CDC: Migratory Birds and Spread of West Nile
Virus in the Western Hemisphere:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol6no4/rappole.htm>
USGS - Principle Migratory Routes from North America:
<http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/othrdata/migratio/routes.htm>.
In the case of Newcastle Disease, Psittacines and other birds can be
reservoirs of infection and can continue to excrete virus for up to
12 months after recovering from clinical disease.
NDV is capable of infecting a wide variety of avian species. In
addition to poultry, more than 230 species from more than one half of
the 50 orders of birds have been found to be susceptible to natural
or experimental infections with avian paramyxoviruses:
<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/pub_metadata/field_manual/chapter_21.pdf>
When assessing the threat of foreign animal disease outbreaks on
backyard farms, in areas such as Southern California, populations
include socially distinct groups such as the Hispanic community, with
cultural and linguistic differences, little discretionary income, and
a significant percentage without health coverage.
In many cases, the high cost of veterinary services discourages the
pursuit of animal health care, a factor that compromises mechanisms
for disease reporting. In the light of this challenge, educational
initiatives are needed to inform the general public on how to report
sick or dead birds/animals to the appropriate agency in their state.

"Question for the forum: Were the positive birds previously
vaccinated against Newcastle Disease? What vaccines were used: Live?
Killed? Both?"
It is important to know whether a campaign vaccinating 100 percent of
the population of the game birds and companion avian pets could
prevent the problem.

The following is APHIS' official response, for attribution:
"The State-Federal END (exotic Newcastle disease) Task Force
personnel report that some of the backyard fowl in the CA outbreak
have been vaccinated. Vials of Newcastle disease virus vaccine of
Mexican origin have been discovered on some of the depopulated
premises.
It has been reported that vaccination of poultry during the outbreak
in the early 1970s in CA was not helpful to control the outbreak. It
has been suggested that, in fact, the vaccination program may have
been responsible for spreading the virus because of poor biosecurity
by the vaccination crews.
During the outbreak of END in Mexico in 2000, a vaccination program
with attenuated virus vaccine that is widely used throughout the
commercial poultry industry in the US was used. Producers sustained
heavy losses with this vaccination program; the program was based on
off-label use of 1/2 doses of vaccine instead of full doses.
Nevertheless, it is likely that END virus exposure would overcome the
immunity provided by attenuated virus vaccination alone. After the
2000 outbreak in Mexico, the government-mandated vaccination program
employed in commercial chickens was a combination of inactivated and
attenuated virus at one day of age and again at 8-12 days of age,
followed by attenuated virus vaccination every 2 weeks thereafter.
Vaccine efficacy studies after the outbreak concluded that attenuated
virus vaccines alone will not control END, and 2 doses of inactivated
virus vaccine doses in the face of END virus challenge are effective
in preventing clinical disease, but not infection and shedding of
virulent END virus.
There have been discussions with poultry experts and the
State-Federal Task Force Incident Commanders about END vaccination
issues, including possible vaccination of backyard fowl, perimeter
vaccination of premises with back yard poultry/game fowl located
around commercial poultry premises, and flock vaccination in the
unlikely event that there are any unvaccinated commercial poultry
premises. It is believed that all END virus vaccines can reduce
virus shedding and reduce the severity of clinical signs of disease,
but vaccines do not prevent infection, virus shedding, and the
development of infected virulent virus carriers. Attenuated viruses
can re-circulate from vaccine virus carrier birds and could cause
clinical disease in incompletely immunized or unvaccinated birds.
Vaccines considered are:
- an attenuated virus vaccine that is easy to administer
(intraocularly) and provides good immunity. Vaccinated birds cannot
be differentiated serologically from END virus-infected birds, the
vaccine does not prevent infection with END virus which can be shed
from vaccinated birds, vaccine virus can be shed by vaccinated birds,
vaccine may mask infection with END virus,
recombination/recirculation of vaccine and END viruses may occur, and
there are some disease or production losses associated with
vaccination.
- inactivated virus vaccines stimulate a good antibody response.
These are administered intramuscularly, are labor-intensive, and
share many of the shortcomings of attenuated virus vaccines.
- a recombinant chimeric vaccine that would permit serologic
differentiation of vaccinated from infected birds. The vaccine is
not available in the US, but likely shares many of the shortcomings
of attenuated virus vaccines.
- a recombinant fowl pox vectored vaccine. The onset of immunity is
reputed to be slow, and the vaccine likely shares many of the
shortcomings of attenuated virus vaccines.
Implementation of a backyard fowl vaccination program has been
considered. However, the Task Force personnel have the impression
that a large percentage of the industry currently is vaccinating with
some product at various intervals, but there is no standardized
program in place. A standardized vaccination program would likely
reduce the amount of virus in the environment. Use of intraocular
attenuated virus vaccine would be most consistent with current
industry practice, but may make the presence of END more difficult to
detect and is likely to cause some vaccine-related disease. It is
unclear how the initiation of an attenuated virus vaccine program
would affect our ability to eradicate END.
In summary, the use of various vaccines has been considered and while
the option has not been rejected, due to the limitations of vaccines,
they are not believed to be a real solution to the problem. There is
also the issue -- a major difficulty all along in this outbreak --
that not all backyard flock owners are readily identifiable. In
fact, some owners may be obscuring the existence of their birds
deliberately due to associated illegal activities."
