[1] Comment on disease severity
Date: Tue 21 Jul 2009
From: Julian Tang <jwtang49@hotmail.com>


At the risk of recent over-exposure, I would just like to follow up
on Dr Peter Sandman's comments in the ProMED post: "Influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (06): case reporting, archive number
20090717.2553." The comments by Peter Sandman are timely; finally,
someone has stated explicitly what many of us who are involved
diagnostically in this field really suspect. Yet this may go against
the popular notion in many countries that this influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus is a more deadly virus than seasonal influenza.

However, there is an issue about the number of severe cases being
admitted to ICUs [Intensive Care Units]; these are being cited as
being higher for this influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus than for
seasonal influenza. This may also be a problem of case ascertainment
bias for the seasonal influenza cases.

Usually for seasonal influenza (for which very few cases are lab-
confirmed), since it is familiar, most people may not attend
healthcare services so readily. So the patients who finally present
with severe respiratory failure to ICUs are often diagnosed with
bacterial pneumonias that may in fact be secondary to an initial
respiratory virus infection. Yet, at the time of presentation, this
virus may no longer be detectable, and ICUs usually do not look for
them.

Having spoken to various ICU teams over the years, they agree that
they rarely screen for respiratory virus infections in their ICU
patients for 2 main reasons: 1) even if there is a respiratory virus
(e.g. adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, etc.), there
is not much they can do about it; even oseltamivir's beneficial
effects are fairly marginal, and it needs to be given within 48 hours
of infection for such benefits to be seen, treating the presenting
secondary bacterial infection with respiratory support generally
works quite well, so why waste further resources on screening for any
earlier virus infection?

However, such undiagnosed cases of influenza that eventually lead to
secondary bacterial pneumonias may give a false impression of a lower
mortality for seasonal influenza infections as compared to the
current influenza pandemic H1N1 2009 strain. This may simply be
because in this pandemic climate with the influenza pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus rapidly becoming more prevalent in the community, patients
are more aware of viral infections generally, so they present earlier
to healthcare services whilst the virus is still present and
detectable.

Thus, their entire illness (which may, therefore, entail a longer
admission for observation, whether the infection eventually turns out
to be mild, moderate severe, or fatal) and any resulting
case-fatality can be attributed to this new virus.

This may thus give a misleading impression that this new pandemic
strain is causing more severe infections with a higher mortality in
hospitalized patients than seasonal influenza, which may, in fact,
not be the case, though demonstrating this may be practically
difficult (it would require people who would normally stay at home to
tough out their illness to come into hospital for a diagnostic
nasopharyngeal swab to be taken).

[2] Comment on obesity risk
Date: Wed 22 Jul 2009
From: Tom Kiedrzynski <TomK@spc.int>


As we're working in the Pacific Island region, where there is a high
prevalence of obesity in some of the populations, it is important for
us to know the real risk that obesity plays for influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection complications, as many countries have
scarce resources to respond to the pandemic, especially for patient
care. Until now, I haven't seen an estimate of the risk obesity (and
possibly other potential risk factors, e.g. pregnancy) poses with the
current pandemic virus.

As mentioned by the moderator, "...obesity may be a risk factor for
severe complications following infections with this virus," and
nothing has been proven yet. This is also what is explained in the
MMWR article referred to hereunder: "Intensive-Care Patients With
Severe Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection --- Michigan, June
2009."

Similarly, the title of the ProMED posting below should include a
question mark at the end, as some "fast readers" may interpret it as
a fact that obesity is a risk factor.

Clearly, if we have a certain prevalence of obesity in the
population, it is expected that complications happen in the same
proportion of this group as for healthy adults, and, with reference
to the MMWR article, the USA is known for a high prevalence of
obesity. So the question to answer is: are complications
significantly more frequent among the obese population than among
healthy adults once they are infected by the influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus? How could we get this answer?

Another question to answer would be whether healthy adults are a
group at risk themselves, and of what age group exactly, as the
pandemic seems to affect more young adults.

"Erring on the cautious side of the line" is logical, but sometimes
it seems to become nearly as strong as scientifically proven facts.

In the Pacific Island region as elsewhere, especially in developing
countries, we'd like to see more evidence in order to be able to
allocate our meager resources more appropriately and give special
attention to populations at real risk for complications, if this is
possible.

And for sure, we welcome any hint regarding this type of evidence, as
there may be information that we have missed!
