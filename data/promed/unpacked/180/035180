A total of 448 cases of dengue fever including 58 haemorrhagic dengue cases
involving 7 deaths were reported nationwide up to 10 Jul 1999, said Health
Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng.
However, he said, the figure represented a drop of 14.6 per cent compared to
the corresponding period of last year when there were 467 cases including 38
of haemorrhagic dengue involving 6 deaths.
Johor State
----------------
The number of cases reported in Johor for the whole of last year [1998 was
1595, which put the state as the sixth highest in terms of the number of
dengue cases reported in the country, he told reporters today.
Of the total, he said, 1426 cases were normal [classical dengue fever while
169 cases
were haemorrhagic dengue.
Chua said the number of deaths due to dengue fever in the state for the
whole of 1998, however, rose to 24 compared with only 14 in the previous
year.
Control
----------
On enforcement, Chua said so far the ministry together with the local
authorities had inspected 196 438 premises throughout the country of which
1209 were found to breed _Aedes_ larvae. He said 100 674 premises were
fogged and 1049 premises were compounded [sic while one case was taken to
court. [Can somebody please tell us what "compounded" means? - Mod.JW
In this context, he reminded the public not to allow the _Aedes_ mosquito to
breed in their compound as they could be fined under the law.

[We would be interested to know whether the 100 674 premises fogged were
treated individually from the inside by hand sprayers, or estimated from the
number of city blocks on the route of spray vehicles or outdoor sprayers.
Because people close their windows to keep out the smell of the spray,
vehicle spraying is not effective in killing mosquitoes resting inside
houses - Mod.JW
