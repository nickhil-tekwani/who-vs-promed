I agree with the concerns of Dr. Klaphake regarding the
recommendation of meloxicam as "safe". There is no such thing as a
drug without potential side effects. While it appears to be
comparatively less toxic than some other NSAIDs, I have seen
histologic renal lesions consistent with NSAID toxicosis in birds
administered meloxicam at doses as low as 0.3mg/kg q24h, in cases
where there was no other reasonable explanation for the lesions. The
moderator's comment regarding "the implication of capture/endoscopic
examination of these sensitive and wild birds" ignores the potential
impact on whole species of acting without any data. The study on
which the recommendation of meloxicam as "safe" was made was actually
conducted on non-releasable African white-backed vultures and not an
Asian vulture species, and, as Dr. Klaphake states, blood chemistry
and survival are insensitive tests for renal damage in birds. If the
data is examined, meloxicam at higher doses did result in increases!
in uric acid that were close to statistical significance in this
relatively small sample size. Endoscopic renal biopsy is a fairly
routine procedure in birds, and, given the implications of
conclusions for entire species, can be easily justified in
nonreleasable animals. The study may be read here:

Swan G, Naidoo V, Cuthbert R, Green RE, Pain DJ, et al. (2006)
Removing the threat of diclofenac to critically endangered Asian
vultures. PLoS Biol 4(3): e66.
<http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040066>.

A criticism of another study, where a more divergent model species
and a smaller sample size were used, may be seen here:

R. Cuthbert, D.J. Pain, R.E. Green, G. Swan, D. Swarup. 2007.
Comparative toxicity studies of NSAIDs in birds: A criticism of Reddy
et al. Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 23:254-255.

These same criticisms may reasonably be applied to the 1st study.

[I agree with what Dr. Wellehan has said, but there is a difference
between non-release species and my original comment of capture of
wild birds. - Mod.TG]
