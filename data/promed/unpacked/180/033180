More than 20 people at a Rochester wedding reception got sick after
eating chips Friday night [1 Aug 2008] that were contaminated with
norovirus, possibly from fecal matter. "Initial reports came through
from a member of the wedding party itself, indicating ... a number of
people being ill," said Kari Etrheim, public information officer for
Olmsted County Public Health.

The illness spread after an infected guest grabbed handfuls of chips
at the reception hall, Etrheim said. "Most likely, the chips were
contaminated from someone in the party," epidemiologist Larry
Edmonson said. The chips were "statistically implicated," he said.

"Noroviruses spread primarily through consumption of food or water
contaminated by fecal matter or through close contact with infected
people," says MayoClinic.com. Anyone who ate chips before the
infected guest escaped unscathed. But those who ate them
afterward unknowingly risked illness.

Norovirus usually causes diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting within
24 to 48 hours of exposure, says the Mayo Web site. Symptoms last one
to 5 days, and most people recover completely without treatment.
"However, in some people -- especially infants, older adults and
people with underlying disease -- vomiting and diarrhea can be
severely dehydrating and require medical attention," the site says.
The 1st call about the wedding reception at the Rochester Eagles Club
was received at around 3:30 p.m. Monday [4 Aug 2008]. By 6 p.m., at
least 8 public-health experts were investigating. "I think we
conducted 74 interviews Monday evening; it's much easier when you're
given a list of people who were there," Etrheim said. Symptoms of
foodborne illness typically show up 36 to 48 hours after exposure, she said.

Because of quick response, cooperation and a contained outbreak, it's
unlikely others will become ill, health officials said. It's a
reminder of the value of a basic lesson school kids learn: wash your hands.

"Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands," Etrheim said.
"If you're feeling ill, and if you've had diarrhea, we really ask
people to refrain from cooking and helping
with any food preparation activities for 3 days after the illness has
subsided."

Norovirus [infection] is common, and symptoms usually resolve on
their own, Etrheim said. "Go out there and wash your hands -- I feel
like a broken record -- you've got to wash your hands thoroughly,"
Etrheim said. "It is our number-one defense."

[A timely reminder that norovirus infection can be a food-borne
disease and that contamination can occur at all stages of food
preparation, delivery and consumption. In this case, the outbreak has
been traced to contamination of a communal supply of chips provided
for guests prior to the formal wedding reception. The culprit is
inferred to have been one or more guests with deficient personal
hygiene. - Mod.CP]
