The office of the director of the San Jose Department [state or province
equivalent] has confirmed a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in a youth
of 21 years. The patient is interned at home. The young man, currently
residing in the Kiyu spa, department of San Jose, was discharged this
afternoon [16 Apr 2010] after having contracted [a] hantavirus [infection],
a [viral] disease transmitted by field mice. These rodents transmit the
disease [virus] through excreta or urine. It is worth noting that the
infection is not contagious between humans. [This is not correct in the
case of Andes hantavirus infections, but is probably accurate for the
hantavirus involved in this case. - Mod.TY]

According to the referring epidemiologist, Alicia Marizcurrena, the youth
was released this Friday afternoon [16 Apr 2010]. She indicated, also, that
this patient presented with a "severe" influenza-like picture, which
evolved rapidly. "Luckily, [the patient] could be moved to the secondary
level of [medical] attention, and was provided with the necessary
respiratory measures. Now he has to convalesce, first, try to not expose
himself again to the virus. And 2nd [follow] the recommendations that
doctors have given on discharge," explained Marizcurrena.

With this confirmed case, the Ministry of Public Health exhorted extreme
care in homes because this is a disease [virus] of rodents [indicating],
"If one enters a house that has been closed for a long time, or a room
which is not usually open and could have rodents: 1st enter with masks;
2nd, ventilate for an hour and then enter to clean up. Always use gloves, a
bleach solution, and in a few hours one can return to the room."

A hantavirus [infection] causes a lethal disease. It is estimated that 50
per cent of the patients who contract it die. The symptoms are myalgia and
fever, headache, cough, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
mainly respiratory difficulties.

[San Jose is located in the south of the country, along the banks of the
San Jose River, near Montevideo. - Mod.LJS

Between 1997-1999, 15 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome were diagnosed
in Uruguay (see archives below). The area where the infection was acquired
in the case described above is too far east and in an unlikely habitat for
the hantavirus involved to be Andes virus. Hantaviruses (and their rodent
hosts) that could be the etiological agents responsible for this case of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, from a list kindly provided by Dr Jim Mills,
are Laguna Negra (_Calomys laucha_), Bermejo (_Oligoryzomys chacoensis_),
and Lechiguanas (_Oligoryzomys flavescens_).
