Today, the 1st case of influenza A (H1NI) in Guatemala was confirmed.
To date, the total of confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) recorded
is 1370, including 30 deaths, in 7 countries of the Americas (Mexico,
United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala).

To date, the United States has confirmed a total of 403 human cases
of influenza A (H1N1) in 38 States: 4 in Alabama, 17 in Arizona, 49
in California, 6 in Colorado, 2 in Connecticut, 20 in Delaware, 5 in
Florida, 1 in Georgia, 1 in Idaho, 82 in Illinois, 3 in Indiana, 1 in
Iowa, 2 in Kansas, 1 in Kentucky, 7 in Louisiana, 1 in Maine, 4 in
Maryland, 6 in Massachusetts, 2 in Michigan, 1 in Minnesota, 1 in
Missouri, 1 in Nebraska, 1 in Nevada, 1 in New Hampshire, 6 in New
Jersey, 1 in New Mexico, 90 in Nueva York, 1 in North Carolina, 3 in
Ohio, 15 in Oregon, 1 in Pennsylvania, 1 in Rhode Island, 16 in South
Carolina, 2 in Tennessee, 41 in Texas, 1 in Utah, 3 in Virginia and 3
in Wisconsin. Other suspected cases are being investigated. One death
has been registered, a child of 22 months old.

From [17 Apr 2009 to 4 May 2009], Mexico has reported 822 confirmed
cases of influenza A (H1N1), including 29 deaths. The states with the
highest number of confirmed cases are Distrito Federal, Estado de
Mexico, San Luis Potosi and Hidalgo. . The majority of these have
occurred in previously healthy young adult people. There have been
few cases in children under 5 years old (102/822).

In Canada, to date 140 human cases of influenza A (H1N1) have been
confirmed (24 in Alberta, 39 in British Columbia, 2 in New Brunswick,
38 in Nova Scotia, 3 in Quebec, 1 in Manitoba, 31 in Ontario and 2 in
Prince Edward Island) some of them with recent trip history to
Cancun, Mexico. All the cases developed a mild form of influenza like
illness. Some of the cases presented, in addition, gastrointestinal
symptoms. All of them are currently recovered and none required
hospitalization. Laboratory tests were conducted in Winnipeg, Canada.
Indigenous transmission is not discarded since not all the confirmed
cases have trip history to Mexico

On [2 May 2009], Costa Rica notified 1 confirmed case of influenza A
(H1N1) On [3 May 2009], Colombia reported 1 confirmed case of
influenza A (H1N1), while El Salvador reported 2 confirmed cases of
influenza A (H1N1). On [5 May 2009], Guatemala notified 1 confirmed
case of influenza A (H1N1) in a person that has travelled to Mexico.

Various countries of the Region are reporting suspected and probable
cases. This indicates that surveillance enhancement is producing results.

Graficas de Influenza "

Dr. Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos, Federal Minister of Health:

Ladies and Gentlemen: Let's begin this conference with a presentation
of the current status of the epidemic.

This is how we have devided this presentation; we going to present in
a very rapid form, but providing information on the monitoring we
have been doing, the actual situation of the initiatives, especially
the availability of antivirals, the world situation and conclusions
and recommendations.

Methodololgy: There has been direct collection of data from the
field. This is done at 6 PM daily and covers information among the
institutions.

Sources of information: The ISSSTE [Government employees health
system], IMSS [Social Security] provide their institutional
databases; the Ministry of Health and State departments of health.

And finally, the analyses made, and cross validation of data from
different institutions, the analysis of the evolution of data and
regional trends of the epidemic.

As we have said, there were definitions that were established and
used in this document: First, suspected cases, when we are still in
the process of establishing a confirmed diagnosis. All patients that
come to the attention of the health sector for fever, cough and
difficulty breathing, we are including as suspected cases of A(H1N1).

A probable case is one in which there has been a specimen taken and
the specimen is being processed via molecular biology. And a proven
case is one where the specimen is positive.

Evolution of the epidemic. With respect to the evolution of the
epidemic, you can see that up through today [5 May 2009] we have 866
confirmed cases. Even in this moment we are running more tests, but
as of [close of business] yesterday there were 866 cases.

These cases [866 confirmed] correspond to 32.2 percent of the cases
on which specimens were obtained and of these, 50.9 percent were
women. With respect to confirmation of suspected cases, 47.8 percent
of the specimens obtained from young people between 10 and 19 years
of age were positive. The age group with a lower confirmation rate
(or more false positive [referring to considering these cases as
suspected cases?]) are those older than 60 years of age, of which
there were only 16.5 percent were confirmed.

There is a graph that demonstrates that 73.7 percent of the cases
older than 60 years were women.

There is a graph that shows that of the 866 confirmed cases, there is
a downward trend by date having begun on 26 Apr and now there are
substantially lower numbers of cases reported [on a daily basis].

This is observed [the trend of decreasing case reports] not only
among confirmed cases but also among suspected cases.

With respect to the reported deaths, there were initially 214
reported deaths attributable to acute pneumonia. Of these 74 were
definitively discarded based on clinical studies. This left 140
possible deaths due to A (H1N1). Of these, as you know, 26 were
confirmed through molecular biologic studies. We presently have 37
laboratory studies pending on others. There remain 77 deaths on whom
we were unable to obtain specimens so confirmation will not be
possible and they will remain as suspected cases.

What is already known is that the majority of deaths were between 20
and 39 years of age [according to the attached *pdf file, 18 of the
26 deaths were aged 20 - 39 years, whereas 273 of the confirmed cases
were in this age group, with an age specific case fatality rate of
6.6 percent, when compared with an overall case fatality rate of 3.0.
- Mod.MPP], and the last confirmed case [?death] was on 29 Apr 2009.

Regional trends. [there is a graph on the *pdf file one can download
demonstrating all of the above discussed data and the regional trends
- Mod.MPP]

Initiatives. In the case of drugs, we had originally planned on a
million doses of antivirals as part of the avian influenza
preparedness initiative. We have provided the laboratories 410 000
treatments. Each treatment involves 10 doses, we received a donation
of another 400 000 treatments so our reserve is approximately 810 000
treatments. IMSS received 205 000 treatments, the states have
received 242 182 treatments, the hospitals and specialty units have
receivd 39 456 treatments. We now have a reserve of 1 323 362
treatments. This will be adjusted slightly to reflect a little more
than 200 000 treatments which are being provided by PAHO.

[the remainder of the conference was truncated and not available on
the website].

[To summarize the current situation, as of 5 May 2009 there have been
a total of 1490 cases and 30 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection
officially reported to WHO/PAHO coming from 21 countries, up from
1085 confirmed cases and 26 deaths from 21 countries yesterday (4 May
2009). (According to the PAHO daily summary which was released later
than the WHO daily summary, there are now 1370 confirmed cases and 30
deaths attributable to A(H1N1) infection. This discrepancy is related
to the 6 hour time zone difference between WHO HQ [GMT] and PAHO HQ
[GMT -4] so that more reports from countries in the Americas region
time zone are included in the PAHO daily summary).

The USA has officially reported 403 laboratory confirmed cases and
one death coming from 38 states (compared with 279 cases from 36
states on 2 May 2009), and one death in a Mexican child visiting in
the USA (according to a newswire there is now a 2nd death in the USA
in a known chronically ill woman, but official confirmation is
pending). Canada has reported 165 cases from 8 provinces with no
deaths, up from 140 cases from 8 provinces on 2 May 2009. Mexico has
reported 866 confirmed cases with 26 deaths (compared with 727 cases
and 26 deaths on 4 May 2009 -- according to the PAHO update prepared
later in the day than the Mexico MOH website data, there have been 30
confirmed deaths in Mexico) .

Of interest, while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) for the
confirmed cases in Mexico is 3.0 percent, the CFR for the 20-39 year
old age group is 6.6 percent. More detailed information on the deaths
in terms of possible underlying illnesses that would predispose to
more severe disease, and actual cause of death (e.g. acute
respiratory distress syndrome, primary viral pneumonia, secondary
bacterial pneumonia) are presently not available.
