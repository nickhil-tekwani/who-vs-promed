LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE AND LEGIONELLOSIS
=======================================

[see
Legionellosis, 1995 - Denmark 970228182113]
Just after the [in]famous outbreak of respiratory disease at an American
Legion convention in 1976, 144 people developed a "flu-like" illness in
Pontiac, Michigan, characterized by fever, myalgia and headache...without
pneumonia (Glick TH et al, Am J Epidemiol, 1978; 107:149). In contrast to
classical legionnaires disease [LD] which carries a case-fatality rate as
high as 20%, none of the patients with "Pontiac fever" died. Other
differences included an incubation period of 1 to 2 days (2 to 10 for LD);
and attack rate of 95% (1 to 5% in the American Legion outbreak).
The GIDEON software notes that Pontiac fever has been ascribed to _Legionella
anisa_, _L. micdadei_, _L. feeleii_ and _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1. I
suspect that Pontiac fever is not included in the Danish reporting scheme
(defined in the ProMed note as "...cases of _Legionella pneumophila_")
because of the distinct bacteriology and non-specific / benign nature of the
illness.
By the way, to my knowledge, _Legionella_ is the only taxon named for a
social organization.

[Au contrere. Pontiac fever was discovered in 1967 and shown much later to
have been caused by _Legionella pneumophila_; it was not discovered after
legionnaire's disease (1976). So, a serious disease caused by _Legionella
pneumophila_ is reportable but a milder disease caused by _Legionella
pneumophila_ is not; probably some subtypes and varieties complicating this
diagnostic situation. Given that _Legionella_ sp. are difficult to cultivate
in the laboratory, yet grow nicely in shower heads, air-conditioning vaults
(cooling towers), etc. it may be that this (these) organism(s) may in some
way be dependent for their growth (metabolism) on other organisms, such as
bacteria and/or amoeba. Perhaps Joe McDade (i.e., _Legionella micdadei_)
is reading ProMED-mail these days and might be willing to add to the
confusion I think I am causing. As for the naming of this disease after a
social organization, it is unfortunate that this particular group of people
were having an annual meeting in a hotel in Philadelphia; not at all the
fault of the organization, just bad luck to have been in the hotel at the
time. Better to have named the disease after the hotel. Then it would have
been the first disease named after a hotel. -- Mod CHC]
