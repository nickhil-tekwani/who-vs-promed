New Plan for Smallpox Attack
------------------------
Federal health officials today instructed states to prepare to vaccinate
every American in the event of a biological attack using smallpox, and
issued a detailed plan showing how each state could quickly inoculate as
many as one million people in the first 10 days.
In releasing their most comprehensive smallpox preparedness plan to date,
officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]
said publicly for the first time that even one case of smallpox might
result in a nationwide program of voluntary vaccinations. That is in part
because even a single case could be a harbinger of a larger outbreak and in
part because even one case would undoubtedly spark panic and a clamor for
vaccine.
"We want to step up preparedness," Julie Gerberding, the director of the
CDC, said in an interview. "If there is actually exposure and risk, we want
to be able to vaccinate quickly. If there is anxiety, we also want to do it
quickly."
But the new guidance for states is far from encyclopedic, and experts
complained that the center's 48-page document failed to answer questions
about the timing, cost, and logistical hurdles of preparing thousands of
health professionals and volunteers to conduct mass vaccinations while
keeping the public calm. Critics said a superficial plan could sap public
confidence, worsening the effects of a smallpox crisis.
"It's putting a lot of responsibility in a short time on local clinics,
which will be untested," said Caroline B. Hall, a professor of infectious
diseases at the University of Rochester's School of Medicine. "The quilt is
only as good as the stitches. One tiny thread breaks, and the whole thing
unravels."
Smallpox, which was eradicated worldwide 2 decades ago, is highly
contagious and kills roughly a third of its victims, making it a
potentially fearsome biological weapon. Officially, the virus is supposed
to exist only in repositories in Moscow and the CDC's headquarters in
Atlanta, but experts have long suspected that some nations harbor secret
stocks of smallpox to use as a biological weapon.
Today's release of the "Smallpox Vaccination Clinic Guide" comes as the
United States is mobilizing for a possible attack on one of those nations,
Iraq. Dr. Gerberding described this as "an unfortunate coincidence of
timing," and said the guide was simply an update of a preparedness plan
first issued 2 years ago, before the attacks on New York and the Pentagon
and the subsequent anthrax attacks.
Bioterrorism experts said the administration's timing could not be ignored.
"They know the best time for Saddam to hit us, if he has the smallpox
weapon, would be before we go in so he can terrify the American people,"
said an adviser to the Bush administration on smallpox policy. "In that
case, it is definitely good to have these guidelines out there."
The plan does not specify what kind of attack would spur a mass vaccination
campaign, or who would make the decision to initiate one. Agency officials
said that absent a declaration of a national emergency by the president
they would make the decision in consultation with state health officials.
The vaccine is one of the few that can work even if a person is already
infected, and experts say it can protect people if given within 4 days of
exposure to the virus. The guide says up to 75 million doses of the
nation's vaccine stockpile could be shipped in a single day and 280 million
doses, enough to cover every American, in 5 to 7 days.
The guidelines call for states to run 20 clinics 16 hours a day, an effort
that the government estimates would require 4680 public health workers and
volunteers. Depending on the size and severity of the outbreak and where it
is, the guidelines said more or fewer participating clinics could be
needed. In state capitols around the country, health commissioners said
they welcomed the advice but fretted about whether they would be able to
carry it out.
In Maryland, Dr. Georges Benjamin, secretary of the Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene, said he had already told his staff to integrate the
document into the existing bioterrorism preparedness plan.
"What is astounding is the number of people it would take to actually make
this thing happen," Dr. Benjamin said. Asked if he could conduct a mass
vaccination right away, he said, "We would do what we had to do, but it
would be tough. I would hate to try to do this tomorrow."
There is no set timetable by which states must comply, Dr. Gerberding said,
adding that the disease control agency hoped that states would conduct
preparedness exercises as they develop their own plans.
Replete with flowcharts and checklists, the center's guide covers things
like how many security officers would be needed for each clinic to contain
an unruly crowd (2 per clinic per day) and how many minutes it would take
people to fill out the medical history screening forms (2 to 3).
It deals with how clinics should handle people who refuse to be vaccinated
and reminds states that they must plan for huge numbers of fatalities.
"Plan for vaccinating mortuary personnel and their families," the guide says.
But the plan does not address the vexing, and politically delicate, issue
of whether to vaccinate public health workers and emergency personnel
before a terrorist attack. The White House is weighing whether to permit
such vaccinations. Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human
services, has said a decision is expected by the end of this month.
Many public health experts say the precautionary vaccinations are
necessary. "These people need to be protected," said Dr. Mohammed Akhter,
the executive director of the American Public Health Association. "If we do
not do that, and we just go to this plan, then these workers will be
standing in line to get their vaccination rather than helping us" vaccinate
others.
But the issue is complicated because the vaccine, made from a live virus,
carries risks to patients with skin disorders and immune system
deficiencies, including people with AIDS. And those who are vulnerable are
endangered not only by being inoculated, but also by contact with others
who have been inoculated.
"It's very hard to say without a clear threat who should and who shouldn't
be vaccinated," said Tara O'Toole, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for
Civilian Biodefense Strategies. "Some analyses suggest that if you have
ever had eczema or live with someone who has, you shouldn't get vaccinated,
and by some estimates that eliminates 30 million Americans."
Dr. O'Toole said she thought the plan "makes great good sense," because it
assumes that the nation must be ready to vaccinate a large number of people
on short notice.
The center's previous smallpox preparedness plan revolved around a strategy
in which public health workers would track down and vaccinate infected
people and those who came into contact with them, working in concentric
circles until the outbreak was contained.
The new document does not supplant the "ring vaccination" plan, Dr.
Gerberding said. But Dr. Bill Bicknell, a professor of international health
at Boston University critical of that strategy, said the guide was
undoubtedly influenced by recent studies showing that ring vaccination
would not contain a large outbreak. He said studies had found that if 1000
people were infected in a large city like New York and ring vaccination
were used, within 3 months there would be 300 000 cases of smallpox and 100
000 deaths, and the epidemic would not be contained. But mass vaccination,
he said, would contain such an epidemic in 40 to 45 days, with 1500 cases
and 500 deaths.
"If they do it correctly, with the proper planning, you can vaccinate
millions and millions of people in a very short time," Dr. Bicknell said.
And he noted that until recently, a mass vaccination policy would have been
implausible, because the nation did not have a big enough vaccine stockpile
to carry it out. Federal officials began building a smallpox vaccine
stockpile after last year's anthrax attacks. Mr. Thompson, the health
secretary, signed contracts with two companies to buy 209 million doses to
add to the existing stockpile of vaccine, some of which dates to the
1950's. In the interim, studies have shown that the existing stockpile
could be diluted.
Government officials have offered differing assessments of whether there is
now enough vaccine for every American. In a recent interview, Dr. Anthony
S. Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, said there was, adding, "If we had an emergency tomorrow, we'd be
good to go."
During a briefing today to discuss the state guidance, Dr. Joseph
Henderson, the center's associate director for terrorism preparedness,
said, "On an emergency basis, if we saw smallpox tomorrow and felt the need
to do mass vaccination, we could vaccinate 155 million individuals."

NEWS ANALYSIS
Guide for Mass Smallpox Vaccinations: Recipe With Missing Ingredients
---------------------------------
The new guidelines for states on mass smallpox vaccinations are most
notable for what was omitted: unanswered and often unaddressed are critical
questions like timing, costs, feasibility, and the multiple problems of
preparing health care workers to conduct vaccinations and communicating the
plans to the public.
The guidelines fit with the Bush administration's recent optimistic
pronouncements about the nation's readiness to confront germ terrorism. But
experts questioned the plan's depth, breadth, and realism, warning that
superficiality can sap public confidence and, in a crisis, widen a health
calamity.
Dr. Mohammed Akhter, executive director of the American Public Health
Association, called the plan good but questioned its feasibility. "This is
a huge and massive undertaking, the likes of which we've never seen in our
history," Dr. Akhter said. If a smallpox attack came tonight, he added,
"There's no way the state and local health departments would be able to
implement the plan."
Jonathan B. Tucker, a germ-weapons expert in Washington and author of
"Scourge," a book on the smallpox threat, said public confidence in the
plan was crucial for its success but judged the guidelines and their
explanation by federal officials wanting. "A real potential problem is how
you ensure that a vaccination process is orderly and people don't panic,"
Mr. Tucker said. "What we saw last fall with the anthrax attacks, which
were much less threatening than a smallpox outbreak would be, was public
hysteria. In the context of a vaccination campaign, that would be very
problematic."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has reassured the
public that federal officials are ready to respond. Dr. Julie Gerberding,
director of the centers, gave a wholehearted "yes" when asked if the agency
was prepared to handle deadly germ attacks.
"CDC's level of preparedness is very high," she said in a recent statement.
"We have the plans, the policies, the people, the products, and now we have
the practice to make sure we are ready to respond."
In theory, during a deadly outbreak, mass smallpox vaccinations can protect
many people: the vaccine is one of the few immunizations that can work even
if a person is already infected. The vaccine can fully protect people if
given within 4 days of exposure to the virus.
The new plan addresses only the most comprehensive response to an outbreak
of the contagious disease, which kills about one in 3 victims. It does not
address giving vaccinations to anyone before an attack or an outbreak, only
afterward.
While the new plan gives a blueprint for how to carry out mass
vaccinations, it says nothing about other precautions that, Dr. Gerberding
said in an interview, would continue to be the first line of defense. For
instance, it is federal policy for health workers first to isolate infected
patients and vaccinate people in close contact with them, forming a series
of rings of immunization around an outbreak and barriers to its spread.
Federal officials said the smallpox plan, [the agency's] third revision
since November 2001, was not a new policy but simply a set of detailed
recommendations for states on how to respond to a worst-case attack.
Dr. Mack Sewell, New Mexico's state epidemiologist, said achieving that
level of readiness "is a matter of time, attention and resources," all of
which are uncertain at this point.
Earlier this summer, federal officials said they would recommend
"preattack" vaccination for up to 500 000 emergency workers, but state
officials complain that they have received little or no guidance on the
critical question of how much vaccine will be made available, and when, or
who will have to be immunized ahead of time so they can carry out the mass
vaccinations.
"They've really been bobbing and weaving on this," said Gary L. Simpson,
director of the New Mexico infectious disease bureau. "We've looked at
numbers that range from 500 up to 50 000 people, and that's just in New
Mexico."
Federal officials said a plan for vaccinating emergency health care
workers, after repeated delays, was to be made public by month's end.
Dr. Tucker, a germ-weapons expert in the Washington office of the Monterey
Institute of International Studies, said the plan was haunted by
uncertainties over whether the states had the financial wherewithal and the
raw organizational skills to carry out mass vaccination quickly. Even
though the federal government has given the states $918 million to build
bioterror defenses, that may not be enough, Dr. Tucker said.
"These plans have to be exercised under realistic scenarios to make sure
they would actually work in a crisis," he said.
Dr. Tucker added that good public communication, vital to the plan's
success, seemed to be an afterthought. "It's very unclear whether CDC or
the states are developing the necessary communication strategy to prevent
panic in the event of an outbreak," he said.
The centers' briefing yesterday on the plan, Dr. Tucker added, was
strikingly lackluster. "It was very bureaucratic and full of jargon, so
even when they were speaking to reporters they were not speaking in plain
language," he said. "If they're going to communicate with the public,
they're going to have to do it in a simpler, more direct way."
The plan says nothing about how ready the federal government is to
distribute the rare vaccine to the states. For security reasons, much of
that information is kept secret to deny terrorists details that might let
them cripple defenses and make smallpox attacks more effective.
Federal officials assert that they can transport vaccine anywhere they need
in a matter of hours, not days. But it is unclear where it is stored and
how quickly it can in fact be distributed. The general goal is to be ready
to vaccinate every American by the end of this year.
Acambis, a company in Cambridge, England, is making 209 million doses of
the vaccine for the federal government but says it is barred from giving
out all but sketchy details of its progress. Last week, Acambis said it had
produced the first smallpox vaccination kits for the federal stockpile but
would not say how many were available. Each kit contains the dry vaccine,
fluid for its dilution, needles for its administration and forms to inform
the patient of its status as an investigational new drug.
Dr. Akhter, of the public health group, said an even bigger unknown was who
in Washington would make the decision to begin mass vaccinations and how
that decision would be communicated. "This would be a national emergency,"
he said. "Someone at the national level has to be designated to flip the
switch."

If Smallpox Breaks Out: Questions and Answers on the U.S. Vaccination Plan
------------------------------
Routine smallpox vaccinations were discontinued in the United States in
1972, and the disease was declared eradicated in 1980. But now, faced with
the possibility of a terrorist attack, the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have adopted guidelines for a mass vaccination in
the event of an outbreak.
The vaccine carries some risk of serious complications. But the CDC says
anyone who has definitely been exposed to the virus should be vaccinated.
For those not yet exposed, or uncertain whether they were exposed, the
picture would be more complicated. Following are questions and answers
about the government's plan.
THE RISKS
What are the complications? In the 1960's the rates of severe side effects
were about 12 cases of encephalitis and 39 cases of severe eczema per
million vaccinations. The death rate from complications was about 1 per
million. Milder but more common side effects include fever, sore arms, and
swollen lymph nodes.
What if I've already been vaccinated? It is not known how long a childhood
vaccination will protect an adult, so the CDC recommends vaccination for
anyone who has definitely been exposed to the virus, regardless of age or
medical condition.
Should anyone avoid vaccination? Health officials say some people should
avoid the vaccine unless it is certain they have been exposed to smallpox.
Children younger than 1: Infants have a greater risk of complications from
the vaccine. About 42 children out of a million will experience brain
swelling, which can lead to retardation or death. Small children are also
more likely to touch their vaccination sore and then their eyes or mouth,
causing new sores.
Pregnant women: The risk from smallpox vaccine to the fetus is relatively
small, but health officials recommend that pregnant women who have not been
exposed to smallpox wait until after childbirth. If they have been exposed,
vaccination is recommended.
People with weakened immune systems: When smallpox was declared eradicated
in 1980, little was known about immune-system problems, but experience with
other serious infections suggests that such people will be more vulnerable,
both to smallpox itself and to severe side effects from the vaccine.
The C.D.C. says those who have not been exposed to smallpox ''should think
about not being vaccinated or waiting to be vaccinated until you have
completed any treatments that affect your immune system function." The
waiting period can be as long as 3 months.
People with skin conditions Vaccination creates a high risk for a severe
skin condition called eczema vaccinatum, which has been compared to
third-degree burns all over the body. People with a history of eczema
should not be vaccinated unless they know they have been exposed to
smallpox. Those with allergic reactions, severe burns, impetigo, and
chicken pox should wait until the condition clears up.
What precautions follow vaccination? The vaccinia virus in the vaccine is a
cousin of the smallpox virus. Studies suggest that those who have been
vaccinated rarely transmit it to anyone else. But they should not let
anyone -- especially children -- touch the vaccination spot until it has
healed and the scab has fallen off.
How are complications treated? The 2 treatments that exist for severe side
effects are: vaccinia immune globulin, which is derived from the blood of
donors vaccinated with smallpox vaccine, and cidofovir, an antiviral drug
marketed as Vistide. At the moment, there is only enough globulin for about
600 patients, the number of serious complications expected from vaccinating
5 million people. More is being produced.
THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN
What would happen first? The CDC is playing down the possibility of a
massive rush to vaccinate and anticipates providing vaccine to state and
local health officials to carry out their own plans. But if a single case
is confirmed "we will act as if the nation were under attack" unless it
clearly stems from a lab accident, a CDC doctor said. In an outbreak, the
president could declare a health emergency and take control of the
vaccination effort.
Would vaccination be mandatory? Under the new plan, vaccination is
voluntary even if someone has definitely been exposed to the smallpox
virus. But anyone who has been exposed and refuses vaccination may be
involuntarily quarantined for up to 18 days.
Must I consent to be vaccinated? Because all smallpox vaccines are
considered "investigational new drugs," written consent is required. The
CDC envisions showing all patients a video about the disease, vaccination
and side effects. Medical personnel will then ask for a medical history to
screen out those who should not be immunized.
Is there enough vaccine? About 155 million vaccine doses are available now,
and enough for all 280 million Americans should be ready by year's end. The
vaccine is not available through private doctors, only through the CDC. The
procedures for using such drugs are complex, but would be streamlined in an
emergency.
What are the logistics? Mass vaccination would require enormous resources.
Clinics would take over schools, warehouses, stadiums. Huge numbers of
workers would be needed to give injections, screen patients, get consent
forms and control crowds. Isolated hospital wards would have to be set
aside for smallpox victims and those suffering complications, and to
quarantine those who refuse vaccinations.
What about the cost? The CDC estimates $5 to $10 a patient, but that covers
only the screening and injection itself.

THE SIDE EFFECTS
Medical Conditions Create Vulnerability to Vaccine
--------------------------------------
Many more people today are at risk of serious side effects from the
smallpox vaccine than in the past, when vaccination was routine.
During the 1970's when smallpox vaccination in the United States was
halted, AIDS was unheard of, organ transplants were uncommon, and the rates
of skin disorders like eczema were a third to a half of what they are now.
Today, millions of people with those conditions have an increased risk of
adverse reactions from the smallpox vaccine, along with many other people,
including pregnant women, babies less than a year old, and patients with
cancer and autoimmune diseases like lupus. Even healthy adults who had
eczema only in childhood are considered to be at risk.
If a smallpox outbreak should occur and the government decided to offer
vaccinations to the entire country, these vulnerable people would be
endangered not just from being vaccinated, but also from being in close
contact with someone else who had recently received the vaccine.
Serious reactions can be countered with a special medicine, vaccinia immune
globulin or VIG, but the nation has only 600 to 700 doses. The government
is trying to speed up production of VIG, said Joe Henderson, associate
director for terrorism preparedness and response at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
Dr. Donald Leung, an author of a recent article about the risks of smallpox
vaccination, and head of the pediatric allergy and immunology division of
the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, said: "It is a
scary thought that only 600 to 700 doses of VIG are available. That
certainly will not be enough if there really is a bioterrorist attack." The
article is in this month's issue of The Journal of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology.
Adverse reactions occur because smallpox vaccine is made with a live virus,
vaccinia, which is related to the smallpox virus. In people with skin
conditions or immune disorders, vaccinia can multiply too much.
Mr. Henderson said the disease centers, the Food and Drug Administration
and the National Institutes of Health were negotiating with a private
company to produce a smallpox vaccine using a weaker form of vaccinia that
would be safer for people at risk from the current vaccine.
Skin disorders alone would cause as many as half the people in the United
States to be discouraged from getting vaccinated except in an emergency in
which they had reason to believe they had been exposed to someone with the
disease, Dr. Leung said. The estimate includes patients with the itchy
rashes known as eczema and atopic dermatitis, and also family members who
would endanger the patients by being vaccinated.
But people who have been exposed to smallpox, even those at high risk,
should be vaccinated, doctors say, because the risk of dying from smallpox
-- about 30 percent -- is greater than the risk of dying from a reaction to
the vaccine.
Only a minority of people with skin disorders would be likely to suffer
severe reactions, but the number of cases could still be high, because skin
problems are so common, Dr. Leung said. About 15 million Americans suffer
from eczema and atopic dermatitis. It is impossible to predict which people
with skin disorders will have problems from the vaccine.
Vulnerable people can be infected by close contact with someone else who
has recently been vaccinated, because the live virus is shed from the sore
at the vaccination site for 2 to 3 weeks, said Dr. Lisa Rotz, a medical
epidemiologist with the bioterror program at the disease centers. Mr.
Henderson said the disease centers was considering the use of special
bandages to keep the shedding to a minimum.
People with skin problems are at risk for a condition called eczema
vaccinatum, which can cause high fever and severe sores, scabs and deep
scars all over the body. The condition has a death rate of one percent to 6
percent.
People whose immune systems have been weakened by AIDS or certain cancers,
or by radiation, chemotherapy, steroids, or drugs used to prevent
transplant rejection, may be prone to an illness known as progressive
vaccinia. In that condition, the sore that normally forms at the
vaccination sites expands abnormally, growing larger and larger, causing
tissue death and a systemic infection that may be uncontrollable. It can
have a death rate as high as 36 percent, Dr. Leung said in the article.
VIG works in some but not all cases, said Dr. Rotz. "If we had to do
something tomorrow, if an outbreak occurred and we had to offer vaccination
on a larger scale, we would have to do our best to screen out people at
risk, because we don't have enough VIG to treat them," she said.
Pregnant women are advised to postpone vaccination until after they have
given birth, unless they have been exposed to smallpox. It is best for
babies not to be vaccinated until they are a year old.

[This is a very in-depth analysis of the vaccination strategy for states in
the event of introduction of smallpox into the United States. These
articles have done an excellent job of presenting many of the controversies
and questions surrounding the plan as released as well as general
controversies and questions surrounding the use of smallpox vaccine in the
United States, especially in an environment and population that have
changed from when our data on the risks of the vaccine were produced.
ProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged
to read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns
surrounding smallpox vaccination. In a nutshell, the current vaccine
available for prevention of smallpox is one of our more dangerous vaccines
in terms of associated serious side-effects and death. In the face of a
real threat of smallpox, with introduction of the wild virus into the
general population, the risk of the disease will far outweigh the risk of
complications from the vaccination. A disease that carries a mortality of
30 percent or more with a high level of morbidity for survivors, clearly is
more dangerous than the vaccine. The controversy is centered upon the
risk-benefit analysis of use of the vaccine when the risk of disease from
the wild virus is theoretical/hypothetical, while the risk of the vaccine
is real. Current supplies of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG -- used for
treatment of severe complications following smallpox vaccination) are
insufficient for widespread vaccination activities, and the use of
antiviral agents for treatment of serious complications of the vaccine is
less than ideal in terms of knowledge of efficacy of treatment and safety
issues surrounding the use of the drugs. While not a scientific
conclusion, one hopes that we will have the luxury of time for further
research and development of a newer, safer vaccine, increased production of
VIG, and further research on the safety and efficacy of antiviral agents to
be used for both complications of vaccination (vaccinial infections) and
for the actual disease. - Mod.MPP]
