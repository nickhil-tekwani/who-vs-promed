A mysterious disease is killing lobsters off the coast of Maine,
threatening a $136 million-a-year industry in the nation's top
lobster-producing state. Some lobstermen say as many as a dozen dead
lobsters a day are being pulled from traps on their boats. Some lobstermen
reported 50 percent declines in their catches over the summer, though it
wasn't clear whether the illness was solely to blame. The problem has
already cost $2.5 million, Robert Brown of the Maine Lobster Dealers
Association said Tuesday.
"We've never seen anything like this in the 20 years I've worked with
lobsters," said Robert Bayer, director of the University of Maine's Lobster
Institute. Bayer said humans are not at risk of contracting any illness
from eating lobsters because the sick ones never get to market and even
healthy lobsters are boiled before they are eaten.
The disease first came to the attention of researchers a year ago.
"All we know now is that it's worse than it was last year," said Maya
Crosby, a microbiologist at the University of Maine's Darling Center in
Walpole. She is the only full-time researcher working on the problem.
Tissue and blood samples from the diseased lobsters have been sent to the
universities of New Hampshire and Arizona, where researchers are trying to
isolate the pathogen that is responsible. The scientists are "miles away
from finding a cause," Bayer said.
The threat comes a year after Maine lobster sales hit an all-time high of
46.3 million pounds. Bayer said the problem may be understated because
people are afraid of harming business in Maine, which lands about a quarter
of the lobster caught in the United States and Canada.
