Response to comments in Post Number 20220826.8705240
----------------------------------------------------
As of 26 Aug 2022, all cattle except for 12 from one owner have been vaccinated.

In terms of disposal, due to environmental conditions, most of the infected animals have been disposed of by deep burial and the burial sites have been recorded.
