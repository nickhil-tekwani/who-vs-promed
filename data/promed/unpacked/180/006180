6 people diagnosed with botulism in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
6 people were admitted to the City of Dnepropetrovsk's infectious disease
hospital with botulism after a birthday celebration. According to
Dnepropetrovsk Nutrition Hygiene department chief Ivan Dedayev, physicians
thought that the source of the botulism cluster was homemade canned corn
shared by the participants in the celebration.
According to Ivan Dedayev, the hospitalized individuals are expected to
survive, and their condition is satisfactory. Also according to Dedayev,
this year [2003], there were 13 cases of botulism reported, with dried fish
and homemade canned mushrooms found to be the source of the toxin-induced
disease.

[Botulism is an uncommon but potentially fatal disease due to one of 6
(A,B,C,D,E,F) neurotoxins produced by strains of _Clostridium
botulinum_. Spores of the organism are quite ubiquitous in the
environment, and the toxin is elaborated after the spores germinate and
grow in an anaerobic environment. The disease usually results from the
ingestion of preformed toxin in inadequately preserved food products. The
vegetative organism and its toxin are readily inactivated by boiling, but
the spores must reach higher temperatures for inactivation. Home canning
is a common vehicle for transmission of botulism (as in this posting), but
commercially produced canned food has also been implicated. - Mod.LL]
