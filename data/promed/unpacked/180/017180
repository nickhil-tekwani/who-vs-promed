[Just got the following information from] Stuart Macmillan, the
conservation biologist in wood buffalo. They have now found a total
of 32 carcasses since the outbreak began, most of the over the
weekend [28-29 Jul 2007] and today [30 Jul 2007]. They have
incinerated 11, treated 2 with formaldehyde and left 19 that were too
autolyzed or scavenged already. A total of 12 of these 19 carcasses
were found this morning in one small prairie in very close proximity
with the use of forward looking infrared (FLIR) in a helicopter. They
were basically just hide and bones from what Stu told me.
They are also doing fixed wing surveillance flights in other areas of
the park to see if there might be other areas affected, but nothing so far.
There seems to be 2 focal areas, Pine Lake where there is (was) a
fire camp and the Parsons Lake Road area, which is about 15 km [about
9.3 miles] north of Pine Lake. All bison have been bulls so far with
the exception of 2 cows.
It is going to continue to be hot and dry, so I suspect we may see
more over the coming weeks. They will be continuing to do
surveillance with the forward looking infrared (FLIR) over the next
few days to see if they can spot any more carcasses. Apparently the
stench of rotting bison from the group of 12 could be smelled from
over 3 km [1.8 miles] away.

[The 1st dead bison was found on 17 Jul 2007 along Parson's Lake
Road. It was treated with formaldehyde while burning was being
organised and initiated on 20 Jul 2007. This case was later confirmed
as anthrax by ADRI, Lethbridge. At that time there were no more
cases. By 25 Jul 2007 a total of 6 bison carcasses had been located,
treated with formaldehyde and incinerated. A 7th carcass was already
partly dismembered by scavengers in a remote area -- it was pointless
to treat it as the scavengers had been at it. By 27 Jul 2007 the
total was 10 bison. On 29 Jul 2007 it was 20 -- 2 of these on the
shores of Pine Lake. All within the Parsons Lake Road - Pine Lake
area thanks to ground searching and aerial surveillance with forward
looking infrared (FLIR) technology in the area.
More information on the park including maps can be found at
<http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/nt/woodbuffalo/index_e.asp>. Parsons Lake
Road and Pine Lake are southwest of Fort Smith. The present estimate
for Wood Bison in the Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP) is 5400. - Mod.MHJ]

Nothing to add from our perspective. We (government of the NWT) have
stepped up our survey frequency for the Slave River Lowlands within
NWT jurisdiction [and immediately north of the WBNP. - Mod.MHJ]. Most
of the bison population in that area (our estimates) visually
inspected and all tails wagging as of 23 Jul 2007.

[So far the disease is limited to the Parsons Lake Road and Pine Lake
areas. Past experience in the park and surrounding areas is that
outbreaks are in discrete areas, independent of each other. When the
disease is spread by biting flies, the survivors have a significant
measure of herd immunity. The population of Wood Bison is made up of
discrete mobs of bison cows with some adult males. Otherwise the
males outside of the breeding season, which is now, roam off in pairs
and trios. Our thanks to Troy, Todd, Stu and Nahum for keeping us
informed in the midst of what must be a very busy time. - Mod.MHJ]
