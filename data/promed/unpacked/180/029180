Egypt: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 4
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has announced a new
human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The case is a
4-year-old female from El-Edwa district, Menea governorate. She
developed symptoms on 21 Feb 2008 and was hospitalized on 24 Feb
2008. She is receiving treatment and is in a stable condition.

Investigations into the source of her infection indicate exposure to
sick poultry in the week prior to onset of symptoms.

Of the 44 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 19 have been fatal.

[2] Egypt - 45th case

A 25-year-old Egyptian woman tested positive for bird flu on Saturday
[2 Mar 2008], the 45th confirmed human case in the Arab world's most
populous country, state news agency MENA said. Ministry of Health
spokesman, Abdel Rahman Shaheen, said the woman had been treated with
the antiviral drug Tamiflu and had been transferred from Fayoum
province to a hospital in Cairo. The woman was suffering from a high
fever; both her lungs were inflamed, and she was being kept on a
respirator and under observation, Shaheen said.

A 4-year-old girl tested positive for bird flu on Monday [25 Feb
2008]. [See: WHO confirmation above].

Four Egyptian women died from bird flu in December [2007]. Their
deaths ended a 5-month pause in human cases in Egypt and brought to
19 the number of Egyptians who have died of the H5N1 bird flu virus
since it emerged in Egypt in early 2006. It is the 3rd winter the
virus has struck after lying low during Egypt's hot summers.

Around 5 million households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main
source of food and income, and the government has said this makes it
unlikely the disease can be eradicated despite a large-scale poultry
vaccination programme. Deaths from bird flu total more than 230
worldwide since 2003 and have been reported in several African and
Asian countries. Egypt has been the worst-hit country outside of Asia.

[One of our ProMED correspondents has commented that there is an
overwhelming female bias in mortality in Egypt: only one of 19
confirmed fatalities has been male. This anomaly seems to have
received little attention from the community so far.

case. - Mod.CP]
