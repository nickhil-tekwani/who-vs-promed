[1] Incubation Period Outliers

Nearly 6 months after the start of a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak blamed on tainted pain shots, patients who originally tested clear are showing up sick, raising worries that the incubation period for illness may be longer than anyone thought. Though the flood of patients has slowed dramatically, 2 or 3 people each week are still reporting infections caused by contaminated steroids in the outbreak that has killed 48 and sickened more than 700, officials with the CDC said. Among those new patients are people who received mold-tainted doses of the drug methylprednisolone, but who previously got MRIs or lumbar punctures that showed they were free of infection. These slow-growing infections aren't as severe as meningitis, but worrying nonetheless.

"If you had an MRI in October [2012], I don't know that you're out of the woods," said Dr. Anurag Malani, an infectious disease expert at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the state that has seen the most cases -- 253 -- in the outbreak. CDC officials issued a health alert this week urging clinicians to remain vigilant for new infections, even in people who show subtle symptoms -- or none at all.

"We are seeing some patients with very long incubation periods," said Dr. Tom Chiller, associate director for epidemiological science in the CDC's division of foodborne, waterborne and environmental diseases. "We expect to see people getting infections months after their injections."

Nearly 14 000 people in 23 states were exposed to the contaminated drugs produced by the now-shuttered New England Compounding Center of Framingham, Massachusetts. An estimated 11 000 actually received shots for back or neck pain, the CDC says. So far, 720 people in 20 states have fallen ill. Most of the seriously ill people -- those with fungal meningitis infections that caused strokes, for instance -- showed up within several weeks or one to 2 months starting in late September 2012.

Back then, CDC officials told worried patients that the greatest risk for meningitis was likely in the 1st 42 days -- 6 weeks -- after the shots, suggesting that they could breathe easy after the 1st week in November 2012. But patients have continued to become ill, most often not with meningitis, but with infections at the injection site, with epidural abscesses or with a condition called arachnoiditis, an inflammation of the nerves near the spine.

Though doctors have little experience with such fungal infections, the incubation period appears to be stretching longer than a previous outbreak in 2002, when a patient became ill 152 days -- 5 months -- after getting a steroid shot.

"I don't think at this time we know how long the incubation period is," Malani said. That's worrisome for people like a 54-year-old man, of Nashville, Tennessee, who received a steroid shot for back pain from one of 3 tainted lots in September 2012. He says he's feeling "remarkably well" these days, with no signs of infection. Health officials told him the biggest worry was after 90 days or so, but now he's not so sure. "There's people still having problems," said the man, who owns a sound system firm. "We just keep our fingers crossed. I try not to worry about it."

CDC officials want health workers to continue to monitor patients who got shots, particularly those whose have pain that is worse or different from the initial symptoms. But even patients who previously tested negative for infections and those with no apparent symptoms are at risk. "These infections may be unrecognized because some patients have not continued to receive close clinical follow-up or because they have not recognized symptoms suggestive of a localized infection," the new alert says. The CDC recommends that health workers have a low threshold for considering MRIs, or magnetic resonance imaging, to detect unseen infections. Even patients who initially resisted MRIs because they didn't want them or didn't think they needed them have turned up with infections, said Malani.

The danger of not detecting the infections is that they only will get worse, Chiller said. "Any untreated infection can sit there and smolder and spread," he said, noting it can move beyond soft tissue to bone and the central nervous system, with devastating, even deadly, effects. That, however, raises the next question in the ongoing meningitis puzzle: How long should infected patients be treated? Some patients say they've been told 3 months, then 9 months -- then a year. The primary drugs used to treat the fungus -- voriconazole and amphotericin B -- are both expensive and toxic, with a host of side effects ranging from hair loss and hallucinations to liver problems.

[2] More Rapid Diagnostics
Date Wed 20 Mar 2013

Instead of waiting a week or longer to see if mold will grow in a test tube, the CDC now has a much faster method for diagnosing a rare form of meningitis and other fungal infections.

The agency's scientists have developed a DNA-sequencing test that produces results within 48 hours. The new test also has a higher detection rate, according to an article published this month in the American Society of Microbiology. CDC microbiologists devised the test during the early days of the fungal meningitis outbreak and and quietly began studying its effectiveness.

The DNA test proved to have a 29 percent detection rate, compared to just 9 percent for traditional test-tube cultures. Since the new test does not have federal approval as a diagnostic tool, doctors will have to ask state health departments to ship tissue samples to the CDC for surveillance testing.

Health officials will accept samples from patients with symptoms that match the CDC case definitions for fungal infections linked to contaminated steroid medicine manufactured by New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts.

The test has already been used on patients from Tennessee, where 150 people have been sickened and 14 have died after exposure to the tainted drugs. "We had about 75 percent of our specimens to come from 4 states," said Mary E. Brandt, one of the CDC microbiologists who conducted the study. "There were 4 states that were very heavily impacted. They were Tennessee, Michigan, Virginia and Indiana. From Tennessee, we received 110 specimens from 72 patients."

She cautioned that a negative result on the new test does not rule out an infection. The CDC has more research planned.

"We are planning to participate in a study designed to follow a group of these NECC steroid-injected sick patients for at least a year," Brandt said. "Our colleagues are nearly ready to start. We hope to answer questions like when patients can safely stop taking anti-fungal medication, are other anti-fungal drugs helpful and what kinds of long-term symptoms do these patients show."

[The latest statistics, released on 25 Mar 2013
(http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/outbreaks/meningitis.html) reported a total of 730 cases and 51 deaths. The total has increased from 722 and 50 deaths from 2 weeks earlier.

The periodic CDC statistics do not reflect the incubation period from last injection of the potentially contaminated steroid until the first symptoms. It is now more evident that there are some cases with much longer incubation periods than previously thought. - Mod.LL
