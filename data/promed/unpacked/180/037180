[This is the 3rd case of rabies in Chimkent during the past 3 months.
The previous 2 cases were reported in October [2008]; a 52-year-old
woman and a 21-year-old man died as a result of rabies virus
infection. The worst epizootic situation for rabies virus infection
is in the southern part of Kazakhstan (Chimkent in particular).
During the last 10 years more than 30 people have died as a result of
rabies in Kazakhstan. - Corresp.BA]

Tajik medical authorities concerned over increasing rabies cases
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tajik medical authorities are concerned over incre
asing number of rabies cases in the country. According to Navrouz
Jaffarov, head of the center for sanitary and epidemiologic
supervision within the Ministry of Health (MoH), 13 cases of rabies
have been registered in the country over the first 10 months of this
year [2008], which is 7 cases more than in the same period of last
year. Specialists note that in 70-80 percent of cases, the [fatal
outcome] is caused by delay in seeking medical aid [i.e. post-exposure
vaccination]. Another reason is insufficient financing of medical
facilities for purchase of necessary medical preparations and rabies
vaccines.

Rabies, also known as hydrophobia, is a viral zoonotic neuroinvasive
disease that causes acute encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in
mammals. It is most commonly caused by a bite from an infected
animal, but occasionally by other forms of contact. If left untreated
in humans it is almost invariably fatal. In some countries it is a
significant killer of livestock.

The rabies virus makes its way to the brain by following the
peripheral nerves. The incubation period of the disease depends on
how far the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system,
usually taking a few months. Once the infection reaches the central
nervous system and symptoms begin to show, the untreated infection is
almost inevitably fatal within days.

In non-vaccinated humans, rabies is almost invariably fatal after
neurological symptoms have developed, but prompt post-exposure
vaccination may prevent the virus from progressing. Rabies kills
around 55 000 people a year, mostly in Asia and Africa.
