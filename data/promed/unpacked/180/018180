Antimicrobial resistance surveillance in Europe; Annual report of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) 2014
------------------------------------------
Summary
------------
The results presented in this report are based on antimicrobial resistance data from invasive isolates reported to EARS-Net by 29 EU/EEA countries in 2015 (data referring to 2014), and on trend analyses of data reported by the participating countries for the period 2011-2014.

The antimicrobial resistance situation in Europe displays large variations depending on the bacterium, antimicrobial group and geographical region. For several antimicrobial group-bacterium combinations, a north-to-south and west-to-east gradient is evident in Europe. In general, lower resistance percentages are reported by countries in the north and higher percentages by countries in the south and east of Europe. These differences are most likely related to differences in antimicrobial use, infection control and healthcare utilisation practices in the countries.

For gram-negative bacteria, the situation is especially worrying, with high and, in many cases, increasing resistance percentages reported from many parts of Europe.

Over the last 4 years (2011-2014), resistance to 1rd-generation cephalosporins in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Escherichia coli_ increased significantly at the EU/EEA level as well as in many of the individual Members States. A large proportion of the isolates resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporins produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). 3rd-generation cephalosporin resistance was often seen in combination with fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside resistance. The EU/EEA trend for this type of combined resistance increased significantly between 2011 and 2014 for both _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_. Increasing trends were observed in more than 1/3rd of the individual countries, both in countries with high and low levels of resistance. The observed increase in combined resistance to multiple antimicrobial groups, as well as the high proportion of ESBL-producing isolates, is especially worrying, as this leaves few treatment alternatives for patients with infections caused by these pathogens. Besides its impact on treatment outcome of individual patients, frequent resistance in gram-negative bacteria may lead to an increased use of carbapenems, thus further favouring the emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.

While the EU/EEA population-weighted mean for carbapenem resistance in 2014 was 7.3 percent for _K. pneumoniae_, carbapenem resistance remained very low in _E. coli_ (0.1 percent). Large inter-country variations were noted for _K. pneumoniae_ for which resistance percentages ranged between zero and 62.3 percent. With a few exceptions, countries reporting the highest levels of combined resistance to fluoroquinolones, 3rd-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides also reported the highest percentages of carbapenem resistance. The 4-year trend for carbapenem resistance appeared fairly stable in _E. coli_, with few changes observed in national data between 2011 and 2014 and no significant increase of the EU/EEA population-weighted mean during the same period. A more dynamic pattern was observed for _K. pneumoniae_, with a significantly increasing 4-year trend for both the EU/EEA population-weighted mean as well as for 7 individual Member States, including countries with both high and low resistance levels. Carbapenem resistance and resistance to multiple antimicrobial groups were also common in _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Acinetobacter_ species. For _P. aeruginosa_, the EU/EEA population-weighted mean percentage for carbapenem resistance increased significantly between 2011 and 2014. For _Acinetobacter_ spp., no trend analysis was possible as data have only been available since 2012. However, this was the bacterium for which the highest carbapenem resistance levels were reported, with more than a 3rd of the reporting countries reporting resistance percentages above 50 percent in 2014.

Treatment alternatives for patients infected with bacteria resistant to both carbapenems and other key antimicrobial groups are often limited to combination therapy and to older antimicrobial agents such as polymyxins, e.g. colistin. Although data on polymyxin susceptibility as part of EARS-Net surveillance are not complete, the fact that some countries, especially countries with already high percentages of carbapenem resistance, report large numbers of isolates with polymyxin resistance is an indication of the further loss of effective antimicrobial treatment options for gram-negative bacterial infections. The increase in carbapenem resistance in _K. pneumoniae_ observed in the EARS-Net surveillance data is most likely the result of an increase in isolates producing a carbapenemase, as previously reported from the ECDC-funded European Survey on Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (EuSCAPE). The continuous spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), mostly _K. pneumoniae_, presents a serious threat to healthcare and patient safety in European hospitals, to which many European countries have reacted by intensifying their containment efforts. However, results from EuSCAPE have highlighted that gaps still remain and many countries are still lacking national guidance for CPE prevention and control.

Resistance trends in gram-positive bacteria showed a more diverse pattern across Europe. For meticillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), the EU/EEA population-weighted mean percentage has continued to decrease over the last four years, from 18.6 percent in 2011 to 17.4 percent in 2014. The decline in recent years has, however, been less pronounced than for the period 2009-2012.

For _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, resistance percentages were generally stable during the period 2011-2014, but with large inter-country variations. Macrolide non-susceptibility in _S. pneumoniae_ was, for most countries, higher than penicillin-non-susceptibility. The significantly increasing 4-year trend of the population-weighted EU/EEA mean percentage for vancomycin resistance in _E. faecium_ observed last year [2013] continued in 2014. The future development of vancomycin-resistant _E. faecium_ in Europe requires close attention, as the number of countries reporting significantly increasing trends has increased in recent years. In 2014, more than 1/3rd of the reporting countries saw an increasing trend in vancomycin-resistant enterococci, the highest number since 2004.

Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to public health in Europe. For invasive bacterial infections, prompt treatment with effective antimicrobial agents is especially important and is one of the single most effective interventions to reduce the risk of fatal outcomes. The ongoing increase in antimicrobial resistance to a number of key antimicrobial groups in invasive bacterial isolates reported to EARS-Net is, therefore, of great concern. Prudent antimicrobial use and comprehensive infection prevention and control strategies targeting all healthcare sectors are the cornerstones of effective interventions aiming to prevent selection and transmission of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents.
