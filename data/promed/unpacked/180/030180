The 1st case of tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium caprae_ has been detected in a fox in Spain.

Recently, there have been outbreaks of tuberculosis in herds of cattle and goats near the area where the 1st case of tuberculosis in foxes was detected, and thus these cases may be associated.

Cases of tuberculosis in foxes have been reported infrequently.

Tuberculosis (TB) due to _Mycobacterium caprae_ is endemic in goat herds and free-ranging wild boars in Spain, causing infections in other animals, including wildlife, although to a lesser extent. Tuberculosis infection in foxes is rare and they are often considered secondary hosts.

In foxes, there have been infrequent reports of _Mycobacterium bovis_. Scientists from the IRTA-CReSA Animal Health Research Center, the Autonomous University of Barcelona, and the Government of Catalonia have described this case of _M. caprae_ infection in a fox.

Scientists stated it was a blind, severely emaciated red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) that was admitted to a rehabilitation center. After clinical examination, he had to be euthanized due to his poor condition.

Generalized tuberculosis lesions were observed at necropsy, which were later confirmed by histopathology, together with a coinfection with canine distemper virus. During the analyses, _M. caprae_ was detected in the culture of mycobacteria and the spoligotype SB0415 was identified.

In order to know the origin, the complete genome sequencing (WGS) of the isolated _M. caprae_ was carried out and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were compared with other sequences isolated from cattle and wildlife from the same area along of the last decade. These analyses associated this case with recent outbreaks in cattle and goat herds in the area.

The authors state that this is the 1st reported case of _M. caprae_ tuberculosis in a fox in the Iberian Peninsula. "The results indicated the transmission of _M. caprae_ between cattle and foxes, suggesting that this species may sometimes play a role in the epidemiology of animal tuberculosis."

"In addition, the risk to human health should not be ignored, especially when these animals are clinically evaluated and handled in a wildlife center or handled by hunters/furriers," they add.

_Mycobacterium caprae_ is a cluster within the _M. tuberculosis_ complex. This pathogen has been recognized mainly in central Europe, where it has been occasionally isolated from tuberculous lesions from cattle, pigs, red deer (_Cervus elaphus_), and wild boar (_Sus scrofa_). A survey conducted in 2008 in Austria found a prevalence of 23% of _M. caprae_ in red deer.

A previous case of disseminated TB caused by _M. caprae_ was reported in a fox from Austria, and as in this case, it was found associated with a concurrent viral infection. An immunosuppressive effect of a viral infection may contribute to the progress of the bacterial disease. Another disseminated case of TB in a fox, but caused by _M. bovis_, was also found associated with a concurrent viral infection. - Mod.PMB
