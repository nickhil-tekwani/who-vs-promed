Abstract
--------
Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is most frequently mild yet can be severe and life-threatening. Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are predicted to reduce viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and prevent hospitalization.

Methods: In this ongoing phase 2 trial involving outpatients with recently diagnosed mild or moderate COVID-19, we randomly assigned 452 patients to receive a single intravenous infusion of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 in one of 3 doses (700 mg, 2800 mg, or 7000 mg) or placebo and evaluated the quantitative virologic end-points and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the viral load at day 11. The results of a preplanned interim analysis as of 5 Sep 2020 are reported here.

Results: At the time of the interim analysis, the observed mean decrease from baseline in the log viral load for the entire population was -3.81, for an elimination of more than 99.97% of viral RNA. For patients who received the 2800-mg dose of LY-CoV555, the difference from placebo in the decrease from baseline was -0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.98 to -0.08; P = 0.02), for a viral load that was lower by a factor of 3.4. Smaller differences from placebo in the change from baseline were observed among the patients who received the 700-mg dose (-0.20; 95% CI, -0.66 to 0.25; P = 0.38) or the 7000-mg dose (0.09; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.55; P = 0.70). On days 2 to 6, the patients who received LY-CoV555 had a slightly lower severity of symptoms than those who received placebo. The percentage of patients who had a COVID-19-related hospitalization or visit to an emergency department was 1.6% in the LY-CoV555 group and 6.3% in the placebo group.

Conclusions: In this interim analysis of a phase 2 trial, one of 3 doses of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 appeared to accelerate the natural decline in viral load over time, whereas the other doses had not by day 11. (Funded by Eli Lilly; BLAZE-1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04427501.)

Introduction
------------
LY-CoV555 (also known as LY3819253), a potent antispike neutralizing monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, was derived from convalescent plasma obtained from a patient with COVID-19. The antibody was developed by Eli Lilly [who funded this study] after its discovery by researchers at AbCellera and at the Vaccine Research Center of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The discovery of LY-CoV555 and its passive protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates has been reported previously [see full report at source URL above for references].

Discussion
----------
In a post hoc analysis that was focused on high-risk subgroups (an age of 65 years or older or a BMI of 35 or greater), the percentage of hospitalization was 4.2% in the LY-CoV555 group and 14.6% in the placebo group.

The data regarding symptoms (as measured by the change from baseline in the symptom score) were also consistent with the hospitalization results, with findings that supported a possible reduction in symptom severity as early as day 2 in the LY-CoV555 group. This effect was maintained over time and across doses, which further supports the validity of a treatment effect on symptoms and suggests a mechanistic link between a lower viral load and a lower frequency of hospitalization. Although the differences in the effects of the 3 doses of LY-CoV555 were not clear, the 2800-mg dose was the only one to show evidence of accelerated viral clearance. Nevertheless, further studies should continue to assess the efficacy of lower doses.

The safety profile of patients who received LY-CoV555 was similar to that of placebo-treated patients. These data indicate that the treatment is safe. In this interim analysis, the patients who received LY-CoV555 had fewer hospitalizations and a lower symptom burden than those who received placebo, with the most pronounced effects observed in high-risk cohorts. If these results are confirmed in additional analyses in this trial, LY-CoV555 could become a useful treatment for emergency use in patients with recently diagnosed COVID-19.

[These results look very promising at least for the 2800-mg dose, as it was the only one of the 3 doses to show evidence of accelerated viral clearance. It is odd that the 7000-mg dose was apparently less effective than the 2800-mg dose in decreasing viral load. But all 3 doses of the monoclonal antibody led to some decrease in severity of symptoms compared with placebo. Testing on more patients will likely clarify what dose is optimal. A concern is that the treatment is one hour of IV infusion of the antibody. If all mild cases were to be treated, this could be a further burden on the hospital systems that are already stressed. But if high-risk patients were treated selectively, this might prevent hospitalization in that group. - Mod.LK]

The media consortium released a new survey of the situation of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil based on data from the state health departments, consolidated at 8 pm this Wednesday [28 Oct 2020].

The country has recorded 499 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, reaching a total of 158 480 deaths since the pandemic began. As a result, the moving average of deaths in Brazil in the last 7 days was 432, the lowest reported since 5 May 2020, when it was 411. The change was a 13% decrease when compared with the average of 14 days ago, indicating a trend of stability in deaths by COVID-19, that is, when there was no significant increase or decrease in the period.

In confirmed cases, since the beginning of the pandemic, 5 469 755 Brazilians have had or have the new coronavirus, with 28 852 of these confirmed in the past 24 hours. The moving average of new cases in the last 7 days was 24 158 per day, an increase of 20% in relation to cases reported in the past 14 days. That is, it indicates an increase for the 2nd consecutive day in relation to the last 14 days.

Only 3 states show an increase in deaths: Santa Catarina, Amazonas and Amapa. Thirteen other states and the DF have curves that indicate a decrease.

It is worth mentioning that there are states in which the low average number of deaths can lead to large percentage variations. In the AP [Amapa], for example, the average was one and remained at one in the 2-week period, resulting in an increase of 60% during the 2 weeks. In AM [Amazonas], which had the greatest increase (62%), the number jumped from 11 to 17 deaths per day. Moving average data are, in general, in decimal numbers and rounded to facilitate data presentation.

Brazil, 28 Oct 2020
-------------------
- Total deaths: 158 480
- Deaths reported in the past 24 hours: 499
- Average new deaths in the last 7 days: 432 per day (14-day decrease: 13%)
- Total confirmed cases: 5 469 755
- Confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours: 28 852
- Average new cases in the last 7 days: 24 158 per day (14-day increase: 20%)

States
------
- Increasing (3 states): SC [Santa Catarina], AM [Amazonas] and AP [Amapa]

- Stable, that is, the number of deaths did not fall or rise significantly (11 states): RS [Rio Grande do Sul], ES [Espirito Santo], MG [Minas Gerais], RJ [Rio de Janeiro], AC [Acre], PA [Para], TO [Tocantins], CE [Ceara], MA [Maranhao], PE [Pernambuco] and SE [Sergipe]

- Decreasing (12 states + DF): PR [Parana], SP [Sao Paulo], DF [Distrito Federal], GO [Goias], MS [Mato Grosso do Sul], MT [Mato Grosso], RO [Rondonia], RR [Roraima], AL [Alagoas], BA [Bahia], PB [Paraiba], PE [Pernambuco], PI [Piaui] and RN [Rio Grande do Norte]

This comparison takes into account the average number of deaths in the past 7 days until the publication of this balance sheet compared with the average reported 2 weeks ago.

Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
Recommended mitigation behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include wearing masks, hand washing, social distancing, and staying home when ill.

What is added by this report?
Self-reported engagement in mitigation behaviors (mask wearing, handwashing, physical distancing, crowd and restaurant avoidance, and cancellation of social activities) differed significantly by adult age-group. During April-June 2020, the prevalence of these behaviors was lowest among adults aged 18-29 years and highest among those aged more than 60 years. Whereas mask wearing increased over time, other reported mitigation behaviors decreased or remained unchanged.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Improved communication and policy priorities are needed to promote recommended COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, particularly among young adults.

CDC recommends a number of mitigation behaviors to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Those behaviors include 1) covering the nose and mouth with a mask to protect others from possible infection when in public settings and when around persons who live outside of one's household or around ill household members; 2) maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance from persons who live outside one's household, and keeping oneself distant from persons who are ill; and 3) washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or, if soap and water are not available, using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (1; see source URL for complete references). Age has been positively associated with mask use (2), although less is known about other recommended mitigation behaviors. Monitoring mitigation behaviors over the course of the pandemic can inform targeted communication and behavior modification strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Data Foundation COVID Impact Survey collected nationally representative data on reported mitigation behaviors during April-June 2020 among adults in the USA aged 18 years and older (3). Reported use of face masks increased from 78% in April [2020] to 83% in May [2020] and reached 89% in June [2020]; however, other reported mitigation behaviors (e.g., hand washing, social distancing, and avoiding public or crowded places) declined marginally or remained unchanged. At each time point, the prevalence of reported mitigation behaviors was lowest among younger adults (aged 18-29 years) and highest among older adults (aged 60 years and older). Lower engagement in mitigation behaviors among younger adults might be one reason for the increased incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this group, which have been shown to precede increases among those older than 60 years (4). These findings underscore the need to prioritize clear, targeted messaging and behavior modification interventions, especially for young adults, to encourage uptake and support maintenance of recommended mitigation behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

[See source URL for the survey methodology.]
Respondents were asked, "Which of the following measures, if any, are you taking in response to the coronavirus?" Of the 19 response options, 3 mitigation behaviors aligning with CDC recommendations were assessed: 1) "wore a face mask," 2) "washed or sanitized hands," and 3) "kept 6 feet distance from those outside my household." Three social mitigation behaviors aligning with CDC considerations and White House guidelines from March and April 2020 also were selected for analysis: 1) "avoided public or crowded places," 2) "cancelled or postponed social or recreational activities," and 3) "avoided some or all restaurants."

Across survey waves, the majority of the weighted sample (range = 62%-65%) identified as non-Hispanic or Latino White, and 50% identified as female; 14%-15% of respondents were aged 18-29 years. In April [2020], 78% of adults aged 18 years or older reported wearing a mask; this increased to 83% in May [2020] and 89% in June [2020] (Table 1; see source URL) (p less than 0.001). All other reported mitigation behaviors decreased from 20-26 Apr 2020 to early June 2020 (p less than 0.05), except avoiding some or all restaurants, which did not change significantly (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/95944). At each time point, more than 40% of all adults aged 18 years or older reported all 6 assessed mitigation behaviors (Table 2; see source URL). Across all survey waves, reported prevalences of mitigation behaviors were highest among adults aged 60 years or older and lowest among those aged 18-29 years (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1). Age was also significantly associated with the cumulative number of reported mitigation behaviors across all survey waves, with young adults reporting engaging in fewer mitigation behaviors compared with older adults overall and at all time points (Table 2; Figure at source URL).

Among adults who reported face mask use at each time point, a significantly higher percentage reported other mitigation behaviors compared with those who did not report mask use (Supplementary Figure 2 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/95945). Among adults who did not report mask use, all other reported mitigation behaviors declined significantly from the 20-26 Apr 2020 wave to early June 2020. Other mitigation behaviors also decreased over time among those who reported mask use, but to a much lesser extent, and only significantly for washing hands, maintaining a 6-foot distance, and cancelling or postponing social events. A higher percentage of adults who reported mask use also reported a higher cumulative number of other mitigation behaviors during the same period compared with adults who did not report mask use (Figure). By early June, more than 45% of adults who did not report mask use reported one or fewer other mitigation behaviors (Figure). Overall, a significant positive association between age and the cumulative number of reported mitigation behaviors persisted over time among those who did and those who did not report mask use (Figure).

Discussion
----------
This report provides 4 important insights into the practice of mitigation behaviors among US adults to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. First, the majority of US adults reported engaging in most or all of the 6 mitigation behaviors assessed. Second, age was an important determinant of engagement in mitigation behaviors overall. A smaller percentage of adults aged under 60 years, particularly those aged 18-29 years, reported engaging in the mitigation behaviors assessed compared with adults aged 60 years or older. Third, while reported use of face masks increased significantly across all age-groups over time, other reported mitigation behaviors declined or did not change significantly across age-groups. Finally, compared with adults who reported wearing a mask, those who did not report mask use also reported engaging in significantly fewer other mitigation behaviors during the same period, with significant declines in all other behaviors from April to June [2020].

CDC recommends multiple, concurrent mitigation behaviors to most effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 (6). Fewer reported mitigation behaviors among young adults might contribute to the high incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this age-group (4). Older adults might be more concerned about COVID-19, based on their higher risk for severe illness compared with that of younger adults (7). Young adults might also be less likely to engage in mitigation behaviors because of social, developmental, and practical factors (8,9). Across age-groups, increases in mask use and decreases in other mitigation behaviors might reflect elevated promotion of mask use over time, along with the lifting of shelter-in-place orders and reopening of business, service, hospitality and other sectors.

Significant declines in self-reported mitigation behaviors among those not reporting mask use suggests that a minority of persons might be increasingly resistant to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors or unable to engage in mitigation behaviors because of the constraints introduced by their return to work, school, or other settings. Effectively promoting engagement in mitigation behaviors among young adults will require moving beyond education to addressing barriers to mitigation behaviors as the pandemic and the response evolve. Strategies might include engaging trusted leaders and social media influencers to improve social acceptability of mitigation behaviors, offering practical tips for engagement, and appealing to personal values. Strategies also might include addressing social and emotional challenges potentially associated with social distancing behaviors, and engaging communities, businesses, employers and institutes of higher education to ensure mitigation behaviors are both feasible and actively encouraged where young adults work, study, and engage in recreational activities. Similar targeted strategies can be used to promote use of recommended mitigation behaviors among all adults.

[See source URL for study limitations.]
These findings suggest that lower engagement in social mitigation behaviors among younger adults might be one possible reason for the increased incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this group, which began in June 2020 and preceded increases among persons aged 60 years or older by 4-15 days (4). Better understanding of barriers and motivators associated with participation in mitigation behaviors is needed to effectively employ strategies that promote engagement of younger adults and others who are not currently engaging in mitigation behaviors. Reaching these groups through targeted channels, trusted leaders, and influencers at national, state, and local levels has the potential to improve use and effectiveness of critical public health strategies to protect persons of all ages by preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

[It would be interesting to see results of focus groups and KAP (knowledge, attitude and practice) surveys to drill down on reasons mitigation behaviors are not being followed. While this survey was conducted in the USA, similar observations have been made in Europe as well, with initial increases in cases also observed in the younger age-group. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 30 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct30_1604090020.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 30.1% of daily case numbers and 41.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 20.1 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Chile, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico also reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 51.1% of daily case numbers and 37.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 10.5 million. Countries not reporting cases today (30 Oct 2020) include Kazakhstan, Sweden, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. France is dominant, followed by Italy, Spain, UK, Poland, Germany, Russia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Ukraine, Romania, Austria, Portugal, Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Armenia, and Turkey. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Georgia, Serbia, Greece, and Azerbaijan.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.4% of daily case numbers and 9.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 3.0 million cases. Iran is dominant with (record-breaking highs), followed by Morocco, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and UAE. Pakistan, Libya, Kuwait, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Tunisia, Oman, and Somalia did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.3 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Botswana, Algeria, Ghana, Guinea, Angola, Nigeria, Zambia, and Mozambique.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.68% of daily case numbers and 0.66% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.72 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 11.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 10.3% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.1 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. While India is dominant, the 24-hour new case count remains reduced.

Impression: The Americas region combined with the European region account for over 80% of daily reported cases and almost 80% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours. Cases have somewhat reduced in the South East Asian region while overall case numbers remain below 5000 from the Western Pacific region and just below 6000 in the Africa region.
