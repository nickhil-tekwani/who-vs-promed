As a point of introduction, I have a biology-environmental health
background and spent the summer of '98 as the (seasonal only) Public Health
Officer (Sanitarian) at Grand Teton National Park (GRTE). As a westerner
having grown up in Oklahoma with open ranges and a firm belief in "western"
philosophies, I have a great affinity for ranchers, as a group. As you
say, though, ranchers have a disproportionate share of the political power
in many places.
I spent considerable time last summer slightly outside the duties for which
I was hired. One of the issues I followed closely was the bison management
plan for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) area, which had just been
published in late summer [97? . I had several discussions with the GRTE
Chief of Resource Management about the issue. Many of the issues affecting
the Yellowstone herds generally do not affect the GRTE herd of bison,
except in a broader concept. Some of the "scientific" principles invoked
by the GYE bison management plan could hardly be called "good science",
even in the US EPA vernacular.
One of the problems I had noted in managing the bison involved the
assumption that the Yellowstone herd was a threat to Montana's
certification under USDA as a brucellosis-free area. Unlike most
Americans, I have seen the effects of brucellosis in animals and undulant
fever as it known in both animals and people. I have great respect for the
ability of communicable diseases to create terror in local populations.
There is no reason to think most citizens of Montana have the same frame of
reference. Upon checking into the facts of brucellosis transmission from
bison to cattle, I learned several things which create some real
epidemiological questions in my mind.
In recent years, it seems, one of the Yellowstone bison was captured
(perhaps in Montana during a previous winter) and kept confined in a small
stall. I am not certain of the disposition of the bison, however, according
to the story, the stall was later used to contain a cow (non-bison). That
cow later was diagnosed with brucellosis. Therefore, as illogic would
follow, the bison transmitted the brucellosis to the cow. Apparently, this
was the only such occurrence.
There is an immunization for cattle against brucellosis, but it is
apparently not totally useful. It is, as is true of most immunizations, not
100% effective. Efficacy varies with the sex, age, and other factors of the
cow.
The blood test being used to test Yellowstone bison for brucellosis when
they range into Montana was developed to check titer counts in cattle. It
has not been proven effective for determining the communicability of bison.

It has not been proven that the serotype of brucellosis in bison is the
same as the serotype which causes symptoms in cattle.
The bison management plane offered by the GYE Coalition listed several
(perhaps 8, if I recall) options for actions to be taken. Of course, the
requisite option of doing nothing at all was listed, but never seriously
considered, in my opinion. I remember one option which instantly came to my
mind, but it was too politically-loaded for the GYE Coalition to even list
as a potential consideration.
I order to lure tourist dollars to the Yellowstone area during the winter
months, the roads to the towns of Gardiner and West Yellowstone, MT
[Montana, are packed each winter to allow snowmobile access through deep
snows. As you know, without snowmobiles, most tourists would go elsewhere
where there was a little less "real" nature to challenge them. When the
snows in Yellowstone NP [National Park are deep, the bison naturally start
using the packed roadways to ease their travel. Some portions of the park's
herds stay near the warmer geyser areas and never think to travel outside
the park. Other portions of the herds, notable those living in the north
and northeast areas, find the packed roadways too hard to resist. Over the
course of time, those herds have developed a tradition of traveling the
roads in winter.
The one option not considered is to stop packing the roadways during the
winter. Of course, the tourist supply will dry up, and the economies in the
boundary areas will need to shift to another source of income. To the south
of Yellowstone, in Rockefeller Memorial Parkway and GRTE, the roadways are
often allowed to become snowed in. Snowmobiles are allowed along certain
pathways, but the distances involved are usually in excess of what the
Jackson Hole [town in Wyoming tourists are willing to endure. Gardiner and
West Yellowstone access points are much closer for the casual tourist.
Another point of contention is that the bison management plan does not
consider the impact of elk on the spread of brucellosis. The elk may have a
higher infectivity rate than the bison in the GYE area. And they may be
more likely to spread the disease to cattle. Elk are often infected by the
habit of ingesting the afterbirths of their young.
However, would the political battle be too large to handle if Montana
considered that it should, to protect their brucellosis-free status, start
shooting all the elk, as well as the bison? I believe, if that were the
case, there would be a much larger coalition opposed to the deliberate
killing of bison and elk. I do not pretend to know the answers nor do I
have the ability to predict the political will of the country in preventing
the deaths of the bison. I am of the opinion that Science has not yet
entered into the picture with any clarity. I hope it doesn't arrive too late.

[There is an unknown factor not addressed by Mr. Moore. Did the cow, housed
in the same stall as the previous bison occupant, already have brucellosis?
Was she tested negative prior to her housing in the stall? There are many
political issues at stake in the brucellosis triangle between bison,
cattle, and elk. It would be nice to have some real science to support the
issues at hand. - Mod.TG
