NBI rules out cyanide in Bohol poisoning
-----------------------------------------
The National Bureau of Investigation has ruled out cyanide as cause of the
death of at least 27 schoolchildren in a town in Bohol last week.
The bureau's forensic findings revealed that coumaphos, an organophosphate
insecticide, was found on the specimens collected from the house of vendor
and from the internal organs of 2 of the schoolchildren who died.
The organophosphate insecticide was found on the sample from the frying pan
in the vendor's kitchen as well as blood and stomach contents of the
embalmed bodies of 2 of the victims.
"This development is deemed significant in the light of prevailing fears of
some sectors that the cause of death was due to the presence of hydrocyanic
acid, naturally present in cassava," the NBI said. The NBI forensic team
was dispatched to barangay San Jose in Mabini, Bohol on 11 Mar 2005 when
the bureau was tapped to be the lead agency in the investigation of the
mass poisoning of children enrolled at San Jose Elementary School in
Mabili, Bohol.
The children died shortly after eating a snack made of cassava. The vendor
suffered a heart attack after being blamed for the tragedy. She herself ate
the snacks that she sold and suffered the same negative effects. She
remains in the hospital. The NBI will talk to the vendor together with a
psychologist to determine her state of mind.
In an interview with The Freeman, Agent Renato Mandawe, of the NBI in
Bohol, said they will now determine how the pesticide got into the frying
pan that Luyong used in making the cassava snack. Mandawe said that will
narrow down the investigation by determining which pesticides have
organophosphate as a product component.
Mandawe revealed that they actually looked into the angle that a person
tried to sabotage the vendor's business by pretending to buy and
subsequently placing poison into the snack when she looked for loose change
for his money. However, the investigation yielded negative results.
According to the website Healthcentral.com, "serious poisoning can occur
from just the handling the organophosphate without gloves or without
washing hands soon after exposure" and that "significant amounts are
absorbed through the skin unless proper precautions are observed."
The website further states that among the symptoms of poisoning by the
pesticide include weakness, sweating, convulsions and increased urination.
The person may also experience headache, abdominal cramps, difficulty in
breathing and increased salivation.
Following the recent food poisoning in Mabini Bohol, councilor Edgardo
Labella pushed for the adoption of a proposed resolution which urges the
Department of Education here in Cebu to conduct training for first aid
among teachers of elementary and secondary schools.
