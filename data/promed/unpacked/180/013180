Post offices reopen after anthrax scare
---------------------------------------
WASHINGTON DC: The post office has reopened 11 Washington area facilities
that had been shuttered as a precaution after tests at a naval mail sorting
office indicated the possible presence of anthrax. Follow-up tests were
negative for anthrax.
"Everything's back to normal," said Jim Quirk, a spokesman for the US
Postal Service. "Two of the 11 post offices were reopened Friday night, and
the other 9 resumed business as usual Saturday morning."
The facilities were closed on Thursday after an automated alarm and a
follow-up test indicated the presence of small amounts of biological
pathogens, possibly anthrax, at the Anacostia Naval Station, which handles
mail for federal agencies. Officials then conducted a series of tests,
which turned up no traces of anthrax. Results from a final round of tests
Saturday were also negative, said Navy spokesman Ed Zeigler. Officials have
found no contaminated mail.
Five workers at the Navy site were offered the antibiotic ciprofloxacin as
a precaution recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
said Zeigler.
Preliminary tests for anthrax often are inaccurate. Several false alarms
have temporarily disrupted business since the still-unsolved anthrax
attacks in 2001.

Anthrax scare ends after more testing: post offices to reopen today; navy
facility declared safe
-------------------------------------
A brief anthrax alert was declared a false alarm last night, and US Postal
Service officials began reopening mail facilities in the Washington area
that they had closed as a precaution.
The scare began at about 5 pm on Wednesday, when a routine test of air
filters at a mail-sorting facility at the Anacostia Naval Station turned up
positive for a biological agent identified initially as anthrax. But Navy
officials said last night that a series of tests conducted yesterday
indicated that finding was a "false positive," with the facility ultimately
showing no sign of anthrax spores. "We call it a non-event, and we say
thank goodness," Barbara Childs-Pair, acting director of the DC Emergency
Management Agency, said last night, echoing the relief of many officials
and postal workers who feared a replay of the deadly anthrax mailings of
fall 2001.
The results announced last night brought a harmless close to a day in which
officials from various agencies tested and retested samples from the
Anacostia site, the Postal Service disrupted mail delivery to thousands of
Washington area homes and businesses, and the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention put doctors in several states on alert and prompted
regional authorities to gear up for an emergency.
Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), chairman of the Governmental Affairs
Committee, which has oversight over the Postal Service and the US
Department of Homeland Security, praised the quick response by officials
but said the scare underscored gaps in biomedical surveillance systems.
"The Postal Service took appropriate steps by shutting down certain
facilities to safeguard employees," Collins said. "Unfortunately, this
incident also shows how vulnerable we still are to bioterrorist attacks."
Scientists will continue to monitor cultures taken from the Anacostia
facility before declaring an end to the episode. "We're not going to leave
people's lives at risk," said one federal official. Homeland Security
officials declared that no positive results have been confirmed by CDC.
The positive readings sparked a widespread response from postal, federal
and health officials. The House of Representatives and Senate shut down
mail delivery yesterday as a precaution. The US Postal Service closed 11
mail handling and post office locations in the Washington area, including
the facility that processes US government mail, temporarily disrupting mail
delivery to 251 000 homes and businesses. Postal officials said they
planned to open 2 facilities last night and said all would be open for
business today. Navy officials said they would reopen their mail facility
Monday.
Reacting to the episode, CDC activated emergency response plans, causing
states to deploy caches of antibiotics in the Washington area. Medication
for 1500 to 5000 people was readied for use, Maryland health officials
said, with more available if needed. Officials preliminarily planned to
provide treatment for about 75 employees at each of the shuttered 11 postal
facilities and additional doses for post office customers. Hospitals and
health departments were on standby in the Washington area, following
Department of Homeland Security conference calls.
Postal officials said they were erring on the side of caution when they
ordered their V Street NE mail sorting facility closed, as well as the
neighborhood post offices in the District, Maryland, and Virginia. They
said they shut the V Street facility because it supplies 20 000 pieces of
mail daily to the Anacostia Naval Station and closed the neighborhood
offices because they serve as collection points for mail destined for the
Anacostia site.
Thomas G Day, the Postal Service's vice president for engineering, said he
was happy with the swiftness of the agency's response. "When we were
notified of the issue at hand, we were able to respond immediately," Day
said. He added that the disruption affected roughly 100 000 homes and
businesses in the District, 45 000 in Virginia, and 100 000 in Maryland.
Tests for anthrax spores were conducted yesterday and Thursday at the 11
facilities. Those results were not expected until today, but officials said
they were confident, after learning that further testing showed no anthrax
at the Anacostia site, that they would not find anything.
Several businesses reported no significant disruption by the Postal
Service's actions. The Greater Washington Board of Trade and the DC Chamber
of Commerce said they had not heard complaints from members. One of the
District facilities closed yesterday, the Ward Place post office, served
the downtown commercial area near Farragut Square, leaving hundreds of
small shops, restaurants and law offices without mail delivery. Mary Walls,
office administrator for Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP at 1050 Connecticut
Ave. NW, said the lack of mail service was only a slight inconvenience. "If
it's very important, it's transmitted electronically or overnighted," she said.
Tests of the air and surfaces inside the Anacostia facility conducted
yesterday showed no signs of anthrax, a Navy official said last night.
Further testing will be done to verify those results, but, said Commander
Conrad Chun, a Navy spokesman, "the guys are confident that there's no
anthrax." Chun described the tests conducted by the Naval Medical Research
Center in Silver Spring as being "much more refined" than preliminary tests
that showed positive results.
The scare started with a routine procedure on Wednesday. The afternoon
batch of incoming mail at the Anacostia naval site was X-rayed and then
placed inside a negative pressure machine and shaken. Filters in the
machine were tested and turned up positive about 5 pm, Navy officials said.
A contractor, the Louisiana-based Shaw Group Inc, screens mail at the
processing facility at the station, and CDC recommended that the company's
five employees who were inside the facility start taking the antibiotic
ciprofloxacin as a precaution.
The equipment used by Shaw typically registers about one positive reading
per month, officials said. In all previous cases, subsequent testing was
negative. This time, subsequent testing resulted in a second positive
reading. At that point, the contractors secured the facility and began
notifying authorities. Samples were sent out for further testing. The
testing, conducted Thursday morning, found negative results in all but one,
and that one triggered another set of tests. Eventually, results completed
yesterday by the Navy lab for CDC turned up negative.
Most of the mail that comes to the facility is government mail, addressed
to government agencies, in particular Navy and Marine Corps addresses,
naval officials said.
Mail processed at the V Street facility arrives at the Navy facility long
after it has been irradiated in New Jersey. Irradiation is designed to kill
anthrax bacteria. The Postal Service began irradiating government mail
following the anthrax crisis 2 years ago, shipping DC-bound federal
government mail to New Jersey.
Postal officials said irradiation has been a significant line of defense in
protecting government mail. The irradiation process used by the Postal
Service has been approved by the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy. Following the 2001 anthrax crisis, the office convened
an interagency technical team to evaluate and validate the irradiation
process for government mail, and it offered the parameters under which the
mail should be decontaminated. "We know that the process is working," said
Lawrence Kerr, the office's assistant director for homeland security.
