We were concerned with several apparent misrepresentations related in the 13
June 1996 posting from Dr. Michael Woodford, IUCN/VSG, on chronic wasting
disease of deer and wapiti; the quotes in this posting were credited to Dr.
Francois Moutou and excerpted from an article that appeared in the 19 May
1996 issue of Le Monde, although the latter was not entirely clear from the
posting. Unfortunately, we were unable to acquire a copy of Dr. Moutou's
original article in La Semaine Veterinaire prior to preparing this response.
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has occurred in captive deer and wapiti from
wildlife research facilities in northcentral Colorado and southeastern
Wyoming, USA, since the late 1960's. Since its recognition as a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in the late 1970's, various aspects
of the signs, pathology, and epizootiology of CWD have been described in some
50 reports, presentations, press releases, and peer-reviewed articles
beginning in 1979 -- the occurrence of this disease has been anything but a
well-kept secret. Subsequent to its recognition in captive deer and wapiti,
CWD was also diagnosed in free-ranging conspecifics beginning in 1981.

Although most of the 65 free-ranging cases have been submitted in recent
years, this appears largely coincident with the inception of active
surveillance programs for suspect deer and wapiti in the enzootic area and
increased recognition of suspect cases in the wild. To date all free-ranging
cases have arisen within about 100 km of affected research facilities,
although it's not clear whether CWD in captive animals truly preceded the
disease in free-ranging animals or vice versa. A few surveys of wild deer
and wapiti outside this enzootic area (and in other parts of North America)
have failed to detect CWD, although additional surveillance may be warranted.
Within the enzootic area, as in captivity, CWD appears to be maintained
naturally in affected deer and wapiti populations via lateral (and perhaps
vertical) transmission.
The natural host range of CWD appears limited to species in the genera
Cervus and Odocoileus: spongiform encephalopathies have not been diagnosed
in sympatric herbivorous or carnivorous species in either the enzootic area
or in affected research facilities. With the exception of the recent
Canadian case (a captive wapiti imported to Saskatchewan from South Dakota,
USA, as a calf), all cases of CWD diagnosed since the mid-1970's have come
from this localized area; to our knowledge, the origin of infection in the
Canadian case remains undetermined.
Based on the information available to date, CWD appears to be neither BSE nor
scrapie, but rather a unique transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of
native North American cervids whose occurrence and distribution are limited
when compared to the former diseases of domestic ruminants.
