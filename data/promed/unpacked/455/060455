Togo says bird flu hits poultry farm
------------------------------------
An outbreak of bird flu has been confirmed in the West African nation
of Togo for the 1st time since last year [2007], the Health Ministry
said Tuesday [9 Sep 2008].

The virus was detected at a poultry farm housing more than 4500 birds
in the village of Agbata outside the capital, Lome, said a ministry
statement read over state television. It was not known how many birds
died, but more than 80 percent of those infected by the flu were
fatalities, the ministry said.

The statement did not say whether the birds were infected with the
deadly H5N1 strain of the virus, which has scientists concerned
because it has the potential to infect humans. At least 235 people
have died of bird flu worldwide since 2003, according to the World
Health Organization (WHO).

The Health Ministry banned the sale of all chicken and poultry
products in the region around the farm.

Laos reports bird flu outbreak
------------------------------
Samples from dead ducks in Laos' northern Luang Prabang province have
been tested positive to bird flu virus, prompting local authorities
to cull thousands of poultry to curb the disease's spread, Lao
newspaper Vientiane Times reported Tuesday [9 Sep 2008].

The authorities, already culling 3000 fowls, plan to cull over 7000
others in the province's Nambak district. Ducks started to die on 27
Aug 2008. They have been banned from transport, trade, and
consumption in the district.

No human cases have been recorded, and Lao authorities are advising
locals to take preventative measures.

Laos used to rely on bird flu laboratory tests from Thailand and Viet
Nam. The construction of a testing facility in Laos last year [2008]
enables local officials to independently confirm bird flu outbreaks,
the newspaper said. A new international standard laboratory, funded
by the Japanese government, is currently under construction in Laos'
Vientiane capital city.

Earlier this year [2008], a bird flu outbreak occurred in northern
Luang Namtha province, and local authorities culled thousands of
fowls to halt the spread of the disease, said the newspaper. [OIE

Several bird flu outbreaks have occurred in Laos since 2004. The most
serious outbreak happened in 2007 when 2 human fatalities were
confirmed in the capital city and northern Vientiane province, the
newspaper said.
