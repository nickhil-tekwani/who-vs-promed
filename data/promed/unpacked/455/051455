Regarding "Foot & mouth disease - Israel (03): (HZ) bovine, st O" and "Foot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth: (WE) ovine, st O," the "O Majdal Shams, Golan, Hazafon" and "O Jericho, West Bank, Palestinian AT" isolates are highly related, as the homologous rate between their VP1 genes nt sequences was found to be 98.3 percent.

[We are very grateful to Dr Stram for the above firsthand authoritative information indicating the similarity between the virus strains in both (distant) outbreaks.

The aerial distance between the infected cattle holding in Majdal Shams (Israel), northern Golan area, adjacent to the border with Syria/Lebanon, and the infected sheep holding in Jericho (Palestinian territory), about 20 km northeast of Jerusalem, adjacent to the Jordanian border, is about 150 km. Contact between the 2 holdings has not been detected and is rather unlikely. It is more reasonable to look out for virus circulation within the countries adjacent to both outbreaks (Jordan, Syria, Lebanon). Wildlife (in particular wild boar), which is abundant along the said borders and in particular along the Jordan river, deserves to be taken into consideration as well.

Annual vaccination of cattle, sheep, and goats against FMD is compulsory in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Reportedly, ring revaccinations have been recently applied around the 2 outbreaks. No additional outbreaks have been detected so far.

The serotype O component in the FMD vaccine, used in Israel during 2013, was composed of the following 4 strains: O1 3039, O1 Manisa, O 4625, and O1 Israel 2007 (Neve Ur). It will be interesting to obtain additional genotyping results, in particular on the relationship between the current Israeli/Palestinian O strain and the above vaccine strains, as well as with other FMDV strains circulating in the "Virus Pool 3" region (West Eurasia and the Middle East).

The most recent collected data on the FMD situation within the "Pool 3" region are available on pages 8-10 of the last (October 2013) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation" issued by the European Commission for the Control of FMD (EUFMD). The report is available at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/October_2013_FMD_global_report_DRAFT.pdf. - Mod.AS
