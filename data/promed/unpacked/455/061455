After health authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
officially declared that a number of measles epidemics had hit the
country, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) began carrying out mass
immunization campaigns to increase measles vaccination coverage in
the affected areas. In addition to vaccinations, medical teams have
treated hundreds of measles cases.

Measles is a highly-contagious viral infection that can spread
quickly with deadly consequences for vulnerable populations. DRC is
one of the countries where the disease persists despite successful
efforts to control it elsewhere in the world.

"Epidemics like these are avoidable if the population has been
vaccinated," said Karla Bil, MSF's Health Advisor. "Mass immunization
campaigns are so important because they raise the level of
vaccination coverage and prevent unnecessary deaths."

In the health zone of Fizi, in South Kivu province, MSF aims to
vaccinate 120 000 children between the ages of 6 months and 15 years.
Over the next 6 weeks, medical teams will keep trying to reach remote
locations despite ongoing and expanding military operations in the
area and the looming rainy season. The plan is to immunize nearly
every child in the health zone. Preparations started when a measles
epidemic was confirmed at the end of September [2010]. Since then, in
addition to the vaccinations, MSF has also treated approximately 300
people in the area who were suffering from measles and its complications.

Simultaneously, MSF has been responding to a measles epidemic around
Dilolo, in Kitanga Province, near the Angolan border. Since September
[2010], 368 measles cases have been confirmed. Last week, MSF started
a campaign to vaccinate 72 000 children in and around Dilolo. Teams
are hoping to vaccinate 90 percent of the children in the area. MSF
will also carry out an epidemiological assessment in the neighboring
health zone of Kasaji, where measles cases have been reported.

In Bendera, MSF teams are vaccinating 12 000 children, half of whom
were displaced from their homes in South Kivu last year [2009]. MSF
teams have also treated several cases of measles in the region. The
village of Lubilo was at the epicenter of the measles outbreak.
Located in South Kivu, on the eastern side of a peninsula that
extends into Lake Tanganyika, the village has a population of
approximately 3500 people and is extremely isolated, reachable only
by boat. After the local health authority reported that 12 cases of
measles had resulted in the deaths of 2 children, an MSF team left
for the village the next day. After a 5-hour boat trip, they were
greeted by concerned villagers. The 1st priority was setting up an
isolation tent where suspected cases could receive treatment and the
spread of the disease could be contained. Measles is an extremely
contagious disease; almost all non-immune children contract the
infection if exposed to the virus.

The next task was informing villagers via megaphone to bring any sick
children immediately to the heath post for free medical care. Soon,
the wooden benches were filled by mothers with sick children waiting
for a consultation. A child had died the night before, and people
were desperate to get their children seen. Many were severely
dehydrated, malnourished, and suffering from complications such as
pneumonia or diarrhea. 50 cases were confirmed that day alone, and 5
seriously ill children were immediately given IV drips. One of them
died during the night. The other 4 were transferred by boat to the
MSF-supported hospital in Baraka the next day. MSF has treated around
300 children who have been affected by the measles epidemic in and
around Lubilo.

MSF had vaccinated more than half a million children against measles
in 2009, but dealing with the current outbreaks was a different
undertaking given the present and urgent need to vaccinate so many
children so quickly. MSF employed more than 100 extra staff in South
Kivu to visit villages in the region and inform them about the free
vaccination program. There were also radio announcements in several
local languages. It was no easy task to get enough of the vaccine
into the country in the first place. "It's been a huge logistical
challenge sourcing 150 000 doses of measles vaccine at fairly short
notice, certainly considering the heightened demand in the region,"
said Grace Tang, MSF's Head of Mission in South Kivu.

And once the vaccine was in the country, MSF had to ensure that it
was kept cold during transportation so that it reached the
populations in optimal condition. The measles vaccine contains live
[virus] and to be effective must be kept at a controlled temperature
between 2-8 C. "We've had to use cooling elements, solar powered
fridges, and locate fridges along the route," said Tang. "But it's
been so worthwhile seeing children in the area getting a lifetime's
protection from this disease."
