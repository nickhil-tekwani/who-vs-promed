A 7-year-old Paint pony gelding in Scott County, Kentucky has tested
positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) on PCR (polymerase chain
reaction test) and has neurologic signs, according to a statement
from the Kentucky State Veterinarian's office. The pony has the "wild
strain" of EHV-1, not the mutated strain that is more virulent.

The pony was ridden and fine on Saturday [15 Nov 2008] and had a
normal temperature and acted normally Sunday morning, then that
afternoon was thought to be "cast" in his stall. When he was gotten
up, he showed neurologic signs. The veterinarian was called, and
tests showed the pony was EHV-1 positive.

The pony, which arrived on the farm on 3 Oct 2008 from Michigan, can
get up and down by itself and had better tail tone today [19 Nov
2008]. He is expected to make a full recovery.

Preliminary tests on selected other horses in the pony's barn showed
one horse had a positive nasal swab, but no horses in the barn had
clinical signs of herpesvirus. All 24 horses in the barn will be
tested tomorrow [20 Nov 2008] to determine exposure to EHV-1.

The farm, Caddel Equine Therapy Center, is under state quarantine
until test results are completed, and no horses have moved from the
facility. Because of the type of operation, a post-hospital lay-up
farm, all horses have temperatures checked twice a day, and the farm
is operated under strict biosecurity standards on a day-to-day basis.

Operator Linda Caddel said another barn on the property that houses
broodmares has no direct or indirect association with the horses in
the hospital barn. All equipment and personnel are separate because
of standard biosecurity measures in place on the farm.

The pony and the one horse that had a preliminary positive nasal swab
will be maintained in a separate quarantine barn on the property
until all horses are cleared.

Rusty Ford, of the Kentucky State Veterinarian's office, said because
high biosecurity is standard on the farm, he feels there is little
risk of spread off the farm or to the other barn.
