[In 1996, 4/24 Swedish tourists on a trip to Southeast Asia were diagnosed
with falciparum (malignant) malaria on their return home. The incubation
period indicated that they had caught the infection in Lombok. That same
year, laborers from Lombok brought malaria to Bali, and the disease spread
locally -- see references above. The current sudden influx of people
exposed to malaria in Lombok could easily trigger an outbreak in Bali -
