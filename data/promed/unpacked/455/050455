ProMED-mail posting "Foot & mouth disease, wild boar - Israel (N.& N.E.)
20070517.1571" contains 2 errors in the commentary that need correction:
1. The sentence: "Between 1987-1999, a total of 740 boar sera were sampled,
of which 108 (14.6 percent) were found SN (sentinel node) positive" should
read "Between 1987-1999, a total of 740 boar sera were sampled, of which
108 (14.6 percent) were found SN (seroneutralisation) positive".
2. The sentence: "It is not clear if the apparent very high rate of
positive boar in 2007 is indicative of higher infection rate compared to
past observations, or rather a reflection of the high sensitivity of the
ELISA SMP (sodium metaperiodate) test", should read "It is not clear if the
apparent very high rate of positive boar in 2007 is indicative of higher
infection rate compared to past observations, or rather a reflection of the
high sensitivity of the ELISA NSP (non specific proteins) test".
ProMED-mail regrets these errors.
