Canada exceeds test target for mad cow disease
----------------------------------------------
Canada surpassed its goal of testing 30 000 cattle for mad cow disease in
2005, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Friday, and will continue
to test as many old and sick cattle as possible. As of 17 Jun, Canada had
tested 32 363 samples at federal and provincial laboratories in 2005, up
from 23 550 in 2004 and 5500 in 2003.
2 cattle in January 2005 were confirmed to have bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. Canada found its 1st case of the
disease 2 years ago. The 1st US case in December 2003 was also traced to a
Canadian-born animal.
The target was designed to detect one diseased animal out of one million
healthy animals, the CFIA said, making its surveillance program equivalent
to that of the United States. The agency will continue to test as many
samples as it receives from veterinarians and farmers, whose costs are
partly reimbursed by the federal government, said Marc Richard, a media
relations officer. "We want to get the clearest, [most] accurate picture of
what the prevalence of the disease is," Richard said. The agency targets
cattle over 30 months of age that have died, are immobile, or show other
signs of illness.
Mad cow disease can take more than 5 years to incubate, and Canadian
officials have been reluctant to widely test healthy young animals for the
illness. Canada had a record 15.8 million cattle as of 1 Apr 2005,
Statistics Canada data shows. The herd has grown by more than 15 per cent
since Canada found its 1st case of mad cow disease because of trade bans on
live animal shipments. Canada relied on exporting about 1 million head of
live cattle per year to US slaughter plants before the bans, and does not
have enough capacity to slaughter all the livestock it produces. Statscan
said farmers are holding on to more than 900 000 older cows that they would
normally have culled because of poor prices and limited markets.

[The energy shown by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is highly
commendable and -- one hopes -- will be considered positively and rewarded
in the forthcoming discussion on opening the US/Canadian border to Canadian
cattle. - Mod.MHJ]
