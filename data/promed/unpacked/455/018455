The regional administration of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for
Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] has released a statement
concerning hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the
Udmurtia region. Sampling surveys of forest rodents [the wild
reservoir of the disease] show a 2-4 fold increase in population size
compared with the preceding year [2010] and high infection rates (9-13
percent).

However, HFRS incidence during the 1st 5 months of 2011 was lower
than for the comparable period of 2010 [70 cases in 2011], but since
the beginning of June 2011 the incidence has begun to increase. Also
the proportion of severe cases this year is greater than during the
previous year [2010]. There has also been one fatality -- a young man
living in the town of Izhevsk.

The main route of HFRS infection is respiratory (via dust generated
during cleaning activities), alimentary (consumption of contaminated
food), and by transmission via soiled hands while smoking or eating. A
considerable number of cases have been a consequence of gardening and
participation in other outdoor activities. Indeed, 43.8 percent of
cases of cases in the city of Izhevsk have been contracted in this
manner. Up to 1/3 of cases of HFRS are contracted during the period
when people spend time out-of-doors collecting mushrooms or picking
berries in the surrounding forests. It is predicted that the situation
will continue to deteriorate into the autumn due to the increase in
the rodent population.

[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of
clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses from the family
_Bunyaviridae_. HFRS occurs throughout the world. Puumala virus is the
likely cause of HFRS in Udmurtia.

Contamination of dust, food and hands is with the dried urine and
excreta of infected rodents, stirred up during cleaning of
rodent-infested premises.

Udmurtia is a sovereign republic within the Russian Federation. It is
situated in the western part of the Middle Urals between the Kama and
Vyatka rivers. A map showing the location of the Republic of Udmurtia
