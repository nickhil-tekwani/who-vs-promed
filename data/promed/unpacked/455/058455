[In follow-up report No. 34, submitted to the OIE on 20 Apr 2018, the Czech Republic's authorities reported on 3 new ASF cases in wild boar found dead in a forest within the infected zone in Zlinsky province. The most recent one, among the 3, reportedly started on 19 Apr 2018, in Luzkovice, Zlin, Zlinsky. During the 6 subsequent months and as of now, not a single new ASF case has been recorded, allowing the Czech Republic to declare the event "resolved" as of 19 Apr 2018.

During the entire event, since its start on 21 Jun 2017, the domestic swine population remained free of infection. The measures applied by the Czech authorities to control and eradicate ASF from wild boar within its territory have been recently described in a presentation, which is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20180919_pres_asf_cze.pdf.

Since 13 Sep 2018, 70 wild boars have been tested positive for the African swine fever virus in the region of Etalle in the province of Luxembourg.

To date, 126 wild boars have been collected, of which 99 were found in the 63 000 hectare security perimeter. "Of these, there are now 70 viropositive cases," says the regional minister. Wild boar collected outside the perimeter are all negative.

The activities of the various authorities involved are coordinated to prevent the possible spread of the virus through wild boar and to pig farms. Generally, the powers are divided between the regions with regard to the wild animals and the FASFC with regard to domestic pigs.

A contamination zone has been delineated around the infections by the FASFC and the Walloon Region. In the zone, all domestic pigs were killed between 29 Sep and 2 Oct 2018 (decision of the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Denis Ducarme). Repopulation of the farms in the zone is prohibited until further notice.

[The spread of ASF within the wild boar population of the affected territory in southeast Belgium (map at the source URL) continues; the epizootic has not peaked yet. The accomplished culling of the entire domestic pig population within the declared "security zone" may, hopefully, facilitate the eradication of this epizootic, provided biosecurity is satisfactorily maintained. - Mod.AS
