LIVESTOCK DISEASE SITUATION IN THE HORN OF AFRICA: a preliminary analysis
from FAO EMPRES (5/2/98)
Having just returned from Kenya and Ethiopia, I am now in a position to
provide some information. I am grateful to the Kenyan Veterinary and
Medical Services, the Tanzanian Department of Livestock Development, the
Ethiopian Veterinary Team, members of the WHO team in Kenya and many
individuals who have provided the information on which the analysis is
based.
This brief summary deals primarily with the livestock disease situation;
reports from WHO will provide the human disease dimension. In addition to
attempting to describe the existing situation. I have added some indication
of the possible developments in the near future.
THE SITUATION IN KENYA AND SOMALIA
Rift Valley Fever
Historically, within the Horn of Africa, RVF epidemics have occurred in
Rift Valley and Central Provinces of Kenya at prolonged intervals over 70
years or more. Northern Tanzania forms part of this disease zone but RVF
occurrence in north-eastern Kenya has been a rare event in the past. The
climatic factors favouring its emergence from the area in which the
infection persists have been well studied and it is known that epidemics
follow heavy and prolonged, often unseasonal, rainfall. Examination of
remote sensing data at FAO for the past five months indicates that such
conditions had prevailed in Kenya at the end of 1997. In appreciation of
the risk the Kenya Veterinary Service (KVS) warned farmers of the risk and
advised vaccination of high potential livestock. Livestock vaccinated in
December appear to have been protected. The remote sensing data also
indicate that suitable conditions for the explosive multiplication of
mosquito vectors existed and persist over extensive areas of Kenya,
southern Somalia, south-eastern and southern Ethiopia, eastern Uganda,
southern Sudan and northern Tanzania. Reports and investigations by the
KVS, backed up by laboratory confirmation, are consistent with the
understanding that RVF has been occurring in December 1997 and January
1998, primarily in sheep, cattle and camels, in Central and Rift Valley
Provinces and the west of Eastern Province of Kenya. The disease pattern
here has been typical with fever, abortion (the predominant feature), early
neonatal death, jaundice and death predominantly in young animals, and a
fall in milk yield in dairy cattle. Humans have generally suffered an
influenza-like disease with few complications.
>From mid-December 1997, a fatal haemorrhagic fever of humans has been
affecting people in Wajir, Garissa and Tana River Districts of
North-eastern and Eastern Provinces of Kenya and in southern Somalia. Rift
Valley fever (RVF) virus has been identified as a causal agent in this
epidemic. RVF-associated human haemorrhagic disease has also been confirmed
west of Magadi in Rift Valley Province of Kenya. Reports of similar human
disease in the north of Somalia (Erigavo, Bosaso, Hargeisa) have not been
confirmed; investigations are in progress.
At the same time the presence of RVF associated with livestock disease has
been confirmed in north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia. The abortions
reported in camels and goats are consistent with the diagnosis of RVF, as
could also be some reports of disease and mortality, some associated with
blood stained discharges. Abortions of livestock have also been reported
from southern Kenya associated temporally with confirmed RVF in humans.
However, other reports of high morbidity and mortality in camels, small
ruminants and cattle (the last in a limited area of Lower and Middle Juba
Regions of Somalia), and the few descriptions of clinical signs, are not
consistent with RVF. I am not aware of any reports of unusual livestock
morbidity in the northern part of Somalia.
Other Livestock Diseases
The conditions prevailing in the affected area favour the generation of
large populations of mosquitoes, midges and biting flies and, therefore, an
increase in incidence of many of the diseases they transmit was to be
expected. Not surprisingly disease with signs typical of bluetongue is
reported to be affecting improved breeds of sheep (wool sheep, Dorpers and
their crosses) in Kenya away from the northeast and in northern Tanzania.
As expected indigenous sheep and goats do not feature in reports.
Initial suspicions of anthrax have not been borne out by subsequent
investigations, albeit limited. However, the disease could still be a
component of the animal mortality reported and merits consideration,
especially later as the land dries out.
Investigations in NE Kenya and Somalia have been severely hampered by
flooding but investigations are proceeding. The aetiology of the livestock
diseases is not fully established. The understanding presented here will
certainly be amended as more information becomes available. The peak of the
RVF epidemic may now have passed in Kenya and Somalia.
Superimposed on the effects of RVF, other aetiological components which are
likely to be contributing are, by species and disease:
Small Ruminants
Disease resulting from environmental factors: heavy mortality of small
ruminants was associated with the flooding, peaking in NE Kenya in
December. "Foot rot" appears to be widespread as a consequence of long
immersion of the feet in water and mud; loss of the hooves is reported and
ventral dermatitis. Secondary bacterial infection and pain preventing
movement to find food probably resulted in high mortality. It is to be
expected that the stress of heavy rainfall following drought conditions and
combined with malnutrition predisposed them to disease conditions such as
pneumonic pasteurellosis.
Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) was confirmed by the KVS to have
been the cause of respiratory disease and mortality in goats near to
Garissa in early January. It is endemic to the pastoral communities of
northern Kenya, southern Ethiopia and southern Somalia and is suspected to
be causing significant mortality.
Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is considered by the Ethiopian Veterinary
Team to be endemic in south-west Ethiopia and was confirmed to be present
in 1997 in the Somali and Oromiya Regional States of Ethiopia. During 1997,
clinical reports from field operatives in central and southern Somalia
described a disease syndrome highly suggestive of PPR. Although clinical
PPR has never been identified in Kenya, the Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute detected antibodies to PPR in sera collected from 1981 to 1985 in
the border areas of western and northern Kenya. Consequently, the risk of
PPR introduction and/or spread must be considered to be high.
Helminthosis, primarily the stomach worm causing haemonchosis, develops
rapidly in suitable conditions of soil moisture and high ambient
temperature. Severely anaemic sheep with bottle jaw were indeed found to
have heavy burdens of Haemonchus in Kenya. An increase in incidence with
high mortality could be expected to occur as pastures dry out.
Cattle
Cattle have not featured highly in disease reports from the affected areas
except for some reports of unusual mortality from Middle and Lower Juba
Regions of Somalia in January. A clear clinical case description is
lacking. In 1996 the KVS reported the presence of rinderpest in the Mandera
district of North-east Province and since then the disease has been under
surveillance and intensive control activities. There was an unconfirmed
report of a clinical syndrome suggestive of rinderpest in Gedo Region of
Somalia in March/April 1997. It is important that veterinary services,
including those of NGOs, be alerted to the significance of occurrence of a
clinical syndrome which could be suggestive of rinderpest. Any suspicious
signs must be reported to the official veterinary service in order that
prompt action can be taken.
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was present in the Somali Regional State of
Ethiopia, near the border with Kenya, in mid 1997. Clearly, there exists a
risk of dissemination of this infection.
Camels
Many reports of high mortality in camels have been received from throughout
the affected area. The abortion storms described are consistent with RVF
being a cause as is some mortality in young animals. Other descriptions of
morbidity and mortality are highly suggestive of camel pox (or the rarer
parapox) - swelling of the labia and head, lesions on the inside (overlain
by a diphtheritic membrane) and outside of the labia, blockage of the
nares.
A "camel respiratory disease syndrome" is a relatively new disease which
spread in epidemic form in recent years from Sudan through Eritrea,
Ethiopia and Djibouti into Somalia and NE Kenya. Its cause is unknown. One
group of researchers has suggested that PPR virus might be involved whilst
others favour an aetiology involving mycoplasma and/or pasteurellosis
because of suggestive pathology and response to antibiotic therapy. After
the initial epidemic abated, a resurgence of this disease is known to have
been occurring in the Afar and Somali Regional States of Ethiopia in 1997
and it was also present in Somalia. It is possible that this disease could
be contributing to the morbidity; mortality can be high.
Wildlife
The disease which killed some 200 Gerenuk in northern Kenya in December
1997 to January 1998 was characterised by oral hyperaemia and coronitis
raising suspicions that BT or EHD could be responsible. Examinations are
still pending but no further wildlife mortalities have been reported even
in game in close contact with livestock.
Other Considerations/Risks
With high populations of biting flies and midges, it is likely that lumpy
skin disease and ephemeral fever will become prevalent in the near future.
Tick burdens are likely to increase considerably as the land dries, causing
an increase in direct damage (-tick worry- including foot abscessation ).
Nairobi sheep disease epidemics could be experienced, causing abortion
storms and mortality in indigenous sheep and goats, resembling RVF. East
Coast fever could extend well outside its normal range.
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is endemic in the area and mixing
of cattle herds with crowding provides ideal conditions for transmission.
Several different leptospiral serovars (L. grippotyphosa and L.
icterohaemorrhagiae, for example) cause disease in a broad range of
livestock species, primarily in humid conditions. This is usually marked by
fever, abortion in pregnant females, haemoglobinuria, jaundice with
moderate to high mortality, closing resembling RVF. Leptospirosis needs to
be considered in differential diagnosis.
Tse-tse fly transmitted trypanosomosis of cattle is normally present in
southern Somalia and neighbouring Kenya; it is thought to have been
increasing in incidence in NE Kenya before the recent events. Favourable
conditions for tse-tse fly multiplication could be provided as the land
dries out and infection rates could increase. An increase in incidence
could also occur from mechanical transmission by biting flies which are
prevalent. Surra (Trypanosoma evansi infection) is prevalent in camel
populations in the region in normal times and an increase in incidence
would be expected to follow the increase in the numbers of biting flies
favoured by high soil moisture.
TANZANIA
On 5/1/98 a team from the Veterinary Investigation Centre, Arusha, visited
a ranch in western Kilimanjaro Region of northern Tanzania to investigate
reported mortality, from December 1997, in cattle and Black-headed Persian
sheep. In the sheep particularly, their findings were strongly indicative
of an outbreak of BT. Samples have been taken and confirmation is awaited.
ETHIOPIA
Investigations by the Ethiopian veterinary services in South Omo district
of south-west Ethiopia from 11 to 17 Jan concluded that there was no
unusual morbidity of livestock or people although there has been extensive
flooding and conditions for vector multiplication are ideal.
The Ethiopian veterinary services are actively investigating the
possibility that the same disease epidemic conditions as were experienced
in Kenya and Somalia could have extended to include the south-eastern part
of Ethiopia. Reports of human illness are also being followed up by the
medical services.
