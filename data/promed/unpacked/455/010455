The 1st human case of West Nile fever (WNF) in the European region for the 2015 transmission season was reported on 23 Jun [2015] in Sofia, Bulgaria.

The detection of a WNF case in Bulgaria is not unexpected: the country has previously reported cases and is surrounded by countries with reported cases in previous years.

West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne disease, transmitted by the most common local mosquito species in Europe (_Culex_), which is found throughout Europe and is active during the summer. There is no vaccine or prophylaxis available [for humans; there is a vaccine available for equine animals. - Mod.TY], the only prevention is through avoiding and preventing mosquito bites.

Most human infections with West Nile virus are asymptomatic. Most people that get sick have mild, flu-like symptoms lasting for 3-6 days, such as fever, headache and body aches. Weakness, malaise, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, nausea and vomiting could also occur. In rare cases, the infection could lead to serious complications of the nervous system such as encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis or meningitis (Read more on the disease in the ECDC factsheet).

West Nile is an imported tropical mosquito-borne disease, but it has been present in Europe since the 1950s and is transmitted by local mosquitoes. Since 2010, when a large outbreak in Greece occurred, and implementation of close surveillance during the transmission season in 2011, hundreds of autochthonous (locally acquired) West Nile fever cases have been reported in Europe every year (See ECDC infographic on emerging mosquito-borne disease in Europe).

In 2011 ECDC started to implement West Nile fever surveillance during the mosquito-transmission season in order to inform the blood safety authorities in Europe of areas in the EU and the neighbourhood with West Nile cases; according to EU legislation, blood donors from such areas should be deferred or tested.

[This report signals the beginning of the West Nile virus (WNV) transmission season in Europe. The 1st cases of the season usually appear in southern Europe, and later cases in both humans and unvaccinated equine animals can be expected further north in Central Europe and across the Mediterranean Basin countries. Although clinical cases are rare, the public in areas of risk are well advised to heed the advice of the ECDC and avoid mosquito bites.
