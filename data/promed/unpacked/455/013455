Virginia announces policy for active monitoring of all returning travelers
----------------------------------------
Governor Terry McAuliffe announced that starting today, Monday, 27 Oct 2014, the Virginia Department of Health will actively monitor the health of all travelers arriving from the countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, which are battling an unprecedented Ebola outbreak... "Today, the Commonwealth of Virginia will begin to actively monitor incoming travelers from countries battling the Ebola outbreak so that public health officials can respond quickly in the event of an Ebola case in our state," said Governor McAuliffe. "This plan will strengthen our ability to protect Virginians from Ebola, and increase our readiness to respond promptly in the event that we have a case of the disease in our state." ...

All travelers will be asked to take and record their temperature at least twice per day... Should a traveler develop any concerning symptoms, but an initial medical evaluation is negative, the traveler may be asked to remain at home for the remainder of the 21 days with close monitoring.

"This additional monitoring provides another level of protection from Ebola for the people of Virginia. The plan connects each traveler with our professional staff at Virginia's local health departments who know their community and can assure that the travelers will have the support, guidance and prompt clinical attention if needed. Because we will be able to assess the risk of each traveler, we will be better able to determine when a legal order of quarantine is necessary," said State Health Commissioner Dr. Marissa J. Levine...

Pennsylvania to monitor travelers from West Africa for Ebola virus
----------------------------------------
26 Oct 2014: (TribLIVE) Pennsylvania health officials will order any travelers with potential Ebola virus exposure in West Africa to stay off commercial buses, trains and other mass transportation for at least 21 days, according to protocols released Fri [24 Oct 2014]. The commonwealth is among 6 states that will broaden monitoring next week for people who enter the United States from outbreak-stricken Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The 6 states account for 70 percent of up to 150 people who arrive each day from those countries...

[I'm not sure how practical this will be to monitor. What will be done about people who need to get to work but don't have a car? It is also pointless, since Ebola is not transmitted through the air but only by contact with the body fluids of an infected person, a person who is sick and bleeding or vomiting in the USA is more likely to be traveling by ambulance rather than on mass transit. If they do take a bus or other transport, nobody is going to touch them in their condition, so there is very little danger. - Mod.JW]

[2] USA: (New Jersey) quarantined nurse released from hospital
Date: 27 Oct 2014 [updated]
Source: WSJ [edited]
http://online.wsj.com/articles/nurse-being-held-under-ebola-quarantine-at-newark-hospital-will-be-discharged-1414418399


A nurse who was being held at a Newark hospital under an Ebola quarantine left Mon [27 Oct 2014] and was to be privately transported to her home in Maine, officials said Monday. A spokeswoman for University Hospital in Newark confirmed that the nurse, Kaci Hickox, left at 1:20 p.m.

Both New York and New Jersey instituted mandatory quarantines last week for medical workers returning from West Africa. But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's administration has faced criticism in recent days after the nurse documented her isolation in Newark. The governor has also faced sharp attacks from medical health professionals and civil liberties groups on the mandatory quarantine for travelers returning from Ebola-ravaged countries.

The governor's office said Ms. Hickox, a 33-year-old nurse with Doctors Without Borders who recently returned from Sierra Leone, had been symptom free for 24 hours. Ms. Hickox has said she never had a fever or Ebola symptoms...

[3] USA: soldiers returning from Liberia, quarantined in Italy
Date: 27 Oct 2014
Source: CBS News [edited]
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebola-outbreak-u-s-soldiers-returning-from-liberia-placed-in-isolation-in-italy


"U.S. soldiers returning from Liberia are being placed in isolation in Vicenza, Italy out of concern for the Ebola virus, CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports. The soldiers being monitored include Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams who was the commander of the U.S. Army in Africa but turned over duties to the 101st Airborne Division over the weekend, Martin reports. There are currently 11 soldiers in isolation. ...

"A Pentagon spokesman calls it "enhanced monitoring." The soldiers are confined to a building and unable to see their families, Martin reports. The decision was made by the Army and applies only to soldiers returning from Liberia." ... They apparently were met by Carabinieri [see comment below] in full hazmat suits. If the policy remains in effect, everyone returning from Liberia -- several hundred -- will be placed in isolation for 21 days; 30 are expected in today [27 Oct 2014], Martin reports... - more

[The Italian carabinieri (paramilitary police force) are apparently similarly uninformed about the necessity for skin contact with the body fluids of an Ebola victim to transmit the virus. Or perhaps the wearing of hazmat gear is to reassure their families and the general public... - Mod.JW]

[4] Russian "vaccine" actually an antiviral drug

[Regarding the news item about a Russian Ebola "vaccine," Triazavirin, in ProMED Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (25): Norway doctor, USA quarantine, vaccines: 20141026.2903377, ProMED thanks the readers who have written in to point out that this is not a preventive vaccine but an antiviral drug with claimed activity against multiple viruses. We quoted the Tass report verbatim; it is evidently a mistranslation of the original report in Russian. - Mod.JW]

Australia to impose visa ban on West Africans over Ebola
-----------------------------------------------
27 Oct 2014: (Bernama) - Australia has closed the door to people seeking humanitarian entry from Ebola-affected west African countries. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement the temporary suspension meant his department was no longer processing any applications from countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The department is also cancelling and refusing non-permanent or temporary visas held by people from Ebola-affected countries who have yet to leave for Australia. Permanent visa holders from these countries are being required to submit to a 21-day quarantine period before departure for Australia.

USA: NY governor modifies quarantine order
------------------------------------
New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) on Sunday [26 Oct 2014] revised a controversial policy to quarantine returning health-care workers from Ebola-stricken nations, under pressure from the Obama administration and medical experts over the aggressive measures... Elaborating on the procedures, Cuomo said health-care workers who have been in contact with Ebola patients but do not show symptoms of the deadly virus can return to their homes but will be forced to remain there while being monitored by state health officials for symptoms. He said those being monitored can interact with family and friends. "It's not like this is the toughest duty," Cuomo said in a news conference late Sunday with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D). The change separates the state's quarantine process from that of New Jersey, which has come under scrutiny after the weekend retention of a nurse who showed no symptoms of Ebola. Kaci Hickox, who returned from Sierra Leone after working with Doctors Without Borders, has been held in isolation at a site attached to a New Jersey hospital...

WHO convenes industry leaders and key partners to discuss trials and production of Ebola vaccine
-----------------------------------------------
24 Oct 2014 -- WHO convened a high-level emergency meeting on 23 Oct 2014 to look at the many complex policy issues that surround access to Ebola vaccines. Ways to ensure the fair distribution and financing of these vaccines were discussed, as well as plans for the different phases of clinical trials to be performed concurrently rather than consecutively, partnerships for expediting clinical trials, and proposals for getting all development partners moving in tandem and at the same accelerated pace.
