Cases of rat-borne leptospirosis are on the rise in the Philippines, with more than 200 deaths since the beginning of the year [2022], the Philippine News Agency reported.

The statement indicates that between 1 Jan and 20 Aug [2022], the number of leptospirosis infections increased by 15% compared to the same period of the previous year [2021], going from 1278 to 1467 cases, and, according to the agency, 205 people have died in 2022 due to the disease.

Most of the confirmed cases were reported in the Metro Manila area. In recent weeks, an epidemic alert has been issued in the Bicol, Central and Eastern Visayas, and Davao regions; however, no outbreak has been reported in the country.

Leptospirosis infection is caused by a pathogen of the _Leptospira_ genus, which affects the kidneys, liver, muscles, and capillaries and is accompanied by fever. More than half of leptospirosis patients require intensive care. In terms of dangerousness, epidemiological importance, and economic damage, leptospirosis is on a par with tuberculosis and brucellosis.

The main source of the disease in nature is various species of small rodents. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with epidemic potential, mainly after heavy rains, caused by a bacterium called _Leptospira_. _Leptospira interrogans_ is pathogenic for humans and animals, with more than 200 serological varieties, or serovars.
