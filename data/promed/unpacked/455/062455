Re. Undiagnosed die-off, toads - Germany
-----------------------------------------------
It's an interesting situation, clearly a mass-mortality event, but little
more than that can be said at present. Ranaviruses and chytridiomycosis
(see previous ProMED posts on both of these diseases) both cause mass
mortalities in amphibians (including toads).
There are well-supported observations (all published in peer-reviewed
journals) of sites with hundreds of dead amphibians at some
chytridiomcyosis outbreaks and up to tens of thousands of dead salamanders
at sites of ranavirus outbreaks.
It's plausible that the dead toads in Germany all died relatively
simultaneously due to one of these or another infectious agent. They had
just congregated to breed, and this is a good opportunity for an outbreak.
Also, both ranaviruses and chytridiomycosis have been reported from Europe,
and there is evidence that they have been transported between outbreak
sites elsewhere, so it's possible they've just been introduced to the
waterbody.
One scenario is that large numbers of toads that died due to another reason
would then begin to decompose such that gases produced by gut bacteria
caused the "explosions," but of course, the cause of death remains uncertain.
The idea that birds attacked them, leading to the die-off, is unlikely.
European Bufo toads are mostly active at night and usually hide away during
the day, and there is only one previous report of a mass-mortality in which
birds were implicated, but that was countered by findings from another
group (Vet Record 1998 142 (10): 249-250).
The other idea, that recently imported horses infected them with an unknown
pathogen, is also unlikely, and there are no other reports that I know of
citing disease transmission from horses to toads. The article states that
they tested for fungal pathogens; it would be interesting to see whether
they tested for chytridiomycosis and ranaviruses. We await the results with
interest.

spread rapidly in a large group that had gathered for breeding. We
