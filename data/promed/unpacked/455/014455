EU countries (as of 15 Jun 2006)
------------
In the EU area, [13 countries have reported] HPAI
H5N1 since Feb 2006, [of which 8] in wild birds
only (*): Austria*, Czech Republic*, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece*, Hungary, Italy*,
Poland*, Slovakia*, Slovenia*, Sweden and United Kingdom*.
During the winter, the EU took harmonised control
measures: import bans on live birds and
potentially risky poultry products such as fresh
poultry meat and untreated feathers from all
countries and regions which have detected and
confirmed outbreaks of avian influenza; mandatory
surveys for avian influenza; step-up preventive
measures; enhanced routine surveillance in wild
birds; increased biosecurity and risk prevention
measures such as preventing gatherings of birds
at markets, shows and cultural events;
prohibition of hunting with decoy birds; keeping
poultry indoors if necessary; and preventive
vaccination which was subject to stringent
controls with the DIVA (Differentiating between
Infected and Vaccinated Animals) strategy to
distinguish between vaccinated birds and those
with avian influenza. In case of a suspected or
confirmed case in wild birds being found, a 3-km
protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone
were declared together with provisions for
surveillance and requirements for the containment
of poultry indoors and enhanced biosecurity and
movement restrictions in both zones.
In addition, 2 risk areas around protection and
surveillance zones were defined. The risk areas
served as a buffer zone between the outbreaks and
the non-affected parts of the member states. The
latest confirmed outbreak was in Bacs-Kiskun,
Hungary, in domestic geese on 9 Jun 2006.
Poultry within the vicinity including 2300 geese
at the farm concerned had already been culled and
the farm was disinfected. Between February and 21
May 2006, a total of 741 wild birds tested
positive for H5N1, but the disease did not spread
much to domestic poultry. H5N1 was reported in
domestic birds in 5 countries (one per country
only) and all 5 countries reported H5N1 in wild
birds prior to the detection in domestic birds.

Other Europe and Caucasus (as of 14 Apr 2006)
-------------------------
Of 13 countries which reported H5N1 in their
territories, [5, namely] Bosnia and Herzegovina
(2 Feb 2006), Bulgaria (12 Feb 2006), Croatia (24
Mar 2006), Georgia (23 Feb 2006) and Switzerland
(30 Mar 2006) reported cases only in wild birds.
[The data from the other 8 countries are as follows:]
1. Albania (as of 9 Mar 2006):
----------
HPAI H5N1 occurred on 16 Feb 2006 in chickens in
Cuke, Sarande County,Vlore State and in backyard
poultry (chickens, turkeys) in Aliko, Sarande
County, Vlore State. Samples tested positive for
H5 by the Veterinary Research Institute in Tirana
on 23 Feb 2006 and were confirmed at
VLA-Weybridge, UK on 7 Mar 2006. Reported
mortality in Cuke was 100 percent. The Veterinary
Research Institute has been monitoring samples
around intensive poultry (chicken) establishments.
The control measures taken included: stamping out
and disinfection; a 3-km radius quarantine zone
and a 10-km radius surveillance zone around the
outbreaks; control of wildlife reservoirs [What
is the actual meaning of this term? - Mod.AS].
Compensation was given to villagers at 700 leks
[USD 7.63] for a grown chicken and 400 leks [USD 4.36] for a chick.
Another outbreak was found in Ndroq, Peze-Helmes
Village, Tirane on 9 Mar 2006. In total, 2538 poultry have died or been culled.
2. Azerbaijan (as of 11 Apr 2006]:
--------------
In February, numerous swans and crows were found
dead in Khachmas and Devechi Rayons; dead wild
and domestic birds have also been found in
Masalli, Bardeh, Ganjeh, Douche and around Baku,
according to the media. On 10 Feb 2006, a wild
swan from Absheron Peninsula, Caspian Sea coast,
tested positive for H5N1. On 27 Feb 2006, HPAI
H5N1 outbreaks in poultry were reported in
Ghiljazi, Khyzy Rayon and Samedabad, Biljasuvar
Rayon. A total of 296 000 poultry were culled. A
duck in Banovshalar, Agdam Rayon was found dead
and H5 was confirmed on 20 Mar 2006. The control
measures taken include: stamping out;
disinfection; quarantine; movement control. WHO
confirmed 8 human cases, of which 5 were fatal
(62.5 percent). The locations of human cases
were: Salyan Rayon -- Sarvan and Daikyand
settlements (between 23 Feb and 11 Mar 2006), and Tarter Rayon (9 Mar 2006).
In February, when a massive die-off of swans had
occurred in Salyan Rayon, the human cases were
suspected of being involved in de-feathering dead
wild swans. Poultry deaths have also been
observed in the settlements in end-February/early
March. [The distribution of suspected/confirmed
avian cases and confirmed human cases are
indicated on the map, accessible at the above URL].
FAO has sent a disease control expert to assist
Azerbaijan in disease management.
