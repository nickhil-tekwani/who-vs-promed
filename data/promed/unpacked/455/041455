A 30 year old woman, mother of 3 children, died after contracting [a]
hantavirus [infection] in the Higuera locality, Licanten community, in
Maule [province] of Chile. According to statements by regional health
authorities, the infection occurred in a family affected by the earthquake
when they entered a building storing honey, an area that lacked
ventilation. Ministry of Health [personnel] have taken blood samples from
the 5 family members, who are under observation with priority medical
attention. This is the 3rd hantavirus infection registered in Maule this
year [2010], a region that in 2009 had 5 cases of [hantavirus] infected
individuals.

The death of the woman happened after Emol reported that during this year
[2010], as a result of the earthquake, the number of [hantavirus
infections] has doubled nationally, reaching 30 [cases] in the 1st 14 weeks
of 2010, while last year [2009], during the same period, just 17 people
presented with the infection. The Ministry of Health (MINSAL) indicated
that most confirmed cases [this year (2010)] have been registered during
the months of February and March, and are related to patients who live in
areas affected by the earthquake.

The health authorities [predict] that the number of infections will
continue to increase during the month of April [2010]. "We expect more
cases to be reported in April; So far we have had 2 confirmed [cases] in
April... the usual average is at least 4. If we compare this with the 5
previous years, we therefore expect a greater number of cases," explained
Viviana Sotomayor, [health] professional from the Surveillance Unit of the
MINSAL Epidemiology Department.

[The Maule region was seriously affected by the 27 Feb 2010 magnitude 8.8
earthquake. This is the 2nd ProMED-mail report of a hantavirus infection
acquired in the earthquake area (see ProMED archive no. 20100402.1050). The
hantavirus involved in this case is most likely Andes virus.
