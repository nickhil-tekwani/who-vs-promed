Pet owners who feed their animals mice are being warned by the UK Government of a link between the food source and _Salmonella_ in humans.

Scientists have again confirmed a link between the food poisoning bacterium _Salmonella_ detected in feeder mice distributed by Monkfield Nutrition Ltd across all 4 UK nations, and an outbreak of human cases of salmonellosis. The risk to the general public is considered to be very low, but the government is urging reptile owners who purchase certain feeder rodents for their pets to take extra precautions to avoid becoming ill.

The feeder rodents affected, which were imported from Lithuania and are sold in a number of retailers, are typically fed to reptiles -- particularly snakes. Retailers must now by law provide customers buying the feeder rodents from Monkfield Nutrition Ltd with an information leaflet about the risks of _Salmonella_ infection and advice on always washing their hands as a good hygiene practise for handling animal food in the home.

The FSA, which leads on the safety and regulation of animal feed, is working closely with public health and animal health agencies, as well as a range of other partners both inside and outside government. The agency is also liaising with local authorities and with Monkfield Nutrition Ltd, who have contacted all of its customers to inform them of the additional requirements in the short term. The outbreak was first investigated in 2015 and has so far resulted in almost 850 reported human cases, mostly, but not exclusively, living in households with one or more pet reptiles.

Tina Potter, Head of Incidents at the FSA, said: "We are advising pet handlers that they should follow good hygiene when handling feeder rodents and pet reptiles to avoid the risk of becoming ill with _Salmonella_. Retailers must provide a leaflet explaining the risks associated with handling and feeding this type of material to reptiles and the importance of good hygiene with each sale of feeder rodents. This is aimed at ensuring pet handlers clearly understand the potential risks and have access to information to reduce the risks. We will continue to monitor this situation carefully, and act proportionately to ensure both public and animal health."

Dr. Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Pathogens Unit at Public Health England, said: "Epidemiological investigations and whole genome sequencing have again confirmed the link between a _Salmonella_ outbreak in people who have become unwell and feeder rodents used to feed reptiles and some other animals distributed in the UK by this specific importer.

"Just as for handling raw human food, there is an inherent risk of _Salmonella_ when handling raw or frozen and defrosted pet food such as mice, rats or chicks, as freezing does not kill _Salmonella_. In addition, most reptiles carry _Salmonella_ in their intestines for months or even years after exposure to contaminated food, and this can spread to their owners and other household members. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after handling the frozen food and feeding your reptile, after handling your reptile, cleaning their vivarium or any other equipment such as soaking pools. Children should be supervised to ensure they wash their hands properly."

[The _Salmonella_ serotype or serotypes here is not stated, and it is unclear what the temporal distribution of the cases is.

ProMED has previously reported cases of _S._ Typhimurium in the USA and Canada linked to feeder rodents. Previously, an outbreak of human _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- infections associated with exposure to rodents sold as food for pet reptiles and amphibians (that is, feeder rodents) was reported in MMWR from the USA in 2012 (see ProMED archive no. 20120419.1107037). This outbreak strain also was implicated in a 2009 outbreak in the UK and a 2010 outbreak in the USA, both linked to frozen feeder rodents from a single USA supplier, resulting in recalls.

_Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- is quite similar to _S._ Typhimurium; indeed, it has the same somatic (O) antigens of Typhimurium. - Mod.LL
