Diseases caused by begomoviruses are a major
threat to vegetable production for countries in
the Caribbean and Central America. In 1996, an
isolate of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV)
was reported to be affecting tomato plants
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) throughout Cuba
(Martinez et al., 1996). In 2002, the same virus
was detected in pepper (_Capsicum annuum_) in
Camaguey, Sancti Spiritus and Havana provinces
and in bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) plants in
Havana province (Martinez et al., 2002; Quinones et al., 2002).
During a survey in 2005, in the pepper production
areas of eastern Cuban, about 70 percent of
pepper plants growing at an Experimental Station
in Holguin province, showed symptoms that
differed from those previously described for
TYLCV in pepper. Symptoms consisted of plant
stunting and a severe leaf yellow mosaic with
crinkling and curling. Ten representative
symptomatic plants were collected and leaf
samples analyzed by transmission electron
microscopy. Total nucleic acid was extracted and
assayed by non-radioactive nucleic acid
hybridisation, using a TYLCV intergenic region
probe under low stringency conditions (Quinones
et al., 2002) and by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). All leaf samples showed the presence of
typical geminivirus particles, whereas none
exhibited hybridisation signals. Using PCR with
degenerate primers that specifically amplify the
coat protein region from begomoviruses (Wyatt &
Brown, 1996), all samples produced amplicons of
the expected size (576 bp). PCR amplicons from 3
samples were cloned in pGEM T-Easy vectors (Promega).
The clones were sequenced and BLAST analysis
showed the highest identity (98 percent) within
clones; between 93 percent and 94 percent
identity with Cabbage leaf curl virus (U65529 and
AF065815, respectively) and between 87 percent
and 90 percent identity with Pepper yellow vein
virus (AF 063139), Pepper golden mosaic virus
(AY368336) and Texas pepper mosaic virus
(AF077025). However there was only 68 percent
identity with TYLCV (AJ223505). One of the
sequences was deposited in GenBank (DQ207808) as
representative of the 3 clones. This report shows
the occurrence of a new begomovirus in pepper plants in Cuba.

[The crop plant pepper, _Capsicum annuum_,
develops yellow mosaic and leaf crumpling
symptoms when infected by a begomovirus newly
detected in Cuba. The samples were collected in
2005 from a single site at an Experimental
Station in Holguin province. The begomovirus
tomato yellow leaf curl virus is common in Cuba
in tomato and pepper, but this new virus is not
likely to be a strain of TYLC. When the sequence
of the cDNA corresponding to the coat protein was
compared to other begomoviruses the closest
affinity was with cabbage leaf curl virus (CLCV).
It remains to be seen if other regions of the
genome share this close similarity with
CLCV. CLCV causes disease in cabbage in Jamaica
(see 2006 posting 20060310.0768) but there is no
commentary in this article on how common CLCV is in Cuba on cabbage.
This is yet another report pointing out the
diversity of begomoviruses and the frequent
discovery of new viruses of the group. They are
ssDNA viruses (family: _Geminiviridae_, genus:
_Begomovirus_) which are transmitted by
whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_). They have a great
capacity to form hybrids and therefore new
viruses. Once introduced into an area they are
difficult to control. There are approximately
100 previous postings on begomoviruses in
ProMED-mail archives (search term:
begomovirus). The posting included in �see
also:� are for begomoviruses of pepper,
begomoviruses in Cuba and for cabbage leaf curl virus.
