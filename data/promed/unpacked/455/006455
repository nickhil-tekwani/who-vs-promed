The state Secretary of Health confirmed this [Tue 7 Nov 2017], the 2nd case of yellow fever in humans in Itatiba [Sao Paulo, SP].

The patient, 68 years old, remained hospitalized in the Unicamp hospital in Campinas, without forecasted release. On [17 Oct 2017], the municipal government said that a 76-year-old died of yellow fever in the city.

According to a note issued by the Itatiba municipal government at the time, the individual lived on the border with Jundiai (SP), a municipality where 67 monkeys that died were diagnosed with the disease.

Also, according to the municipal administration, a statement from the Adolfo Lutz Institute confirmed that the resident had the [yellow] fever virus.

Nearly 90 monkeys have now died of yellow fever in the Jundiai region, according to the information issued by the municipalities on [Mon 6 Nov 2017]. After the 1st records of primate deaths were issued more than 2 months ago, the municipalities intensified vaccination against the disease.

Jundiai registered 9 more cases, and in Campo Limpo Paulista, the number went from 1 to 5 primate deaths.

To try to combat the disease, the Epidemiological Surveillance [unit] continues to make vaccination efforts.

[The 2 confirmed cases in Itatiba were residents in a rural area in properties with forests present, one of which had deaths of a non-human primate confirmed as due to yellow fever in that property. A detail: although action to vaccinate people in Itatiba has been conducted since April 2017, neither of these fatal cases was vaccinated against yellow fever.

Yes, broadening vaccine coverage is important. Adoption of vaccination against yellow fever as a routine for all the population of the country is a trend. However, in the short term, more important than vaccinating thousands and thousands of people is to vaccinate, as a priority, opportunely (in some areas as a matter of urgency), "certain" people (susceptible and potentially exposed), and in "certain" places (areas of greatest risk of transmission).

The occurrence of the 2 yellow fever cases in Itatiba must be perceived as a sentinel event (and example for other municipalities) rather than as a lost opportunity. - Mod.RNA

The monkeys that died of yellow fever in the area and the fact that these 2 human cases lived in a rural area, some of which is forested, implicates the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle as responsible for these human cases, rather than infection from _Aedes aegypti_ urban transmission. Vaccination of people in this general area is urgent.
