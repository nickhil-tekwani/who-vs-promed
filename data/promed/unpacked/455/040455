The Director of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health, Francisco Araoz,
announced that 13 new cases of cholera were detected in the State of Zulia,
1 in the state of Miranda, and 2 in the Federal District. This brings the
1997 national total to 1436 cases and 41 deaths.
Of the 13 cases reported in Zulia, Araoz indicated that 7 came from the
municipality of Valmore Rodriguez and 1 from Maracaibo. He noted that
those infected in Caracas are connected to food handlers and refuse
collectors in the central Coche market, the workplace of three other
patients who are being treated on an outpatient basis.
The director added that a plan to control the disease in the area of Zulia
consists of treating those who are close to patients. Araoz also urged that
epidemiologists take more exhaustive data in tracking the epidemic, in
particular emphasizing the most affected areas such as Zulia.
