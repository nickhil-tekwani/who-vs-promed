There have been reports of an increase in cases of acute watery
diarrhea, over and above the expected normal summer increase, in a
number of districts in south and west Tajikistan. There have
apparently been a number of deaths and numerous cases requiring
intravenous re-hydration, some arriving at the hospital with
impalpable blood pressure. There is no confirmation of actual patient
numbers, nor of cause, but some clinicians have described the
symptoms as being cholera-like.

illness cluster, which sounds like cholera. - Mod.LL]
