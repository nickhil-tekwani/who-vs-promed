From: Carol Shoshkes Reiss <Carol.Reiss@nyu.edu>

While I am not an expert in this area, I am aware of some of the data.
Both Janet Butel (Baylor College of Medicine) and Bob Garcea (U Colorado)
have found SV40-like viruses (BK, JC) in rare human (pediatric) choroid
plexus tumors. S Tevethia (Penn State) has studied SV40 T Ag transgenic
mice and found choroid plexus tumors, which are treatable by H-2
compatible, T Ag-specific CD8 CTLs.
Thus, I express caution about the comment made by Ronald Gold in [(02) in
this thread, that "there is no evidence that SV40 causes harm in humans."
Janet Butel kindly provided the following references on SV40 and its
closely related viruses, JC and BK, in association with brain tumors. In
addition to choroid plexus tumors, there is a strong association as well
with PML [progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy.

[Carol& Janet: Many thanks for this comprehensive comment. Can you tell us
if any of the human cases quoted were known NOT to have received an
SV-40-containing vaccine?
