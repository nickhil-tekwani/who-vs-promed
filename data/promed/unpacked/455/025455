[This is a belated, retrospective report of a single case of mild
encephalitis, caused by WNV in a horse in the UAE, dating back to
August 2007. The case was previously reported by ProMED-mail in
January 2008, citing the investigator saying that "seeing only one
clinical case means to us that we are dealing with a very mild
strain." Reportedly, 20 percent of tested horses were found
seropositive.

For detailed discussions and further background, subscribers are
referred to ProMED-mail postings 20080121.0257 and 20080124.0291.

The current reporting may reflect the commendable proactive attitude
of OIE's Animal Health Information Department in following the animal
disease situation in member countries and initiating their submission
of updated disease records.

In view of the approaching warmer, vector (mosquito) activity season
and the zoonotic nature of WNV, a call for the UAE public's alertness
deserves consideration. - Mod.AS]
