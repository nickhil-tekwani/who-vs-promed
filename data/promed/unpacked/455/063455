[Cambodia's last official report to the OIE (Follow-up report No. 3) on the
occurrence of HPAI was received on 22 Sep 2004. It included data on an
outbreak in a broiler farm in Kean Svay district, Kandal province, where
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was identified (see also ProMED-mail posting
20040922.2616). No official reports on later outbreaks are available.
However, an FAO report of 16 Feb 2005 included information on an outbreak
in a family chicken farm in Takmao district, Kandal province, about 12 km
south of Phnom Penh City. The H5N1 virus was confirmed by the Pasteur
Institute in Phnom Penh City (see posting 20050216.0519). - Mod.AS]
