A worryingly resilient strain of gonorrhea has infected 7 people in Hawaii, the CDC has confirmed. The 6 men and 1 woman were all ultimately treated by the CDC's recommended combination treatment of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. But the Hawaii State Department of Health said lab tests showed the infections were not destroyed as quickly or as easily as they have done in all previous cases.

Health officials fear this means the incredibly common sexually-transmitted disease could become untreatable sooner than we think. Gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis are normally treated with a short dose of antibiotics. But at this rate, it could be just years before this method becomes ineffective

Since 2005, we have seen 4 isolated cases that showed resistance to both ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This is the 1st cluster of cases we have seen with reduced susceptibility to both drugs. The report, released on Wed [21 Sep 2016] [http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2016/2016-std-prevention-conference-press-release.html], came just hours after the United Nations held the 1st ever top-level summit on antibiotic resistance.

Despite years of warnings that bacteria was building resistance to antibiotics, scientists warn we are doing nothing to delay or stop that process. This week, a CDC report revealed hospitals have not been limiting prescriptions - in fact the number of last-resort antibiotic prescriptions in the last few years increased. Another report by the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) revealed fast food outlets are continuing to use meat from antibiotic-fed animals. Drug-resistant bacteria currently claims 700 000 lives a year. Global public health officials warn that figure could climb to 10 million a year by 2050 if we do not limit our use of antibiotics.

A driving force behind this potential disaster is our flagrant use of antibiotics to treat minor infections and to grow animals. Putting just small doses of the drug into our bodies allow bacteria to adapt to the medication, building defenses against it. As a result, common infections like gonorrhea and _E.coli_ could soon be untreatable.

Earlier this month [Sep 2016], the WHO updated its guidelines on how to treat chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis for the 1st time since 2003. Together, the diseases infect 200 million people every year. They are normally treated with a short and simple dose of antibiotics. But at the rate the diseases are developing, it could be just a matter of years before this method becomes ineffective.

Crucially, the health officials warn, doctors must stop over-prescribing antibiotics, and patients must be vigilant about taking the correct doses."Resistance of these STIs [Sexually Transmissible Infections] to the effect of antibiotics has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced treatment options," the UN agency said. Antibiotic resistance also exists in chlamydia and syphilis, though it is less common.

The CDC recommends treating the infection with a combination of two antibiotics: azithromycin and ceftriaxone. The infection has already become immune [that is, resistant] to penicillin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolones. Increasingly, gonorrhea is building up a resistance to the individual drugs.

When left undiagnosed and untreated, the 3 diseases can have serious consequences, causing pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy in women, and increasing the chances of miscarriage, stillbirth and newborn death. Medical officer Teodora Wi, who was involved in WHO's update, called gonorrhea a 'very smart bug' that repeatedly adapts to new antibiotics. It can infect the genitals, rectum, and throat.
