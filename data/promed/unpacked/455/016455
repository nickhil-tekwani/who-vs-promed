Abstract
--------
Background
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is a human pathogen that is expanding its endemic zones in Europe, emerging in previously unaffected regions. In Austria, increasing incidence in alpine regions in the west has been countered by a decline in traditional endemic areas to the east of the country.

Aim
To shed light on the cause of this disparity, we compared the temporal changes of human TBE incidences in all federal provinces of Austria with those of Lyme borreliosis (LB), which has the same tick vector and rodent reservoir.

Methods
This comparative analysis was based on the surveillance of hospitalised TBE cases by the National Reference Center for TBE and on the analysis of hospitalised LB cases from hospital discharge records across all of Austria from 2005 to 2018.

Results
The incidences of the 2 diseases and their annual fluctuations were not geographically concordant. Neither the decline in TBE in the eastern lowlands nor the increase in western alpine regions is paralleled by similar changes in the incidence of LB.

Conclusion
The discrepancy between changes in incidence of TBE and LB supports the contributions of virus-specific factors beyond the mere availability of tick vectors and/or human outdoor activity, which are a prerequisite for the transmission of both diseases. A better understanding of parameters controlling human pathogenicity and the maintenance of TBE virus in its natural vector-host cycle will generate further insights into the focal nature of TBE and can potentially improve forecasts of TBE risk on smaller regional scales.

[It is clear that in this study the geographic location where tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease (LD) were acquired was assumed to be within the federal provinces where the patients reside. However, for both LD and TBE, it is important to obtain a thorough travel history from patients, as these diseases may be acquired in endemic areas other than where they reside, and knowing the proportion that travel-related LD and TBE accounts for the documented cases is important. Nevertheless, even though questionnaires were sent to the treating physicians in the hospitals that requested information on the possible geographical site of infection, we are not told to what extent this information matched the location of the patient's residence.

Also, the study involved only hospitalized patients with TBE and LD. Only a minority of patients with LD require hospitalization. In the US, about 2800 patients with LD were hospitalized, usually because of carditis, arthritis, or neurologic involvement, between 2005 and 2014 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7521202/). Thus, only about 1% of the about 30 000 cases of LD reported each year (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/index.html), are hospitalized in the US and perhaps in Austria. Thus, the observed findings in incidence rates of LD in Austria likely apply to only a very small fraction of all LD patients.

However, a much larger portion (20-30%) of patients with TBE develop central nervous system involvement, with symptoms of meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis, that likely require hospitalization. As pointed out by the investigators of this study, the falling incidence of TBE is unlikely to be caused by TBE virus strains circulating in eastern Austria that have acquired mutations that reduce transmission or pathogenicity for humans, and thus reduce the frequency of hospitalization. - Mod.ML

This report raises some critical questions: was the prevalence of TBE virus in vector ticks constant over the years, including in those localities where the incidence of human TBE cases declined? Was TBE virus vector the tick population in these areas decreasing, stable, or increasing? Was the proportion of the population vaccinated against TBE increasing in localities where hospitalized TBE patients were decreasing? Had TBE virus transmission efficiency of vector ticks changed over time in any of the localities? Is that efficiency altered for local TBE virus strains with increasing temperature? - Mod.TY
