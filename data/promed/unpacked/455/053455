Number of hepatitis C patients tripled from 2002 to 2010 in Korea
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Patients with the hepatitis C virus in Korea increased almost 3-fold
from 2002 to 2010. The number of the hepatitis C patients was over
5600 as of last year. The 2002 figure only stood at around 1900,
according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The health authority warns that the virus is easily transmitted
through daily activities [involving abrasion of the skin, facilitating
bloodborne transmission - Mod.CP]; for example, through sharing the
same tooth brush, nail clippers, or razors; and that the virus can
lead to chronic liver disease, including cancer.

Unlike hepatitis A and B viruses, no vaccine is available to protect
against hepatitis C virus, nor [are there] noticeable symptoms in the
1st phase of the disease, so regular blood tests are recommended.

[The above statement offers no explanation for this significant
increase in hepatitis C virus infection in South Korea during the past
8 years. It is unclear whether this increase reflects increased
exposure and transmission or progressive improvement in surveillance
of infection. Further information in this respect would be welcomed.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is most efficiently transmitted through large
or repeated percutaneous exposure to infected blood (for example,
through transfusion of blood from unscreened donors or through use of
injecting drugs). Although much less frequent, occupational,
perinatal, and sexual exposures also can result in transmission of
HCV. According to the US CDC
http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/HCVfaq.htm#section6), the role of
sexual activity in the transmission of HCV has been controversial.
Case-control studies have reported an association between acquiring
HCV infection and exposure to a sex contact with HCV infection or
exposure to multiple sex partners.

About 20 to ­30 per cent of those newly infected with HCV experience
fatigue, abdominal pain, poor appetite, or jaundice. In those who do
develop symptoms, the average time period from exposure to symptom
onset is 4­ to 12 weeks (range: 2 to ­24 weeks). Most people with
chronic HCV infection are asymptomatic. However, many have chronic
liver disease, which can range from mild to severe, including
cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Chronic liver disease in people with HCV infection is usually
insidious, progressing slowly without any signs or symptoms for
several decades. In fact, HCV infection is often not recognized until
asymptomatic people are identified as HCV-positive when screened for
blood donation or when elevated alanine aminotransferase levels are
detected during routine examinations. A small percentage of people
with chronic HCV infection develop medical conditions due to hepatitis
C that are not limited to the liver. These conditions are thought to
be attributable to the body's immune response to HCV infection. -
