The rabid dog that bit an 11-year-old girl on [19 Nov 2013] had bitten 4 more people in the same area [Pune, Maharashtra state] on that day. The girl succumbed to the infection at 9:30 pm on Wednesday, 4 Dec 2013, while the 4 others are recovering. As many as 100 dog bite cases have been reported from the area in the past few days.

"All the 5 people, including the deceased victim, were reported to my clinic between 9:30 pm and 11:30 pm on 19 Nov 2013. The 11-year old suffered an injury on her forehead and it was a deep wound. So, I advised her parents to rush her to Sassoon hospital," said physician Vilas M Dhere, who runs a clinic in Rammya Nagari in Bibvewadi [Pune]. Among the dog bite patients who reported to Dhere that day included a 30-year-old man who suffered an injury in his right armpit; a 22-year-old man whose got a deep wound on his right earlobe; a 50-year-old man who was bitten near the eyes and a 28-year-old man who got wounds on his head. "All 4 patients are recovering," Dhere said.

Dhere's clinic has been offering anti-rabies vaccines at subsidized rates through a project run by the Sevadham Trust and Grahak Panchayat since 2005. There are 4 more such clinics located in Yerawada, Perugate, Kunjirwadi and Narayangaon [areas in and around Pune] that do similar work. "As anti-rabies vaccines are provided for a very nominal charge, I get dog bite cases from Bibvewadi, Dhankawadi, Kondhwa, Katraj and even Peth areas. I have overseen such cases since January this year [2013]. The deceased girl was a grade III dog bite patient. However, I only possess the vaccine for grade I and II cases," Dhere said.

On why such a large number of cases are reported from the Bibvewadi-Dhankawadi-Katraj-Kondhwa belt, Dhere said, "Most housing colonies in these areas have issues regarding sanitation. Packs of dog are seen roaming freely near overflowing garbage bins." Local corporator Yogesh Tilekar said, "The Pune Municipal Corporation's squad that catches stray dogs take the round of the area during day between 11:00 am and 5:00 pm. But the canines create problems usually after 6:00 pm. I have requested the municipal commissioner to direct the squad to catch the strays in the evening."

Doctors working at the anti-rabies project at Perugate clinic also get a steady flow of cases every day. "Around 70 cases are usually reported to our clinic throughout the year," said family physician Manoj More. S T Pardeshi, PMC medical officer of health, said, "We have intensified the work of catching stray dogs from the outskirts where most dog bite cases are reported. We hope to check the menace soon."

Experts have highlighted the need for health education programmes for the medical community and the public. They said the importance of proper wound care and post-exposure vaccination must be reinforced to prevent rabies infection.

[It is likely that the victim in this incident succumbed to rabies virus infection as a consequence of the site of the bite, thereby enabling rabies virus to enter the central nervous system before inactivation of the virus by administration of anti-rabies vaccine.

Regarding the management of animal bite wounds, the National Centre for Disease Control of India recommends the following:
- Since the rabies virus enters the human body through a bite or scratch, it is imperative to remove as much saliva, and thereby the virus, from the wound as is possible by an efficient wound cleaning that should not involve additional trauma.
- Since the rabies virus can persist and even multiply at the site of the bite for a long time, wound cleaning must be performed even if the patient reports late.
- This can be done by prompt and gentle thorough washing with soap or detergent and flushing the wound with running water for 10 minutes.
- If soap and detergent are not immediately available, wash with running water for at least 10 minutes.
- Avoid direct touching of wounds with bare hands.
- The application of irritants (like chilies, oil, turmeric, lime, salt, etc.) is unnecessary and damaging. In case irritants have been applied on the wound, enough gentle washing with soap or detergent to remove the extraneous material, especially oil, should be done followed by flushing with a copious amount of water for 10 minutes immediately.
- Application of antiseptics: After thorough washing and drying of the wound, any one of the following available chemical agents should be applied: povidone-iodine (Betadine), alcohol, chloroxylenol (Dettol), chlorhexidine-gluconate and cetrimide solution (Savlon -- in appropriate recommended dilution), etc. - Mod.CP
