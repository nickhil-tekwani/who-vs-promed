China: enterovirus 71 case confirmed in Hong Kong
-----------------------------------------------
The [Hong Kong] Center for Health Protection has confirmed a case of
enterovirus 71 involving a 2-year-old girl. She developed oral ulcers
and a rash on 29 Aug 2004, and is now in stable condition. No
hospitalization was required. Her family members are asymptomatic. As
she had not traveled recently, the case has been classified as local,
bringing the total number of infections to 32, all local cases but
one.

At the Wong Tai Sin nursery the patient attended, 5 boys and 3 girls,
aged 2 to 4, showed symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease between
26 Aug and 8 Sep 2004. All are stable, and 5 have recovered. No
hospitalization was required. One home contact, a 6-year-old boy,
also developed symptoms and is in a stable condition.

To prevent the disease: wash your hands before eating and after going
to the toilet and/or changing diapers; cover your mouth and nose when
coughing and sneezing; maintain good ventilation; thoroughly clean
toys or appliances that are contaminated with nasal or oral
secretions; parents should seek medical advice if their children
develop symptoms; and, infected children should stay at home and
avoid contact with others.

[Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a frequent cause of hand, foot, and mouth
disease (HFMD) epidemics in children and may be associated with
severe neurological sequelae in a small proportion of cases. There
has been a significant increase in EV71 epidemic activity throughout
the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. Some recent HFMD epidemics in
this region have been associated with a severe form of brainstem
encephalitis associated with pulmonary edema and high case fatality
rates. This does not seem to be the situation in the small number of
locally acquired infections described above, but clearly any outbreak
of HFMD, however small, should be monitored closely. - Mod.CP]
