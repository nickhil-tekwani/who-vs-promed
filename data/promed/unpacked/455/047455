The Chesterfield County Health Department said it has confirmed 4 more cases of the _Legionella_ bacteria at sites in the northeastern part of the county. [These cases likely refer to environmental sites, not case patients, of which there are 10. - Mod.ML]

This comes as the county continues to investigate 10 cases of Legionnaires' disease in the area since 1 May [2019]. On average, the county normally sees 3 cases of the disease each year.

District Health Director Dr. Alexander Samuel told CBS 6 that the confirmation came last week. He said the bacteria were found in cooling towers at Johnston Willis Hospital in the 1400 block of Johnston Willis Dr., the Richmond Ice Zone in the 600 block of Johnston Willis Dr., the U.S. Defense Supply Center Richmond in the 8000 block of Jefferson Davis Highway, and Reynolds Metals in the 2000 block of Reymet Rd.

These discoveries come after the bacterium was found in a cooling tower at Greenfield Elementary School in the 10 700 block of Savoy Rd.

Investigators have been testing sites in the northeastern portion of the county since 10 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed in that area since 1 May [2019]. The most recent confirmed case was in mid-July [2019].

The _Legionella_ bacteria can cause Legionnaire's disease, which is a type of pneumonia. The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) said the disease is "more common and more severe" in people who are 50-years or older, current/former smokers, those with "underlying lung disease (such as emphysema), and people with weakened immune systems."

VDH added that the bacteria occur naturally in the environment and grow best in warm water, such as that found in air conditioning cooling towers. "The bacteria get into the air when a mist or spray of water is created. People breathe in the mist that has been contaminated with the bacteria, and then they might become sick. In general, the bacteria do not spread from person to person."

Dr. Samuel said that in all 5 cases [likely referring to 5 environmental sites], the bacterium was of the Lp1 strain [Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1]. He added that none of the sites have been definitively linked to the 10 cases in the county, but they have not been ruled out either. He said they are awaiting further lab testing to see whether there is a genetic match between the bacteria found at the sites and the bacteria found in the patients. However, he said even that may not provide a conclusive answer.

Dr. Samuel said the health department informed the 4 sites of the bacteria's discovery and told them how to treat the bacteria. He added that, to his knowledge, the 4 sites are following the county's advice.

A spokesperson for HCA Virginia, which runs Johnston Willis Hospital, sent the following statement to CBS 6 regarding the discovery:

"The safety of our patients, visitors, and staff is our top priority. We have worked closely with the health department and completed the recommended treatment plan on our cooling system. Infection control experts agree there is no evidence of transmission within the hospital and there has been no impact on patient care."

As for the 1st site where the bacteria were found, Greenfield Elementary School, the superintendent of Chesterfield County Public Schools (CCPS) sent a letter to Greenfield parents on Monday [5 Aug 2019] and stated that an outside firm has finished cleaning the cooling tower, and the school is expected to reopen this week.

When the bacterium was 1st discovered in late July [2019], CCPS moved summer school at Greenfield to nearby Weaver Elementary School. Summer school has since finished.

As for the 10 patients who contracted Legionnaires' disease, Dr. Samuel said that the majority of them have been treated and released, while those who remain in the hospital are on the road to recovery.

He added that the health department continues to investigate the cause of the cases but said that the investigation has not gone beyond the northeastern section of the county because there have been no new cases of the disease.

The Chesterfield Health District officials said that, out of an abundance of caution, anyone who becomes "ill with pneumonia-like or respiratory symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache, should promptly seek medical care."

[A recent ProMED-mail post reported that there have been 10 people diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in Chesterfield County, Virginia this summer (Legionellosis - USA (17): (VA) Archive Number: 20190727.6591431).

Chesterfield County, with a population of 316 236 residents in 2010, is located just south of Richmond, the capital city of the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, and is part of the Greater Richmond Region; its county seat is Chesterfield Court House (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield_County,_Virginia). Chesterfield County can be found on a map at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chesterfield+County,+VA.

We are told in the news report above that 5 cooling towers, including the Greenfield Elementary School's cooling tower, are positive for _L. pneumophila_ sg.1. These cooling towers are located in the northeastern portion of the county, which is the area being investigated for a potential source apparently because of the geographic distribution of the 10 affected individuals within the county. However, the news report says that they are awaiting genotyping of the environmental and clinical isolates; matching genotypes will establish which cooling tower is responsible for the respective cases. - Mod.ML
