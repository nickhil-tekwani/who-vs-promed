The 9th confirmed case of hantavirus [infection] was registered this
Friday [23 Sep 2011] in the Coyhaique Regional Hospital. The patient
is a 44-year-old woman who visited the La Junta area, the same site
where a month earlier her husband also was infected with the virus. In
both cases, their recoveries were positive so that both the woman and
her husband were released [from the hospital] without serious health
consequences.

Marco Acuna, epidemiologist of the Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial
Secretariat] who ratified the 9th case of this infection, said that
the woman was again at her home. "The woman was hospitalized on 12 Sep
[2011] with febrile symptoms, intense muscle pain and poor general
condition, and was hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the
Coyhaique hospital, where preliminary tests by the hospital clinical
laboratory recorded [a] hantavirus [infection]. On Friday [23 Sep
2011] the [positive] results were confirmed by the Public Health
Institute. The woman recovered favorably and was released on 18 Sep
[2011].

With this case, [the number of cases] of the infection increased to 11
in the Aysen region.

Marco Acuna, provided information about the areas with the greatest
concentration of mice and thus the greatest probability of contracting
the disease. "The information that we have had is that in the most
affected areas in the north from Viviana to Lago Verde, the current
situation is normal for this time of year, with a significant decline
in rodent populations. The important activity is in the barrier
between Rio Paloma, Lago Caro, Lago Atravesado, Lago Portales, Lago
Riesco, where the concentration of mice was most important 2 weeks ago
and to date there is a similar notable decline, but there is still an
abnormally [high] population of mice for this time of year."

Finally, Acuna reiterated the call to maintain good cleanliness in the
various areas occupied by people, to avoid contracting this virus
[infection] that may be fatal and has taken the lives of 3 people this
year [2011].

[Although not specified, the hantavirus most likely involved in this
case is Andes virus.

A 3rd positive case of a hantavirus [infection], little known in this
[Iquitos] area, has been diagnosed.

[An additional report from HealthMap Alerts (URL unspecified) received
on 24 Sep 2011 indicated that this 3rd case was a nurse with a febrile
disease without other (renal, pulmonary) complications, who has
recuperated satisfactorily. There is no indication if she was in
direct contact with the 2 previous cases or not, nor where or how she
might have been exposed to the virus. Direct person-to person
transmission has been shown to occur only with Andes hantavirus, and
requires extremely close physical contact. Andes virus is not likely
to occur in the Iquitos area.

The hantavirus involved in this case is not specified. A hantavirus
that causes HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) that is found in the
Amazon Basin is Araraquara and its rodent host is (_Necromys (Bolomys)
benefactus_).
