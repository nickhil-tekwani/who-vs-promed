In regard to whether pigeons and parrots can carry or transmit HPAI,
we need to be careful to distinguish between whether they can be
infected at all versus whether they show symptoms of infection. A
quick check of genbank yields:
AF509023 A/Pigeon/Hong Kong/SF215/01 H5N1
AY180427 A/Pigeon/Nanchang/11-045/2000 H3N6
AY180428 A/Pigeon/Nanchang/8-142/2000 H3N6
AY180429 A/Pigeon/Nanchang/9-058/2000 H3N3
AF156375 A/Pigeon/Hong Kong/Y233/97 H9N2
AF222607 A/Pigeon/Hong Kong/FY6/99 H9N2
AY180445 A/Pigeon/Nanchang/2-0461/2000 H9N2
AY180455 A/Pigeon/Nanchang/11-145/2000 H9N2
AY180458 A/Pigeon/Nanchang/7-058/2000 H9N2
AF202243 A/parrot/England/1174/94 H7N1
AF202252 A/parrot/Northern Ireland/VF-73-67/73 H7N1
Thus, if it is possible to isolate virus from pigeons (and parrots),
pigeons can potentially transmit flu A. Whether the birds exhibit
symptoms as a consequence of infection is a separate question.

Psittaciformes are most definitely susceptible to influenza.
Back in the 1970s when the USDA was monitoring shipments of imported
birds for the presence of Newcastle disease virus, they found a lot
of AI in psittaciformes and passeriformes. (Disease of Poultry 11th
ed. p 145).
I am aware of only one reported attempt to infect pigeons, and when
the attempt was unsuccessful, the author concluded that pigeons were
resistant. That is faulty reasoning for many reasons, most notably,
individual avian influenza isolates have differing abilities to
infect different hosts.
We have isolated H1N1 from a pigeon from a turkey farm. Unfortunately, it was
never reported in the scientific literature.

[According to the references below,] psittacines can carry and be
affected by avian influenza. [However,] this is rare, the disease is
mild, shedding is limited, and so far isolates from psittacines have
been non-pathogenic in poultry and mice. Pigeons resist infection
with avian influenza. Thus, there is no justification for the
culling of psittacines or pigeons in the face of an outbreak in which
the virus is virulent and shed in massive numbers by affected
poultry.

[This moderator checked with USDA prior to posting the comment.
Indeed, pigeons can acquire Newcastle disease, and the USDA reported
that apparently 6 percent of such birds did test positive for AI but
had no clinical disease. Furthermore, I could not find any evidence
of transmission to other birds. I believe the documentation and logic
supplied in the last response in this posting may be the appropriate
approach to this problem.
This moderator appreciates the assistance of our readers who may be
more closely in touch with the latest research. Thanks to all who
have written. - Mod.TG]
