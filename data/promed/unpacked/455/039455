Detection of huanglongbing (_Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus) in
the municipality of Tizimin, Yucatan, Mexico
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the actions applied by the "Prevention campaign against
the introduction of citrus quarantine pests" in the State of Yucatan,
a positive sample of the citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_) was
detected with huanglongbing in the municipality of Tizimin, State of
Yucatan.

SENASICA [Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad
Agroalimentaria/National Services of Animal and Plant Health, Quality
and Food Safety], through the Plant Health General Directorate in
collaboration with the Yucatan Plant Health State Committee, have
initiated the actions for the "Emergency protocol for the detection
of huanglongbing." The actions are the following: intensive search
for symptoms to detect contaminated plants; delimiting the outbreak
in order to begin actions to eliminate positive plants; and the
intensive and systematic control of the vector.

According to the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures
of the International Plant Protection Convention and the NAPPO
Regional Standards for Phytosanitary Measures, we are notifying the
detection of the bacteria which causes huanglongbing in a vector
specimen (_Diaphorina citri_) trapped in the Municipality of Tizimin,
Yucatan.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most
damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In
northern America, it is caused by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting
bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus. Its vector is the
Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often
spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission. The vector is
specific to _Citrus_ and close relatives, and thus the disease is
confined to these crops. Two other species of _Ca._ L. (africanus and
americanus) can cause HLB in different areas. For more information on
HLB, see links and previous posts listed below.

Asian citrus psyllids were reported from northern Mexico (Baja
California) in July 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20080701.2006). This is
likely to have increased national vigilance since the presence of the
vector poses a severely increased risk of introduction of the disease
to an area. The discovery of HLB carrying vectors has now been
reported from the opposite end of the country. While it cannot be
excluded that this may be due to the spread of the insects, it
appears more likely that the psyllids may already be widely
distributed in Mexico posing a severe risk of spreading HLB. Besides
the emergency measures listed above, the source of the infection
would also need to be clarified in order to devise HLB management
strategies.
