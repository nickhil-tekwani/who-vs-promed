EuroTravNet, the European Travel and Tropical Medicine Network of the
International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM), reports a case of
chikungunya [virus] infection seen by our MRS site in the Laveran Military
Hospital, Marseille, France. The patient was a French woman returning from
a 2-day stay in Singapore (2 Mar 2009 evening to 4 Mar 2009 evening). She
developed fever, polyarthritis, and rash on 6 Mar 2009. Molecular diagnosis
was confirmed by the Department of Virology, Institute of Tropical Medicine
for the French Army, Marseille, France. Exposures within Singapore were:
Botanic gardens, Rain forest, Sentosa island, Little India and Chinatown.
No excursion out of Singapore itself occurred, and she had no other
international travel in the previous month.

GeoSentinel, the Global surveillance program of the ISTM, notes that since
autochtonous transmission was 1st reported in Singapore in 2008, only one
other travel-related case of chikungunya attributed to Singapore has been
reported by our sites; this occurred in a US traveler in January 2009. The
SIN GeoSentinel site reports few recent chikungunya cases reported locally
and so has passed the exposure history of this case to the Ministry of
Health in order to pursue necessary public health measures.

Singapore is a major international gateway, so control of local cases is
important in order to prevent spread to the many countries, including in
temperate zones, where _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes are active during
warmer seasons.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Simon for this report, which indicates that
chikungunya virus is still being actively transmitted in Singapore. Also,
this is yet another timely illustration of rapid, long distance movement of
a pathogen from a tropical endemic area into a temperate area where
competent vectors may be present. Since _Aedes albopictus_ has been
documented in the French Riviera, there is a possibility that it could be
present in the Marseille area as well. Should that be the case, there would
be a possibility of ongoing local transmission there should the virus be
introduced by a traveler in the summer, when higher temperatures would
favor increased _Ae. albopictus_ populations and facilitate transmission,
as it did in Italy in 2007 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20071210.3980).
