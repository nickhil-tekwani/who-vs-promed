A source in the regional commission for animal development in the region of Hodh El Gharbi told Sahara Media that the commission recorded the emergence of cases of Rift Valley fever [RVF], among herds of camels in the village Bouderka [Bou Demgha?] in the district of El-Ayoun, the capital of the region.

The source said that "the delegation received a report stating that a number of camels had died in the village of Bouderka, and that it had sent a mission to the aforementioned village, to inspect the camel herds in which sudden deaths appeared."

He pointed out that "the mission, after it suspected that these herds were infected with RVF, decided to take samples and send them to the laboratory to confirm that they were infected with this disease, which is transmitted to humans."

The same source confirmed that "lab results confirmed that a number of herds of camels were infected with RVF," adding that the commission took a package of necessary measures to prevent the spread of the disease, including spraying ponds and swamps to combat mosquitoes that transmit the disease.

The source, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed that the Ministry of Health took samples from some residents and distributed some mosquito nets impregnated with insect repellents to residents residing in the area.

He added that the commission launched an awareness campaign to prevent disease, calling to stay away from eating the meat of sick animals and getting rid of the carcasses of these animals by burning.

[Mauritania was the 1st (late 1987) West African country reporting Rift Valley fever (RVF) causing haemorrhagic fever in humans in its southern region of Trarza, bordering Senegal. Previously (since 1930) the disease was known to circulate mainly in East and Southern Africa. The diagnosis was made by the collaborating centre for arbovirus research in Dakar, Senegal, where the RVF virus was identified later (January 1988) in Senegalese patients (202 cases, 39 fatal). The origin of infection in humans was reported to be arthropod borne, direct contact with animals, and animal products. The main clinical sign in animals was abortion. Serological investigations revealed high titers of IgG and IgM antibody in high proportion of examined cattle, sheep, and goat, probably also in camels.

During September-October 2010, a serious outbreak of RVF was reported in the northern Sahelian region of Mauritania after exceptionally heavy rainfall. A total of 63 cases among humans, including 13 deaths, were officially reported. In a published report, the authors said that the true number of human cases was probably much higher and that camels probably played a central role in the local amplification of the virus. They described the clinical signs in camels: the 1st cases were similar to those of pasteurellosis. The herdsman slaughtered the animal before it died but delayed the cutting up of the meat because of the remote location. Subsequently, the uncooked meat was shared within the extended family, and within a few days, several people died with intestinal and hemorrhagic symptoms, diagnosed by the laboratory as RVF. Two weeks after the index case, additional cases in camels, abortion storms in small ruminants, and human deaths (hemorrhagic fever, icterus, and nervous symptoms) were reported on a massive scale (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310676/, see citation below).

During a 2020 RVF event in Mauritania (ProMED post 20200926.7813988), 4 outbreaks were reported in camel herds, causing a total of 68 clinical cases among 378 susceptible animals, killing 26 of the cases. One of these outbreaks was in Tamchekket, which is also located in the region of Hodh El Gharbi.

Mauritania's southern region of Hodh El Gharbi borders Mali on its south. Further details on the current event are requested, including camel tissues sampled, tests applied, clinical signs observed, and -- if sampled -- test results of human sera. - Mod.AS]

[Apparently there are no human cases in this outbreak. In addition to avoidance of consumption of meat from affected or recently dead camels, butchering of ill or dead animals presents a risk of infection and should be avoided, as should consumption of raw milk from ill animals. If the breeding areas of vector mosquitoes are extensive, as can happen after rain events, control of the mosquitoes may be very difficult. - Mod.TY
