[A correction to this post has been posted as Tick-borne encephalitis - USA (02): (NY) Powassan virus, alert, corr. Archive Number: 20130802.1860398. The patient did not die and the statement "If someone has been bitten by a deer tick, there is a one in 20 chance that [the individual] has the fatal illness" is a misquote and incorrect. ProMED-mail regrets the errors contained in the original news report and any resulting alarm. - Mod.DK]

The New York State Department of Health says there was one confirmed case of the deer tick virus, also known as Powassan virus, in May of this year [2013] in Saratoga County. Dr. Laura Kramer with the Wadsworth Center tells NEWS10 that one person has died from this virus. She says the person died within 8 months of severe symptoms.

Symptoms people face after contracting Powassan virus include drowsiness, lethargy, headache and fever. Dr. Kramer says the virus ultimately leads to death in about 10 to 30 percent of the cases. She says the virus is transmitted at a rapid rate, about 15 minutes, as compared to Lyme disease, which is transmitted in about 2 days.

Researchers at the Wadsworth Center found that the number of ticks with this deadly virus is increasing, and if someone has been bitten by a deer tick, there is a one in 20 chance that [the individual] has the fatal illness. They [deer ticks] have been found in Saratoga, Albany, Rensselaer and Columbia Counties. The Albany County Health Department says there was one confirmed case in the county in 2004.

[For a detailed account of Powassan virus and its deer tick vector, readers are referred to a previous ProMED-mail post: "Tick-borne encephalitis - USA: (NY) Powassan virus 20130717.1830332."

Powassan virus (POWV; family _Flaviviridae_, genus _Flavivirus_) is a member of the mammalian tick-borne encephalitis virus group. POWV was 1st isolated and identified from brain tissue of a fatal case of encephalitis in 1958 in Powassan, Ontario, Canada. POWV is composed of 2 lineages, lineage I (prototype POWV) and lineage II (deer tick virus; DTV), with distinct transmission cycles. With the exception of a few human isolates, the majority of lineage I strains isolated in North America have been primarily from _I. cookei_ ticks and their hosts, woodchucks, mustelids, and wild canids. Lineage II strains have been isolated predominantly from _I. scapularis_ ticks and/or white-footed mice. A virus isolated in 1952 from _Dermacentor andersoni_ ticks collected in Colorado, and a virus isolated from the brain of a fox in West Virginia in 1977, have been subsequently characterized as lineage II strains. DTV is considered a genotype of POWV due to antigenic and genetic similarity. Evidence of POWV transmission has been detected throughout the United States, Canada and the Primorsky krai region of Russia. Serologic evidence suggests transmission in Mexico as well.

Evidence of widespread and continuous (2007-2012) DTV transmission was noted in several counties of the Hudson Valley, NY, concomitant with an apparent increase in the number of diagnosed human POW encephalitis cases since 2004 in the same region. Small to medium sized mammals, such as opossums, woodchucks, and raccoons, may be important hosts for amplification of virus or at least tangentially involved in vector maintenance. Specific neutralizing antibodies to POWV were detected in passerines for the 1st time in the US, supporting earlier findings in British Columbia, Canada indicative of exposure to infected ticks and thus serving as a potential vehicle for dispersal. - Mod.CP
