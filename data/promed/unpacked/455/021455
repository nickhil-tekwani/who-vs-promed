The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported in November, 1998 that
Panama disease was present in two adjoining blocks of 'Lady Finger' bananas
in a plantation near Coffs Harbour, NSW. Some of the original planting
material was obtained from the owner's property and some from another
source which will be periodically examined for any suspicious symptoms.
There has only been one previous outbreak in the Coffs Harbour district and
that was also in the same variety. Race 4 of the pathogen (_Fusarium
oxysporum_ f.sp. cubense) has not been detected in the district, but it
does occur approximately 300km to the north around the NSW/Queensland
border. It has a very wide distribution in the southern Queensland banana
industry and hence very tight quarantine restrictions for the movement of
planting material have been imposed. All suspected material is sent to the
Pathology Section of Queensland Department of Primary Industries at
Indooropilly for positive identification.

Australian Banana Growers' Council confirms that it is also present in
southeastern Queensland, and northern NSW. - Mod.DH
