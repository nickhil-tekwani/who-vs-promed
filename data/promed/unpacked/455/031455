The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday [20 Sep 2021] sent a Health Alert Network notice to health providers warning that cases of measles and mumps have been detected in people recently evacuated from Afghanistan.

So far, 16 cases of measles and 4 cases of mumps have been reported among Afghan refugees and US citizens who were recently airlifted from Afghanistan. The CDC said continued vigilance is needed, and evacuees who are in the United States are required to receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and complete a 21-day quarantine after vaccination at designated locations. Evacuation flights into the United States from other countries have been halted to allow for MMR vaccination and quarantine.

The CDC said it expects more measles spread among evacuees, given the low MMR vaccine coverage in Afghanistan and the close living quarters inherent in the evacuation process. It urged public health departments to continue to look for people with communicable diseases, isolate those with symptoms, and identify and monitor contacts.

The notice also urged health officials to monitor for other diseases. Besides measles and mumps, other infections have been found in evacuees, including chickenpox, tuberculosis, malaria, leishmaniasis, hepatitis A, and COVID-19.

Summary
-------
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinicians be on alert for cases of measles that meet the case definition, as well as other infectious diseases, including mumps, leishmaniasis, and malaria, among evacuees (including both Afghan nationals and US citizens) from Afghanistan. Clinicians should immediately notify their local or state health department of any suspected cases of measles. Clinicians should also recommend the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine for unvaccinated patients. Measles is an extremely contagious infectious disease; around 9 out of 10 people who are close contacts and who are not protected will become infected following exposure to measles virus. As of [20 Sep 2021], CDC has been notified of 16 confirmed cases of measles and 4 cases of mumps among Afghan nationals and US citizens, recently arriving from Afghanistan and continued vigilance is needed. In addition to MMR vaccination, CDC recommends that evacuees are also up to date on vaccinations for varicella, polio, COVID-19, and seasonal influenza."

Vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) present a challenge among displaced persons. Common VPDs encountered in humanitarian emergencies include measles, polio, and depending on geographical location, meningococcal meningitis, yellow fever, hepatitis A, and cholera, and now COVID-19. Vaccination is one of the most basic and critical health interventions for protecting vulnerable populations during emergencies. - Mod.LK
