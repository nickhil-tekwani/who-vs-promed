[This report presents an interesting case. Back in 1959 there was a widespread anthrax epidemic in the US midwest in commercial piggeries due to a contaminated feed. About 9 months later, when the survivors went for slaughter, a number of pigs were found to have enlarged and inflamed abdominal lymph nodes. Culture revealed _B. anthracis_, and these were otherwise healthy hogs. It would seem that we have a similar situation of a latent porcine infection in Ukraine. Pigs have a measure of resistance to anthrax infections, but in theory a similar situation could apply with cattle. Either way it allows this pathogen's ability to reach out across a number of seasons while awaiting a drop in innate resistance in its host, at which point it can become a clinical infection and demonstrate an efficient projected infection risk to other animals. - Mod.MHJ]
