The Ivorian Ministry of Health has confirmed 19 people have been
infected with yellow fever since May [2008], while the World Health
Organisation (WHO) warns Cote d'Ivoire is at an "elevated" risk of
yellow fever epidemics.

"Since the beginning of May [2008], Abidjan has been threatened with
a yellow fever epidemic," confirmed Felix Bledi Touin, a senior
health official. "3 cases have been found in the [Abidjan suburbs]
Treichville and Cocody. At this stage, 19 cases have been confirmed
and 1500 people have been vaccinated," he said.

Yellow fever [virus] is spread by mosquitoes. Epidemics touch on
average 20 percent of people in affected areas, half of whom may die,
according to the WHO. There is no cure for people already diagnosed
with the fever, but a vaccination can prevent infection.

WHO vaccinated 26 000 people against yellow fever in February 2006 in
Bouna, in the east of the country. A vaccination campaign was also
conducted in the capital, Abidjan, in 2001.

The Ivorian government and WHO have announced another vaccination
campaign for this year [2008] targeting almost 2 million people in
Abidjan.

"Despite a large vaccination campaign conducted in 2001, the rate of
coverage is still only around 60 percent," the WHO said in a
statement.

The early symptoms of yellow fever are similar to malaria, making it
hard to recognise, experts say. After experiencing fevers, sore
muscles, and nausea, an infected person may relapse into jaundice,
bleeding from the eyes, nose and mouth. Resulting kidney failure can
lead to death.

Yellow fever is on the rise again in Africa, although an effective
vaccine has been available for 60 years.

[As pointed out in the comment in ProMED archive no. 20080809.2449,
"Abidjan, which has a population of 3.5 million, a YF vaccine coverage
of less than 60 percent, and vector mosquito densities above the
danger threshold, has been extraordinarily lucky not to have suffered
a roaring urban YF epidemic. Before ProMED-mail began reporting in
1994, Nigeria had huge YF epidemics with thousands of cases in the
under-vaccinated populations of major cities. Why this outbreak has
not happened in Abidjan sooner is an epidemiological puzzle."

Why there have only been 19 cases recognized in the last 3 months is an even
greater puzzle. Pierre contributes the following. - Mod.JW]


Tara K. Harper's TKH Virology Notes on Yellow Fever states that
"There are no reported cases of yellow fever in Asia. It is suspected
that the high incidence of dengue fever helps confer protection
against yellow fever." The problem is I can't find any information on
prevalence of dengue in the Ivory Coast, even if the maps showing
dengue hotspots shows the IC [Cote d'Ivoire] as red (epidemic)." D.
J. Gubler of CDC writes "...by the time an immunization program is
mounted, the epidemic has usually peaked and is beginning to wane. A
classic example of this scenario was the YF outbreak in Abidjan, CÃ´te
d'Ivoire in 2001; the last confirmed case of YF occurred a month prior
to the emergency vaccination program being implemented" [D.J. Gubler,
Comp. Immun. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 27 (2004) 319-330].

That last time (2001), 2 million doses of vaccine were used in a city
[Abidjan] with 2.1-2.5 million people. So why is the vaccination
coverage estimated at only 60% (was the recent political turmoil
responsible for a high turnover in the population?).

Yellow fever virus transmission continues in Abidjan, with the ongoing
risks mentioned in [2] above. ProMED-mail will be very interested to
receive new information about this potentially dangerous outbreak and
progress of the vaccination campaign. - Mod.TY

In answer to Pierre above, in its 14 years of existence the 1st & only
report of dengue in Abidjan that ProMED has seen came in only last
week, and that was a single case in an expatriate resident -- see ref.
below. The reason for the low vaccination coverage may be that the
city's population has exploded from 2.5 to 3.5 million in the last 7
years, filling it with unimmunized people from outside, while a whole
cohort of children under 7 years old have been born. Although YF
vaccination is included in the childhood vaccination program of the
country, coverage in December 2007 was only in the 50-79 percent band
