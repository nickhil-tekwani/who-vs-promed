From: Dr. Chesang <moh@net2000ke.com>

I am a District Medical Officer in Kenya, Nakuru, one of the districts
affected by cholera within one of its divisions, Molo. The outbreak
started on October 10, 1997, and was well contained by October 22, 1997
(day of last admission). We had 12 deaths, 4.6% of the admitted cases.
Specific bacteriologic diagnosis revealed the offending organism to be
Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, biotype El Tor, Ogawa serotype. The one
isolated in Nyanza Province of Western Kenya was Inaba serotype. I have no
information concerning the cholera outbreak in the Coast Province [reported
to be Ogawa serotype, see Cholera - Kenya (06) - Mod.ES. It is however
important to note that there is al lot of movement within the East and
Central Africa region. Therefor, as long as the conditions are right
anywhere ( unsafe water and poor sanitary conditions), cholera is likely
strike.
