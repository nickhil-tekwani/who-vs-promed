The Nuble Health SEREMI [SecretarÃ­a Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat], confirmed the 3rd case of infection with a hantavirus so far this year (2022) in the region.

According to the Public Health Institute (ISP) the case is a 38 year-old-man with symptoms of fever, headache, and muscle pain since [25 Apr 2022], who was admitted to the Herminda MartÃ­n Hospital in ChillÃ¡n on [1 May 2022].

His medical evolution was not favorable and the following day he was moved to the Hospital del TÃrax [Chest Hospital] in the metropolitan region [Santiago], where he is in serious condition connected to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system.

"Our institution carried out an epidemiological environmental investigation and identified some risky activities carried out by the patient in rural sectors of the San Ignacio commune related to agricultural work during which he might have acquired the infection through contact with the long-tailed mouse," indicated the Health SEREMI, Ximena Salinas.

The professional pointed out that the most common form of transmission is via inhalation of aerosols containing urine of infected rodents; people who live in rural areas, in places with little human activity, are at the highest risk, as well as people whose recreational activities take them to these places.

This year [2022], another 2 cases have been reported in Ã'uble. In January, a 51-year-old man died, and in March 2022, a 37-year-old woman. Last year [2021], 3 cases were registered, one of which died.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infection in Ã'uble this year (2022) has increased from 2 to 3. Although not specified in this or previous reports from this and other regions, the hantavirus involved in these 3 cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including in the Ã'uble region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the regions.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly from person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
