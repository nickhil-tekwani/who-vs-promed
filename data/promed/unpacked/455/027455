Jakarta closes zoo
-----------------
Authorities closed the Jakarta zoo after 19 birds there were found to
be carrying the deadly [avian influenza] virus, officials said.
Agriculture Minister Anton Apriantono said that Jakarta's Ragunan zoo
will be closed to the public through October 17, during which a
complete sterilization of the area and treatment of infected animals
will be completed.
Apriantono told the ElShinta private radio that 19 out of 27 samples
taken from various birds at the zoo, including pigmy chickens and
eagles, contained the bird flu virus.
Four other samples were inconclusive and the remaining four were
negative, he said.
'Usually two weeks are enough but we decided to raise it to three
weeks to make sure unwanted things would not happen,' Apriyantono
said of the closure, adding that some 2,100 birds in the zoo's
collection will be tested for the virus.
Any bird found carrying the virus would be killed if it was not from
a protected species, the minister said.

[Captive animals have reportedly been affected by the H5N1 virus in 2
Thai zoos in 2004; one case involved tigers, allegedly infected by
means of being fed raw poultry meat. More information on the species
involved and the source of infection in the Jakarta zoo will help. -
