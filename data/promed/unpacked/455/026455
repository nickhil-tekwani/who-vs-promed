AFSCA, the Belgian food safety authority, announced today, 23 Jan 2012, that powdered milk imported from Belgium was believed responsible for infecting infants in the north of Russia with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Oranienburg. AFSCA reports that one production lot comprising 19 tons was implicated; 16 tons were shipped to Russia, and the remaining 3 tons, mixed together with other production lots, were supplied to several developing countries. None of the contaminated milk powder was sold in Belgium, or in any other European country. AFSCA has inspected the manufacturing facility and is confident that all necessary measures have been taken to prevent a reoccurrence of the contamination.

The powdered infant formula manufactured by a Belgian company is responsible for 16 cases of salmonellosis in [Usolye-Sibirskoye, Irkutsk, Russia], according to a report carried on ProMED-mail [ProMED-RUS, the Russian version, archive no 20120122.139001]. The illnesses occurred between 2 Nov 2011 and 13 Jan 2012. 13 of the outbreak victims were children aged 2 weeks to 7 months; one was a 4-year old child, and 2 victims were adults aged 24 and 29 years. All 16 confirmed victims were infected with _S._ Oranienburg.

The implicated milk was identified as ["Damil 1 Lux"] a dry milk formula. It was manufactured in Belgium by FASSKA S.A., and distributed in the Russian Federation by JSC "STI Damil" (Moscow). The implicated batch of dry milk formula carried a date of manufacture of 01.2011. The Russian distributor has recalled the dry milk formula, which was supplied to wholesale suppliers, large retail chains, pharmacies, and health care institutions.

Belgium has notified the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed ("RASFF" - Notification no. 2012.0094, issued 17 Jan 2012 and updated 20 Jan 2012) that dry milk infant formula linked to an outbreak of _S._ Oranienburg was supplied to Burundi, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Haiti, Mozambique, and the Russian Federation. No other reports of _S._ Oranienburg illnesses from countries other than Russia are available.
