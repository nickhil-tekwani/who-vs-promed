Three cats from 2 households in Savoy have tested positive for
tularemia, or "rabbit fever," an infectious disease that has been
relatively rare in Illinois.

The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District said the cats were
diagnosed in July and September [2011] at the University of Illinois
College of Veterinary Medicine.

The 3 cases could indicate an increased concern for the disease in the
area, health officials warned.

Tularemia is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially
rodents, rabbits, and hares, and cats may become infected by preying
on those animals or through tick exposure, according to the health
district.

Infected cats may have a high fever, mouth ulcers, depression,
enlarged lymph nodes, and behavioral changes that include not wanting
to eat. Cats that have been outdoors and are showing these symptoms
need veterinary care.

People can become infected by handling pets or wild animals with
tularemia, or by being bitten by ticks or inhaling the organism,
health officials said. Symptoms of the disease in people include
sudden fever, chills, diarrhea, joint pain, muscle aches, cough, and
weakness. If you have those symptoms, see your doctor for treatment.

Tips to avoid tularemia from the health district:
- Don't allow your cat to hunt outdoors.
- Make sure your cat is protected from tick bites.
- Report any large die-offs of rodents or rabbits to local animal
control officials.
- Wear tick protection outdoors.
- Don't handle or mow over sick or dead animals.
- Cook wild game meat thoroughly before eating it and use gloves when
handling it beforehand.

[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_ , is a non
sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related
to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is
killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks
or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can
be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their
biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in
North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may
be 5-7 percent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most
commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections
in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from
arthropod vectors.

In domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical
infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at
increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an
increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little
is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in
domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and
jackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North
America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and
Asia.

Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by
aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of
aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in
an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact
with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as,
cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular,
oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal
form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in
infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection
transstadially and transovarially, which makes them an efficient
reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include
_Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the
lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the dog tick), and
_Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly).

The most common source of infection for people and herbivores is the
bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat
improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats,
and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an
infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source
of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to
people.

The incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals, the
disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy,
anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with
septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased.
Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria may develop. Prostration and death
may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized
by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15
percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.

People may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending
on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin
ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen
and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria
are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever,
chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive
weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing,
which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum,
and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not
treated with appropriate antibiotics.

Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases
(especially plague) or acute pneumonia.

Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are
effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and
chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early
treatment should prevent death loss. Control is difficult and is
limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and
treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms
are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at
high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently
under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.
