[This OIE report would appear to refer to the outbreak previously reported that had 11 people hospitalised with suspect anthrax lesions, but confirmation had not been achieved. Clearly the veterinarians found the carcass and did what was necessary.

Jalal-Abad is in western Kyrgyzstan at the head of the Fergana valley; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_physio-2005.jpg.

The Fergana valley is rife with livestock anthrax, so these people could have gotten infected from one of their own animals that died and was butchered, or from meat they bought in the market. Without a coordinated vaccination-control program between the 2 countries in this region, we will continue to see outbreaks there. But without further details, 11 people hospitalized with suspected anthrax is indicative of some street-market meat as well as the farm's butchering team. Such a number is not atypical for exposure to just one dead cow. - Mod.MHJ
