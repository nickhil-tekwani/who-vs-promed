An ongoing outbreak of measles linked to anthroposophic communities
in The Hague, The Netherlands has been identified since mid-June
2008. 34 cases have been reported until 25 Jul 2008. In addition, 2
cases have been reported in other cities (Leiderdorp and Utrecht).
Both are epidemiologically linked to the cluster in The Hague.

Introduction
------------
Measles is a statutorily notifiable disease in The Netherlands. The
case definition for surveillance purposes includes patients with
clinical symptoms in combination with an epidemiological link and/or
laboratory confirmation. The most recent large measles outbreak in
The Netherlands took place in 1999-2000. Over 3200 cases were
reported, of whom 3 children died [1]. The outbreak was predominantly
situated in the so called "bible belt," where many people choose not
to immunise their children based on religious conviction.
[Anthroposophy is a formal, educational, therapeutic, and creative
system established by Rudolph Steiner (1861-1925) seeking to use
mainly natural means to optimise physical and mental health and
well-being. - Mod.CP]

The Dutch national immunisation programme has included routine
measles vaccination since 1976. A 2-dose measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)
vaccine schedule was introduced in 1987 for children aged 14 months
and 9 years. In 2007, the national vaccination coverage rates for the
1st and 2nd dose of MMR were 96 percent and 93 percent, respectively
(birth cohorts 2005 and 1997) [2]. Corresponding figures for The
Hague were 98 percent and 84 percent, respectively.

Current outbreak description
-------------------------
On 17 Jun 2008, a general practitioner (GP) reported a suspected case
of measles with strong clinical evidence in a previously unvaccinated
8-year-old boy. Urine, throat swab and blood specimens were
subsequently submitted for PCR testing. All specimens were found
positive for measles virus. It is yet unknown from where this case
(the index case) acquired the infection. There was no relevant travel
history. The child attends a school of 210 pupils, of whom many come
from the anthroposophic community in which parents opt not to
vaccinate their children. From 18 Jun to 3 Jul 2008, 9 further cases
from the same school were reported. One was laboratory confirmed, and
8 were epidemiologically linked.

On 26 Jun 2008, a 7-year-old child from another school (population:
450 pupils), also with many pupils from the anthroposophic community,
was diagnosed with measles and confirmed by PCR. The child is a
cousin of one of the cases from the 1st school. From 3 to 22 Jul
2008, 15 other cases from the 2nd school were reported. All were
epidemiologically linked. The vaccination coverage amongst children
at the 2 schools is unknown. However, we estimated the 2nd dose
coverage at the 2nd school to be 65 percent in 2007 [3].

Initially, the measles outbreak seemed confined to the 2 school
clusters. Eight incidental cases outside the 2 schools were reported,
but all were family members of the affected school children.
Recently, however, 2 cases outside the school clusters have been
reported in other cities (Leiderdorp and Utrecht). Both are
epidemiologically linked to the outbreak in The Hague. [The number of
cases of measles by day of onset of symptoms, defined as 1st day of
fever, is illustrated by a figure in the original text].

Age and vaccination status
--------------------------
The median age of the affected children in The Hague (n=32) was 8
years, (range 4-16 years). Two affected adults (a mother and a father
of affected children from different families) were aged 35 and 48
years, respectively. Male to female ratio was 1:1. Of the 34 cases,
31 were non-immunised children; one child received the vaccine (1st
dose) during the outbreak and developed measles 3 days later. This
is, therefore, not considered a vaccination failure. Regarding the
adults, one was vaccinated with a single dose in 1978 and the other
has never been vaccinated.

Microbiological investigation
--------------------------------
Clinical specimens (urine, throat swab, serum) were obtained from 6
cases. The presence of measles virus was detected in all cases by RT-
PCR. The sequences of the N-terminal part of the nucleoprotein gene
of the viruses were identical for 5 cases and belonged to genotype
D8. In one case, genotyping is pending. In 2 cases, measles-specific
antibodies (IgM) were detected in serum.

Control measures
-----------------
The municipal health centre of The Hague (GGD) has implemented
several outbreak control measures. Since the outbreak was initially
limited to the specific anthroposophic population associated with the
2 schools, measures were aimed at this target group. All parents of
children attending the 2 schools received an information letter. MMR
vaccination was offered to all unvaccinated children and to the
family members of cases. However, the school authorities had
rightfully predicted that very few would use this opportunity, as
most parents in this community had deliberately chosen not to
immunise their children. In total, only 10 vaccinations were
administered (2 to adults, 8 to children). For case-finding, the
local GPs and microbiologists were asked to be alert and report
possible cases of measles. In the general population, awareness of
the importance of vaccination was raised with the help of media
releases. An elaborate fact sheet with questions and answers for the
public was published on the GGD website [4]. Until 21 Jul 2008, about
500 visits were registered.

Discussion
-----------
We report the largest cluster of measles that has occurred in The
Netherlands since the large outbreak of measles in 1999/2000. It is
yet unclear from where the virus involved in the current outbreak
originated. Although genotype D8 has been detected in Europe before
[5], recent outbreaks of measles in several European countries have,
to our knowledge, not been associated with genotype D8 [6]. The
present outbreak is linked to the anthroposophic community. The
relatively low vaccination coverage in combination with social
clustering, e.g. at schools, makes this community particularly prone
to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. As the vaccination
coverage of the general population in The Netherlands is relatively
high, the risk of spread of measles outside these communities,
whether anthroposophical or religious, is limited when compared to
the risk of spread within these communities in outbreak situations
[7].

In the last few years, the infectious potential of measles seems to
be increasing, with outbreaks currently being reported in the United
States [8] and several European countries including Italy [9], Spain
[6], Switzerland [10] and the United Kingdom [11], some of which were
also linked to anthroposophical communities [12]. Based on the high
overall vaccination coverage and the low incidence of measles, The
Netherlands appears to be near to the 2010 WHO Euro measles
elimination goal [13,14]. However, there is strong social clustering
of people who deliberately (on various grounds of principle) choose
not to vaccinate. As a result, a large measles outbreak associated
with religious or anthroposophic communities can still occur.

[A multi-state outbreak of measles linked to non-immune
anthroposophic communities in Austria, Germany, and Norway occurred
earlier in the year and has been described in detail in the
ProMED-mail archived reports referenced below. It will be interesting
to establish whether there is any link between the index case of The
Netherlands outbreak and the outbreaks in these other European
countries and to establish whether the D8 measles genotype is present
all these countries.

The current Netherlands outbreak once again highlights the need to
elevate and maintain the level of acceptance of MMR vaccination
throughout Europe.
