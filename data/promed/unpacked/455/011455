The French public health Agency announced Saturday 12 Mar 2022, that a 2nd child has died as part of the resurgence of cases of serious infection with the _E. coli_ bacterium,

As of [11 Mar 2022], 26 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) "linked to _E. coli_ bacteria with similar characteristics have been identified" in children ages 1 to 15 and "2 children have died," Public Health France said in a press release, adding that "22 additional cases are under investigation".

The consumption of animal products (meat or dairy products) that are poorly cooked or eaten raw can trigger this infection. "Fresh fruits and vegetables that have been in contact with EHEC may also be at risk," adds the Institut Pasteur.

At this stage, the epidemiological investigation has not made it possible to incriminate a particular source of infection. Also, the health authorities are renewing the general recommendations for the prevention of food risks, especially for children under 16: hand washing before preparing meals; cooking red meats thoroughly; raw milk cheeses must not be consumed by children under 5 years old; vegetables, salads or fruit must be washed or peeled; kitchen utensils and work surfaces must be washed; leftover food must be quickly put in the fridge.

Sant√© Publique France indicates that "the health authorities, who are monitoring the development of the situation on a daily basis, are fully mobilized in order to identify the source of this contamination and put in place the appropriate health measures as quickly as possible to avoid the occurrence new cases."
