Xinjiang reports 4 imported polio cases
--------------------
Four infants in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
have been diagnosed with polio, a disease that can cause irreversible
paralysis, the local health authority said Friday night.

The four patients, aged from 4 months to 2 years, are all from Hotan
Prefecture, including 2 from Hotan city and one each from Lop and
Yutian counties, Xinjiang's regional health department said in a press
release.

It said the cases were reported from [3-17 Jul 2011].

As of Friday, 2 of the patients have recovered and been discharged
from hospital, and the other 2 who remain hospitalized are in stable
condition, it said.

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on its
website at midnight the virus had been confirmed by the World Health
Organization to be imported from Pakistan.

The center said the WHO confirmed after gene sequencing that the virus
had a 99 percent resemblance with the wild poliovirus that caused an
outbreak in Pakistan in 2009.

Chinese Ministry of Health sent a team of experts to Xinjiang Thursday
to assist in disease prevention.

Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a viral disease of the brain and spinal
cord that mainly affects children under 5 years of age. One in 200
infections leads to irreversible paralysis, usually in the legs.

Of the 4 polio-endemic countries in the world, Afghanistan, India,
Nigeria and Pakistan, Xinjiang neighbors 3.

Before the Hotan outbreak, China had been polio-free for 11 years.

[The occurrence of 4 cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) associated disease
in Xinjiang Autonomous Region of Western China with a genetic
sequencing identifying the viruses as the same as those circulating in
Pakistan in 2009 suggests that there has most likely been "silent"
transmission of these viruses in either Pakistan or Xinjiang
Autonomous Region for the past 2 years. Unfortunately the continued
circulation of WPV in areas with suboptimal programmatic activities
due to infrastructural challenges and/or civil unrest has been posing
the most significant challenges to the goal of eradication of the
WPV.

cases as of 24 Aug 2011 can be found at
