[1] Viet Nam: new variant
Date: Sat 29 May 2021

Viet Nam has detected a COVID variant that appears to be a combination of the Indian and UK variants and can spread quickly by air, officials say. Viet Nam's health minister Nguyen Thanh Long described the latest mutation as "very dangerous". Viruses mutate all the time, and most variants are inconsequential, but some can make a virus more contagious. Since COVID-19 was first identified in January 2020, thousands of mutations have been detected.

"Viet Nam has uncovered a new COVID-19 variant combining characteristics of the 2 existing variants 1st found in India and the UK," Mr Nguyen told a government meeting, according to Reuters news agency. Mr Nguyen said the new hybrid variant was more transmissible than previously known versions, especially in the air. He said it was discovered after running tests on newly-detected patients, online newspaper VnExpress reported. He added that the genetic code of the virus would be made available soon.

The variant of COVID-19 1st identified in India last October 2020 -- called B.1.617.2 -- is more transmissible than the UK/Kent variant -- also known as B.1.1.7 -- according to experts. Research suggests that vaccines, such as the Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs, are highly effective against the Indian variant after 2 doses, but protection from one dose appears to be reduced.

There is no evidence that any mutations of the coronavirus cause much more serious illness for the vast majority of people. As with the original version, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. But a virus being more infectious and equally dangerous will in itself lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.

Viet Nam has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks. The country has registered more than 6700 coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic. Of those, more than half have been recorded since late April this year [2021]. It has also recorded 47 COVID-related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

"Prof Dr Nguyen Thanh Long, minister of health emphasized: In this 4th wave of epidemics, in accordance with the actual situation, the biggest goal set by the prime minister is to control the epidemic situation in 2 countries. In Bac Giang and Bac Ninh provinces, the Ministry of Health has made changes in epidemic prevention in isolation, testing and treatment. The rate of increase in cases shows no sign of slowing down.

"Commenting on the current situation of the COVID-19 epidemic nationwide, Prof Dr Nguyen Thanh Long, minister of health, said that as previously forecast, the 4th wave of epidemics was very complicated, with difficulties in disease control. This epidemic has spread to more than 30 provinces and cities and has been basically controlled by the provinces. Particularly, Bac Giang and Bac Ninh are 2 localities that tend to have very complicated developments due to the appearance of infection patterns in industrial zones. Along with that, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed with mutations that increase its ability to spread quickly and spread widely. This explains the rapid increase in the number of infections in a short time.

"In these 2 provinces, the number of confirmed cases shows no sign of slowing down, mostly in isolated and blocked areas. The head of the health sector said that coming here, Bac Giang and Bac Ninh will continue to have infections, and it will take more time to control the situation well. The minister hoped that, with the plans and measures being implemented, together with the drastic measures of the government, the prime minister, the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 prevention and control, the Ministry of Health, and localities, in the coming time, the epidemic situation in these 2 provinces will be well controlled." - Mod.LK]

[2] Thailand: prisons

A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand's prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom's overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. More than 22 000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep.

Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak.

"Prisoners don't have the knowledge to protect themselves," said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand's harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month [April 2021] and told AFP that he had not been tested for COVID-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. "But after this, I'm so scared (for everyone still inside) If you are inside the prison, you are at risk" it's unavoidable," he said.

Thailand's prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya "Rung" Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year [2020] demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail.

The Thai prison population stood at around 311 000 earlier this year [2021], the International Federation for Human Rights said, more than 2.5 times the system's official capacity. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a meter (less than 2 feet) of space. "That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin," justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February [2021].

Officials have tested more than 36 000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering COVID vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home.

"For us to bail anyone or do anything, it has to be done properly," Somsak told reporters on [Mon 24 May 2021]. "We can't allow them to spread infections."

"Authorities should reduce the detainee population of those held on politically motivated charges or for minor offences," said Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch.

[Prisons are high risk environments for spread of infectious diseases, and especially respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Prisoners often experience poor health and limited access to health care before and during incarceration. Once incarcerated, prisoners often age prematurely, experiencing health problems associated with people in the general population who are 10 to 15 years older, making them prime candidates for severe COVID.

Furthermore, it is challenging for prisoners to maintain physical distancing, as they live, work, eat, and sleep in communal settings. Poor ventilation in many facilities means the spread of an airborne virus is often quick. All these factors lead to a dangerous situation for prisoners and the prison staff, and a difficult situation to correct without releasing prisoners incarcerated for minor offences to decrease the density of the population. - Mod.LK]

[3] CDC: carditis after vaccination
Date: Fri 28 May 2021

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/COVID-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html


Clinical considerations: myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines among adolescents and young adults
---------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Since April 2021, increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the United States after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), particularly in adolescents and young adults. There has not been a similar reporting pattern observed after receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson).

In most cases, patients who presented for medical care have responded well to medications and rest and had prompt improvement of symptoms. Reported cases have occurred predominantly in male adolescents and young adults 16 years of age and older. Onset was typically within several days after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, and cases have occurred more often after the 2nd dose than the 1st dose. CDC and its partners are investigating these reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older given the risk of COVID-19 illness and related, possibly severe, complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death.

Background
Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the lining outside the heart. In both cases, the body's immune system is causing inflammation in response to an infection or some other trigger. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.

The severity of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis can vary. For the cases reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, most who presented to medical care have responded well to medications and rest.

Recommendations for clinicians
- CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older given the greater risk of other serious complications related to COVID-19, such as hospitalization, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), or death.
- Report all cases of myocarditis and pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System).
- Consider myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents or young adults with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. In this younger population, coronary events are less likely to be a source of these symptoms.
- Ask about prior COVID-19 vaccination if you identify these symptoms, as well as relevant other medical, travel, and social history.
- For initial evaluation, consider an ECG, troponin level, and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In the setting of normal ECG, troponin, and inflammatory markers, myocarditis or pericarditis are unlikely.
- For suspected cases, consider consultation with cardiology for assistance with cardiac evaluation and management. Evaluation and management may vary depending on the patient age, clinical presentation, potential causes, or practice preference of the provider.
- For follow-up of patients with myocarditis, consult the recommendations from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.
- It is important to rule out other potential causes of myocarditis and pericarditis. Consider consultation with infectious disease and/or rheumatology specialists to assist in this evaluation.

Where available, evaluate for potential etiologies of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly acute COVID-19 infection (for example, PCR testing), prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (for example, detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies), and other viral etiologies (for example, enterovirus PCR and comprehensive respiratory viral pathogen testing).

[4] UK: variants
Date: Thu 27 May 2021
Source: Public Health England [edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/confirmed-cases-of-COVID-19-variants-identified-in-uk


Public Health England (PHE) releases weekly updates on the number of confirmed new cases of variants of concern and variants under investigation identified in the United Kingdom. The dominant variant continues to be VOC-20DEC-01 (B.1.1.7), and PHE will continue to monitor all variants closely. The best way to stop the spread of the virus is to remember: hands, face, space and follow the restrictions in place.

Public health leaders urge caution in areas of high variant prevalence. PHE's latest weekly variant cases data shows that cases of VOC-21APR-02 (B.1.617.2. - Mod.SH) have risen by 3535 to 6959 since last week.

The most affected areas continue to be Bolton, Bedford and Blackburn with Darwen, which have seen 1354, 366, and 361 confirmed cases, respectively. There are small numbers of cases of VOC-21APR-02 in most parts of the country. PHE have published a full breakdown of VOC-21APR-02 cases by lower-tier local authority.

In some affected areas, hospitalisations are rising. Hospital attendances and admissions are predominantly in unvaccinated individuals, highlighting how crucial it is that people in these areas come forward to receive vaccination. Nationwide, up to 25 May 2021, 201 people who were confirmed to have VOC-21APR-02 attended A&E, resulting in 43 admissions. These numbers will be updated with new sequencing results on a weekly basis.

Evidence shows that VOC-21APR-02 is likely to be more transmissible than the dominant B.1.1.7 Kent variant. Cases of VOC-21APR-02 have continued to grow faster than B.1.1.7 but an increase in overall cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections has only been seen in a small number of areas. PHE experts are monitoring the situation closely to establish how much more transmissible VOC-21APR-02 may be. It is crucial that everybody, particularly in the most affected areas, take particular care to remain responsible and vigilant.

A PHE study showed that 2 doses of vaccine offer high levels of protection against symptomatic disease from VOC-21APR-02. We expect the vaccines to be effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, so it is vital to get both doses to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging variants.

Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive, UK Health Security Agency, said: "With cases of the variant first identified in India continuing to rise in some areas, we are urging people to be very cautious and follow the guidance on hygiene, face coverings, social distancing, and meeting outdoors. We now know that getting both vaccine doses gives a high degree of protection against this variant, and we urge everyone to have the vaccine when the NHS invites you.

"Please follow the public health advice and make sure that you remain careful, work from home if you can, meet people outside where possible, and remember 'hands, face, space, fresh air' at all times. This is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from this variant."

In London, PHE is working across the health system and with borough council leaders in parts of the city where cases have been identified. A targeted approach is being used throughout the city, including Hounslow and other parts of west London, where dispersed clusters have been detected. This includes whole genome sequencing, PCR testing, settings-based testing, enhanced contact tracing, self-isolation support, and enhanced vaccine deployment to ensure that 2nd doses for priority groups are brought forward and that maximum uptake is achieved for 1st doses.

In Bolton, the army working with RE:SILIENT visited over 4000 houses, delivering over 1500 test kits. This was in addition to the national surge team efforts, which saw over 9000 properties visited and over 3000 kits given out. In Blackburn with Darwen, enhanced vaccine uptake support has resulted in over 82% of registered patients in cohorts 1-10 receiving their first dose.

NHS Test and Trace have supplied more than 400 000 additional PCR test kits to the most affected areas to make sure that everyone who needs a test can get one. In addition, over 190 existing test sites have been reassigned to provide PCR test kits in areas where VOC-21APR-02 prevalence is high. This means tests can be sequenced faster, so VOC-21APR-02 cases are found sooner. Over 300 mobile testing units (MTUs) have been deployed to provide PCR test kits for those without symptoms in high-prevalence areas, including to more than 35 schools, so students, parents, and staff can get a PCR test as quickly as possible.

National marketing support is in place to make sure that local communities are kept well informed about the situation in their area, how and where to get a test, and about any public health interventions, such as surge testing.

A further variant, VUI-21MAY-02 (C.36.3), has been designated as a variant under investigation (VUI) on 24 May on the basis of the mutation profile and increased importation from a widening international area. There have been 109 cases of VUI-21MAY-02 dispersed across the country to date. The C.36.3 variant was first detected in Thailand, in cases who had travelled from Egypt. There is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective. PHE is carrying out laboratory testing to better understand the impact of the mutations on the behaviour of the virus. All appropriate public health interventions will be undertaken, including additional contact tracing and targeted testing. Where cases have been identified, additional follow-up of cases, testing of contacts, and, if required, targeted case finding will limit its spread.

More information will be available in Variant Technical Briefing 13, which Public Health England will publish on Thu 27 May 2021.
