UK's DEFRA investigates possible new foot-and-mouth outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON: The department of environment, food and rural affairs said
it is investigating a possible new outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at an
abattoir in Leicestershire.
DEFRA said that, as a precaution, all movement of livestock was banned in a
five mile radius of the slaughterhouse in the town of Congerstone.
Results from tests on a pig suspected of carrying the disease will not be
known for four days.
The UK was declared free of the disease in January.
