Summary of the 20 Feb 1998 FDA Inspection Report on the MBPI [Michigan
Biologic Products Institute, Lansing, Michigan. Meryl Nass, M.D., May 19,
1998.
Essentially all the issues in the report have to do with grossly inadequate
quality control... [Here I am trying only to list in a brief but
comprehensible manner the issues enumerated in the FDA's report.
[An extract follows. The full version can be accessed by sending an e-mail
message to majordomo@usa.healthnet.org saying:

1. MBPI did not test the suitability of their own procedures, nor validate
them.
2. Inadequate analytical methods
3. Lack of written operating procedures
4. Inadequate testing procedures
5. Quarantined materials
6. Expiration dates
7. Labelling issues
8. Stability testing
9. Use of vaccine lots that failed testing. Several examples
10. Sterility
11. Missing sections of the report

[I have not personally seen this FDA report, but it appears to list
multiple failures in GMP -- Good Manufacturing Practices -- which call into
question whether the vaccine as stockpiled meets FDA standards.
I would remind readers interested in further information that the US Dept.
of Defense has web pages on the vaccine at:
