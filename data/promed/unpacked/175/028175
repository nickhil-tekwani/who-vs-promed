The Ministry of Health of Argentina issued an alert for an outbreak of paratyphoid fever in Salta after an interprovincial sporting event in a club in the city that took place on 12 and 13 Nov 2022. The Ministry calls for intensified epidemiological surveillance. As for the general situation of paratyphoid fever in Argentina, the National Health Surveillance System reported that 1427 notifications of parathyroid fever were recorded. 94% of the notifications correspond to the province of Salta or were detected in persons in other provinces with a history of travel to Salta, except for 6 cases (2 corresponding to a family cluster in Catamarca and 4 isolated cases in the province of Jujuy).

80% of the reported cases who reside in the province of Salta correspond to the Capital department, followed by Cerrillos (5.7%), Rosario de Lerma (5.5%), and Chicoana (1.8%). 61% of the total number of reported cases correspond to children under 15 years of age. Delegations from Salta, Catamarca, Chaco, Formosa, Jujuy, La Rioja, and Tucum√°n participated in the event. Among the attendees, there was an outbreak of enteric fever, and _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B was identified in the available isolates. The event included players, coaches, and family members.

Once the cases were notified, Salta officials began the investigation of the outbreak; the other jurisdictions involved participated in the investigation in their provinces to identify possible cases among participants from their jurisdiction and carry out investigation and control activities. The national and jurisdictional directions of epidemiology agreed to use a common form and information flow to carry out a single collaborative investigation that would allow the scope and extent of the outbreak to be determined.

Given the current situation, it is recommended that all health teams strengthen the clinical-epidemiological suspicion of paratyphoid fever in people who match the case definition, with timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment of cases, research actions aimed at identifying and controlling possible sources, and sensitizing the population to measures to prevent the disease as well as for early warning and consultation before the onset of symptoms.

A suspected case is any person with a high fever (more than 38 deg C/100.4 deg F) of at least 3 days of evolution, affected general condition, maybe accompanied by diarrhea, abdominal pain, periods of constipation, and without another apparent focus or another defined etiology. Any suspected case must be confirmed or ruled out by laboratory analysis.

[Paratyphoid fever is like typhoid fever in that both are enteric fever types of disease, although the former can be, but is not necessarily, less severe. The paratyphoid salmonellas are divided into A, B, and, rarely now, C. _Salmonella_ Paratyphi, also referred to as _S. enterica_ serotype Paratyphi, types B and C, also have species, now serotypes, Schottmuelleri and Hirschfeldii, respectively. Like typhoid, paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a zoonosis, with [only] humans as the reservoir, but the paratyphoid bacillus has been isolated from domestic animals and fish.

In India, paratyphoid A has become an increasing problem, accounting for up to 45% of cases of enteric fever in 1998 (1). Although initially quite sensitive to antimicrobials, strains have become more resistant to quinolones; in contrast, _S._ Typhi has manifested resistance for some time.

In a report regarding differential risk factors for typhoid and paratyphoid in Indonesia, the authors found that the infections seemed to have distinct routes of transmission (2). Typhoid was associated with factors within a household (recent case in the house, no soap for handwashing, sharing of food from the same plate, no toilet in the house), whereas paratyphoid was associated with sources outside the household, such as food from street vendors and flooding.
