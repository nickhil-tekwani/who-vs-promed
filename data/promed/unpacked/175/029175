Uganda: Marburg Virus Claims Another Victim
-------------------------------------------
Another person has died of Marburg virus disease in South West Uganda, bringing the toll from the outbreak to 5, government officials said on Saturday [20 Oct 2012]. The death occurred in Bukora Kitumba sub-county in Kabale district. "It's sad the 5th person has died because the emergency team delayed to reach Kabale on Friday [19 Oct 2012]", according to Patrick Besigye Keihwa, the Kabale District Chairman.

Meanwhile, the emergency team dispatched to deal with the outbreak has arrived in Kabale. The team will be conducting burials and managing an emergency zone to treat people. Efforts are also underway to track all people who had had contact with the victims, the government said. The authorities urged the public to avoid direct bodily contact with a person suffering from Marburg virus disease and unnecessary public gatherings.

Marburg virus disease, also known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever is transmitted through bodily fluids such as saliva and blood, or by handling infected wild animals such as monkeys. The disease [is caused by a virus belonging] to the same family of viruses as Ebola virus [the family _Filoviridae_], starts with severe headache and leads to haemorrhaging and, in previous outbreaks in Africa, to death in 80 percent or more of cases, usually within 8 to 9 days.

The last outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Uganda occurred in 2007 and killed 2 miners in the west of the country. The latest outbreak comes after at least 16 people died from Ebola virus disease in August [2012]. In 2000, 425 people contracted Ebola virus disease in Uganda and more than half of them died.

A major outbreak of Marburg virus disease occurred among gold miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2000, causing 128 deaths out of 154 cases. An outbreak in Angola in 2004-05 killed 150 people out of 163 cases, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Refugees from Congo suspected to have brought Marburg to Uganda
----------------------------------------------------------
According to emerging reports from Southwestern Uganda, there is increasing suspicion of an outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus disease, and affected individuals have been tested and put into a full quarantine. A team of health officials is on the ground, assisted reportedly by security personnel, combing areas where refugees have sought shelter to identify anyone displaying symptoms in line with the early signs of the disease.

Only 2 weeks ago, Uganda was declared free Ebola virus disease, after an outbreak, also suspected to have been brought into Uganda from the Eastern Congo, which [was responsible for the deaths of] patients and health workers. Marburg virus disease falls into the same category of virus diseases as Ebola virus disease, and while less virulent, is still known to be a disease with a high percentage of fatalities.

Diseases in Congo's rain forests are common but normally contained within a small radius of one or 2 communities. But with the lack of health care structures in that part of the [Democratic Republic of Congo], where at the moment intense fighting is going on, it makes refugees often the main carriers to bring such disease across the border into Uganda, where a much better-equipped health care infrastructure is then compelled to deal with the unwanted 'imports.'

The local media in Kampala is now starting to pick up on the news, which almost inevitably started to emerge on Twitter as individuals on the ground sent messages out, which were then picked up and retweeted.

The outbreak comes on the day prior to Uganda's National Bird Watching contest, with the opening ceremony taking place this afternoon at the Uganda Museum in Kampala from where the participating teams were to leave for their chosen locations upcountry and in the national parks.

A full statement is expected later today [19 Oct 2012] from the Ministry of Health, but the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe has reportedly confirmed that [the causative agent] is Marburg virus, prompting widespread containment measures now unfolding around the affected areas between Kabale and Kisoro.

[Kabale District is bordered by Rukungiri District to the north, Ntungamo District to the northeast, the Republic of Rwanda to the east and south, Kisoro District to the west and Kanungu District to the northwest. The town of Kabale, where the district headquarters are located, lies approximately 420 kilometres (260 mi), by road, southwest of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.

A map of the districts of Uganda can be accessed at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabale_District. Kabale District has a common border with Rwanda, but is not directly adjacent to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which lies further to the west. So refugees would have to transit another Ugandan district which has not yet reported Marburg virus disease.

Transmission of the virus from person-to-person requires close contact with a patient. Transmission does not occur during the incubation period 3 to 9 days). Infection results from contact with blood or other body fluids (faeces, vomitus, urine, saliva, and respiratory secretions) with high virus concentration, especially when these fluids contain blood. Transmission via infected semen can occur; virus has been detected in semen up to 7 weeks after clinical recovery.

Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses, and are most infectious during the phase of severe illness. Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease, rapid deterioration, and possibly higher fatality. (For additional information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_marburg/en/index.html.)

In an outbreak of Marburg virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1999/2000 the majority of cases occurred in young male workers at a gold mine in Durba, in the north-eastern part of the country. In the most recent previous outbreak in Uganda in 2007, 3 confirmed cases were reported in mine workers from Kamwenge, western Uganda. The 2nd and 3d miners developed illness after caring for their colleague; one of the caregivers also died.

It would be relevant to establish the proximity of mine-working to the current outbreak. - Mod.CP
