1st report of barley as host of a phytoplasma belonging to group
16SrI, subgroup B, and ribosomal protein subgroup rpI-B in Lithuania.
-----------------------------------------------
L. Urbanaviciene and R. Jomantiene, Fitovirus Laboratory, Institute
of Botany, LT-08406 Vilnius, Lithuania; and R. E. Davis, Molecular
Plant Pathology Laboratory, USDA-Agricultural Research Service,
Beltsville, MD 20705. Plant Dis. 89:339, 2005; published on-line as
DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0339A. Accepted for publication 2 Dec 2004.
Numerous diseased plants of barley (_Hordeum vulgaris_ L.) exhibiting
twisted, abnormally thin and yellowed awns, reduced spikelets, and
general stunting and yellowing were observed in fields in the Vilnius
and Kaisiadorys regions of Lithuania. The possible association of a
phytoplasma with the disease, termed barley deformation (BaDef), was
assessed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
3 phytoplasma universal primer pairs (P1/P7, R16F2n/R16R2, and
rpF1/rpR1) (1,2,4) were employed to amplify ribosomal (r) RNA gene
(rDNA) and ribosomal protein (rp) gene sequences. Template DNA
extractions and PCR (direct and nested) were conducted as previously
described (4). Although DNA was amplified in PCRs containing template
extracted from diseased plants, no amplification was observed in PCRs
containing DNA from symptomless plants sampled from the same fields.
The BaDef phytoplasma was identified and classified according to Lee
et al. (4) through restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
analysis of 1.2-kbp 16S rDNA amplified in the PCR primed by primer
pair R16F2n/R16R2 and analysis of the 1.2-kbp rp gene sequences
amplified in PCR primed by primer pair rpF1/rpR1. On the basis of
collective RFLP patterns of amplified 16S rDNA and rp gene sequences,
the BaDef phytoplasma was classified as a member of group 16SrI
(group I, aster yellows phytoplasma group), subgroup B (16SrI-B), and
rp subgroup rpI-B.
Ribosomal protein subgroup B was distinguished from other rp
subgroups on the basis of the presence of a recognition site for
HpaII. The 1.8-kbp rDNA product of PCR primed by P1/P7 and the
1.2-kbp rpF1/rpR1 PCR product were cloned and sequenced, and the
sequences were deposited in GenBank under Accession No. AY734453 for
the BaDef 16S rDNA and Accession No. AY735448 for the BaDef rp gene
sequence.
Previously, only oat proliferation (OatP) phytoplasma, a member of
subgroup 16SrI-A, had been characterized in a cereal crop (_Avena
sativa_ L.) in Europe (3); BaDef is another phytoplasmal disease
threatening cereal crops in the region.

[Aster yellows (AY) is the most widespread plant disease among those
known to be caused by phytoplasmas. AY phytoplasmas are associated
with diseases in more than 100 plant species worldwide, predominantly
in herbaceous dicotyledonous plants. In North America, AY diseases
are attributed primarily to phytoplasma strains belonging to
subgroups 16SrI-A (termed Eastern AY phytoplasma) and 16SrI-B (termed
California AY or Western AY phytoplasma) in the AY group (16SrI).
Both 16SrI-A and 16SrI-B phytoplasmas are transmitted by a variety of
polyphagous leafhopper species and have a wide range of plant hosts.
On the basis of RFLP patterns of the 16S rDNA, the OatP phytoplasma
was classified as a member of group 16SrI (group I, aster yellows
phytoplasma group). The RFLP patterns of the 16S rDNA were
indistinguishable from those of 16S rDNA from tomato big bud (BB)
phytoplasma and other phytoplasmas classified in group I, subgroup A
(subgroup I-A, tomato big bud phytoplasma subgroup). Disease
management depends upon the crop involved. Monitoring of leafhoppers
and early detection of AY yellows symptoms are important for those
crops in which hand-removal of diseased plants is feasible. For field
crops, there are very few management options available. Crop rotation
will not reduce aster yellows, because it is not a soil-borne
disease, and most crops are susceptible to the phytoplasma. There are
no fungicides available to control aster yellows. I rather doubt that
there are varieties that possess resistance to the AY phytoplasma.
