Concurrent outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus infections -- an unprecedented epidemic wave of mosquito-borne viruses in the Pacific 2012-2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Roth A, Mercier A, Lepers C, Hoy D, Duituturaga S, Benyon E, Guillaumot L, Souares Y]

Summary
-------
Since January 2012, the Pacific Region has experienced 28 new documented outbreaks and circulation of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus. These mosquito-borne disease epidemics seem to become more frequent and diverse, and it is likely that this is only the early stages of a wave that will continue for several years. Improved surveillance and response measures are needed to mitigate the already heavy burden on island health systems and limit further spread to other parts of the world.

Background
----------
Since January 2012, the Pacific is experiencing a high burden of mosquito-borne disease due to concurrent epidemics of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus infections. So far over 120 000 people have been reported to be affected, a figure that is likely to substantially underestimate the real numbers due to underreporting. For as long as there has been data available from the Region (that is, 40 years), this epidemic wave of mosquito-borne viruses with 28 new mosquito-borne viral outbreaks (n=25) and circulation (n=3) documented since January 2012 (18 dengue virus (DENV) serotype 1-4, 7 chikungunya virus and 3 Zika virus infection outbreaks, respectively) is unprecedented.

Virus epidemiology
Dengue
------
The epidemic pattern of dengue in the Pacific Region has typically presented in form of sporadic or rare epidemics rather than a hyperepidemic/endemic pattern, with one dominating serotype sweeping across the islands every 3-5 years, and with varying duration of circulation in different islands largely depending on population size. During 2012, there were outbreaks of all 4 serotypes of DENV documented for the 1st time during one year. DENV-1 was the dominating serotype in 2012 and beginning 2013, causing the largest documented dengue outbreak ever in New Caledonia, with 10 978 confirmed cases and 5 deaths from September 2012 to September 2013. Since 2012 there have only been reports of one outbreak with DENV-2 and -4 respectively

Chikungunya
-----------
After being reported in the Pacific for the 1st time in a small tightly controlled outbreak in New Caledonia in 2011, CHIKV is currently becoming established in the Region. In Papua New-Guinea in 2012-13, the largest epidemic in the Region so far with estimated (though poorly documented) tens of thousands of cases, was caused by the East Central South African (ECSA) lineage of the virus. The Asian lineage of the virus was responsible for the outbreak in Yap State (2013-14) and also in New Caledonia (2013).

Zika
----
After the 1st documented Pacific Zika outbreak in Yap in 2007, the Asian lineage of the virus reappeared in French Polynesia in October 2013, and has since caused large outbreaks in New Caledonia (1400 confirmed cases), Cook Islands (over 900 cases), and Easter Island that is not part of the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network. Between November 2013 and February 2014, increased incidence of neurological complications, including 42 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, was a unique and worrying feature of the French Polynesia outbreak that warrants further studies.

Conclusions
-----------
Risk of further spread
Considering also the previous dengue outbreaks in the Pacific Region and the diversity of the current outbreaks, it seems likely that the Pacific Region is in the early stages of an epidemic wave for the 3 mosquito-borne viruses that started in 2012 and is likely to continue for several years. The risk for further spread in the Pacific Region is high for several reasons. Firstly, it is likely that there is little immunity to these diseases, as DENV-3 had not been circulating in the Region since 1995 and prior to the current wave, CHIKV and Zika virus occurrence in the Pacific was limited to 2 documented outbreaks. Secondly, competent vectors present in the Region, mainly _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_, but also other local mosquitoes such as _Ae. polynesiensis_ or _Ae. hensilli_ are known to transmit these viruses. These species have been incriminated in DENV transmission on epidemiological and/or experimental (laboratory infections) grounds. Several of them are confirmed or strongly suspected vectors of CHIKV and Zika viruses. Thirdly, large [human] population mobility and airline travel facilitate the spread.

[The complete report including tables, a map of reported cases of the 3 viruses in the region, and references is available at the source URL above.

This report does not paint a promising picture for the likelihood for a halt of the outbreaks of these 3 viruses. There are no commercially available vaccines available for any of these viruses at this time. That leaves vector control as the only measure to reduce transmission. The report indicates that _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ are the 2 main vector species but also other local mosquitoes such as _Ae. polynesiensis_ or _Ae. hensilli_ are known to transmit these viruses. The island setting may make them good candidates for some of the non-pesticide vector control measures currently being tested in other parts of the world.
