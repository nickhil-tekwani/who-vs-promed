Combating Newcastle disease
---------------------------
Virulent Newcastle disease continues to spread; it started in Spanish
Lookout and has now been detected in other parts of Cayo, as well as
Corozal, Stann Creek, and Toledo. And that wide dispersion is what's
behind a 2-day training session at Central Farm. The course is to
educate agriculture extension officers and backyard producers in best
practices to vaccinate poultry. And that's where OIRSA [International
Regional Organization for Plant and Animal Health
<http://www.eppo.org/WORLDWIDE/RPPOs/oirsa.htm>] comes in. They are
providing the vaccines and that organization's Fermin Blanco
explained the importance of getting it distributed.

Fermin Blanco: "OIRSA is very enthusiastic in assisting the
government of Belize and particularly BAHA [Belize Agricultural
Health Authority] and the Ministry of Agriculture in controlling this
disease, so as not to spread in the rest of the nation and the region
by default. So we are here gathered today [27 Jan 2009] to also
provide with the vaccination through the project of OIRSA to finance
the purchase of vaccines."

Hon. Rene Montero [Minister of Agriculture & Fisheries, Belize
<http://www.agriculture.gov.bz/>]: "It has spread to Belize and the
Stann Creek Districts and other areas in the Cayo Districts. We also
now know that it is widespread in the Toledo District as well. It has
affected all types of poultry; broilers, layers, breeders in
chickens, as well as turkeys. It has a great social and economic
impact and has caused concern for food safety, public health, and
food security. Presently we have movement controls in place and our
officers can stop motorists and request presentation of their
movement permits. Backyard producers will be supported by vaccination
campaigns administered by our Ministry, thus the reason for the
participation of many existing staff who will be responsible for
ensuring proper immunization in all communities in their districts,
particularly in affected districts."

The Ministry has also received assistance from PAHO [Pan American
Health Organization], the USDA [US Department of Agriculture], and
IICA [Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture].

[This reflects the seriousness with which the Belize veterinary
service is tackling this emergency and bringing it home to backyard
poultry keepers in Belize. Newcastle disease can cycle out of sight
in these small flocks and prove impossible to eradicate unless they
are vaccinated and monitored.
