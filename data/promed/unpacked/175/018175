On 27 April 2000, a national newspaper reported on a rare _Salmonella_
epidemic affecting wild birds in an area north of Montreal. The area
involved is mostly resort territory used for winter sports and summer
vacations. Local residents began to notice sick birds by mid-March but they
thought they were dying because of the unusually cold weather conditions.
In spite of sick birds being placed in cages in a warm environment they
continued to die, explained a local resident. About 30 birds were found dead.
