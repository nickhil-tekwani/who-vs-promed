Bali officials detect 2nd bird flu flare-up in 10 days
------------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza has struck a 2nd district in Bali despite efforts to
contain the spread of the disease on the island, the district's
animal husbandry, marine, and fisheries agency said on Friday [20 Feb
2009].

I Gusti Ngurah Sandjaja, the head of the agency in Jembrana district
in western Bali, said the outbreak was discovered after 52 chickens
in the village of Banyubiru died over the course of 4 days.

"We immediately conducted a rapid test and found that the chickens
were infected with the H5N1 virus," Sandjada said.

Following the discovery, Sandjaja said the agency banned the
transportation of poultry in and out of the village and had been
culling the bird population and disinfecting cages since Thursday [19
Feb 2009].

He said the agency was still concerned because a number of birds from
Banyubiru had been sold to neighboring villages.

To head off further spread of the virus, the agency also conducted
disinfecting drives in the nearby Gilimanuk market and chicken
slaughterhouses. Dozens of chickens had died recently in the Arum
Gilimanuk area.

Bird flu first emerged on the island in Jembrana district in 2007-08,
causing the deaths of hundreds of chickens and infecting some local
residents. One person died from the virus.

Sandjaja said the local government was concerned because the latest
outbreak was the 2nd to strike in less than 10 days. Earlier this
month [February 2009], a bird flu outbreak emerged in Badung
district, causing 133 chickens to be destroyed. One person suffered
bird-flu-like symptoms after contact with sick poultry but later
recovered. The Ministry of Health only releases information about
suspected cases a few times a year, and test results from that
particular case have not yet been released.

Meanwhile, state-run Antara news agency reported on Friday [20 Feb
2009] that bird flu cases had been reported in 11 subdistricts in
Banyuwangi, at the easternmost tip of Java Island. Since January, 932
chickens were killed by the virus, the highest number of chicken
deaths due to bird flu ever recorded in East Java Province.

Dewa Made Ngurah, the head of the animal husbandry, marine and
fisheries agency in Bali's provincial capital of Denpasar, said that
many birds were smuggled from Banyuwangi to Bali despite a 2005 bylaw
prohibiting the unregulated flow of poultry in and out of the
province.

Indonesia remains the hardest-hit country in the world from the H5N1
virus, with 113 confirmed human deaths out of a total of 139 cases as
of 19 Jan 2009, according to the World Health Organization.

[2] India: Manipur 2007, a unique H5N1 strain

Bird flu virus in Manipur in 2007 was unique
--------------------------------------------
A study of the H5N1 virus causing the outbreak of highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) in Manipur in 2007 suggests that the virus
originated in Russia, China, or Mongolia, and may have been brought
by migrating wild birds.

A focal H5N1 outbreak in poultry was reported from Manipur, a north
eastern state of India, in 2007. "7th space" reports that the aim of
the study was to genetically characterize the Manipur virus isolate
to understand the relationship with other H5N1 isolates and to trace
the possible source of introduction of the virus into the country.

Characterisation of the complete genome revealed that the virus
belonged to clade 2.2.

It was distinctly different from viruses of the 3 EMA sub-lineages of
clade 2.2 but related to isolates from wild migratory waterfowl from
Russia, China, and Mongolia. The HA gene, had the cleavage site
GERRRRKR, earlier reported in whooper swan isolates from Mongolia in
2005.

A stop codon at position 29 in the PB1-F2 protein could have
implications on the replication efficiency. The acquisition of
polymorphisms as seen in recent isolates of 2005-07 from distinct
geographical regions suggests the possibility of transportation of
H5N1 viruses through migratory birds.

The authors concluded that considering that all 8 genes of the
earlier Indian isolates belonged to the EMA3 sub-lineage and similar
strains have not been reported from neighbouring countries of the
sub- continent, it appears that the virus may have been introduced
independently.
