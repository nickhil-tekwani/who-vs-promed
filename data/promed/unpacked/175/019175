Schistosomiasis outbreak worries government
-------------------------------------------
Bilharzias outbreak affecting Kindege locality since September last year
[2008], is worrying the government of the northern Zaire province, calling
for measures to stem the disease.

Addressing an opening session of the II broad consultative council of the
provincial health department, the deputy-governor for the organisation and
technical services, Rogerio Zabila, [expressed concern about] the current
situation.

"The commune of Kindege, Nzeto district, has been going through, since late
last year, a situation which requires special attention by all of us,"
stressed the vice governor referring to the disease. Rogerio Zabilia
appealed to the health authorities in the region to coordinate efforts to
contain the spread of the disease.

In his turn, the head of the public health division of Nzeto district,
Boaventura Justina, noted that since September last year to 10 Jan 2009,
the commune of Kindege has recorded 354 cases of bilharzias, which resulted
in 15 deaths.

The disease attacks both children and adults, and is caused mainly by
contact with water.

[Schistosomiasis is endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A recent
report found infections rates in another district between 4 per cent and 8
per cent. (Baluku B, Bagalwa M, Bisimwa B. Parasitologic survey of
schistosomiasis due to Schistosoma mansoni in Katana, Democratic Republic
of Congo. Med Trop 2000; 60(2): 163-6). The report has very little
information on the means of diagnosis and previous infection in the area,
but the fact that people are very sick with several deaths suggest that the
infection is newly introduced into a population without preexisting
immunity. This could be related to irrigation or other farming projects
with increased contact to water. Â­ Mod.EP]
