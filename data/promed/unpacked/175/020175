Cholera confirmed in the national prison of Venezuela
German Valero, previously the regional director of health, confirmed
the existence of 85 cases of cholera in the national prison at
Maracaibo. (In the state of Zulia, this brings the number of cases this
year to 800 with 24 deaths.) The epidemic was detected last Wednesday
night in the reeducation area where approximately 800 prisoners are
held. Valero stated that the problem originated with the ingestion of
shrimp or food that was improperly prepared, and pointed out that
prisoners in other areas of the jail could become contaminated as well
as visitors from outside the jail. (Sanitary conditions in the jail
kitchen and toilets were described as very substandard.)
