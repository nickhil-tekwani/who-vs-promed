Limpopo to contain bilharzia outbreak
-------------------------------------
The Limpopo Department of Health will soon conduct visits throughout the
province and identify areas with a potential of harbouring bilharzia, says
spokesperson Phuti Seloba. The decision follows a recent outbreak of the
disease in Vhembe District, where some residents have been diagnosed
bilharzia positive.
Mr Seloba said the visits would help the department come up with
preventative methods such as advising communities against [visiting?]
bilharzia infective areas. "We want to identify these places to quickly
deploy preventative methods before more people become infected," he said.
He said that, after identifying places hit by the bilharzia outbreak, the
department would launch awareness campaigns on how to employ preventative
methods.
He said the outbreak was caused by dirty water that the residents there
consumed. A similar outbreak had recently hit the Kroondal informal
settlement, consisting of about 3000 residents in North West province.
However, the provincial department's Outbreak Response Team (ORT) provided
prophylaxis treatment to infected people there.
Bilharzia, also known as schistosomiasis, is a disease caused by parasitic
worms in fresh water. People are at risk of bilharzia if their skin comes
into contact with fresh water contaminated by a specific species of snails
capable of hosting bilharzia parasites. Fresh water becomes contaminated by
schistosoma parasite eggs when infected people urinate or defecate in the
water. The eggs hatch and, if the snails are present, the parasites grow
and develop within the snails.
When the parasites leave the snail, they can survive in water for about 48
hours, and they are then able to penetrate the skin of people who come into
contact with the water. The parasites bore through the skin and begin to
develop into more mature reproductive forms. Within several weeks, adult
forms may be found inside venous channels in various parts of the body,
where they produce eggs. These eggs are usually released into either the
bladder or intestines.
During early stages of infection some people have no symptoms at all.
Others develop a rash or itchy skin within days of infection. Within a
month, they may have fever, chills, coughs, and muscle aches. A common but
non-specific symptom of bilharzia is fatigue. There may also be blood in
the urine from the passage of eggs into the bladder.

[_Schistosoma haematobium_ is known in the Limpopo river system. Outbreaks
may occur if control programmes fail to treat infected people. Information
on the previous prevalence of schistosomiasis in South Africa would be
appreciated. - Mod.EP]
