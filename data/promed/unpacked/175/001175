Researchers have identified a new virus in the aftermath of a fish kill on a lake in north eastern Wisconsin. The virus, named largemouth bass reovirus, is part of a family called Reoviridae. But little else is known about it, including whether it was responsible for the May 2015 die-off in Pike Lake in Forest County.

"This could be inconsequential to largemouth bass or it could be an existential threat to the species," said Tony Goldberg, a professor and epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "At this point, it's all new and we are trying to find out more."

The fish kill was limited in nature and largemouth - the species most affected - continues to live in the lake, according to the Department of Natural Resources. But samples from Pine Lake's dead fish led to a scientific discovery in Goldberg's laboratory at UW-Madison.

Details of the finding were published last week [1-6 Aug 2016] in the online version of the Journal of General Virology. The paper was authored by Goldberg and colleagues from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources [DNR], including David Giehtbrock.

State fisheries biologists sampled dead fish on Pike Lake after the die-off was observed. Initial tests did not find signs of known pathogens. The virus was subsequently isolated at the US Fish and Wildlife Service's La Crosse Fish Health Center. But it remained unidentified until its genome was sequenced in a "virus hunting laboratory" operated by Goldberg in the university's School of Veterinary Medicine.

The virus did not match any of the millions of genetic sequences on databases, Goldberg said. Goldberg and colleagues decided to name it largemouth bass reovirus. Reoviruses are known to affect fish, birds and mammals, including one that has been linked to mortality of salmon at fish farms. They have not shown any risk to humans.

The finding of the new virus in Wisconsin has not prompted any regulation changes or special warnings from the DNR. "While we are concerned about this development, we aren't advising any new actions," said Giehtbrock, DNR fish culture section chief. "We would hope people will continue with their due diligence and follow the rules in place that seek to prevent the spread of viruses and other fish health concerns." The 2006 discovery of viral hemorrhagic septicemia in Lake Winnebago led to a number of rules in Wisconsin, including prohibitions on transferring live fish or water from one waterbody to another.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia [VHS] is found in the Lake Michigan and Lake Superior watersheds, but has not been found in the Wisconsin River or other inland Wisconsin waters not connected to the Great Lakes, Giehtbrock said. While VHS caused fish kills of multiple species over the last decade, it has not been documented to have caused declines in any Wisconsin fish population, according to the DNR.

Giehtbrock said it's too early to assess the effect of largemouth bass reovirus in Wisconsin. "We'll apply anything new that is learned about the virus," Giehtbrock said. "For now, we recommend vigilance and ask that boaters and anglers follow the regulations in place."

Reoviruses are icosahedral and non-enveloped, with double-stranded RNA genomes with 10-12 segments. The Reoviridae family is divided into 2 subfamilies, Spinareovirinae and Sedovirinae, with 15 genera. The host range of Reoviridae extends from insects, fungi and plants to fish, molluscs, reptiles, birds and mammals.

The reovirus most closely related to this new virus is the piscine reovirus (PRV), the putative cause of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation of farmed salmon.
