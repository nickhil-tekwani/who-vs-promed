Canadian health officials have issued a warning over whooping cough as the disease continues to sweep through parts of British Columbia. There have been more than 140 suspected or confirmed cases of the illness since early December 2011, according to the Fraser Health Authority.

Hotspots for the outbreak include the Hope, Chilliwack and Agassiz areas, but officials said it has also spread to other communities.

With this in mind, anyone traveling into the region might want to double check what their pre-existing medical travel insurance covers, just in case the worst happens.

The authority said the genuine number of cases is likely to be considerably higher because of those that are yet to be reported.

Chief Medical Health Officer Dr Paul Van Buynder has said the best way to safeguard against whooping cough is to get vaccinated, especially for people who have contact with children. Dr Buynder has called for adults who had the vaccination as a child to book a booster shot and parents to make sure their children are also vaccinated.

A spreading outbreak of whooping cough has prompted Fraser Health to extend its vaccination campaign across the region. More than 150 people are believed to have contracted pertussis, a highly contagious bacterial infection that causes adults to cough for months but can be deadly to babies.

Medical health officer Dr. Elizabeth Brodkin said efforts to combat the illness had focused on Chilliwack and Hope [British Columbia, Canada], where the outbreak began but said the vaccine is now being made available to doctors and pharmacists across the region. "More and more, we are seeing cases outside of Fraser East," she said.

Whooping cough cases are appearing in Burnaby, New Westminster, Langley and Maple Ridge [British Columbia, Canada], Brodkin said.

"We didn't want to wait until we were seeing huge numbers of cases and a very aggressive spread," she added. "We saw enough cases that we became concerned and decided it was time to act."

Adults and youth in contact with young children who have not had the pertussis vaccine in the last 5 years are urged to get vaccinated. The goal is to immunize adults, for whom pertussis is more of an irritant, so they don't act as carriers infecting infants, who are most at risk and are hospitalized in more than half of cases.

Three children have already been hospitalized due to the outbreak, including a 2-week-old baby that ended up in intensive care for 5 weeks. All 3 have recovered. Most infants infected get it from parents or close family members.

California had a huge outbreak in 2009 that claimed the lives of 10 children; 5 more died in Saskatchewan in 2010, and 2 more children died in 2011 just across the border in Washington State, where authorities are still battling an outbreak.

[In assessing the durability of pertussis vaccination in children, some researchers noted that: "Reported cases and outbreaks in older children and young adults may reflect a less durable vaccine-induced protection than seen in natural disease (Cherry JD, Brunell PA, Golden GA, Karzon, DT. Report of the task force on pertussis and pertussis immunization - 1988. Pediatrics 1988; 81(June Suppl): 955). The duration of protection has varied in several studies, depending on the epidemiological setting, that is, prevalence of natural disease as well as the vaccine product used. A study in Michigan showed an efficacy of 80 per cent 3 years after the last dose, 50 per cent between 4 and 7 years, and virtually none after 12 years. Breakthrough disease noted in this study was usually mild." - Mod.LL]
