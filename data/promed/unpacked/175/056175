India: Dengue Fever Control Measures in Mumbai
----------------------------------------------
Early in July 2002 the civic Public Health Department was called upon to
undertake urgent preventive measures against a range of diseases. The
sweltering September-October heat made the city a happy hunting ground for
dengue.
The BMC's dengue control [report is as follows: [Dengue fever] is a viral
disease, which is spread by the bite of the female _Aedes agyptus_
mosquito. [In total], 66 cases were detected this year, and 4 deaths
reported. Fogging operations have been intensified, with destruction of
adult mosquitoes through the spread of larvicides and insecticides like
MCO, Fenthion, Abate, and DDT.

Taiwan: Taipei's First Case of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Confirmed
------------------------------------------------
Health officials yesterday reported the first confirmed case of the
potentially fatal dengue hemorrhagic dengue fever in Taipei City this year.
Taipei City Department of Health Director Chiou Shu-ti confirmed that a
40-year-old woman was treated for hemorrhagic dengue fever earlier this
month. The woman, who originally made her home in southern-lying Kaohsiung
City, is thought to have [contracted] the disease when she returned to the
area in early September 2002. The greater Kaohsiung area has been hard hit
by one of the worst outbreaks of dengue fever ever seen in Taiwan. Health
officials have expressed concern that the mosquito transmitted disease
could spread to other areas of the island, although to date there have been
no signs of other areas being affected.
Chiou said the woman had suffered from an earlier bout of dengue fever 10
years ago, which would make her more likely to contract the sometimes fatal
hemorrhagic form of the disease the second time around. Hemorrhagic dengue
fever can have mortality rates of up to 50 percent if proper medical
treatment is not received. Health officials said that the woman's previous
experience with the disease prompted her to check into a hospital after she
started having a fever and suffering from aches in her joints and the
orbits of her eyes. On Tue 1 Oct 2002, her blood platelet count began to
drop and she started to bleed from her nose and gums, all common symptoms
of hemorrhagic dengue fever. The woman was given blood transfusions to make
up for the loss of blood and released with a clean bill of health on Mon 7
Oct 2002. Chiou warned anyone experiencing similar symptoms to contact a
doctor immediately.
