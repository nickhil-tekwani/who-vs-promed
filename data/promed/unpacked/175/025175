About 30 residents in the southern city of Pusan were confirmed to have
contracted dysentery bacilli, putting health authorities on emergency alert
for the highly contagious disease.
The Pusan city government said that the patients suffered from bloody
diarrhoea after they had meals provided by a church in Samrak-dong [on
4 March 1999, before being diagnosed with dysentery. Severe diarrhoea is a
typical symptom of dysentery.
Of the patients including 18 pre-school children and 12 of their family
members, 28 are now undergoing treatment [in hospitals, while two with
light
symptoms returned home after being cured. Presently, a special inspection
team dispatched by the government is tracking down the water-borne disease's
source and infection route, and the city government is carrying out
emergency anti-epidemic efforts to prevent the disease's further spread,
including dispersing disinfectants.
Dysentery cases normally appear in warm seasons after July, but this year it
began to show earlier, in January. Twelve patients were discovered in the
city in the first two months of this year.
