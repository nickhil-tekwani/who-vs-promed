A man died of rabies in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday [18 May 2011],
taking the toll due to dog bites to 5 in 10 days, officials said.

The daily-wage laborer died of rabies at a government hospital in
Kakinada in East Godavari district of coastal Andhra Pradesh, doctors
said. The 45-year-old bit his wife before his death, and she too has
been admitted to the hospital. The victim had been bitten by a stray
dog 4 months ago, but he did not receive anti-rabies vaccine.

All 5 deaths have occurred in East Godavari district, leaving the
people scared. The government has constituted a technical committee to
inquire into the deaths.

While 3 people, including an 8-year-old girl, died in Rajahmundry, 2
deaths have been reported from Kakinada.

Activists of various political parties staged a protest on Wednesday
[18 May 2011] outside Rajahmundry municipal corporation office. They
blamed the municipal authorities for the deaths. They also alleged
that government-run hospitals have not stocked adequate doses of
anti-rabies vaccines; 3 of the victims had approached the hospitals
after dog bites but were reportedly sent away, as the vaccine was not
available.

Meanwhile on Wednesday [18 May 2011], the state government submitted
a report to the state Human Rights Commission concerning the death of
the 8-year-old girl as a result of lack of anti-rabies vaccines at
Rajahmundry hospital. The state government, as well as the district
administration, admitted in their reports that there had been a
shortage of the vaccine during the period 4-26 Apr 2011. The
commission, which issued the notice to the government, has adjourned
the hearing to 28 Jun 2011.

According to the health authorities, there are close to 67 000 stray
dogs in the urban areas of East Godavari district alone, while their
number is over 20 lakh [2 million] across the state.

A 10-year-old boy, who was admitted in a government hospital near
here following a dog bite, has died, family sources said. The boy was
moved to Kakinada Government General Hospital on Thu 19 May 2011 and
died late last night [20 May 2011] due to rabies virus infection. He
had been bitten by a dog on 26 Apr 2011 and was admitted to a primary
health centre before being moved to the hospital in Kakinada, East
Godavari district. The victim is the 3rd person to have succumbed to
rabies in the district in the last few weeks.

[Unlike previous reports from the region, these deaths can be
attributed unequivocally to shortage of vaccine for post-exposure
prophylaxis of victims bitten by rabid dogs. This is a deficiency
which should be remedied without delay.

The reader of the report is left wondering whether the woman who
received a bite from her rabid husband is similarly not receiving
acceptable post-exposure vaccine therapy.

Rajahmundry is a city and municipal corporation of the Indian state
of Andhra Pradesh. It is the 4th largest city in the state and is
