Two cases of legionellosis were found at the Sinigo elementary school [Trentino-South Tyrol region]. Since the infection is transmitted via aerosol (through the droplets present in the water vapor), the use of the showers has been suspended and the air conditioning system closed.

The school management was informed on Friday [11 Oct 2021]. Since the _Legionella_ bacterium is transmitted through the inhalation of water vapor, as a precaution, the use of showers was suspended and the air conditioning system closed. Infection does not occur from person to person, nor by drinking water.

The health department has carried out water samples; the analyzes are still in progress.

_Legionella_ are bacteria present in natural and artificial aquatic environments and despite their ubiquitous nature, human disease is very rare. Risk factors can be advanced age, or cardiovascular, pneumological, and immunological diseases.

Legionellosis encompasses diseases caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. 2 forms of legionellosis are legionnaires' disease, a serious, potentially deadly, lung infection (that is, pneumonia), and Pontiac fever, a less serious infection with influenza-like symptoms, without pneumonia. We are told in the news report above that 2 cases of legionellosis occurred in the Sinigo elementary school, but details are missing. For example, did the 2 cases have legionnaires' disease or Pontiac fever; is Sinigo a boarding school; over what time-line did the 2 cases occur; how were the diagnoses established; has genotyping of any isolates been performed; and are the cases schoolchildren or school staff? More information on these 2 cases would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Legionellosis is very uncommon in children (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/965492-overview, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5654988/, and https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2010/03000/Neonatal_Legionellosis__The_Tip_of_the_Iceberg_for.26.aspx).

Although inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_ is the usual way the disease is acquired, debilitated patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water. ProMED previously reported aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated water as the source for neonatal legionnaires' disease that occurred following underwater birthing (ProMED post Legionellosis - UK: (England) neonatal, underwater birthing 20140708.2594991). Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described [Correia AM, Gonçalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc1505356; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Sinigo is a suburb located 4 km (2.5 mi) south of the center of the city of Merano (https://www.suedtirolerland.it/en/south-tyrol/merano-surroundings/merano/sinigo/). Merano (population, 41 051 residents in 2018) is the 2nd largest city in the province of Trentino-South Tyrol, or Alto Adige, in northeast Italy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol).
