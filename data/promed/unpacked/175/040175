Colorado officials have determined that whole cucumbers from Mexico were the "likely cause" of a small outbreak of _E. coli_ among Jimmy John's patrons in the Denver area in October 2013. "Prior to this outbreak, there have been no documented _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks associated with cucumbers in the United States," according to the report from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE], dated 4 Dec 2014. Officials from the department did not immediately respond 8 Dec 2014 for requests for comment on the report or investigation.

Colorado's investigation showed 9 people were infected with the same specific _E. coli_. All reported eating fresh cucumbers on sandwiches from 3 Jimmy John's locations in Denver. The cucumbers on the sandwiches were the only common food consumed by all 9 people, according to the report.

A Denver distributor, Colo-Pac Produce Inc., supplied whole, fresh cucumbers to the 3 restaurants, according to the Colorado report and Jim Garin, president of Colo-Pac. Garin said the report is correct that Colo-Pac bought the Mexican cucumbers from GR Produce Inc., McAllen, Texas.

Investigators did not find any handling violations at either the Jimmy John's locations or Colo-Pac Produce, according to the Colorado report. Rather, it says the whole cucumbers were likely contaminated in the field. It is the general practice of Colo-Pac to distribute cucumbers in the boxes they are received in, Garin said, without repacking.

"Our investigation found no evidence that would support that the cucumbers became contaminated at the Denver-based produce distributor Colo-Pac Produce Inc. or during shipment to the implicated Jimmy John's locations," according to the Colorado agency's report.

[This outbreak was reported in June 2014 at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists meeting in Nashville, TN (https://cste.confex.com/cste/2014/webprogram/Paper3228.html). The abstract is reproduced below:

"Background: US outbreaks of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 (ECO157) have been associated with produce including leafy greens and sprouts, but not cucumbers. In October 2013, ECO157 cases with a history of consuming sandwiches from 3 locations of a sandwich restaurant chain (Chain A) prompted a public health investigation.

Methods: All cases were defined as Colorado residents with onset of symptoms in October 2013 after dining at Chain A. Confirmed cases had a laboratory confirmed ECO157 infection with the outbreak multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis pattern. Probable cases had post-diarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) with positive ECO157 serology. We conducted case finding, 2 case-control studies (Study I and II), an environmental investigation, produce traceback, and laboratory testing. Case finding occurred via routine public health surveillance methods. Study I assessed restaurant exposures; attempts were made to enroll 3 age-, sex-, and neighborhood-matched controls per case using sequential digit dialing. Study II assessed Chain A food exposures; online and phone order records were used to recruit controls who purchased food from the same locations on the same dates as cases. Environmental investigations were conducted at 3 Chain A locations and the common produce distributor. Produce records were obtained to conduct a traceback. The state public health laboratory tested food and environmental samples from Chain A and the produce distributor.

Results: One probable and 8 confirmed cases were identified. Cases ate sandwiches at 3 Chain A locations on 5, 6, 7, and 9 Oct 2013. Case median age was 23 years; 78 percent were female; 1 was hospitalized with HUS; all survived. 8 cases and 12 controls were enrolled in Study I; consuming food from Chain A was associated with illness (OR=undefined, p=0.00007). 8 cases and 112 controls were enrolled in Study II; consuming cucumbers from Chain A was associated with illness (OR=undefined, p=0.0016); no other food items were statistically associated with illness. The environmental investigations found no obvious cause of contamination. Produce traceback conducted by CDPHE determined that the 3 Chain A locations received a common lot of imported cucumbers; no other food items had a common source. ECO157 was not recovered in food or environmental samples; however, samples of the implicated cucumbers were not available for testing.

Conclusions: The likely cause of this outbreak was imported cucumbers served at Chain A. Cucumbers are a novel vehicle for ECO157 transmission. Public health and food safety agencies should be aware that cucumbers can be contaminated with ECO157."

The following report: UM Abdul-Raouf, LR Beuchat, and MS Ammar: Survival and growth of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 on salad vegetables. Appl Environ Microbiol. 1993; 59(7): 1999-2006, had previously reported that _E. coli_ O157:H7 could experimentally survive and replicate on cucumbers and lettuce. Interestingly, the same observation was not made for carrots. - Mod.LL
