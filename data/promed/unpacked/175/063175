Translation of information received on 11 Jun 2002 from Dr Bernardo
Gabriel Cane, President, National Agrifood Health and Quality Service
(SENASA), Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food,
Buenos Aires:
End of previous report period: 5 Jun 2002 (see Disease Information,
15 [23], 91, dated 7 Jun 2002).
End of this report period: 11 Jun 2002.
The President of the SENASA, Dr B.G. Cane, hereby states, under the
heading "There is no foot and mouth disease in Carmen of Patagones",
that the analyses carried out in the official Central Laboratory of
SENASA, have proved negative, and that the suspicion of foot and
mouth disease (FMD) reported in the Department of Carmen de Patagones
can therefore be ruled out.
The analysis conducted by the official Central Laboratory of SENASA
gave negative results. It should be emphasised that the typing of
field samples by ELISA test, the 3 transfers through BHK cells, the
inoculation into unweaned mice and the analysis of 30 sera by
3ABC/EITB ELISA test, carried out on 5, 7, 10, and 11 Jun 2002, were
all negative.
In relation to the animals concerned, the situation within the
establishment remains stable; all the establishments in the
surrounding area have been inspected, and no evidence of FMD has been
found.
SENASA states that the last FMD outbreak was eradicated on 25 Jan
2002. The 3 vaccination campaigns carried out between April 2001 and
May 2002 have achieved total vaccination coverage of the national
herd with the distribution of more than 178 million doses of
oil-based vaccine.
Furthermore, the development of the animal health situation in
Argentina is such that the OIE International Committee, during its
70th General Session, approved by a unanimous decision of its 162
Member Countries, to restore the status of "zone free from FMD
without vaccination" to the part of the Patagonia Region located
south of parallel 42 degrees south.

[Some caution in evaluating the situation in Argentina is warranted.
In the 2000 outbreak, a 3-member delegation was sent to Argentina to
clarify the situation when they had a probang positive A24 strain
positive test, but it was deemed to be only isolated incursion of
animals and appropriate control measures were taken. A major outbreak
requiring mass vaccination occurred 6 months later.
The last reported outbreak was in Patagonia when they discovered 25
new cases last August. Any new outbreaks would obviously be a blow
to restoring normalcy in this very important industry. The suspicion
of FMD reported in the 6 Jun 2002 report was based on clinical signs.
Vesicular diseases of cattle are indistinguishable clinically, so it
is impossible to tell whether a lesion is due to Foot and Mouth
Disease or Vesicular Stomatitis etc. If the 55 calves in the first
report didn't have FMD, it would be very useful to know what disease
these cattle actually had. - Mod.PC]
