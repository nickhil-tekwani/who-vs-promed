Salmonella has been found in the pig feed Yhdistelma-Tiiviste
(protein concentrate) from the Rehuraisio Oy factory in Raisio. The
salmonella found is suspected to be of the same strain of _Salmonella
Tennessee_ as the strain previously detected on 2 egg production
farms and in the poultry feed protein concentrate Kanatiiviste Herkku.

Rehuraisio's cleaning and sanitation measures are being extended to
include the whole factory. During this time, no feed will be
delivered to farms from the establishment.

The authorities are taking fecal and feed samples from all the pig
and poultry farms to which feed produced on the Raisio factory line 7
had been delivered subsequent to 15 Jan 2009 (Kanatiiviste-Herkku,
Yhdistelma-tiiviste, Mami-Tiiviste, Mami-Herkku super, Poikas-Herkku,
Super-Mami puolitiiviste, Kanavilja-Herkku, Kana-Herkku Profit,
Sian-Herkku Tiiviste). These feeds have also been produced on the
other lines, but the sampling that is now beginning does not concern
them. More information is available from the sales personnel at Rehuraisio.

The farms can continue using the feeds until they get replacement feeds.

The investigation into the distribution of salmonella found in the
poultry feed produced by Raisio Feed Ltd. is likely to take weeks.
According to preliminary estimates, at least 26 poultry farms have
received contaminated feed, but, through agricultural trading,
further small farms may also have received the faulty product.

In February 2009, layer chickens on 3 egg-producing farms in Western
Finland were discovered to be carrying salmonella. Poultry feed from
Raisio Feed Ltd. was soon defined as the source of the infection.

In cooperation with Raisio Feed Ltd., the Finnish Food Safety
Authority EVIRA will go through the list of the possibly contaminated
delivered consignments, after which inspectors will collect stool
specimens of chicken from the farms in question.

As a precautionary measure, the delivered feed consignments will be
collected and replaced with clean products. The feed production line
will also be disinfected.

This week will definitely be spent collecting samples. After that,
the analysis of each sample will take around 4 days at the EVIRA lab.
The entire project will take weeks, estimates the head of the unit,
Kaija Varimo, from EVIRA.

If salmonella is found from any of the farms, their chicken will be
disposed of and the eggs will be prevented from entering the market.

According to Varimo, many Finnish farms have been insured against
salmonella outbreaks. The salmonella insurance was introduced after
the 1995 epidemic. Farms using approved feed can be granted such insurance.

Raisio Feed Ltd., in turn, will see to the product liability side of
things by providing farms with new feed consignments to replace the
faulty ones.

Finland has around 900 layer chicken farms. Last week, salmonella was
found at 3 of them. Initially, the plan was to withdraw the farms'
eggs from the market, but then it was decided that the eggs did not
present a danger to consumers.

These are Finland's 1st salmonella cases this side of the millennium,
and the 1st-ever cases involving Raisio Feed's products. Up to 10 per
cent of the feed raw material may be contaminated, but, normally, any
germs are eliminated in the production process.

The discovered salmonella bacteria are suspected of having ended up
in the manufacturer's Kanatiiviste product from foreign soy grind.

According to Varimo, the feed used by layer farms differs from the
feed aimed at broiler farms. Eating chicken is, therefore, safe.
Also, the eggs available in shops in Finland are safe to be consumed,
even when raw.

[Finland's Salmonella Control Programme in production animals and
products of animal origin, already operational for several decades,
is known as very efficient. The EU accepted it officially in 1995.
The programme concerns live cattle, swine and poultry, fresh meat of
cattle, swine and poultry and eggs (the part concerning poultry has
been revised in 2005). Feed control is a major part of the programme.

The programme requires notification of all serotypes, aiming at
maintaining the very low prevalence of salmonella. As of 2007, about
40 municipal or commercial laboratories were approved to do the
analyses. The need for such a large number was explained by the long
distances (about 1300 km from Helsinki to Utsjoki). All the suspected
isolates have to be sent to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL).

We have received from a Finnish subscriber (Pauli Kuoppamaki
<pauli.kuoppamaki@yx2.fi>) media-derived information stating that
during the cleanup of the salmonella-contaminated plant, wild birds
were allegedly found to be infected with Newcastle disease virus. The
cited source was the daily Turun Sanomat of 11 Mar 2009 (in Finnish).
Confirmation of this information, or its denial, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
