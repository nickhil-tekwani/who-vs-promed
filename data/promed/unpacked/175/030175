Taiwan to resume vaccinations on hogs to fight foot-and-mouth disease
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Taiwan will begin from 1 Aug 2009 giving every hog aged between 12 to
14 weeks vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the Bureau
of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ)
announced Friday [31 Jul 2009].

BAPHIQ Deputy Director General Huang Kuo-ching said that the measure
was taken to prevent the disease virus from spreading after 7
outbreaks have been reported from hog farms in the Yunlin, Changhua,
Chiayi, Pingtung, Taoyuan and Hsinchu areas since February 2009. The
sporadic cases indicated that the virus had not been completely
destroyed following eradication efforts in the aftermath of an
outbreak in 1997, Huang said.

The resumption of vaccination means that the day for Taiwan to be
listed as a fully FMD-free country will not come in the short run, he
added. Taiwan has been working to become a fully FMD-free country
after it was recognized by the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) as an "FMD-free country with vaccination" thanks to its efforts
to eliminate the disease since the 1997 outbreak.

Huang stated that 90 percent of the hogs around the country have
never been given shots of an anti-FMD vaccine since 2005, when the
vaccination was fully stopped in efforts to seek Taiwan's FMD-free
status. As a result, 78 percent of Taiwan's existing hogs were found
with no antibodies against the FMD virus, Huang said, noting that
this is believed to be the major reason behind the recent outbreaks.

Tests, moreover, have shown that resistance against FMD in the pig
populations has dropped, according to Huang. These signs showed a
spread of the disease virus in domestic hog farms, Huang said.

Meanwhile, the animal inspection bureau has also found that only 3 of
7 FMD cases this year were reported to the authorities by local
breeders or veterinarians voluntarily, while the other cases were
only exposed during the bureau's surprise inspections.

The reluctance of hog breeders to immediately report outbreaks
inhibits the bureau in its efforts to eliminate the source of
infections as soon as outbreaks occur, Huang said.

[OIE applies 4 categories for countries recognised as free of FMD; those are:
1. FMD free where vaccination is not practised
2. FMD free where vaccination is practised
3. FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised
4. FMD free zone where vaccination is practised

The currently listed countries or zones are presented at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/Status/FMD/en_fmd_free.htm>.

Taiwan ('Chinese Taipei' in OIE's terminology) was recognised in May
2004 as an "FMD free Member where vaccination is practised." However,
in February 2009, Taiwan reported 2 outbreaks of FMD type O in the
states of Yun-Lin and Chang-Hua. These were the 1st outbreak of FMD
in Taiwan since 2001. Consequently, the recognition of Chinese Taipei
as FMD free with vaccination was suspended with effect from 18 Feb
2009. In order to achieve eradication of the FMD virus and regain the
FMD-freedom status, Chinese Taipei uses non-vaccinated pigs as
sentinel animals on every farm. However it seems that the vaccination
coverage has not been optimal, leading to the appearance of new
outbreaks in a steadily increasing rate. The current decision to
intensify vaccination seems to be undertaken in order to remedy the
observed deterioration. - Mod.AS]
