Sri Lanka: WHO team sent to investigate mystery disease
-------------------------------------------------------
A special World Health Organization (WHO) team is due here shortly to assist
Sri Lankan specialists trying to combat a mystery illness which has hit the
Badulla and Moneragala areas. The disease, which has symptoms of chest pain,
breathlessness, and accelerated heartbeat, is so far believed to have
afflicted 184 persons in the region with 64 confirmed cases.
The Health Ministry in the meantime has requested the public not to panic,
saying all precautions have been taken to combat the disease. Health
authorities yesterday assured that all possible preventive measures were in
place to combat an affliction suspected to be "myocarditis" which was
spreading in the Badulla and Moneragala districts. However, health
authorities are yet to confirm the cause and other reasons leading to the
disease.
An official said a team of specialists have been sent to assist the Badulla
Hospital staff. "Another team comprising epidemiologists and virologists have
inspected hospitals in Badulla and its surroundings and samples obtained from
the patients were brought to Colombo for further testing," an official said.
A total of 184 patients suffering from this health ailment have been reported
from Badulla and Moneragala districts. "Of these, there are 64 confirmed
cases while others are considered as suspected cases," an official said. The
symptoms of the disease include difficulty in breathing, chest pain and high
palpitation. 8 confirmed cases are being treated at the Badulla Hospital and
6 others at the Cardiology Unit of the Colombo National Hospital
(CNH). "These patients are undergoing special medical tests at the CNH and if
necessary, they will be referred to laboratories of private hospitals for any
other additional research," the official said. A separate ward has also been
set up at the Badulla Hospital for patients suffering from the disease and in
the future, all new patients suspected of suffering from it will be admitted
to this ward.
Meanwhile, the WHO has expressed willingness to extend its assistance to deal
with the emergency. Following a discussion at the Health Ministry, WHO's
Representative in Sri Lanka Dr. Kan Tun has agreed to provide drugs to treat
the patients. "A special WHO team will be arriving in Sri Lanka shortly to
assess the situation here and assist in medical research. This team will
comprise doctors, virologists, epidemiologists etc," the official added.
