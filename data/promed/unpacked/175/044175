Would the distribution of vaccine-containing bait be an option for Nepal,
or are the numbers (costs and logistics) for an oral vaccination program
prohibitive?

I would like the ProMED-mail readers to know that tissue culture vaccines
namely Purified Chick Embryo Vaccine (PCEC known as Rabipur) and Purified
Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (PVRV or Verorab) are expensive but available in
the major towns in Nepal particularly in Kathmandu. Human Rabies Immune
Globulin has also been consistently made available in Kathmandu from our
clinic. For the average Nepali, this treatment is very expensive. The
problem is that government facilities only stock and use the nervous tissue
vaccine made from sheep brain. It is time to move to producing tissue
culture vaccines for widespread use in the country besides rabies control
in dogs and control of stray dog population.

Once again, Latin-American cities, with much larger population than those
in Nepal, eradicated dog rabies with comprehensive control PROGRAMMES.
Political decisions are needed to reach this goal and they rest on the
Health Authorities.
