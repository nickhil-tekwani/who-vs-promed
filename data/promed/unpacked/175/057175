Avian Influenza in Korea (Democratic People's Republic of ~)
---------------------------------------------
Immediate notification
Information received on 7 and 8 Apr 2005 from Dr Ri Gyong Gun, Director of
the Veterinary and Anti-Epizootic Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Pyongyang:
Report date: 5 Apr 2005.
Reason for immediate notification: first occurrence of a listed disease (1)
in the country.
Precise identification of agent: avian influenza virus type A subtype H7.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 26 Mar 2005.
Date of start of the event: 25 Feb 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Diagnosis:
Laboratories where diagnosis was made / Diagnostic tests used
- Laboratory of the Pyongyang Poultry General Complex / haemagglutination
- Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory / haemagglutination inhibition
- Institute of the Cells and Gene Engineering, Academy of National Sciences
/ ELISA(2); PCR(3).
Source of outbreak: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- control of arthropods;
- control of wildlife reservoirs;
- partial stamping out;
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- vaccination;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s).
Vaccination in response to the outbreak:
Poultry farm / Total number of vaccinated birds / Details of the vaccine
Hadang / 255 570 / inactivated virus vaccine
Sopo / 283 531 / inactivated virus vaccine
Mangyongdae / 562 199 / inactivated virus vaccine
Treatment of affected animals: no.
Additional details:
Respiratory distress syndrome was observed among the chickens in one of the
blocks (the block has a capacity of 19 000 to 24 000) of the Hadang poultry
farm, notably when there was a build-up of poisonous fumes in the block
caused by a power failure that occurred during the night of 23 to 24 Feb
2005. Air vents were opened to improve ventilation and provide fresh air,
but from the next day some layers began to die.
Samples were sent for examination to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory
of the Pyongyang Poultry General Complex on 28 Feb 2005 and strict
anti-epizootic measures were taken.
The Diagnostic Laboratory of the General Complex conducted tests between 28
Feb and 5 Mar 2005 but was unable to identify the precise cause of the
disease. It then informed the National Veterinary and Anti-epizootic
Emergency Committee and sent samples and isolates to the Central Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory.
The National Veterinary and Anti-epizootic Emergency Committee organised
the incineration and burying of all the chickens in the infected blocks
and, with a view to identifying the disease, authorised the Central
Laboratory to inject all the chickens in the unaffected blocks and in
neighbouring chicken farms with an inactivated vaccine obtained by
inoculating eggs with material from internal organs of dead chickens into
embryonated eggs.
The Central Laboratory conducted general examinations several times between
5 and 15 Mar 2005, but was unable to obtain a definite identification of
the virus subtype due to the lack of standard sera and suitable testing
kits, but was able to confirm that the disease was influenza type A.
With the help of Government measures, tests continued and the virus subtype
was eventually confirmed, using the PCR(3) technique, as avian influenza
virus subtype H7 at the Institute of Cell and Gene Engineering, National
Academy of Sciences, on 26 Mar 2005.
The disease outbreak could eventually be officially announced in the
country on 27 Mar 2005.
Tests are currently under way to determine the N subtype of the virus.
On or around 5 Mar 2005, an outbreak of the disease also occurred at the
neighbouring Sopo and Mangyongdae chicken farms, which proved to be caused
by the same subtype that affected the Hadang chicken farm.
At Hadang chicken farm a total of over 151 968 layer chickens in the eight
blocks were destroyed. At the Sopo and Mangyongdae farms the damage was
less extensive thanks to the vaccination that had already been conducted,
only three blocks with a total of 51 820 chickens being lost at Sopo and
only a single block with over 15 000 chickens being lost at Mangyongdae
poultry farm.
A total of over 218 882 chickens were culled and buried during the disease
outbreaks. No clinical signs of the disease have been detected since 7 Mar
2005.
All the necessary anti-epizootic measures have been taken, including a ban
on movements into and out of the affected area, in accordance with the
provisions of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. There has been great
awareness of the disease among the human population in the affected area.
Public health surveillance has been stepped up, especially for those
involved in the destruction and burying of infected chickens. To date there
have been no reported cases of human infection.
Investigations are under way throughout the country to try to determine the
full extent of infection in poultry farms and in various wild bird populations.
As this disease event was one of the first of its kind ever to have
occurred in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it took some time to
make the correct diagnosis. The inexperience of the veterinary experts, the
inadequate facilities and apparatus and the lack of reagents, such as
standard sera, caused by the country's recent economic difficulties had a
negative effect on the conduct and timing of the diagnostic procedures.
The anti-epizootic measures taken on this occasion to eradicate the disease
were in accordance with the technical standards of the OIE, but the lack of
facilities such as reagents, apparatus and standard sera resulted in poor
identification of virus subtype H7, though it was diagnosed as H7 by PCR(3)
analysis at the Veterinary Institute of the Academy of Agricultural
Sciences and the Institute of Cell and Gene Engineering, Academy of
National Sciences.
On 4 Apr 2005, an FAO(4) expert visiting the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea initially confirmed the virus as subtype H7.
(1) Note by the Animal Health Information Department: the listed disease is
suspected to be highly pathogenic avian influenza
(2) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(3) PCR: polymerase chain reaction

[This report raises many questions and makes for fascinating
reading. Vaccination is the big issue, and while inactivated vaccine is
mentioned in this report, safety and efficacy procedures for the
preparation of the vaccine are not detailed, and the obvious lack of
resources in the country could cause problems. The importance of ensuring
the vaccine is adequately inactivated is addressed by Mod.AS in "Avian
influenza, H7 - North Korea" 20050405.0978.
Furthermore, details of surveillance -- to be sure spread from the original
locus in Hadang -- are also not given. The power failure is most likely a
coincidence, as every epidemiologist recognizes that unusual, unrelated
events do sometimes occur in tandem. The North Korean animal health
authorities are to be congratulated for their efforts at
transparency. Rapid communications through such means as frequent OIE
updates or Ministry of Agriculture reports would be another important step
forward. - Mod.PC]
