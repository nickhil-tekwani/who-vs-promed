The whole village in Mulugu district is suffering with a mysterious disease. A total of 6 people died within a period of 20 days. All the people who died with this disease suffered with fever, bloating, and vomiting with blood. Even the doctors are not able to find the reason behind these mysterious deaths. Even after testing the people with various tests, they are not able to find about the disease.

Six people have died with this strange disease in Muppanapalli village in Kannai Goodem zone of Mulugu district. Panicked people are leaving the village. In just 2 days, 3 members of the same family died of a mysterious disease, and 3 members of 2 other families died.

With the rapid spread of this disease, the villagers are moving to other areas, fearing that something had harmed their village due to fever, bloating, and death the next day. Upon learning of the strange disease [and] deaths, paramedics conducted a medical camp in the village. A total of 72 people were tested for dengue, malaria, typhoid, and coronavirus.

So far, 72 people have undergone medical tests, district medical health officer Appaya said. He explained that special medical teams are trying to bring the situation under control. No one needs to worry, the DMHO said, adding that pollution was the cause. Contaminated water [has been] sent to the lab for testing.
