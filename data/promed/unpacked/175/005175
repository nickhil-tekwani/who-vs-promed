Genetic sequencing on the H5N1 avian flu virus from birds in Nigeria
show it is virtually the same as that found in fowl in China and
Turkey, a scientist said on Friday [10 Feb 2006].
A laboratory in Padua, Italy carried out the test on behalf of 2
international agencies dealing with the outbreaks in animals, the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE).
The H5N1 virus was found in dead poultry in northern Nigeria, the 1st
time it has been detected in Africa after spreading across Asia and
along the Black Sea.
"It is virtually identical to the [virus affecting] birds in Qinghai
Lake, China and the chickens in Turkey," Ilaria Capua, who carried
out the genetic sequencing at the Padua laboratory, told Reuters.
"This is the full sequence of one sample," she added.
The World Health Organisation [WHO] has said that the viruses from
Turkey's first 2 fatal human cases were virtually identical to
viruses from Qinghai Lake nature reserve in central China, where
there was an unprecedented die-off of 6000 migratory birds in April 2005.

A senior scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on
Friday that a limited number of migratory birds appear to be
spreading a single sub-strain of the H5N1 virus, a potentially
positive discovery.
In theory, this could lower opportunities for the lethal H5N1 virus
to mutate into an easily transmissible form which could spark a human
influenza pandemic, according to Michael Perdue, an epidemiologist in
WHO's global influenza programme.
Scientists are increasingly convinced that some migratory waterfowl
carry the lethal virus in its highly pathogenic form, introducing it
to poultry flocks along their routes.
4 family groups of the H5N1 virus have been identified, with multiple
substrains within each, but it appeared that only one was "moving
westward," Perdue said.
"We are looking at what I think is probably limited (migratory bird)
species that are infected with what appears to be a single sub-strain
of the Asian viruses," he told reporters.
"That is better news than thinking all the birds are spreading the
virus all over the world -- that's not happening. In that sense, it's
not as grim perhaps as it looks," he said.
Perdue later told Reuters: "It could reduce the mutation level... You
are less likely to have widespread mutation than if you had 20
strains hop-scotching across Asia."
"It also appears that this virus is relatively stable."
The WHO has said that the viruses from Turkey's 1st 2 fatal human
cases were virtually identical to viruses from Qinghai Lake nature
reserve in central China, where there was an unprecedented die-off of
6000 migratory birds in April 2005.
Perdue, who led the WHO team in Romania during poultry outbreaks in
2005 and played a key role in its investigations into Turkey's recent
human cases, announced a WHO team is going to Nigeria where the virus
has been found in poultry.
Genetic sequencing of the virus found in chickens in northern
Nigeria, completed late on Friday, showed it also closely matched
that in poultry outbreaks in Turkey and China [see reported above].
"Thus far we have no evidence of any human infections, but it
represents our fears that this virus is perhaps being carried by
migratory waterfowl," he said of Africa's most populous nation.
The H5N1 virus had progressed through Asia, Central Asia, Kazakhstan,
Russia, Mongolia, Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, Iraq and "now down into
Africa", he said.
"It is problematic that we are seeing such an extension from China of
apparently this same virus. On the other hand, it appears to be a
single sub-strain that is being spread. In other words, we are not
spreading all the viruses of southeast Asia all over Asia and Europe," he said.
"It is very difficult to predict without knowing anything about the
ecology of these migrating birds where the virus is going to show up
next," he added.
Substrains of avian viruses can dominate for one year, then be
supplanted the next, according to the American expert.
"It is very difficult to say. The virus might go away tomorrow,
frankly, and we might not see any more infections."

The influenza virus very often spreads through the movement of
affected birds, FAO/OIE said. Therefore the movement of poultry
should be stopped immediately in order to contain the disease. People
should not buy or trade poultry or poultry products from infected
regions. FAO /OIE therefore today called upon veterinary authorities
in Nigeria to immediately close down poultry markets throughout
Kaduna and Kano state and neighbouring regions to prevent the further
spread of the deadly bird flu virus.
Countries surrounding Nigeria (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger
and Togo) should increase surveillance and import control measures,
the 2 organisations said in a joint statement.
Priority measures include: appropriate culling respecting OIE
standards in and around outbreak spots, ring vaccination around
infected areas, the control of people and livestock moving to and
from outbreak zones, thorough disinfection, hygiene and good farming
practices. Only vaccines that fulfill OIE international quality
standards should be used.
FAO and OIE welcomed the emergency measures applied in Kaduna, Kano
and Plateau state, where suspected bird flu cases in poultry are
under investigation. However, control measures need to be intensified
applying standard procedures recommended by FAO and the OIE
international guidelines.
FAO/OIE welcomed a statement by the Nigerian Minister of Agriculture
Mallam A. Bello that farmers would be compensated for livestock
losses caused by the disease and culling. Compensation schemes are
useful to encourage early disease reporting.
Veterinary staff and technicians working in outbreak areas and
laboratories should wear protective clothing. FAO and the US
Department of Agriculture are shipping over 1000 sets of protective
gear to Nigeria.
FAO/OIE will field a joint mission to Nigeria within 48 hours to
reinforce the FAO veterinary team already on the ground. The mission
will assess the situation and will advise on emergency measures and needs.

[Those interested in programs addressing the epidemiology of avian
influenza in wild birds, particularly if related to Europe, may refer
to the following 4 presentations which were made by different experts

bird migration; refs 2 and 4 include collected virological data from
wild birds):

New studies into the epidemiology of H5N1, authored by 28
investigators from China (Guandong, Fujian), Hong-Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia, USA and Vietnam, have been published yesterday (10 Feb
2006) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the
United States of America (PNAS), as an online paper before print. See
"Establishment of multiple sublineages of H5N1 influenza virus in
Asia: Implications for pandemic control" by H. Chen, G. J. D. Smith,
K. S. Li et al. Abstract accessible at
<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0511120103v1>).
The said abstract includes the following statement: "Our data show
that H5N1 influenza virus has continued to spread from its
established source in southern China to other regions through
transport of poultry and bird migration. The identification of
regionally distinct sublineages contributes to the understanding of
the mechanism for the perpetuation and spread of H5N1, providing
information that is directly relevant to control of the source of
infection in poultry. It points to the necessity of surveillance that
is geographically broader than previously supposed and that includes
H5N1 viruses of greater genetic and antigenic diversity."
The findings and the said statement confirm that, in addition to
migratory bird flyways as a plausible route for the spread of H5N1,
possible other routes are not to be overlooked. In this respect,
data on imports of poultry (short-distance poultry for slaughter,
long-distance breeding material) from infected countries, as well as
possible (illegal?) trade in captive birds, are to be taken into
consideration, prescribing the needed control activities. Wild birds
cannot be controlled nor eliminated; their contact with domestic
poultry, and human-regulated international movements of infected
animals/products, should be prevented and deserve appropriate
international support. - Mod.AS]
