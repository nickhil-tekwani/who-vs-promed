The 2015 kinnow [mandarin] yield was markedly low compared to previous years because of various plant diseases that plagued citrus orchards in the Punjab, Kinnow Growers' Association's Hamid Saleem Warraich said.

"Citrus canker, one of the most devastating plant diseases, spread like wild fire across the kinnow production belt." He said farmers had to bear the brunt of the damage. "Almost 64 per cent of citrus fruit grown in the Punjab is kinnow." Several commercial citrus varieties were highly susceptible to the disease, and kinnow was the most vulnerable. He requested the government to conduct thorough research and look for solutions to prevent citrus canker.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_). The disease originated in Asia but is now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide, except Australia, where an outbreak was successfully eradicated (ProMED-mail post 20090206.0528). CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_. A number of different strains (pathovars) specialise in infecting different hosts to cause bacterial blights in, for example, pomegranate and onion. CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected, it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacterium can be transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material but may also include bactericidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves that can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry may also be used to reduce CC incidence.

In Pakistan, an outbreak of citrus canker in this area was reported initially in early 2015 in orange groves (ProMED-mail post 20150415.3298470). It is not surprising that kinnow mandarins (_Citrus nobilis_ x _C. deliciosa_ hybrid) and other citrus crops would also be affected.

A group of strains of the related _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ originating in South America causes a similar disease in some locations, but it is much less widespread and of lower economic significance.
