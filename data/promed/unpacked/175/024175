Tests confirm H5N1 in Romania's dead chicken
-----------------------------------------------
A dead chicken found in eastern Romania about 2 weeks ago has tested
positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu virus, Romanian Agriculture
Minister Gheorghe Flutur said on Saturday [10 Dec 2005].
The chicken was found dead in the small village of Scarlatesti in Braila
county, eastern Romania on 26 Nov 2005. It was sent to a British laboratory
for further tests after it was found to have a form of avian flu.
The chief of Braila county has decided to order a new round of quarantine
in the village to prevent new bird flu outbreaks.
Scarlatesti village was the 1st place to have detected bird flu in Braila
county, and its local residents had slaughtered all their 11 883 poultry by
27 Nov 2005 and have received 2.8 billion leus (USD 93 300) in compensation
from the government.
4 other villages or towns in Braila have also reported bird flu cases. They
are now waiting for test results from the British laboratory.
The local governments of Braila and Tulcea counties, both in eastern
Romania, have distributed 7.5 billion leus (USD 250 000) in relief funds
for the villagers, whose poultry businesses have been affected by the flu.
The Romanian government has ordered all poultry to be confined and dead
ones to be handed over to the health department. It decided on Thursday [8
Dec 2005] to impose stiff fines on villagers who defy the orders.
Romania is the 1st European country to have detected the deadly H5N1 virus
in poultry. So far, it has not reported any human case of bird flu.

Romania detects new suspected avian flu cases
-----------------------------------------------
Romania detected on Sunday [11 Dec 2005] 5 new suspected cases of avian flu
in domestic birds in Buzau county west of the Danube delta, where the
deadly virus was 1st isolated in October 2005, officials said.
Avian flu has been found in birds in more than a dozen villages in and
around the Danube delta, Europe's largest wetlands, which lie on a major
migratory route for wild birds.
4 outbreaks have been confirmed as the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain.
Nicolae Stefan, head of the Animal Health and Diagnosis Institute, told
Reuters that tests on samples taken from dead poultry in the village of
Padina showed the presence of bird flu.
"Rapid tests indicated the H5 virus in a hen and 4 ducks," Stefan said. "We
hope to isolate the virus tonight [Sun 11 Dec 2005]. After it's isolated,
we will send the samples to London."
Romania has no capabilities to test for H5N1.
Authorities quarantined Padina and started to cull domestic birds in the
affected household and its vicinity. Padina lies 10 km (6.2 miles) west of
the village of Ciocile, where the disease was also detected earlier this
month [December 2005].
On Friday [9 Dec 2005], tests on an infected turkey confirmed the deadly
H5N1 strain in the small village of Scarlatesti in Braila county, some 110
km west of the area where the virus was 1st detected in birds in the Danube
delta.
The results showed the disease had spread to birds on the fringes of more
populated regions of Romania. Scarlatesti, a village of 1000 farmers in an
area of lakes, lies close to a number of towns. It is 170 km from the
capital Bucharest.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, where
it has killed 70 people.
It remains hard for people to catch, but there are fears it could mutate
into a form which passes easily from person to person, sparking a pandemic
in which millions could die. There have been no cases of human infection
outside of Asia.
