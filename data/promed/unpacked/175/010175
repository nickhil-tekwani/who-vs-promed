More Vaccinations Planned, New Measles Cases Suspected
------------------------------------------------------
A total of 2 more people are suspected of having measles after health
officials announced Wed 23 Feb 2011 that a woman who works in Boston
was diagnosed with the illness. The two new cases are in Boston,
according to the Boston Public Health Commission.

"One is a person who frequented restaurants around that building, and
the other is a person who lives right near the case," said Dr. Anita
Barry of the Boston Public Health Commission (BHP).

The woman, who is in her 20s, is a French consulate worker in Boston.
She likely contracted the virus overseas and is now recovering at
home, health officials said. "She is not contagious anymore. She is
fine, and the Boston Public Health Commission cleared her," said
Nathalie Bastin, spokeswoman for the French consulate.

Hundreds of people who may have been exposed were offered vaccines.
Everyone who works at the consulate must provide proof of vaccination
or remain quarantined at home until 3 Mar 2011. Symptoms of the
infection include cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis and fever,
followed a few days later by a signature rash, BPH officials said.
Health officials said anyone who visited the building between 7 Feb
2011 and 10 Feb 2011 10 may have been exposed. The woman also rode the
MBTA and visited three clinics while she was contagious, officials
said.

Nurses from the city health agency provided the measles vaccine to
some of the 1500 to 2000 workers in the Park Square Building who
haven't had the recommended two shots of protection against the
illness, which can prove lethal in rare cases.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that if
one person is stricken with measles, 90 percent of unvaccinated people
close to them will get sick.

Measles Case in Maricopa County
-------------------------------
If you're behind on your kid's vaccinations, health officials say now
is a good time to get caught up. There is a confirmed case of measles
in Maricopa County, and several cases in Pima County.

A man living in Maricopa County who recently traveled abroad has a
confirmed case of the measles. Symptoms of measles include head-to-toe
red spots on the body, red eyes, and coughing or a cold. It's a very
contagious virus. Health officials say the man spent time in public
places around town before finding out, and they're worried others may
be exposed.

Measles can be spread by coughing and sneezing, and can stay on
surfaces for several hours. Another big concern is the fact that some
parents are averse to vaccinating their children. "Obviously one of
the big things with the measles vaccine is the [now discounted] link
to autism.

The Department of Health Services says about 3 percent of school
children in Arizona have not been vaccinated against measles. Kids are
recommended to receive the vaccine once at age 1 and a 2nd time at age
4.

Department of Health Investigating Measles Case in New Mexico
Resident
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The New Mexico Department of Health announced today that it is
investigating a case of measles in Santa Fe County. The Department's
Scientific Laboratory Division confirmed the case in a 27-year-old
woman who was not immunized against the disease and had recently
returned from a trip overseas. The person is currently hospitalized.
This is the first confirmed measles case in New Mexico since 2008.

"We are working with the patient and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention to identify people who may have been exposed so we can
prevent more cases of the disease," said Secretary Designate of the
Department of Health Catherine Torres, MD. "This case should serve as
a reminder to all of us to keep our immunizations up to date --
especially when it comes to children. Immunizations are the best tool
we have to protect people from serious and potentially life
threatening diseases."

Measles is highly contagious and transmitted through the air. Early
symptoms of measles include: red eyes, fever, runny nose and cough.
Within a few days following the cough and runny nose, a rash will
begin on the face and spread down the body. Measles is diagnosed by a
combination of symptoms and laboratory testing.

The Department of Health has identified the following airline flight
the person was on while contagious: Southwest Airlines flight 2605
scheduled departure from Denver at 9:55pm and arriving at Albuquerque
Sunport at approximately 11:10pm on 22 Feb 2011. Passengers are
considered protected from measles infection if they were born before
1957, had measles in the past, or have received two doses of measles
vaccine.

People who may have been exposed to measles and develop an illness
should call their medical provider first to make arrangements to be
seen without exposing other patients to the virus. Signs and symptoms
of measles include an illness with fever, cough, runny nose, or pink
eye and the development of a rash.

Adults needing measles vaccine can contact their medical provider or
Nurse Advice New Mexico at 1-877-725-2552. Vaccines are free for any
child in New Mexico, regardless of insurance status, under the
Vaccines for Children program. Children who have no insurance
coverage can get the vaccine at their local public health office.
Infants under one year of age, pregnant women, or immunocompromised
individuals who were exposed to the measles patient may need to
receive other medications to protect them.

Medical providers should report suspect cases of measles to the
Department of Health's Epidemiology and Response Division.

[According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and

a 27-year-old New Mexico woman unknowingly infected with measles
arrived at Gate C39 at about 9 p.m. Tuesday [22 Feb 2011] and stayed
in the area for 2 hours. She then departed aboard Southwest flight

Auckland Regional Public Health Service press release
-----------------------------------------------------
The Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) reports 2 more
people confirmed with measles this week with another likely to be
confirmed. In addition, 5 people are under investigation for measles.
This brings the latest number of people with confirmed measles to 18.

One of the people confirmed with measles was on board the Malaysian
Airlines Flight MH131 which flew from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland Airport
on Fri 18 Feb 2011

Medical Officer of Health Dr Sheryl Jury says a passenger list has
been requested from the airline for ARPHS to begin contacting
passengers seated around the person to assess their immunity. ARPHS
would like to let passengers from the flight know of the risk, in case
there is a delay and anyone is developing symptoms. Prompt
identification of measles helps to prevent it being spread to others.
If anyone has any concerns they may have contracted measles they can
contact Healthline or phone their doctor.

"Measles is a serious illness and one in 10 people with measles need
hospital treatment. ARPHS' role is contacting all the exposed people,
assessing whether they are susceptible to measles infection, and
providing public health advice including the need for isolation and
further immunisation.

"Given the current national emergency with the Christchurch
earthquake, it is particularly important that measles does not gain a
foothold," says Dr Jury.

Any passengers on Malaysian Airlines Flight MH131 who are unwell
should telephone their doctor or call Healthline for advice. It is
important to call 1st because measles is highly infectious and people
with measles can infect others in the waiting room.

Possible measles outbreak eyed in several towns in South Cotabato
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in South Cotabato [province] are studying the
possible declaration of a measles outbreak in several parts of the
province following the confirmation of at least 7 positive cases of
the disease in the area.

Cecil Lorenzo, disease surveillance officer of the Integrated
Provincial Health Office's epidemiology and surveillance unit (PESU),
said the positive cases of measles confirmed in the province were
clinically diagnosed by doctors and had undergone blood specimen
tests. "We're closely looking into the situation right now because
based on the DOH's (Department of Health) guidelines, a single
confirmed case of measles is considered alarming," she said.

Based on a report released by PESU, 3 cases of measles were confirmed
in Tampakan town and 2 cases each in Polomolok town and in Koronadal
City. Owing to this, PESU chief Dr. Salvecio Dagang said they are
currently intensifying their campaign on Garantisadong Pambata (GP)
program, which focuses on the massive immunization of infants and
children at the household level. The program is held every April and
October.

Dagang said their records showed that Tampakan town registered the
lowest GP turnout during the last several years. According to the
DOH's guidelines, a person who had not been vaccinated should be given
vaccine shot regardless of age to cut the vicious cycle of the measles
virus.

Dagang said measles in South Cotabato had been silent for several
years and the province was already preparing for the declaration of
the areas as measles-free when an outbreak occurred during the last
quarter of 2010.
