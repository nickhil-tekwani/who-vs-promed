Eastern equine encephalitis confirmed in Marion County horse
------------------------------------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE, Fla: State officials confirmed the first case of eastern
equine encephalitis virus (EEE) in Marion County on Friday, raising fears
about the fatal horse disease in Florida thoroughbred country. The 4 year
old thoroughbred mare displayed signs of the mosquito-carried disease,
which kills horses, on 13 May 2002. The horse was euthanized by a
veterinarian shortly thereafter.
Although extremely rare, the disease can infect humans as well. Last year,
a 9 year old boy from Panhandle died from EEE. Agriculture Secretary
Charles Bronson said the horse had been vaccinated against the disease, but
apparently hadn't had its booster shots. The horse was the eighth to be
confirmed with the disease this year in Florida, following another case
announced Thursday in Osceola County. Another mosquitoborne virus, West
Nile virus, has infected 7 horses in Florida this year.
Bronson urged owners to get their horses vaccinated for the diseases and
encouraged Florida residents to take precautions against mosquitoes after
dark, including avoiding outdoor activities, wearing long sleeves and
pants, and using mosquito repellant.

[Vaccine is cheap and effective protection. Horses do not need to die from
a disease that is easy and cheap to prevent. The protective titer is short
lived, about 6 months, and revaccination is recommended. The first
vaccination should be given, followed by a protective booster in 2 to 3
weeks and then at least a booster every 6 months in areas endemic with
these encephalitis diseases. West Nile virus vaccine can be given at the
same time, although not in the same injection. - Mod.TG]
