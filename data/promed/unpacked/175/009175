Update on the Hazard of vCJD Transmission by Blood & Blood Products
---------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 30 Sep 2001, the number of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail cases
diagnosed worldwide stood at 117, with 111 people in the United
Kingdom, 4 in France, and one each in Ireland and the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region of China (1). To date, no
epidemiological evidence suggests that vCJD has ever been transmitted
by blood transfusion or the use of plasma derivatives. A number of
studies in animals, however, have indicated that there is infectivity in
the blood in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease
models, suggesting the theoretical possibility of a vCJD risk from
human blood products.
The most recent report on this issue (2) described the precautionary
measures implemented by a number of countries. These precautionary
measures included deferring blood donors from countries with a
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)/vCJD risk. As evidence
accrued of BSE contamination in the food chain in other countries, the
possible extension of this policy was envisaged. With the increase in
BSE cases in several European countries recorded in 2000-2001 (3), the
United States Food and Drug Administration has proposed measures to
strengthen the criteria for deferral from 6 to 3 months spent in the
United Kingdom. Furthermore, other European countries are being
considered in the proposed revision for the deferral policies of
the United States.
The potential exclusion of plasma donors from European countries will
have substantial implications for the world supply of plasma products.
It is therefore encouraging that the growing level of evidence suggests
that plasma fractionation clears TSE strains [prions, including those
associated with vCJD, from final products.
BSE has now been reported in countries outside of the European
Community (i.e., Czech Republic, Japan, Slovakia, Slovenia). This
highlights the need to assess the origins of the BSE epidemic, which is
clearly associated with the use of BSE-contaminated meat and bone
meal and the recycling of infected animals into the animal feed chain.
Therefore, deferring blood donors on the basis of potential exposure to
BSE may result in endangering the supply of blood and blood
products. The need to balance known risks and product-supply
requirements against the possible risk of blood-transmitted vCJD
should be considered, as recommended in this article.
It is unlikely that there will be a blood test for vCJD in the near future.
Measures to avoid this theoretical risk in the blood supply will
therefore continue to be based on donor deferral. It is of particular
concern that in the developed world, where geographically based
deferrals have been implemented, the latter may have preferentially
excluded repeat blood donors. While it is still too early to assess the
long-term effects, it has been shown that losing a small number of such
repeat donors can have a very substantial effect on the overall blood
supply.
In the meantime, blood services should continue to focus their efforts
on providing adequate amounts of blood that is as safe as possible
regarding recognized risks of transfusion. In many areas of the world,
implementation of precautionary deferral measures for BSE /vCJD is
likely to decrease the number of dedicated and low-risk voluntary non-
remunerated blood donors, and thus increase the risk of transmission
of known infections.
Unless more evidence accrues to the contrary, except in areas where the
loss of safe donors can safely be offset, blood services should focus
their efforts on known transfusion-transmitted pathogens by providing
the appropriate donor selection and screening measures, which will
contribute most effectively to making blood safe.

[The message is that balanced risk assessments must be realistic and
consistent. The radical donor deferral policy of the US FDA sits
uneasily with recent blood safety violations by the American Red
Cross, which include release of some blood thought to be tainted with
cytomegalovirus, failure to properly turn away unsuitable donors,
including some with syphilis and others considered at high risk for the
AIDS virus, and computer errors that could cause the release of blood
before it has finished all safety testing (see AP report of 13 Aug 2001 at:
