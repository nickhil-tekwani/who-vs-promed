There are now a total of 31 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infections] in the Epuyen [Chubut province] outbreak. The positive cases during recent weeks were under observation and isolation. The numbers of cases of people under observation are reduced to 89.

The Chubut [province] Ministry of Health confirmed in its most recent official statement that there are now 31 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infections], while there are others who are currently under observation. The details of the information provided by the provincial health office explained that on [Fri 25 Jan 2019] an adult patient who had been convalescent from this disease was released from the Esquel Zone Hospital. Also, the same statement mentioned that a hantavirus infection positive patient was released from the intensive care unit in the same hospital and is convalescing in a ward in that hospital.

As an additional comment, the Ministry of Health also remarked the same [Fri 25 Jan 2019] that an adult patient, resident of the El Maiten locality [Chubut province] who was maintained under strict, supervised isolation at home, was later sent to the Esquel Zone Hospital and was confirmed positive for this disease, bringing to 31 the number of confirmed cases.

In the same statement, it was explained that during Friday afternoon [25 Jan 2019] there was notification of the admission of a patient under observation in the Sub Zonal Hospital in El Maiten and is currently under strict isolation.

In that respect, it also is worth clarifying that the measure of selective respiratory isolation effectively accomplished at home is continued, a measure pushed by the same Chubut Ministry of Health, that has reached 89 people.

Coordinated tasks
-----------------
Within the guidelines set by the Ministry of Health of Chubut, the Undersecretariat of Human Rights, under the Ministry of Government, coordinated a working day at the local Epuyen Cultural Center, where the different emerging issues of the health contingency affecting the locality were addressed. The proposal arose from attitudes and behaviors that show negative beliefs, as well as forms of stigma and discriminatory practices in the community that transcend the theme of health and have an impact on the lives of the people.

[The number of confirmed cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase. The last ProMED-mail post on 19 Jan 2019 (Hantavirus - Americas (06): Argentina (4 provinces) 20190123.6274142), reported that since the beginning of the epidemiological contingency (on 3 Dec 2018) in that province, there were 29 confirmed cases (27 in Esquel, one in Bariloche, and another in Chile), of which 11 died. The total case count given above is now 31. The current total of deaths is not mentioned in the report above. Except for the index case, the transmission that followed is presumed to be interpersonal and is the reason for isolation of potential contacts. As mentioned in the previous ProMED-mail post, interpersonal transmission of the current Andes hantavirus outbreak in Chubut is unusual. However, person to person transmission has happened before. Mod.PMB provided a reference that indicates that in 1996 there was an outbreak of Andes virus Epilink/96 variant in El Bolson, Rio Negro province, and that starting with the index case, a molecular analysis indicated that 15 cases occurred subsequently. Of these 16 patients, 9 died. Of the total cases, 8 probably became infected in a hospital environment, including 5 physicians (3 died) and a receptionist in a private clinic where 4 more cases occurred. The receptionist died. The data in this study suggest the possible existence of 3- and 4-person transmission chains, assuming that only one rodent-to-human transmission event occurred. It is prudent to see that the relevant agencies working in the area are addressing the social dimensions of this outbreak. There is a small population in this locality and it is easy to understand how this outbreak has sparked rumors and false information that can lead to socially adverse opinions, attitudes, and behaviors.

An additional study described 4 clusters of cases in Argentina with probable interpersonal transmission: the 1st a father to son, the 2nd in a rural family, the 3rd among 4 friends who shared a rural cabin, and the 4th a person in contact with another person who, in turn contacted a further person.

It is clear that interpersonal Andes hantavirus transmission occurs, although infrequently, more often than ProMED-mail has reported. - Mod.TY
