Influenza A (H1N1), Argentina
-----------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 01 Jul 2009 from Dr Jorge Nestor Amaya,
presidente, Presidencia, Senasa, Buenos Aires, Argentina

Summary
Report type: Follow-up report No. 1
Start date: 15 Jun 2009
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 24 Jun 2009
Date submitted to OIE: 01 Jul 2009
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 15 per cent
Mortality: 0 per cent
Zoonotic impact: [in Spanish, trans. Mod.AS] Under investigation, since the
hypothesis suggests that the origin of animal infection is contact with
infected humans. [see comment].
Causal agent: A/H1N1 influenza virus serotype: other
This event pertains to the whole country
Related reports: immediate notification (25 Jun 2009) [included in
ProMED-mail posting archived 20090626.2322. - Mod.AS]
Outbreaks: there are no new outbreaks in this report

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: under investigation [see
comment].

Epidemiological comments: A 3 km radius zone around the outbreak as well as
a 10 km radius surveillance zone beyond the previous one have been established.

In the zone around the outbreak, all pig farms were inspected and no
animals with clinical signs were found. Only movements to the
slaughterhouse are authorized after an official clinical inspection has
been carried out.

In the surveillance zone, pig farms are being visited in order to conduct
clinical inspections and surveys with the owners. To date, no new health
information has been reported. Movements of pigs to any destination are
authorized after an official clinical inspection has been carried out.

A total of 4 farms with an epidemiological link were also identified; they
were visited by the same veterinarian who had visited the affected farm
during the past 30 days. These farms were inspected and no new health
information was reported. No more sick animals have been observed in the
outbreak since 24 Jun 2009. On 25 Jun 2009, samples (nasal swabs) were
taken in 50 pigs from different categories (all less than 150 days old);
they were negative for the RT-PCR test.

Animals were sent to the slaughterhouse after the results of the clinical
inspection and the RT-PCR were negative; no new health information was
reported after the ante- and post-mortem inspection.

Control measures
Measures applied:
- quarantine;
- screening;
- zoning;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
- no vaccination;
- no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Directorate of Laboratories and Technical Control
(SENASA) (National laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Swine / real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR)
/ 26 Jun 2009 / Negative

[The statement addressing "zoonotic impact" in the above follow-up report
is similar to the statement included in the previous immediate notification
of 25 Jun 2009. This means that there is as yet no laboratory confirmation
of the suspicion that the virus was introduced by humans, which was raised
in the immediate notification, saying "Between 7 and 9 June 2009, 2 workers
of the farm showed flu signs, but they did not consult a doctor nor made
diagnostic tests."

In view of the importance of clarifying the source of infection, it is of
utmost importance to test the 2 said workers and establish their disease
history. Until such data are available, the possibility that the source of
infection could have been different, including pigs, cannot be ruled out.

The same applies to the Canadian (Alberta) pig outbreak of May 2009;
ProMED-mail's request for information, dated 15 Jun 2009, has not been
responded to as yet. It addressed the test results of the person who was
initially suspected to be the introducer of the virus to the pig farm.
Similarly, the later claim that human involvement in the Alberta event was
-- eventually -- not confirmed (see 20090615.2215), lacked laboratory-based
evidence.

Concluding, 1st hand information and test results from the public health
authorities or from the laboratories involved in the investigations of
possible human involvement in 2009 H1N1 swine-influenza outbreaks on pig
farms in Argentina and Canada are needed in order to clarify the rather
blurred scenery. - Mod.AS]
