The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) today [10 May 2022] warned that rising COVID-19 cases are creating a volatile situation, posing the most risk for countries with low vaccination coverage.

The United States is one of the countries with rising cases, with hospitalizations now showing a small increase, according to the latest data.

At a briefing today [10 May 2022], Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants are driving South Africa's surge, with the BA.2 subvariant dominant across the world and COVID-19 cases rising in more than 50 nations [https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-who-press-conference-10-May-2022].

Relatively high population immunity from vaccination or previous infection are so far keeping hospitalizations and deaths at a lower level than previous surges. "But this is not guaranteed for places where vaccination coverage is low."

He said South African scientists are pushing more vaccination to blunt the impact of the next pandemic wave. Along with saving lives and protecting health systems, immunization has the potential to minimize long COVID, which can be devastating for individuals, communities, and economies, Tedros added.

The Global Summit on COVID-19 coming up on 12 May [2022] is another opportunity to prepare for what comes next with the pandemic, which could include a variant that evades immunity, transmits more easily, or causes more severe disease.

In a separate statement, the WHO commended the United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal for bringing governments together for the latest summit, which it hopes will lead to concrete commitments about vaccination and other measures to boost health security [https://www.who.int/news/item/10-05-2022-leaders-urged-to-make-firm-commitments-for-second-global-covid-19-summit-by-act-accelerator-agency-leads].

It said the ACT Accelerator is making progress on its plan to address health inequities, but so far only 10% of financing needs have been met. The WHO called on richer countries to help bridge the effort's USD 15 billion financing gap to help end the pandemic.

In US COVID developments, recently released federal data show that nearly 2400 coronavirus-positive people are being admitted to the hospital each day, an increase of 17% in the past week, ABC News reports [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hospital-admission-totals-tick-weeks-rising-covid-19/story?id=84599767].

Though daily cases have increased steadily over the past several weeks, hospitalizations and deaths have remained encouragingly steady. But, as more states report significant virus activity, hospitalizations are now also increasing.

Puerto Rico, Vermont, and Maine are among the areas of the country now seeing elevated COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, the Wall Street Journal reports, despite having some of the highest vaccination rates in the country [https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-cases-hospitalizations-rise-in-new-england-and-puerto-rico-11652094004].

Omicron subvariants, which can evade vaccine immunity, may be to blame for the rise in cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Nowcast estimates that BA.2 accounts for 56.4% of new US COVID-19 cases, and BA.2.12.1 accounts for 42.6% [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#circulatingVariants].

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 73 056, with 367 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html].

And the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Protect Public Data Hub shows 19 415 inpatient beds in use for COVID-19 [https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization].

Pediatric COVID-19 cases also increased this past week, as has been the trend for the past month. More than 62 400 child COVID-19 cases were reported for the week ending 5 May [2022], according to the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics. That marks an increase of 69% over the past 2 weeks [https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/].

[2] Antimicrobial use

A study of 3 hospitals in New York City found that antimicrobial use in COVID-19 patients during the 1st year of the pandemic far exceeded the incidence of coinfections, researchers reported today in Antimicrobial Stewardship & Healthcare Epidemiology [see citation below].

The study, conducted at 3 tertiary-care hospitals, found that, among 7209 patients (median age, 65 years) admitted with a confirmed COVID-19 infection from 1 Jan 2020 - 1 Feb 2021, 663 (9.2%) had a positive culture from the respiratory tract or blood sometime during their initial hospitalization. Positive respiratory cultures were found in 449 patients (6.2%), and blood culture positivity occurred in 334 (4.6%). _Staphylococcus aureus_ was among the most common pathogens isolated from both blood and respiratory cultures.

Despite the low incidence of coinfections, antimicrobials were administered to 5056 patients, or 70.1%, with a median of 6 antimicrobial days per patient. Third-generation cephalosporins [were] the most frequently used antimicrobial agent (3311 patients, 45.9%), followed by azithromycin (3130 patients, 43.4%). A higher proportion of patients received antimicrobials in the 1st wave of the pandemic compared with the later period (82.4% vs 52%). Infection-free survival decreased over the course of hospitalization.

"With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to significantly affect various parts of the world, resource utilization and overuse of antimicrobials warrant continued focus," the study authors wrote. "Our data, obtained through the period of peak COVID-19 activity in New York City, may be used to guide the process of diagnostic decision-making, optimizing resource utilization, and antimicrobial stewardship."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
Background and objective: With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, rates of in-hospital antimicrobial use increased due to perceived bacterial and fungal coinfections along with COVID-19. We describe the incidence of these coinfections and antimicrobial use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to help guide effective antimicrobial use in this population.

"Setting: This study was conducted in 3 tertiary-care referral university teaching hospitals in New York City.

"Methods: This multicenter retrospective observational cohort study involved all patients admitted with COVID-19 from 1 Jan 2020 to 1 Feb 2021. Variables of interest were extracted from a de-identified data set of all COVID-19 infections across the health system. Population statistics are presented as median with interquartile range (IQR) or proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as indicated.

"Results: Among 7209 of patients admitted with COVID-19, 663 (9.2%) had a positive culture from the respiratory tract or blood sometime during their initial hospital admission. Positive respiratory cultures occurred found in 449 (6.2%) patients, and 20% were collected within 48 hours of admission. Blood culture positivity occurred in 334 patients (4.6%), with 33.5% identified within 48 hours of admission. A higher proportion of patients received antimicrobials in the 1st wave than in the later pandemic period (82.4% vs 52.0%). Antimicrobials were prescribed to 70.1% of inpatients, with a median of 6 antimicrobial days per patient. Infection-free survival decreased over the course of hospitalization.

"Conclusions: We detected a very low incidence of coinfection with COVID-19 at admission. A longer duration of hospitalization was associated with an increased risk of coinfection. Antimicrobial use far exceeded the true incidence and detection of coinfections in these patients."

"Discussion
-------------
This study describes the rates of bacterial, fungal, and viral coinfections among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, a group with high resource utilization in terms of diagnostic testing and antibiotic use. The rate of coinfections was low overall. Only 2.9% of patients hospitalized for the 1st time with COVID-19 were coinfected with a bacterial or fungal pathogen at admission, and only 7.9% of patients had a positive blood or sputum culture after 48 hours of admission indicative of secondary nosocomial infections."

"In conclusion, a low rate of coinfection occurred among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia, and secondary infections increased with the duration of hospitalization and the use of immunomodulators. Overall, antimicrobial utilization was high, with a higher rate of utilization in the 1st wave of the pandemic compared to the later pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to significantly affect various parts of the world, resource utilization and overuse of antimicrobials warrant continued focus. Our data, obtained through the period of peak COVID-19 activity in New York City, may be used to guide the process of diagnostic decision making, optimizing resource utilization, and antimicrobial stewardship."

Antimicrobials were administered to 70.1% of patients in this study. That is very high, in spite of the low level of patients with coinfection with bacterial or fungal agents. The high rate of utilization of antibiotics apparently dropped later in the pandemic, possibly as a result of vaccines being implemented, which decreased the severity of the disease. It is important doctors guard against indiscriminate use of antibiotics. - Mod.LK]

[3] Asymptomatic cases

A cough or sneeze in the checkout line at the grocery store may elicit fear of COVID-19, but that maskless person quietly sitting next to you on the subway could pose just as much of a threat, public health experts say.

A significant proportion of COVID-19 transmission is asymptomatic or presymptomatic, potentially as high as 60%, according to a 2021 JAMA Network Open modeling study [see citation below].

That may be even higher now, as early reports have signaled a greater percentage of asymptomatic infections from omicron than from previous variants. That could have a lot to do with higher baseline levels of immunity in the population when that variant hit, Helen Chu, MD, MPH, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told MedPage Today.

Chu said the more exposure to COVID-19 that an individual has -- either in terms of prior infection or vaccination -- the broader the immunity and the better the ability to control the virus. In such cases, an individual is more likely to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, she said. Those with diminished viral loads may be less likely to transmit the disease, but they can still infect others, she said. And breakthrough cases can still carry high viral loads, as was observed in the Provincetown, Massachusetts, outbreak in July 2021.

"Spaces that are not well ventilated, have large numbers of individuals, and places where people are speaking loudly or eating, those are the spaces that we should be most concerned about," Chu said.

Estimates of asymptomatic disease rates with COVID-19 -- the proportion who are infected but never manifest symptoms -- have ranged from about 25% to 40% throughout the pandemic, with a number of papers, including one in the Annals of Internal Medicine [see citation below], coming in at about 1/3 of cases.

There are no data yet on whether omicron's subvariants, such as BA.2 and BA.4 and BA.5, cause more asymptomatic infections, Otto Yang, MD, an infectious diseases physician at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, told MedPage Today.

But he also noted that high levels of population immunity put the US in a "completely different situation from earlier when there weren't vaccines and few people had been infected."

Nonetheless, both Chu and Yang said the high rate of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission highlights the need for continued mitigation measures, especially to protect vulnerable populations such as children under 5 and the immunocompromised.

"We know what works, and I just find it puzzling that we aren't continuing to do the things that work when we know that there's long COVID, the under-5s are unvaccinated, and people can get repeatedly infected over time," Chu said. "We can't get to zero COVID, but it just surprises me that so many things have stopped, and in a time in which we have very little surveillance."

Yang also cautioned that continued transmission brings "more opportunity for new variants to develop, and the next variant could be more deadly for all we know."

Just last month [April 2022], the CDC reported that as of February [2022], more than half of the US population has been infected with COVID-19, including 75% of children and adolescents. About 1/3 became newly seropositive since December 2021, when omicron became predominant in the US.

CDC noted that seroprevalence can improve understanding of population-level incidence of COVID-19 because some cases are asymptomatic, not diagnosed, or not reported. However, it stated that seropositivity for antibodies produced in response to infection should not be interpreted as protection from future infection.

There also remains a concern about long COVID following infection, even one that occurs without acute symptoms, experts said.

"Given that community transmission levels are rising in most of the US, it is important we continue to layer mitigation measures to prevent further spread and exposure to the virus even if you are vaccinated," said Syra Madad, DHSc, MSc, of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. "While the risk at the individual level may be low if you are not in the high-risk category, and we have more tools to manage the disease including antivirals, the risk to the overall community is still high."

The combination of 60% or more of infected individuals being asymptomatic or presymptomatic and a large proportion of the population not wearing masks is a recipe for a public health disaster. It is important that the public be educated on the risk to themselves and others when masks are not worn in enclosed or crowded spaces. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 12 countries including Germany (104 449), the USA (90 572), France (56 449), Italy (56 199), Australia (53 001), Taiwan (50 819), Spain (49 829), South Korea (43 899), Japan (39 041), Brazil (20 143), Belgium (13 746), and Switzerland (12 846) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2122 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 8 May 2022 to late 9 May 2022).

A total of 36 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 19 of the 36 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 2.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 16.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 27.5% increase in daily reported cases and 32.4% increase in reported deaths. An overall global trend of decreasing cases and deaths (US has shown an increasing trend in cases and deaths over the last few days).

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.70 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 518.48 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.28 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
