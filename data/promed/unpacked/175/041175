The strange disease that has left scores of people hospitalised in Kayunga
district in the past few weeks is not yellow fever, the Ministry of Health
(MOH) has said.
John Eremu writes that in a statement yesterday, the ministry said samples
collected from the patients earlier reported to be suffering from yellow
fever had turned out to be cases of jaundice and Hepatitis B.
"The blood samples collected from all the 4 cases and analysed at the
Uganda Viral Research Institute are negative for yellow fever. Therefore,
based on the definition of yellow fever and laboratory tests, the 4 cases
observed in Kayunga district are not yellow fever," said the statement,
signed by Prof. Francis Omaswa, the director general of health services.
The New Vision on Tuesday quoted Dr. Godfrey Kiyingi, the Kayunga district
director of health services, as saying that 30 people had been hospitalised
in various health units in the district, suffering from yellow fever. MOH
immediately dispatched epidemiological experts to verify the reports.
Omaswa urged the public not to panic but to be on the alert, following the
outbreak of the disease in southern Sudan. He said last week that
vaccination against the deadly disease was going on along the Uganda-Sudan
border.
Yellow fever is a disease that starts with jaundice, high fever and later
bleeding. It is caused by the yellow fever virus, which remains dormant in
the body for 3-6 days. Omaswa said the incubation period is followed by 2
phases of the disease. "While some infections have no symptoms whatsoever,
it is common for patients in the first acute phase to have fever, muscle
pain (with severe backache), headache, shivers, loss of appetite, nausea,
and vomiting.
"After 3 to 4 days, most patients improve and their symptoms disappear.
However, about 15 percent of the patients enter the toxic phase within 24
hours," he said.

[The first report mentioned approximately 30 patients admitted with the
presumptive diagnosis of yellow fever. The absence of reports of deaths
associated with this outbreak is further suggestive that this was not an
outbreak of yellow fever, but more consistent with a milder icteric
illness. More information on the epidemiology of this outbreak as well as
clarification of whether the newswire reference to "jaundice and hepatitis
B" refers to a mixed outbreak of hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus --
or just an outbreak of hepatitis A with coincidence hepatitis B-positive
individuals with co-infection -- would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
