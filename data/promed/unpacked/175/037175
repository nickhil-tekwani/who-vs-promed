Survey of Virus Diseases Infecting Cucurbit Crops in Eastern, Central
and Western Sudan
H. Lecoq, G.A. Dafalla , Y.F. Mohamed, H.M. Ali, C. Wipt- Scheibe, C.
Desbiez, A.E. Eljack, S.K. Omara and M. Pitrat, University of Gezira,
Sudan and INRA, Montfavet, France.
A survey was conducted in eastern, central and western parts of Sudan
to determine the major viruses affecting various cucurbit crops
[including] snake cucumber (_Cucumis melo_ var. _flexuous_), melon,
watermelon, and squash).
Of 102 samples analyzed, using DAS-ELISA, ca. 65 percent were
infected by cucurbit aphid-borne yellows luteovirus (CABYV), 54
percent by zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus (ZYMV) and 39 percent by
geminiviruses serologically related to watermelon chlorotic stunt
virus (WCSV).
Other viruses identified were squash mosaic comovirus (SqMV, 15
percent), a potyvirus closely related to watermelon mosaic type
Morocco (WMV-M, 4 percent), cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV, 4
percent) and melon rugose mosaic tymovirus (MRMV, 2 percent).
This is the 1st report of CABYV and ZYMV in the Sudan, and the 1st
report of WCSV and MRMV in Africa.

[Unfortunately I could not find data regarding crop losses for this
report. All of the listed viruses cause varying levels of crop damage
and loss. I appeal to plant pathologists in Sudan or in neighboring
areas to provide useful information about diseases caused by these
viruses.
