International outbreak of _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 infection: update
---------------------------------------
As of 16 Aug 2001 the Department of Human Services, Victoria, Australia has
identified 17 cases of _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 (STM 104) infection
linked to the consumption of helva, a sesame seed based product imported
from Turkey. The cases became ill between 5 Feb and 24 Jul 2001. A further
case of STM 104 infection, 65 years old with no history of helva
consumption, was notified on 13 Aug 2001. The case had been in Turkey for 3
months, and became unwell while flying to Australia from Istanbul, Turkey,
on 28 Jul 2001. STM 104 infection linked to the consumption of helva has
recently been reported in Sweden (1) and cases in Norway, the United
Kingdom, and Germany are being investigated (2-4).
To date, STM 104 with the same antibiotic resistance pattern as cases has
been isolated from 16 separate containers of Gulsan brand helva (chocolate,
plain, and pistachio flavours) and 3 containers of Ceren brand helva
(chocolate and vanilla flavours) collected in Victoria and tested at the
Microbiology Diagnostic Unit, Melbourne, Australia. In addition,
_Salmonella typhimurium_ U302 was isolated from one container of Gulsan
brand pistachio helva. A national recall of the products was implemented,
and no further cases linked to helva consumption have since been reported.
The Australia and New Zealand Food Authority have been advised by the
Australian Embassy in Turkey that the 2 brands imported to Australia, and
the product implicated in the Swedish cases, were produced by the same
company in Turkey during the same period in October 2000. Information
provided by the company suggests the source of contamination is not known
(ProMED-mail Digest:194, 17 Aug 2001).
During the investigation in Australia, _Salmonella oranienburg_ and
_Salmonella amsterdam_ var 15+ were also isolated from 2 containers of
pistachio helva, of a different brand, which were produced in Lebanon.
There are no known linked human cases. Between 1985 and 2001 the National
Enteric Pathogen Surveillance Scheme (NEPSS) in Australia has recorded the
isolation of 17 different _Salmonella_ spp. from sesame seeds, and sesame
seed products, including houmous, tahini, and halva on 30 occasions. Given
these data and the results of the investigations reported by the
manufacturer specified in the current outbreak, further investigation of
the mechanisms for, and prevention of, contamination of these products is
warranted.
