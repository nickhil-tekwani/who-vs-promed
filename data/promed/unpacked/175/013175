Foreign experts, including those from the United States' Centers for
Disease Control, may be called in to help tackle the outbreak of Japanese
encephalitis. Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Halim Ali, who will
chair the joint action committee to tackle Japanese encephalitis [JE on
Tuesday, said he would consider seeking foreign help.
Ten people living near or associated with pig farms have died from
suspected JE in Negri Sembilan.
Since October [1998, there have been four confirmed JE deaths out of 27
encephalitis-related deaths. All the four confirmed JE deaths were in Perak.
Following the outbreak in Negri Sembilan, the decimation of pigs was
considered to check the spread of the disease. In another measure to
control the outbreak, the Cabinet decided to have more than two million
pigs vaccinated.

[This outbreak appears to be gaining quite a bit of attention locally.
Recent editions of Asian newspapers have carried stories in which the
government of Malaysia has been heavily criticized for a variety of actions
and perceived inactions. Mostly, the complaints center on the government's
perceived lack of completeness with regard to epidemiologic studies, case
updates, and a lack of planning and coordination. Some comments have been
made in public regarding an apparent Health Ministry governmental "gag
order", which we had heard about during the coxsackie B virus epidemic of
1997. This is difficult to believe as it is clear to everyone that the
more information the easier it is to attain a solution to the problem,
notwithstanding the policies of various dictatorships. Absent accurate
information about an epidemiologic situation, the rumor mill goes into high
gear, which is, in the end, self-defeating for those who would rather
suppress information. The general public deserves better than that and, if
this report is correct, it appears that the Malaysian government now is
doing the right thing. Keep in mind, however, that the CDC has never been
allowed (ostensibly by the Malaysian government) to release the data it
obtained during the coxsackie B virus epidemic of 1997. - Mod.CHC
