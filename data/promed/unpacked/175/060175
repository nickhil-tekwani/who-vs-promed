Human rabies - Minnesota: 2007
------------------------------
On 20 Oct 2007, a Minnesota resident died from rabies, approximately
one month after initial symptoms of limb paresthesia, which
progressed to flaccid weakness and ataxia. This was the only human
rabies case reported in the United States in 2007. A presumptive
diagnosis of idiopathic transverse myelitis was considered initially,
because of abnormalities detected via spinal cord imaging studies and
a lack of laboratory confirmation of a specific infectious etiology.
The presumptive diagnosis subsequently was changed to include rabies,
based on the patient's rapidly deteriorating neurologic status and
elicitation of a history involving bat exposure during the month
before illness onset. This report summarizes the medical and
epidemiologic investigation by the Minnesota Department of Public
Health and CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and
the ensuing public health response. The findings underscore the need
for early inclusion of rabies in the differential diagnosis of
rapidly progressive encephalitis, improved public awareness of the
risks associated with animal bites, and appropriate rabies
prophylaxis after exposure.

Case report
-----------
On 19 Sep 2007, a man aged 46 years visited an outpatient facility
with paresthesia in his right hand. During the next 3 days, the
paresthesia spread proximally, and the patient developed flaccid
weakness in the right upper extremity. Electromyography (EMG)
performed at a local outpatient facility on 24 Sep 2007 revealed
evidence of axonal nerve damage. Within 3 days, the patient developed
paresthesia and weakness in his left upper extremity and gait
unsteadiness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain on 28 Sep
2007 was unremarkable, but MRI of the cervical spine showed central
spinal cord T2-signal abnormalities with associated edema spanning
the C3 to C6 levels, suggestive of an inflammatory process.

On 29 Sep 2007, the patient had a fever of 101.1 deg F (38.4 deg C)
and was hospitalized. He developed double vision, tremulousness, and
rapidly progressive respiratory failure, which required intubation
and ventilator support the next morning. He had no laryngospasm or
dysphagia. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture
revealed a pleocytosis of 12 cells/mm3 (normal: 0-5 cells/mm3), 85
percent lymphocytes, elevated protein of 107 mg/dL (normal: 15-45
mg/dL), normal glucose, and negative bacterial culture and acid-fast
bacilli screening. West Nile virus and herpes simplex virus testing
of the CSF were negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Additional CSF studies were negative for cryptococcal antigen,
antibody for syphilis, and Lyme disease antibody. The patient's serum
was negative for evidence of antinuclear antibodies, extractable
nuclear antibodies, or antibody to West Nile virus, _Borrelia_ sp.,
_Treponema pallidum_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, human T-lymphotropic
virus I and II, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis A, B, and
C viruses. Because his clinical and laboratory profiles were
suggestive of idiopathic transverse myelitis, he was treated with
intravenous methylprednisolone.

The patient's symptoms did not improve, and his fever reached 102.7
deg F (39.3 deg C). In 3 procedures, MRI of the brain did not
demonstrate significant abnormalities, but MRI of the spinal cord
revealed progressive extension of the previously detected cervical
segment abnormalities. He became comatose on 5 Oct 2007 and had no
clinical evidence of cranial nerve function except infrequent
spontaneous respiration. A repeat lumbar puncture showed a normal
white blood cell count of 1 cell/mm3, elevated protein of 75 mg/dL,
normal glucose, and 8 unique oligoclonal bands by electrophoresis
(normal: none), indicative of immunoglobulin production by plasma
cells and central nervous system disease. The CSF immunoglobulin G
synthesis rate by spectrophotometry was borderline elevated at 12.04
(normal: less than 12), consistent with an ongoing inflammatory
process. Bacterial cultures of CSF remained negative, and additional
CSF evaluation showed negative viral PCR tests for cytomegalovirus,
Epstein-Barr virus, enterovirus, and herpes simplex virus. Analysis
of CSF also was negative for neuromyelitis optica antibody,
associated with Devic's disease. Repeat neuroimaging on 7 Oct 2007
revealed further caudal to rostral progression of the brainstem and
spinal cord abnormalities observed on 5 Oct 2007. Because of
progressive neurologic decline, the patient was transferred to a
tertiary-care center.

On arrival at the tertiary-care center, the patient was comatose with
a Glasgow coma score of 3 without demonstrable cranial nerve
function. A neurologic examination revealed flaccid quadriparesis and
hyporeflexia. EMG revealed severe, acute polyradiculoneuropathy.
Auditory evoked potential testing indicated absent responses. With
the presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic transverse myelitis, the
patient was treated with methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis. On 15
Oct 2007, CSF analysis revealed a pleocytosis of 22 cells/mm3 (94
percent lymphocytes), red blood cell count of 2519 cells/mm3 (normal:
0 cells/mm3), elevated protein of 235 mg/dL, normal glucose, and
further elevated immunoglobulin G synthesis rate of 43 mg/24 hours
(normal: -9.9 to 3.3 mg/24 hours). MRI of the brain revealed new
symmetric T2-signal abnormalities within the basal ganglia and medial
temporal lobes, with subtle leptomeningeal gadolinium enhancement.
The ascending paralysis and coma appeared atypical of idiopathic
transverse myelitis, and the patient's clinical progression and brain
imaging abnormalities were noted to resemble those observed in rabies
encephalitis (1).

Once rabies was suspected, the patient's family was interviewed on 16
Oct 2007 for a history of potential exposure. According to his
family, the patient had handled a bat with his bare hands in a
semi-open cabin porch in north-central Minnesota on 19 Aug 2007. He
had reported feeling a needle prick sensation before releasing the
bat. Because no blood or wound was visible, the patient concluded he
had not been bitten and did not seek medical attention. Neither the
patient nor his family was aware that this exposure constituted a rabies risk.

On 17 Oct 2007, specimens of the patient's serum, CSF, saliva, and a
nuchal biopsy were sent to CDC. Rabies virus antibodies were detected
in stored CSF and serum samples collected before plasma exchange,
confirming the suspected diagnosis. However, no rabies virus antigens
were detected in the skin biopsy using fluorescent microscopy, and no
rabies virus amplicons were detected in saliva or skin biopsy samples
by reverse transcription--PCR; therefore, antigenic characterization
and genetic sequencing of the rabies virus variant were not possible.
Because of the poor prognosis, medical care was withdrawn after
extended family discussions, and the patient died on 20 Oct 2007, the
22nd day of hospitalization.

Public health investigation
---------------------------
After diagnosis of rabies, the Minnesota Department of Health
assessed the need for rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) among
close contacts of the patient and health-care workers and searched
the likely site of rabies exposure. Family members, other close
contacts, and health-care workers were interviewed using a standard
questionnaire to identify possible exposures to the patient's saliva.
Three of 14 family contacts and 51 of 524 health-care workers who
participated in the man's care received rabies PEP, administered
chiefly at the respective hospital emergency departments. The
Minnesota Department of Health received no information from
health-care providers suggesting incomplete PEP administration or
adverse events resulting from rabies vaccination. Although a search
of the cabin site on 26 Oct 2007 revealed no evidence of bat
infestation, given the reported bat exposure on 19 Aug 2007, initial
symptoms on 19 Sep 2007, and an incubation period of approximately
one month, investigators concluded that a bite from a bat was the
most likely source of rabies virus infection.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
This report describes the only reported case of human rabies in the
United States in 2007 and the 1st case in Minnesota since 2000.
Investigators determined that the likely source of rabies in this
case was a bat. In Minnesota, bats and skunks are the only known
reservoirs of rabies. In 2006, 42 rabid animals were reported in the
state, including 17 bats and 20 skunks (2).

During 2000-2007, a total of 25 cases of human rabies were reported
in the United States (2). Eighteen (28 percent) cases were associated
with suspected exposure to rabid bats or infection with bat rabies
virus variants. Most of these human cases occurred in late summer or
early autumn, coincident with a seasonal increase in the prevalence
of rabid bats detected in the United States (2). Despite repeated
documentation of human rabies attributable to bat exposures and
identification of 1212-1692 rabid bats in the United States during
2000-2006, the significance of bat exposures often is ignored (3,4).

The animal contact, incubation period, clinical presentation, and
laboratory findings for the patient described in this report were
typical of human rabies cases reported in the United States. However,
a diagnosis of rabies was not considered until the clinical course
appeared atypical of the presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic
transverse myelitis and brain imaging abnormalities resembled those
observed in rabies. One unusual facet of this case was the inability
to detect viral antigens or nucleic acids in patient samples,
although rabies virus antibodies were identified in the serum and
CSF. The only other human rabies case in the United States in which
viral antigens or nucleic acids could not be detected, since such
laboratory methods became more widely available in the early 1990s,
was a 2004 Wisconsin patient, who survived rabies after a bat bite
(1,5). However, the Wisconsin patient was an adolescent girl treated
successfully with a drug-induced coma and antiviral drugs, and the
significance of any similarities between that case and the Minnesota
case is unclear.

This report underscores the need for increased public awareness of
the risks of direct contact with bats and other wild animals. After
exposure, human rabies is preventable with timely and appropriate
PEP, consisting of proper wound care and prompt administration of
rabies biologicals (4). Rabies PEP is recommended for all persons
with direct transdermal or mucous membrane exposure to a bat, unless
the animal is found not to have rabies. However, bite lesions from
certain animals, including bats, can be difficult to detect.
Consequently, proper tailoring of health communications to medical
practitioners and the public remains a challenge to ensure that
appropriate PEP is administered when indicated but not unnecessarily.

Rabies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of human
cases involving acute, rapidly progressive encephalitis, especially
when the clinical course and neuroimaging findings are compatible,
regardless of history of animal exposure (1,4). If a patient is
unresponsive, interview of family members and close contacts might
reveal potential exposures. Prompt diagnosis of rabies can enable
rapid case investigation, implementation of appropriate
infection-control measures, and consideration of experimental therapy (5).

[Any case of rabies is a sad situation because it is so preventable.
Domestic animals can be vaccinated, and wild animals such as bats
should be treated as suspect and not handled. Clearly if the
individual had reported the occurrence of contact with a bat, post
exposure vaccination could have been implemented. - Mod.TG]
