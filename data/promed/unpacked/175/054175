Abstract
--------
Objectives
Anthrax is a disease with an age old history in Africa caused by the Gram-positive endospore forming soil bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Epizootics of wild ungulates occur annually in the enzootic region of Pafuri, Kruger National Park (KNP) in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. Rigorous routine surveillance and diagnostics in KNP, has not revealed these rare isolates since the 1990s, despite unabated annual outbreaks. In 2011 a cheetah was diagnosed as anthrax positive from a private game reserve in Limpopo Province and reported to State Veterinary Services for further investigation. Isolation, molecular diagnostics, whole genome sequencing and comparative genomics were carried out for _B. anthracis_ KC2011.

Results
Bacteriological and molecular diagnostics confirmed the isolate as _B. anthracis_. Subsequent typing and whole genome single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis indicated it clustered alongside _B. anthracis_ SA A0091 in the B.Br.010 SNP branch. Unlike _B. anthracis_ KrugerB strain, KC2011 strain has unique SNPs and represents a new branch in the B-clade. The isolation and genotypic characterisation of KC2011 demonstrates a gap in the reporting of anthrax outbreaks in the greater Limpopo province area. The identification of vulnerable and susceptible cheetah mortalities due to this strain has implications for conservation measures and disease control.

Discussion
----------
Strain KC2011 is the first _B. anthracis_ identified as a B-clade lineage bacterium in over 20 years in South Africa and represents a new subclade in the B-clade. About 90% of the anthrax outbreaks reported world-wide arise from the A-clade, while less than 10% have been reported from the B-clade (KrugerB subclade). The majority of the _B. anthracis_ strains isolated from the northern part of KNP from 1970 to 1981 grouped in the B-clade (KrugerB subclade) but this clade became rare since the 1990s. Only one B strain reported between 1982 and 1997 to the extent that it was no longer isolated from 1997 until this report in South Africa.

No significant anthrax outbreaks were noted outside the endemic regions of KNP (northern part of KNP) in 2011 according to state veterinary surveillance data. The isolate KC2011 was only identified because of the delicate conservation status of cheetah in Africa and because it was within the context of the broader Limpopo province area (i.e. outside KNP). Cheetahs are especially susceptible to the _B. anthracis_ exotoxins, however, they do respond well to vaccination with the Sterne vaccine. This study highlighted the importance of vaccinating cheetah, where logistically possible, in conservancies across Limpopo province.

The phylogenetic structure of _B. anthracis_ determined in this study [see (Fig. 2) in article] is similar to other reported WGS-SNP trees. Past B-clade (1965-1990) isolates from the State Veterinary archival collection have all clustered in the KrugerB lineage. WGS-SNP analysis defined KC2011 strain grouping as a distinctive sub-clade within southern Africa B.Br.010.

Although, distant in terms of number of SNPs, the isolate A0091 and KC2011 belong to a common albeit broader lineage. The isolate A0091 is recorded as being from South Africa circa 1939, but has no other information to link it to KNP or Limpopo Province. There is also a dearth of information from the countries (Zimbabwe and Mozambique) bordering the South African province across the Limpopo River. Further surveillance of Limpopo Province is required to reveal whether deposits of B-clade isolates are subsisting outside KNP or whether this was an incidental mortality due to circumstances outside the realm of current monitoring criteria. Surveillance in the non-endemic anthrax regions is difficult as there are private game reserves and rural livestock farmers bordering KNP. Moreover the rural subsistence farmers (predominantly cattle farmers) are less likely to report mortalities and/or vaccinate their livestock thus complicating disease monitoring and control. This report of the _B. anthracis_ KC2011 isolated outside the endemic region highlights the necessity of disease surveillance in non-endemic regions.

Conclusion
----------
The identification of KC2011 is significant in that mortalities linked to the B-clade have diminished over several decades and therefore was estimated to have disappeared from the local environment. This suggests a possible gap in surveillance of carcasses submitted for anthrax diagnostics in the Limpopo province especially in the non-endemic regions. It also has implications for the inclusion of the Sterne vaccine as part of the conservation measures to be included for cheetah in sanctuaries and private game reserves across the Limpopo Province in South Africa.

[Remember: absence of evidence does not constitute evidence of absence. As the authors point out there well might be a lack of observation of anthrax deaths in this part of the KNP and adjoining areas, not an absence of wildlife outbreaks. Although this strain is unique it has a near B-relative in A0091 but whose origin is unknown other than South Africa in or around 1939, a time when Max Sterne was active in Natal and developing his vaccine.

Anthrax has long been a chronic problem in the Kruger National Park (KNP) with the Pafuri with its own outbreaks, occasionally interrupted by flooding but they eventually recur there. Pafuri is the northernmost part of the KNP and is described by the Pafuri river. There are 2 relevant papers worth reading on anthrax in the KNP:
