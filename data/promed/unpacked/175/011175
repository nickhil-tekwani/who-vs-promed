[1] Merida, Mexico: suspected
Date: Fri 28 Feb 2014

Dr. Scott Weaver, Director of the Institute for Human Infection and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, TX, confirmed to the Houston Chronicle on 26 Feb [2014] that there are suspected cases of chikungunya in the area of Merida, Mexico.

During an telephone interview on 24 Feb [2014] with this reporter, he mentioned that a colleague was investigating those reports. The difficulty in confirming the appearance of chikungunya on the Yucatan Peninsula, he said, was the inability to test for the illness locally. Specimens may have to be brought to Galveston for testing.

[This report is of significant concern, possibly as the 1st reported instance of chikungunya cases in North America in an area of active dengue virus (DENV) transmission. If these are, indeed, cases of CHIKV infection, there are no barriers to its spread southward into Central America and beyond.

ProMED will be very interested in the results of the laboratory tests confirming or discarding the etiology of these cases as due to CHIKV infection.

ProMED thanks Roland Hubner for sending in this same report also.

[The above are confirmed or probable cases and do not include numbers of suspected cases, which are much higher (see ECDC report below).

Roland Hubner wonders what will happen when spring break students return to their home countries after their holidays in chikungunya affected islands. Ongoing transmission following their return will depend on the availability of mosquito vectors.

This moderator wonders what happens when infected individuals from the affected islands travel to dengue-endemic countries, such as Brazil, where carnival, which has just begun, attracts tourists from all over the world.

[3] ECDC summary
Date: 23 Feb-1 Mar 2014

Epidemiological summary:
---------------------------
Cases reported as of 28 Feb 2014:
Virgin Islands (UK), 6 confirmed cases;
Saint Martin (FR), 2030 suspected and 765 confirmed or probable cases;
St. Maarten (NL), 115 confirmed autochthonous cases;
Martinique, 3940 suspected and 1058 confirmed or probable cases;
Saint Barthelemy, 380 suspected and 127 confirmed or probable cases;
Guadeloupe, 1460 suspected and 476 confirmed or probable cases;
Dominica, 45 confirmed cases (1 imported) and 44 autochthonous cases;
French Guiana, 17 confirmed cases, 10 of which are autochthonous cases;
Anguilla, 11 confirmed cases on the island with one case probably originating from Saint Martin;
Aruba, one imported case originating from St. Maarten;
St. Kitts and Nevis, one confirmed case.

ECDC assessment:
Epidemiological data indicate that the outbreak, which started in St. Martin (FR), is expanding. An increasing number of cases have been observed from most of the affected areas. The vector is endemic in the region, where it also transmits dengue virus. Vigilance is recommended for the occurrence of imported cases of chikungunya in tourists returning to the EU from the Caribbean, including awareness among clinicians, travel clinics, and blood safety authorities. The autochthonous cases in French Guyana are the 1st autochthonous chikungunya cases in mainland South America.

[Interestingly, reporting of chikungunya cases in the French Antilles is no longer compulsory (http://www.hcsp.fr/explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=408 in French), which raises questions about future case counts. - Mod.TY
