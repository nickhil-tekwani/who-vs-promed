The UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
said movements of fish in and out of a fishery in East Sussex have
been restricted, following the confirmation of Koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease.

Defra has issued a designated area order prohibiting the movement of
fish to and from Moor Hall Pools, Moor Hall Farm, Ninfield, Nr
Battle, East Sussex.

KHV Disease affects common carp and carp varieties such as Koi. It
can result in high rates of fish mortalities. There are no
implications for human health, the department said in a statement.
