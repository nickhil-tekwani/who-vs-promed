A case of "mad cow disease" in Wales was in Carmarthenshire, the Welsh Government has confirmed.

The disease -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- was discovered in a dead 6-year-old cow during routine surveillance on 28 Sep 2015.

All animals over 4 years [48 months] old that die on a farm are tested for BSE.

As the diseased animal was part of a herd of 33 cows and one calf, all 34 have been placed under restrictions for 21 days. The entire herd will then be culled in line with EU requirements [see comment].

The last BSE cases in Wales were in 2013 when the disease was found in animals in Powys and Gwynedd. North East Wales has not seen a case since 2008.

The Carmarthenshire animal did not enter the food chain, and the Food Standards Agency said there was no risk to human health.

[Carmarthenshire is a unitary authority in the southwest of Wales.

Earlier this year (2015), a classical BSE case was diagnosed in Ireland in a 65-month old dairy cow (see posting 20150627.3467749) in a (rotbunt breed) dairy operation including 289 cows. The affected animal was born, reared and spent its entire life on the same farm. As prescribed by the EU requirements, the victim's cohort group was identified, taking into account animals born in the herd in the same year (2010) as the case, in the previous year (2009), and the following year (2011). The objective was to identify those animals which might have consumed the same feed as the case animal. 63 animals were still alive. With regard to the progeny of the cow, all 4 animals were identified. All progeny and cohort animals that had been identified, traced, and restricted, totalling 67 head, were removed and slaughtered. All 67 animals tested, subsequently, negative.

It will be interesting to note whether similar considerations have led to the culling of 33 animals in Wales. - Mod.AS
