The agricultural department in east China's Anhui Province has sent a warning of a wheat scab epidemic. The department discovered that 4.7 million hectares [about 11.6 million acres] of wheat fields in the province are prone to an outbreak of the fungal disease this year [2019]. Among them, 2 million hectares [about 4.9 million acres] are likely to suffer losses. Wheat scab had been expanding and aggravating over the past years in the province, affecting yield and quality.

Agricultural experts said farmers should seize the current "window period" of the plant's growth to carry out pharmaceutical prevention and control. Wheat is the main grain crop in the province, accounting for 40% of the total grain output.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called ear blight, scab) of small grain cereal crops (wheat, barley, rye, oats, maize) is caused by several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_. FHB causes yield losses of up to 45% and reduces the grade of harvested grain. The fungi can also cause foot rot and seedling blight and form a complex of diseases on seeds, seedlings, and adult plants. Current names of the fungi include _Fusarium graminearum_ (synonym _Gibberella zeae_), _Fusarium poae_, _Microdochium nivale_ (synonyms _Fusarium nivale_, _Monographella nivalis_), and _Microdochium majus_. The pathogens are favoured by humid conditions.

Depending on fungal strains involved and environmental factors during plant growth and grain storage, infection may also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins. The total crop may be lost because of toxin levels. The fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues; spores are spread by wind, water, mechanical means, and with infected plant material (including seeds). For seedling blights, the main pathogen source is contaminated seed. Disease management includes fungicides as crop sprays or seed treatments, long crop rotations with non-hosts, and planting of cereal varieties with reduced susceptibility. Use of certified clean seeds is essential.

New fungal strains are emerging worldwide. Examples are the re-emergence of some fusarium diseases thought to be driven mainly by changes to climate and agronomic practices in the UK (ProMED-mail post 20100726.2497) and new FHB strains with increased mycotoxin levels in Canada (ProMED-mail post 20091210.4211). Continuing breeding programmes for new FHB resistant (or tolerant) crop varieties are needed to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.
