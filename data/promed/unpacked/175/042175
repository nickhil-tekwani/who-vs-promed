Hundreds of people across the Taluka were seen admitted to Government and private hospitals of Bhatkal after they reportedly fell sick by consuming mussels (sea shells) on [Sun 17 Feb 2019]. On [Sun 17 Feb 2019] evening, it was observed that a large number of people including members of the same family were rushing towards Government and Private hospitals of Bhatkal, Shirali and Murdeshwar, after they fell sick by eating a homemade mussels dish.

The victims were seen with the initial symptoms of uneasiness in the stomach and diarrhea and later felt dizzy and even get unconscious. It has been suspected that the chemical used to preserve the mussels have been the cause of the disease. Sources said that, the mussels were brought to Bhatkal from Kundapur. Daily number of bags containing mussels are brought there and sold at different places of the Taluka.

Bhatkal Tahsidar VN Bhadkar visited the hospitals and enquired about the health condition of the people. Speaking with the media he added, "I have been informed that people are falling sick after eating mussels. I have talked with the health officer regarding the issue too. The responsible department and the police personnel have been assigned to investigate the matter. Samples of mussels brought from Kundapur have been sent to laboratories for testing and the reports will soon be known."

The Tahsildar requested the people of Bhatkal taluk to not to eat mussels for few weeks until the problems are resolved.

[The etiology or etiologies of this outbreak could be a toxic chemical as suggested in the posting but may well be infectious including norovirus, _Vibrio sp_, and may well also be diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). DSP is an acute gastrointestinal illness cause by ingestion of shellfish that have accumulated okadaic acid or related dinophysistoxins through filter feeding. The onset of illness in DSP is shorter than the usual infection and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fever and chills.

Bhatkal, also known as 'Batecala' in some historical Portuguese texts, is a port town in the Uttara Kannada District of the South Indian state of Karnataka. - Mod.LL
