Shallots grown in Tuticorin [Toothukudi] district [are] affected by purple blotch [due to] heavy rains. In most areas [shallot] is inter-cropped with chilli.

[A farmer said,] "This year [2019] we had continuous downpour almost every day for about a month, leaving the soil soaked and shallots rotting." He said that rotting is common every year but it used to vanish under the sun. Without sunshine and a break in the rain, farmers fear their production would drop to a mere [half to one-third] against the usual. Crippling of leaves due to the weather is also affecting growth of the bulbs.

A team from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University [TNAU] visited the areas affected by onion purple blotch disease. "Farmers have started using the pesticides they suggested. But sunlight is necessary for stagnated water to evaporate and the shallots to be ready for harvest," [a farmer] said.

[Purple blotch of onions (_Allium cepa_; some varieties known as shallots) and related crops, such as leek (_A. porrum_) and garlic (_A. sativum_), is caused by the fungus _Alternaria porri_. Crop losses depend on environmental conditions and may range from 25 to 90 percent. The damage may continue to develop post-harvest. Symptoms on onion include small, water-soaked lesions with purple centres on leaves, leaf bases and flower stalks, which expand and result in necrotic patches; symptoms may be confused with stemphylium blight of onion (_Stemphylium vesicarium_; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). On leek, _A. porri_ leads to white or purple spots appearing on leaves; affected leaves crack and eventually die.

The disease is favoured by high humidity and often occurs as a secondary infection on plants already affected by other pathogens or pests (for example, onion thrips). The pathogen is mostly spread with infected plant material and by mechanical means (including insects and human activities). Disease management may include fungicides, clean planting material, phytosanitation to minimise inoculum and crop rotation.

Other members of _Alternaria_ species complexes cause, for example, early blight of potato and tomato (_A. solani_); leaf blight of tea (_A. alternata_); almond leaf spot (_A. alternata_, _A. arborescens_, _A. tenuissima_); leaf blotch of apple (_A. mali_).
