An adult pygmy sperm whale died Wednesday after beaching itself, becoming
the third such fatality on Florida shores in 2 months.
The pygmy sperm whale died while marine experts were hoisting it into an
ambulance, said Geoff Oldfather, a spokesman for the Harbor Branch
Oceanographic Institution in Fort Pierce. The carcass was to be taken to
SeaWorld Orlando's necropsy lab for examination.
Two other pygmy sperm whales recently have died after beaching themselves
on Florida shores. Both were found to have suffered gastric ulcers,
dehydration and stomach parasites.
"All the animals seem to be suffering an inability to digest food,"
Oldfather said. "They have an irregular heart beat."
The 3 deaths indicate a virus is affecting a population of pygmy sperm
whales off Florida's east coast, according to Steve McCulloch, the
institution's dolphin program director.
The first whale beached itself near Stuart, 18 Feb 2000, and died 2 days
later after being taken to the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota. The
second whale beached itself last Sunday and also was taken to the Mote
Marine Laboratory, where it died the next day.
