[The original article, available at the source URL (http://www.foodqualitynews.com/Food-Outbreaks/Listeria-outbreak-from-salmon-in-Denmark), is copyrighted and cannot be reproduced. However, it is summarized below:

The Dansk Supermarket Group (DSG) recalled cold-packed smoked salmon, manufactured in Poland, after _Listeria monocytogenes_ was identified in the product. The isolate from the product was almost identical by whole genome sequencing to isolates from 3 of 4 patients, whose food history in 3 of the patients identified the smoked salmon as the likely source.

The smoked salmon product was recalled from about 600 stores in Denmark and a limited number in Metro Poland.

Up to 3 of the 4 patients had become ill in the same week in August 2017 and the 4th had become ill in May 2017. One of the 4 patients has died. All 4 patients had severe underlying disease.

DSG consists of chains (fotex, Bilka, Netto, and Salling) with more than 1400 stores in Denmark, Germany, Poland and Sweden.

Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for listeriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated cured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require further cooking before eating. The news report said that more cases related to this outbreak were expected, despite the recall, as the incubation period for listeriosis is up to 3 weeks [actually symptoms can start up to as 70 days after exposure]. - Mod.ML
