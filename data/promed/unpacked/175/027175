More cases of spotted fever reported
------------------------------------
Health officials on Mon 14 Nov 2005 detected 2 more suspected cases
of Brazilian spotted fever, a rare disease that has infected at least
5 people and killed 2 in a nearby mountain resort.
Health authorities in the city of Petropolis, 60 km (40 miles)
outside of Rio de Janeiro, said a 21-year-old man and an 8-year-old
girl were believed to have contracted the disease. The man was in
good condition and being treated at home. The girl had been
hospitalized. Officials said lab results were expected shortly.
Earlier in November 2005, a health inspector and a journalist died
from the disease after spending time in the mountain region of
Itaipava near Rio, where the ticks that spread the disease are
common. Ticks often transmit diseases to dogs but rarely to humans.
When treated early with antimicrobial agents, Brazilian spotted fever
usually is not fatal. The rare disease was identified in Sao Paulo in
1929.

[Brazilian spotted fever, in Portuguese, is known as "febre maculosa
brasileira". The disease is quite similar to Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, with only subtle differences. The etiological agent,
_Rickettsia ricketsii_, is considered almost identical to its
American counterpart.
As noted, the disease was 1st described in 1929 but underwent a still-
unexplained disappearance in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1985, it has been
found with increasing frequency in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states, but
cases have been seen in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo states. Recently,
cases have been identified in the state of Santa Catarina in the south. The
main vector tick is _Amblyomma cajennense_, but _A. cooperii_ has been also
implicated. - Mod.LL]
[The Brazilian equivalent of ProMED, called LISAS , has
reported outbreaks of this disease in 8 different localities in Sao Paulo
state during 2005, besides the outbreaks in Minas Gerais & Rio de Janeiro
states. This compares with only one or 2 outbreaks reported in each of the 3
preceding years. Measures have been proposed to get rid of the ticks on
capybaras, aquatic rodents the size of large dogs that roam the municipality
of Piracicaba where more than 80 suspect cases have been reported. Rodents of
various species are the wild hosts of both the tick and the microbe.
Perhaps an entomologist reader can tell us if the climatic conditions in 2005
have especially favored ticks in the southern part of Brazil. I know I got
covered in them when I went up into the coastal mountain range in Rio de
Janeiro state for a few days last month, but then that happens to me every
year in October. - Mod.JW]
