Local Iraqi authorities declared a state of emergency on Monday [8
Sep 2008] after cholera killed 8 people in Babil province, south of
Baghdad, in 3 days, with another 500 suspected to have contracted the
disease. 20 other cases of cholera, which can sometimes kill victims
with sudden severe diarrhea, have been confirmed. Officials declared
the state of emergency at a news conference.

Scarcity of water during Iraq's scorching summer forces many to drink
water from unsafe sources. More than 4000 cases of cholera were
diagnosed in Iraq in 2007, killing at least 24.

Babil province borders Baghdad, where Iraq's general director of
public health on Sunday [7 Sep 2008] told Reuters 6 people had been
diagnosed with cholera.

Two more cholera cases have been diagnosed in Baghdad, bringing the
number of cases to 7 since last week [week of 1 Sep 2008], including
a fatality in the south, the Health Ministry said on 7 Sep 2008.

"So far 7 cases have been confirmed since last week: 5 in Baghdad's
western suburb of Abu Ghraib, one in its eastern Rasafa side, and the
7th was the fatality in Maysan province," Ihssan Jaafar,
director-general of the public health directorate, told IRIN.

Maysan's fatality was a 3-year-old boy. The province is about 350 km
(218 mi) south of Baghdad.

Jaafar added that the scarcity of clean water during the scorching
summer months had forced more people to drink water from unsafe
sources and as long as the scarcity continued, cholera would remain a
problem.

At least 8 more persons including 3 children who were displaced by
the Koshi floods and taking shelter in various government-run camps
in Sunsari and Saptari districts have died of high fever and diarrhea
in the past 24 hours. The Himalayan Times quoted Sunsari District
Police Office as saying that a 5-year-old and a 50-year-old, both
Haripur-8 residents, died of fever in Sunsari on Sunday [7 Sep 2008].
4 others of Haripur-2 had died of dysentery Saturday night [6 Sep
2008]. 2 other children, who had come to Koshi colony in Bhardaha of
Saptari to take shelter from Sitapur village of India, died due to
diarrhea on Sunday [7 Sep 2008].

According to the daily, the death toll from flood related diseases
stands at 36, 25 in Sunsari and 11 in Saptari.

Health workers warn that diarrhea is gradually turning into an
epidemic in the camps due to poor sanitation condition of the
displaced people and lack of enough toilets. They are also
complaining of low quality food being distributed under World Food
Program and lack of clean drinking water, worsening the condition at
the camps.

Around 70 people at Sidhar village under Suti-I block in Murshidabad
are suffering from cholera for the last week or so. The disease has
already claimed 2 lives. Sources said all the tube wells in the
village are lying defunct for the last few months. Some of the wells
are also in a poor condition. So, the villagers were collecting
drinking water from river Banshlai.

The disease possibly broke out as villagers drank the water without
boiling it. 2 children, aged 2 and 4, have died of the disease. 11
victims have been admitted to Raghunathganj and Aahiran hospitals in
a critical condition.

Chief medical officer of health (CMOH), Murshidabad, Srikanta Roy
said: "A medical team is working in the village to stop the disease
from spreading to newer areas. We have also spoken to the local
administration to set up tube wells and repair the old ones."

[5] Cholera - Pakistan (Federally Administered Tribal Areas)

Cholera has broken out among some of up to 300 000 people in
northwestern Pakistan who have fled fighting between government
forces and militants, the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) said on Friday [5 Sep 2008]. The situation in the Bajaur
region, a haven for Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters along the Afghan
border, remains "very volatile" despite a government-declared
ceasefire for Ramadan, a senior ICRC official said.

The neutral humanitarian agency's top priority is providing clean
water and sanitation to tens of thousands who fled Bajaur for nearby
Lower Dir district since the conflict intensified 4 weeks ago.

"Cholera has started in certain areas... It is a major concern,"
Pascal Cuttat, head of ICRC's delegation in Pakistan, told a news
briefing. "The most immediate need remains access to clean water and
sanitation. No food, health care, or shelter is going to be of any
good if people get water-borne diseases," he said.

The ICRC had no figures for the number of cases of cholera, which
Cuttat said had been confirmed in local laboratories by Pakistani
doctors. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had no immediate
information on any cholera outbreaks in Pakistan.

About 80 percent of an estimated 50 000 displaced in hot and
overcrowded makeshift camps or schools in Lower Dir, are women and
children, according to Cuttat. Most men stayed in the villages to
guard their property and harvest crops. Another 20 000 people have
fled more recent fighting which erupted in Swat Valley in North West
Frontier Province, he said.

A cholera epidemic, which has claimed 90 lives to-date in
Guinea-Bissau, with more than 3900 people suffering from the disease,
is spreading but no new cases have been reported from neighboring
Guinea, the WHO said Sunday [7 Sep 2008].

"The cholera outbreak continues with 3915 cases and 90 deaths
reported as of 31 August [2008]" in Guinea-Bissau, said a World
Health Organization (WHO) report seen by AFP.

"New cases have been detected in Bijagos archipelago bringing the
number of regions affected to 10 out of 11." Aid groups MSF [Medecins
Sans Frontieres]-Spain and OXFAM-US have mobilized teams to support a
response, the report added.

Cholera has broken out in the Mazabuka district, southern Zambia,
state media reported on Saturday [6 Sep 2008]. According to Zambian
News and Information Services (ZANIS), no deaths have been recorded
since the disease broke out late in August 2008. All the patients
admitted at the cholera center are responding to the treatment, ZANIS
said.

The source of the disease is due to contamination of water villagers
fetch from shallow wells, which they also use to wash their clothes
and cooking, according to ZANIS. Health staff also issued a circular
to discourage people from converging in groups following the cholera
outbreak.

A cholera outbreak in the Maradi region of Niger's economic capital
(about 700 km (435 mi) east of Niamey) has killed 3 people, according
to initial reports by the regional health authorities who set up a
camp to quarantine patients at the district health center, a reliable
source told APA on Thursday [4 Sep 2008].

The 1st cases were recorded late in August 2008 when the health
centers were stormed by patients suffering from diarrhea and vomiting
in Bagalam, a district known to be dirty and with a high human
density. An official with the Maradi integrated health center told
APA that the situation seems to have calmed down even though there
were still grounds for concern as this epidemic coincides with
Ramadan during which the consumption of raw vegetables increases.

As the administrative district of the region named after it, Maradi
city is one of Niger's most populated cities and also a commercial
center of attraction for the local population and others in
neighboring states like northern Nigeria.

An outbreak of cholera has claimed at least 9 lives in Chitungwiza,
Zimbabwe, and another 30 people have been admitted to the central
hospital in the Harare satellite town. Unconfirmed reports said as
many as 19 people had died at the hospital since Tuesday [2 Sep 2008].

The worst affected areas of Chitungwiza were said to Units O and Unit
K where burst sewer pipes have long been a common sight. Local
sources added that residents are drawing water from unprotected wells
because the local water supply system has broken down. A Chitungwiza
municipal official said authorities have sent bowsers, or water
tanker trucks, to the affected areas to provide residents with clean
drinking water.
