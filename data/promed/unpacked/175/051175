Two Haldimand [county] horses have tested positive for a serious equine virus. The horses, which are housed in the Dunnville area, tested positive earlier this month [August 2018] for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus after showing neurological symptoms, the Haldimand-Norfolk health unit announced [Wed 15 Aug 2018].

The health unit has not had a report of a horse positive for the virus since 2009. "This serves notice that the virus continues to circulate in the area," the health unit said.

The virus, also known as "triple E" or "sleeping sickness," affects mostly horses and birds and is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.

It also can be transmitted to humans through mosquitoes, said the health unit, noting that most people infected will not develop symptoms.

However, severe cases can cause headaches, high fevers, chills, and vomiting. The illness can then progress into disorientation, seizures, and even coma.

The health unit said it has received no reports of human cases in Haldimand or Norfolk. And its mosquito surveillance program has had none of the insects test positive for the virus to date.

"With recent surveillance finding mosquitoes positive for West Nile virus and now 2 horses with eastern equine encephalitis, it's clear we shouldn't become complacent when it comes to protecting ourselves from mosquito bites," Kris Lutzi, senior public health inspector, said in a news release.

The health unit offered a few tips to protect residents from mosquito bites. They include: apply insect repellent containing DEET or picaridin, wear light-coloured clothing, long sleeves and pants, if possible, and remove standing water from your property.

Removing all standing water sites from your property is also a good idea for horse owners.

The health unit also suggests making sure barns have tight-fitting screens over windows and doors and using yellow incandescent or fluorescent lights because they considered less attractive to mosquitoes.

On [8 and 9 Aug 2018], the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) was notified of 2 confirmed cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in horses in Haldimand County.

Both horses, from separate farms, were unvaccinated for EEE and had no history of travel. They were euthanized following the sudden onset and progression of neurological signs. Laboratory diagnostic testing confirmed infection with EEE virus. Private veterinarians have confirmed 3 more horses have demonstrated acute onset of neurological disease within a 5 kilometre [3 mi] radius of these 2 horses and 2 have been euthanized.

Veterinarians in Ontario should consider EEE as a differential diagnosis in horses exhibiting neurological signs and can identify positive cases through appropriate testing. IgM antibodies to the EEE virus (EEEv) can be detected in serum from horses with neurological signs. Clinical signs of EEE including circling, head-pressing, ataxia, and depression, can mimic a variety of encephalitides including rabies, West Nile virus (WNV), botulism, hepatic encephalopathy, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, and equine herpes myeloencephalopathy. Most equine cases of EEE in Ontario occur between August and October and end with the onset of frost.

Effective equine vaccines for EEE are available and veterinarians should encourage clients to keep their horse's vaccinations current. Once clinical infection develops, treatment options are limited to supportive care. The mortality rate in unvaccinated horses is high.

EEEv affects mainly equine species in eastern North America, but can occasionally cause severe disease in humans, including permanent brain damage or death. EEEv has also caused fatal infections in pheasants, quail, captive whooping cranes, emus, and dogs.

EEEv has been present in the Ontario horse population since 1938. Equine neurological cases are posted on the OMAFRA website (http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/westnile.htm).

Ontario's local public health units are conducting mosquito surveillance for both WNV and EEEv. Birds are the natural hosts for both viruses, which are transmitted to horses and humans by mosquitoes which have bitten an infected bird. As of [8 Aug 2018] no mosquito pools have tested positive for EEEv.

[These 2 articles from Canada may refer to the same equine cases but it is not clear these are the same 2 horses just because the area is the same. The reporting entities are different and there are helpful information in each of the articles.

The overall theme on this and today's report from the USA (archive no. 20180820.5975634) is that owners are failing to vaccinate their animals. There is an effective vaccine. Mosquitoes carry the virus and mosquito control is also important in controlling this disease. - Mod.TG
