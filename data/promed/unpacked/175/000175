[Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is caused by a type strain for avian
paramyxoviruses.

NDV is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting most species of
birds. Clinical signs are extremely variable depending on the strain of
virus, species and age of bird, concurrent disease, and preexisting immunity.

NDV is spread primarily through direct contact between healthy birds and
the bodily discharges of infected birds. The disease is transmitted through
infected birds' droppings and secretions from the nose, mouth, and eyes.
NDV spreads rapidly among birds kept in confinement, such as commercially
raised chickens.

NDV affects the respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems. Signs are very
variable depending on the strain of virus, species of bird, concurrent
disease and preexisting immunity.
