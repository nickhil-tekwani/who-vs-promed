_Trichinella britovi_ in wolves, Switzerland
--------------------------------------------
Wolves were extinct in Switzerland in the 1st part of the last century.
Within the past years, however, individual animals have increasingly
crossed the border, especially coming from Italy. Most of these immigrating
animals have been legally or illegally killed at sites close to the crossed
frontier. In March 2006, however, a wolf was accidentally killed by a
train, but in the central part of the Swiss Alps, indicating a more
prominent immigration activity.
The wolf was molecular-genetically tracked as originating from a north west
Italian wolf population. The dead wolf carcass underwent pathological and
infectiological investigation on a regular basis, with special attention to
potential zoonotic parameters. The wolf was found to harbor _Trichinella_
muscle stage larvae. Using multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction), the
isolate was identified as _Trichinella britovi_.
Although _Trichinella britovi_ is known to affect the Swiss fox and lynx
population, it has so far never been seen in other animal species,
especially not within the Swiss domestic pig or wild boar population.
Historically, _Trichinella_ spp. has not occurred in Swiss pigs and wild
boars for multiple decades. Nevertheless, the potential transmission risk
in pigs has theoretically increased due to a rise in the number of pigs
being kept under free-range grazing conditions.
Wildlife carcasses harboring _Trichinella_ may lie around for weeks or
months and may thus become accessible for other omnivorous hosts, such as
rats, wild boars or even free-ranging pigs, all potentially feeding on
carrion if offered. _Trichinella britovi_ muscle stage larvae can survive
in wildlife carrion, especially during winter, for months. Consequently,
immigrating wolves have to be epidemiologically considered as a new
introducing source for _Trichinella_ into Switzerland and thus require
respective surveillance.

[_T.britovi_ has been found in wild boars from Belgium and France,
including Corsica, and in free-ranging pigs in Sardinia, showing that _T.
britovi_ is a public health risk to humans. In particular, meat from wild
boars used in sausages poses a risk of infection. - Mod.EP]
