STREP. PNEUMONIAE, PENICILLIN-RESISTANCE AND OTITIS MEDIA

A ProMED-mail post

Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph), Sept. 2, 1997 (from an
American Academy of Otolaryngology press release)
A new study offers first documentation that PRSP [penicillin-resistant
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_] causes chronic middle ear infection. The
judicious use of antibiotic therapy in treating this common childhood medical
disorder is recommended.
A new prospective study provides the first documentation that PRSP is a
pathogen in causing otitis media with effusion (infection of the middle ear)
in young children. The presence of PRSP is significant for this common
childhood ailment is regularly treated with antibiotics and in some cases, the
insertion of tympanostomy tubes. This finding was made by Patrick J.
Fitzgerald, MD, of Stanford University, and Joseph B. Robertson, Jr., MD,
and Christina Laane, MS, both from Palo Alto, CA.
The results of the research [are to be] presented at the 101st Annual Meeting
of the American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Foundation,
which [will be] held at the Moscone Center, San Francisco, CA on September 7-
10, 1997. The meeting is the largest gathering for otolaryngologists,
physicians who specialize in the medical and surgical treatment of the ears,
nose, throat and related structures of the head and neck.
Methodology: Middle ear aspirates (discharges) were obtained from 50
consecutive children (mean age of 4.35 years) at the time of tympanostomy
tube placement for chronic otitis media with effusion. Some 49 of the
cultures were available for review.
Results: The examination of the discharges revealed that 23 of 49 contained
growth with pathogenic bacteria. The most common pathogens were _Haemophilus
influenzae_ (6/23), _Moraxella catarrhalis_ (6/23), and _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_ (5/23), two of the latter were identified as PRSP. Treating
otitis media with effusion with antibiotics has been a standard of care.
Now, with PRSP as a possible pathogen for this disorder, physicians must
ensure that the antibiotics they prescribe for ear drainage after placement
of tympanostomy tubes are effective against PRSP.
[With _H. pylori_ implicated in ulcers, _Chlamydia_ in heart disease, other
organisms in early-onset diabetes (type I) and now this, it's becoming
clearer [microorganisms] are involved in more disease than ever previously
thought. -- RAL]
