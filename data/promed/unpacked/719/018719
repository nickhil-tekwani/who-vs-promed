The Agriculture Ministry said yesterday that it has discovered a suspected
case of bird flu at a poultry farm in Iksan, in the south west of the
country [map at <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KS/3/Iksan.html>].

Health inspectors are now conducting tests after about 6000 of the 13 000
chickens at the farm died between Sunday [19 Nov 2006] and Wednesday [22 Nov
2006], Kim Chang-seob, chief veterinary officer at the ministry, said at a
briefing.

Kim said the government was informed of the incident on Wednesday, raising
alarm that the large number of deaths may be an indication the virus is of a
virulent strain.

The discovery comes as the country is on a high bird flu alert as migratory
birds, which can easily spread the life-threatening disease, fly to the
Korean peninsula for the winter, the ministry said. "We have closed the farm
and halted the movement of any poultry or eggs from the farm," Kim said. The
ministry also issued an order to temporarily close 2 hatcheries in the area
as further investigations will be conducted. A 10 km radius around the farm
will be quarantined.

Kim said the ministry expects to confirm whether the poultry had been
infected with bird flu on Saturday. The official said the chickens show
signs of bird flu, but was careful not to speculate that it was of the
potentially deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza.

Korea reported its 1st outbreak of H5N1 in Dec 2003. About 5.3 million
chickens and ducks valued at 150 billion won (USD 161 million) were
slaughtered within 4 months.

The H5N1 virus is known to have infected 258 people in 10 countries over the
past 3 years, killing 153 of them, according to the Geneva-based World
Health Organization. During 2006, 75 deaths have been recorded by WHO. This
is more than the United Nations agency counted in the previous 2 years
combined.

So far, Korea has reported no human H5N1 cases, according to the WHO

[The Republic of Korea eradicated its 1st HPAI outbreak swiftly and
efficiently, being one of the very few countries which successfully regained
their status of official freedom from HPAI. See the OIE notification at
<ftp://ftp.oie.int/infos_san_archives/eng/2004/en_040924v17n39.pdf>. Results
of the current laboratory investigation are awaited with concern. - Mod.AS]
