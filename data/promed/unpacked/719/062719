Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Stanley infections linked to wood ear mushrooms
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Stanley infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 24 Sep 2020, a total of 41 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Stanley have been reported from 10 states.

Location / No. ill people

California / 25
Connecticut / 1
Georgia / 1
Illinois / 5
Louisiana / 1
New Jersey / 2
New York City / 1
Pennsylvania / 2
Wisconsin / 2
---------------
Total = 41

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 21 Jan 2020 to 26 Aug 2020. Ill people range in age from 2 to 74 years, with a median age of 27; 62% of ill people are female. Of 32 ill people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

WGS analysis of 26 bacterial isolates from ill people did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is underway.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback information show that wood ear mushrooms distributed by Wismettac Asian Foods, Inc. are the likely source of this outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 18 people with information, 16 (89%) reported eating ramen at a restaurant in the week before their illness started. Several people reported eating at the same ramen restaurants, showing they may be part of illness clusters.

A foodborne illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store in the week before becoming ill. Investigating illness clusters can provide critical clues about the source of an outbreak. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there.

Four illness clusters were identified at restaurants serving ramen in 3 states; 8 (89%) of the 9 ill people linked to restaurant clusters reported eating wood ear mushrooms or ramen containing wood ear mushrooms in the week before their illness started.

The FDA and states are conducting a traceback investigation to identify the source of the wood ear mushrooms eaten by ill people. Review of records collected to date [24 Sep 2020] identified that Wismettac Asian Foods, Inc. supplied wood ear mushrooms (dried fungus) to the illness cluster restaurants.

The California Department of Public Health collected dried fungus at one of the restaurants linked to an illness cluster for testing. Testing identified _Salmonella_ in a sample of dried fungus distributed by Wismettac Asian Foods, Inc. WGS analysis is being done to determine if the _Salmonella_ identified in the dried fungus is the same as the _Salmonella_ from ill people.

On 24 Sep 2020, Wismettac Asian Foods, Inc. issued a recall (https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/wismettac-asian-foods-voluntarily-recalls-dried-fungus-due-potential-salmonella-contamination) of all Shirakiku imported dried fungus after the California Department of Public Health found _Salmonella_ in the product. Restaurants should not sell or serve recalled wood ear mushrooms distributed by Wismettac Asian Foods, Inc.

This investigation is ongoing, and the CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

[_Auricularia auricula-judae_, known most commonly as wood ear, jelly ear, or by a number of other common names, is a species of edible Auriculariales fungus found worldwide. The fruiting body is distinguished by its noticeably ear-like shape and brown colouration; it grows on wood, especially elder. The fungus can be found throughout the year in temperate regions worldwide, where it grows on both dead and living wood.

In the West, _A. auricula-judae_ was used in folk medicine as recently as the 19th century for complaints including sore throats, sore eyes and jaundice, and as an astringent. Although it is not widely consumed in the West, it has long been popular in China, to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early 20th century. Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as hot and sour soup, and also used in Chinese medicine. It is also used in Ghana as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that _A. auricula-judae_ has antitumour, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant and cholesterol-lowering properties.

How the mushrooms became contaminated with _S._ Stanley is unclear but likely occurred after harvesting. - Mod.LL
