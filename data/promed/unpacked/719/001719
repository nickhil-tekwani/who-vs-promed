Whirling Disease Infects Hatchery
--------------------
Whirling disease has been detected at a southern Utah fish hatchery
producing hundreds of thousands of trout this year for nearly 3 dozen
previously untainted bodies of water.
Fishery biologists found clues of the cartilage-curving disease in May 2002
during routine tests at the Mammoth Creek Fish Hatchery near Hatch in
Garfield County and then retested rainbow trout at the hatchery this month
to confirm their worst suspicions.
"This is a whole new watershed," said Joe Valentine, aquatic culture
supervisor for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR). "We have
never had it here."
The Mammoth facility is the second state-owned hatchery blighted by
whirling disease since 1991, when it was first detected in Utah at the Dry
Valley hatchery in Loa, which is owned by Gov. Mike Leavitt's family.
The state's Midway hatchery, one of 10, was closed 2 years ago when
whirling disease was found there. While state biologists don't know how the
disease entered Mammoth, it may be too late to save the hatchery.
"Whirling disease is forever," Valentine said. "Yep, it doesn't go away."
Most of the fish at the Mammoth hatchery probably will be killed and
disposed of in a landfill. Wild rainbow and brown trout populating upper
Mammoth Creek, which biologists confirmed is also tainted, will not be
killed, but will be forever plagued by the disease, which attacks trout and
salmon. As it progresses, whirling disease curves a fish's spine, causing
the fish to swim in semi-circles just before death.
"[Disease-carrying] spores last about 30 years," Valentine said. "They are
pretty hardy. They don't die easily. They can stand freezing. They live in
dirt. They can stand anything but cooking."
DWR has not yet tested Mammoth Spring, which feeds the hatchery, for the
disease.
Meanwhile, fishery biologists are testing the 33 bodies of water that have
recently received 250 000 fish from the Mammoth facility, including Lower
Enterprise Reservoir, Ken's Lake, Kolob Reservoir, Navajo Lake, Newcastle
Reservoir, Panguitch Lake, Pine Lake, Paragonah Reservoir, and Yankee
Meadow Reservoir.
Whirling disease has spread to many of Utah's prime watersheds since 1991.
While the disease was once thought to strike a deathblow for a fishery,
rivers such as the Madison in Montana continue to thrive despite contamination.
Some believe the disease is less virulent in cold water. If true, this
theory spells trouble for Utah's latest outbreak, which is centered in warm
water.
"This is of great concern," said Byron Gunderson, owner of Fish Tech
Outfitters in Holladay. "This is where they have low water and hot water,
where the impact of whirling disease will be greater felt than in the
northern water."
An emergency response team is working on a plan to respond to the outbreak,
said Randy Radant, DWR's Aquatics Section chief.
"We'll shift some of the fish from other hatcheries to waters that would
normally have been stocked by Mammoth Creek," Radant said. "This is a good
year to do that because drought conditions have reduced the number of
waters we can stock, so we have fish we can stock in these waters."
A renovated hatchery at Fountain Green in central Utah will be fully
operational next year to help replace some of the fish Mammoth would have
stocked.

[Whirling disease is caused by the protozoan parasite _Myxobolus
cerebralis_. It poses no known health hazard to humans who handle or
consume fish, nor to any animal other than fish. It has a 2-stage life
cycle involving trout or salmon and aquatic Tubifex worms. When fish eat
infected worms or ingest the spores they release, the parasite attacks the
head and gills, damaging the cartilage surrounding the brain. This causes
CNS damage leading to erratic swimming, tail-chasing, and whirling. It is
not always fatal. On death, spores are released and are ingested by the
Tubifex. Birds or predatory fish that eat infected fish or worms
contribute to the spread. - Mod.TG]
