Twenty-four cattle from Jeli have been confirmed with foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD], the 1st case reported in the State [Kelantan] this
year [2007].
Kelantan Veterinary Department deputy director, Dr. Sulaiman Abdul
Kadir, said the latest case, involving cattle owned by 6 rearers from
Kampung Air Satan near Batu Melintang, was reported to the
authorities on 31 Jan 2007.
"The department has sent officers to immediately carry out
vaccination in the area to prevent the disease from spreading," he
said.
Sulaiman said the department believed that illegal movement of
affected cattle had contributed to the case.
Last year [2006], the department recorded 28 FMD cases with 184
cattle affected. The highest number was recorded in Jeli, followed by
Tanah Merah, Pasir Putih, and Kuala Krai.
Kelantan has more than 40 000 rearers with about 110 000 cattle. The
department vaccinated about 49 000 cattle to curb the disease last
year [2006].
On avian influenza, he said, the department had taken about 700
samples including chicken reared by villages and fighting cocks. "The
samples were from all districts and the results so far showed that
the State is free from the disease," he said.
