Often considered as "unattended" or "forgotten", paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) has returned to cause a state of alert in northeastern Argentina. There has not only been in increase in cases but also the emergence of a new clinical form that affects children and young people with a rapid and severe course.

PCM is a systemic fungal infection caused by the genus _Paracoccidioides_, which is unique to Latin America and neighboring countries such as Brazil. The fungus exists in the environment and enters the body by inhalation. Science has been unable to determine its exact ecological niche.

The NEA is included in the endemic region, where historically this disease has been described in a chronic clinical form in adults, but in recent years, cases have occurred that triggered alarm in the scientific community. These cases have affected infant and young patients as never before, some of them in urban areas.

But what is most worrying is that, among this segment [of the population], the disease progresses quickly, is progressive, and can be fatal if diagnosed late or inaccurately. For the last few years, a team of researchers from the Department of Mycology of the Regional Institute of Medicine of the UNNE, headed by Dr Gustavo Giusiano, has been closely monitoring the evolution of the disease in the region and Dr Giusano has activated the alarm.

"In the past 2 years the frequency of cases of PCM in general has increased 5-fold compared with previous years, but with epidemiological characteristics different from those historically known; previously the chronic form affected only adults in rural areas," said Dr Giusiano.

Until 2006 it was thought that the only causative agent of PCM was the fungus _Paracoccidioides brasiliensis_, but the discovery that _Paracoccidioides_ includes several species and genotypes may be one of the explanations for the emergence of these variants of clinical forms. The range of possibilities includes environmental reasons as a result of the Yacyreta dam, changes in the types of crops grown, the movement of soils and agrochemicals, and the socio-economic situation.

[Paracoccidioidomycosis (also known as Brazilian blastomycosis, South American blastomycosis, Lutz-Splendore-de Almeida disease and paracoccidioidal granuloma), is a fungal infection caused by the fungus _Paracoccidioides brasiliensis_. However, paracoccidioidomycosis is caused by a different fungus than that which causes blastomycosis.

_P. brasiliensis_ is another of the dimorphic fungi that exist in the soil and environment as a mold but when spores enter the body, usually via the respiratory route, a yeast develops that is the pathologic form for humans. It is interesting that the scientific name relates it to coccidiodomycosis, but it is often called South American blastomycosis, and its presentation tends to be more similar to histoplasmosis, with either acute or chronic lung involvement or dissemination to the liver, spleen and bone marrow with or without gastrointestinal ulcers.

The infection is limited to the Latin American countries with the most important regions of endemicity in Brazil, Columbia and Venezuela.

The yeast form found in lesions in the body has a very characteristic multibudding appearance, sometimes called "pilot's wheel budding" as shown at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paracoccidioides_brasiliensis_01.jpg.

In recent years, a separate species of the genus has been characterized, _P. lutzii_, which can be serologically distinguished from _P. brasiliensis_ . (Gegembauer G, Mendes Araujo L, Pereira ED, FM, et al. Serology of paracoccioidomycosis due to _Paracoccidoides lutzii_. PLoS Neglect Trop dis 2014;8:e2986). It is not clear if the pathogenicity of the 2 species differ. - Mod.LL
