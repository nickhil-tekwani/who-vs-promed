State investigates Dairyland dog deaths
---------------------------------------
State investigators are trying to determine what caused the deaths of
6 greyhounds at the Dairyland dog track in Kenosha, including 4 that
bled to death.

The Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection is
testing the food the dogs ate to see if the deaths are due to a
food-borne illness.

The state Division of Gaming is also investigating. Gaming
administrator Bob Sloey says 2 dogs that died last weekend [17-18 Oct
2009] came from different kennels. The 1st 4 deaths, since August
[2009], involved dogs from the same kennel operator.

The investigation comes as dog track operators decide the future of
Dairyland. It lost USD 3.4 million last year [2008]. Attendance so
far this year is down 19 percent.

[Perhaps the top differential should be anticoagulants, of which
there are a number of different forms. They are most often known as
rodenticides. The article does not give us enough clinical signs to
list differentials, but speculation may include aflatoxin, in
addition to rodenticides, and perhaps even mycotoxins or perhaps
mushrooms. Hopefully samples have been submitted to the diagnostic
lab in Wisconsin.

The evidence presented in this article is sketchy at best. We would
appreciate an authoritative source providing more information. - Mod.TG]

[One also can't help but wonder if this event is accidental or
intentional. - Mod.MPP]
