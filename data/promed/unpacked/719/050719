Wild chimpanzees have been found to be infected with leprosy for the 1st time, in 2 locations in West Africa that are separated by hundreds of miles.

Experts discovered 2 wild chimp populations, in Guinea-Bissau's Cantanhez National Park and Tai National Park in Ivory Coast, that are infected with the disease, as confirmed by faecal samples.

Leprosy -- which is caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_, a species of bacteria -- once caused misery to millions of humans across the planet, with colonies set up to isolate the sick from civilisation.

The chronic infectious disease causes gruesome skin lesions and, if left untreated, nerve damage that can result in crippling of hands and feet, paralysis, blindness, and loss of body parts.

It has been controlled in humans with antibiotics since the 1980s, and researchers once thought it had been wiped out in the animal kingdom.

But in the last 2 decades, scientists have found it spreading in red squirrels in the UK and armadillos in the Americas, and now, wild chimps.

Conservation scientist Dr Kimberley Hockings at the University of Exeter and wildlife veterinarian Dr Fabian Leendertz from Robert Koch Institute, Germany are among the authors of a pre-print paper describing the findings, which are also covered in Science Magazine.

'There are at least 4 chimpanzees among 3 different communities in Cantanhez National Park, Guinea-Bissau, that have severe leprosy,' Dr Hockings told MailOnline.

'In Tai National Park in the Ivory Coast, leprosy has only been detected in one chimpanzee community and did not seem to spread to neighbouring communities.'

In humans, prevalence of leprosy depends on access to treatment, but no chimpanzees in the wild have ever received treatment for leprosy.

'Leprosy is very easy to treat in humans, but administering antibiotics to wild unhabituated chimpanzees would be a real challenge,' Hockings told MailOnline

The new-discovered infected chimps are unlikely to have got the disease from infected humans, the experts believe, indicating an unknown source of leprosy in the wild.

Theories are the leprosy-causing bacteria could be found in an animal the chimpanzees hunt or in the environment where the animals live.

Leprosy is actually caused by 2 species of bacteria -- _Mycobacterium leprae_ as well as the more recently confirmed _M. lepromatosis_ -- although faecal samples confirmed the presence of the former as the cause of the disease for chimps at the 2 sites.

Professor Anne Stone, an evolutionary geneticist at Arizona State University who was not involved in the study, says leprosy dates back millions of years and may have inflicted beings long before humans evolved.

'The data increasingly point to the possibility that something else than humans is actually the main host,' she said.

For the moment, the infected chimpanzees seem to be coping with their illness, although one is losing weight.

Unfortunately, treating them is not really an option, according to Dr Leendertz, as they're wild animals and unused to humans.

'Humans have to take antibiotics for months to treat leprosy. You just can't do that with these wild animals,' said Dr Leendertz.

For now, the disease does not appear to put the groups as a whole at risk but it's another risk to chimps, which also face the threats of poaching, habitat loss, and other diseases.

Naturally acquired leprosy has previously been described in captive non-human primates, and, likewise, the exact origins of infection had been unclear.

For years, researchers had thought leprosy afflicted only humans, but over the past 2 decades, scientists found the leprosy bacteria circulating in nine-banded armadillos in the Americas and in red squirrels in the UK.

Both species harbour the same bacterial genotype, called 3I, which has been linked to medieval European outbreaks.

Leprosy develops very slowly, and although it is an infectious disease, not all chimps or humans that are exposed to the bacteria will go to develop it.

In 2012, the number of chronic cases of leprosy in humans was 189 000, down from some 5.2 million in the 1980s, with India accounting for more than half of all cases.

The illness is renowned for being extremely slow to develop. The bacteria reproduce slowly and people may not develop symptoms for decades after being exposed.

The average time is around 5 years, but some people may not develop signs for more than 20 years after coming into contact with the bacteria.

Symptoms of leprosy include patches of discoloured skin, numbness, muscle weakness, eye problems, a blocked nose, and nosebleeds and ulcers on the soles of the feet.

More than 200 000 people are thought to be diagnosed with the disease worldwide, with 60 per cent of cases in India. Brazil and Indonesia also have relatively large numbers of infections, while the rest are scattered around the world.

Historically thought to have been a contagious skin disease which led to societies banishing victims to 'leper' colonies, scientists now believe the illness spreads -- slowly -- if people inhale bacteria.

The illness can cause progressive nerve damage, weakness, and the breakdown of limbs, flesh, and facial features if left untreated, but antibiotics can now clear it up.

[Mycobacteria causing leprosy were previously only reported in humans and armadillos. More recently, _Mycobacterium leprae_ and the novel _M. lepromatosis_ were reported in wild red squirrels. The _M. leprae_ found in red squirrels originates from a medieval human strain, whereas the strain of _M. lepromatosis_ diverged from Mexican strains around 27 000 years ago. Mycobacteria are very hard to eradicate and wildlife species appear to play a role in their maintenance.

The origin, ecology, and significance of the disease caused by these mycobacteria in chimpanzees need to be investigated. The emergence of a new disease may cause a dramatic impact on a population, and we are currently experiencing it with COVID-19. It should be determined if _M. leprae_ infection in wild chimps represents a new scenario or it has been going on undetected for long. Screening of archived chimpanzee feces showed that traces of the mycobacteria was present in the population of one of the parks in 2009. Scientists also managed to sequence bacterial genomes from current fecal samples and found that the genotypes found are rare in humans. This suggests that the source of these episodes is not humans and there might be another unidentified wild reservoir. This is another example where a 'One Health' transdisciplinary approach is required.
