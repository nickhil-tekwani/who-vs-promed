Malaysia: Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease Cases in Sarawak Reach 13 800
-----------------------------------------------
Sarawak state in eastern Malaysia has detected 23 new cases of Hand,
Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in the past 24 hours, an official said
on Sun 20 Aug 2006. Among the new cases reported up to 10 a.m. local
time (0200 GMT) on Sunday, 10 children have been hospitalized, said
State Deputy Chief Minister George Chan. Six of the children were
admitted to the Miri hospital, 2 to the hospital in Bintulu and the
rest in Sibu and Limbang, said Chan, who is also Chairman of the
State Disaster Relief Management Committee.
The latest figure brought the total number of children infected since
the disease broke out early this year [2006] to 13 800, Chan said at
a news conference in Kuching, capital of the state. Throughout the
state, Sibu registered the highest number with 3025 cases, followed
by Miri (2872), Kuching (2125), Bintulu (1761) and Sarikei (946). So
far, the disease has claimed 13 lives, including 7 who have tested
positive for Enterovirus 71 (EV71).
HFMD can be spread from person to person by direct contact with the
nasal discharge, saliva, feces and fluid from the rash of an infected
person and indirectly by contaminated articles. Children are more
vulnerable to the disease, while adults can carry the virus without
showing any symptoms of infection, said local health authorities.

[According to Podin et al. (BMC Public Health. 2006 Jul 7;6:18),
since 1997, Sarawak has experienced 3 major outbreaks of human
enterovirus 71 infection, in 1997, 2000 and 2003. The predominant
strains circulating in these outbreaks were from genogroup B,
although the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically
distinct from each other. Human enterovirus 71 outbreaks have
occurred in a cyclical pattern every 3 years, with Coxsackievirus A16
co-circulated with human enterovirus 71. It is to be hoped that when
the current outbreak subsides, a period of 2 years remission can be
expected. - Mod.CP]
