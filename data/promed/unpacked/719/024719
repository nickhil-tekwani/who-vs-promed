[Reporting of animal disease occurrence in North Korea is a most
welcome development. Subscribers are referred to the notifiers' claim
that this is the 1st (reported) occurrence of FMD since 1960.
Data on the origin of the (legally, as indicated) imported, FMD-O
infected animals will be of interest and value.
North-Korea's neighbour on the north, People's Republic of China, has
sent to the OIE an immediate notification and 4 follow-up reports on
FMD outbreaks since the beginning of 2007. All of them caused by FMDV
serotype Asia 1, none of them adjacent to the N.Korean frontiers. -
