CEREAL RUST UPDATE - USA (09)

The small grain harvest has commenced from southwestern New York to
northern South Dakota. Drought-like conditions are common in the
most of the northern small grain area, which will hasten crop maturity.
Wheat stem rust.
----------------
Wheat stem rust has been reported on susceptible spring wheat in the
northern plains. In mid-July 2006, trace to 10 percent severities of
wheat stem rust were observed on the susceptible spring wheat
cultivar Baart in southern and west central Minnesota and east
central North Dakota. All of the current spring wheat cultivars are
resistant to the prevalent U.S. race population. Earlier in the
year, there were few reports of wheat stem rust in the southern U.S.
grain growing area. Stem rust observation maps are now available on
the CDL website (<http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=9757>).
Wheat leaf rust.
----------------
Wheat leaf rust is present in low to high severity levels on spring
wheat cultivars in the northern plains. In mid-July 2006, trace to
60 percent leaf rust severities were observed on flag leaves of
spring wheat cultivars in fields and plots from north central South
Dakota to west central Minnesota. In early July 2006, high levels of
leaf rust severity were found on susceptible winter wheat in plots in
southeastern North Dakota and in mid-July 2006 high levels of
infection were found in spring wheat fields in north central North
Dakota. Many wheat fields have been sprayed with fungicide to
prevent losses due to rust and scab. Hot dry weather combined with
severe leaf rust infections will kill the flag leaves of spring
wheat. In early July, low levels of leaf rust were found in winter
wheat plots at Ithaca, New York. In mid-July, leaf rust was very
light in experimental plots at Pullman and Mt. Vernon, Washington. No
rust was found in grower's fields.
Wheat stripe rust.
------------------
In mid-July, hot dry weather had stopped development of stripe rust
on spring wheat in the northern Great Plains. By mid-July, stripe
rust development has slowed in Pacific Northwest fields because of
the hot dry weather. In early July, 70-100 percent severities were
reported on susceptible entries in plots where moisture was not
limiting. Compared to last year, wheat stripe rust is lighter in the
Pacific Northwest.

[There are 3 main rust diseases of the cereal crop plant wheat (bread
wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_), all
caused by species of the fungus Puccinia: wheat stem rust (_P.
graminis f.sp. tritici_), wheat leaf rust (_P. triticina_ aka _P.
recondita f. sp. tritici_) and wheat stripe rust (_P. striiformis f.
sp. tritici_).
Severe losses due to wheat stem rusts have abated in the USA since
the 1960s due to effective resistance breeding. Severe losses are
still a possibility with leaf rust. The USDA Cereal Disease
Laboratory in St. Paul, MN publishes regular reports on cereal rusts
in the USA during the crop season. Each report gives detailed
state-by-state information, including a summary map, all in pdf file
format (see link to main article). Information for rusts other than
those that infect wheat is not included in this ProMED-mail posting
but others are described in the full report.
This report for mid July 2006 deals mostly with the more northerly
production areas in the USA and confirms that rusts are present on
susceptible lines and that fungicide treatments are still needed for
some commonly grown lines that do not have robust resistance.
