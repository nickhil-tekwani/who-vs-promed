BANANA BUNCHY TOP - PAKISTAN (SINDH) (02): CORRECTION

Randy Ploetz spotted an error in a ProMED-Plant piece that I had posted on
18 Oct 2004. The Daily News (Pakistan) had stated that the current outbreak
of Banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) in Sindh province "was not as serious
in Pakistan compared to other parts of the world, such as Australia,
Panama, Surinam, Central America, India and Colombia." With the exception
of Hawaii, BBTD has not been reported in any country in the Western
Hemisphere. A map of the distribution of BBTD in the world is given in the
link below.
According to Ploetz, the entries that do not include a + sign are countries
in which the presence of BBTV has not been confirmed. This does not mean
that assays for the virus were conducted, but negative. Symptoms of BBTD
are very distinct, so he is fairly certain that the disease is in the
listed countries regardless of whether or not assays have been conducted.
This data was published as Table 4.4 in: Randy C. Ploetz, John E. Thomas
and Walter Slabaugh (2003) Diseases of Banana and Plantain. In: R.C. Ploetz
(ed.) Diseases of Tropical Fruit Crops. CABI Publishing. Wallingford, UK.
