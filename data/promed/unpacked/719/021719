[It is rather surprising to be informed of continued spread of BTV-8 in cattle in France during the winter months, regarded as a non-vector season. New outbreaks have been reported in each of the weekly reports submitted to the OIE since the autumn of 2015. The affected area covers already most parts of continental France's surface, as illustrated in the updated (11 Feb 2016) official map issued by the Ministry of Agriculture (http://tinyurl.com/hnhg3tc; thanks to Dr Louis Musnier and Susan Baekeland for the link).

The current summary of the event since its start (21 Aug 2015), as presented in WAHID's archive updated 22 Feb 2016, is the following:

Total outbreaks = 191 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 32 322 / 272 / 1 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 2696 / 16 / 0 / 1 / 0
Sheep & goats / 161 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

The above summary, and OIE's map showing the locations of the 191 accumulated outbreaks, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019780_20160222_173855.pdf.

Since the start of the event, not a single mortality has been recorded among the 272 cattle reported as "cases" (within 191 "outbreaks"). In fact, no information could be obtained about clinical signs in these "cases." Even more puzzling is the situation in sheep, an animal species regarded as most susceptible (clinically) to the Bluetongue virus. Since the start of the event in August 2015, just 2 outbreaks have been reported in sheep, both on mixed cattle/sheep farms about 2 km distant from each other, as follows:

1. Location: Les brulards, Louroux de Bouble, Allier. Start, 21 Aug 2015 (Immediate notification, 11 Sep 2015)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 147 / 27 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 208 / 6 / 0 / 1 / 0

2. Location: Luzet, Louroux-de-Bouble, Allier. Start, 11 Sep 2015 (follow-up report No 1, 18 Sep 2015)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 144 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 141 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

ProMED-mail's repeated requests for clarification of the criteria according to which outbreaks are recorded and the event continuing during the winter, are pending. - Mod.AS
