A two-year-old boy, believed to have been killed by enterovirus 71 [EV71],
had developed acute encephalitis but did not show obvious hand-foot-&-mouth
disease [HFMD] symptoms, sources said yesterday. HFMD is an infectious
disease caused by several enteroviruses, including EV71. Symptoms include
[those of] flu, fever, rashes on the palms and soles and mouth ulcers.
Sources said the toddler, who attended a nursery, did not show obvious
symptoms, which made diagnosis difficult. "It is not very rare for such a
situation to happen," one doctor said. "The virus can get in the patient's
brain directly without causing any problems to the skin."
It is understood that medical workers later noticed that the boy's
three-year-old sister had a skin rash, leading to suspicion that the boy
might have contracted EV71. Tests were conducted on both of them immediately.
The Department of Health announced on Friday the boy was believed to have
died of EV71 infection on 14 May 1999. If confirmed, it will be the first
fatal EV71 infection in the SAR [Special Administrative Region].
The boy's sister also contracted the virus, while four other children at
the nursery also developed HFMD but all recovered.
