3 of the 6 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) identified [so far in 2015] have been brought into the nation [Taiwan] by Chinese immigrant spouses, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday.

CDC physician Chan Pei-chun said cases of MDR-TB account for approximately 1 percent of the average 10 000 new cases of tuberculosis recorded each year in Taiwan, adding that MDR-TB is defined by patients' resistance to 2 primary effective anti-tuberculosis drugs: isoniazid and rifampicin.

Citing an annual report on tuberculosis released by the WHO in 2014, the CDC said China reported about 54 300 new cases of MDR-TB in 2013, accounting for 5.7 percent of its new tuberculosis cases that year [2013].

Chan said among the 3 Chinese immigrant spouses detected with MDR-TB this year, a 36-year-old woman was confirmed with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) -- a relatively rare type of MDR-TB that is even more difficult to treat because of its resistance to even more types of drugs.

The XDR-TB infected woman had received MDR-TB treatment for 4 years (between 2009 and 2013) and underwent surgery in China before immigrating to Taiwan in 2012, Chan said, adding that the woman is now undergoing monitored treatment in a negative pressure isolation room.

Chan said the cure rate of MDR-TB in Taiwan is about 82 percent, but if the virus [sic] evolves into XDR-TB, the cure rate drops to about 50 percent, and the treatment process might take up to 2 years.

The CDC's data showed a total of 308 confirmed cases of Chinese immigrant spouses infected by tuberculosis, between 2011 and July 2015, with exchanges between China and Taiwan becoming more frequent.

Chan said the CDC has participated in 2 meetings with Chinese health departments [in September 2015] and is hoping to improve the treatment of Chinese immigrants infected by tuberculosis and prevent further spread of the virus [sic] by exchanging information on identified cases.

[For a discussion of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in China, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK195964/. WHO defines multidrug resistant TB (MDR TB) as an isolate resistant at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin, and extensively resistant TB (XDR TB) as an isolate resistant to INH and RIF (i.e., MDR TB) plus resistant to at least 1 of the fluoroquinolones and 1 of the following 3 injectable drugs: capreomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin.

A national survey of drug-resistant tuberculosis in China in 2007 revealed 5.7 percent of new cases had MDR TB and 25.6 percent of previously treated cases had MDR TB (Zhao et al., 2012 Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22670902). XDR TB (here defined as resistance to at least isoniazid, rifampin, ofloxacin, and kanamycin) rates were 0.47 percent for new cases, 2.06 percent for previously treated cases. Furthermore, among new cases, 1.8 percent of patients with MDR TB were already resistant to ofloxacin or kanamycin, as were 8.5 percent of previously treated patients.

In 2013, more than half of the global burden of MDR-TB is in 3 countries: India, China and the Russian Federation (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr14_supplement_web_v3.pdf). China had the 2nd-largest MDR TB burden among the 27 high-burden countries (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK195964/). High-burden countries have at least 4000 cases of MDR TB each year and/or at least 10 percent of newly registered TB cases are of MDR TB (http://www.tbfacts.org/drug-resistant-tb/).

In the U.S., the CDC reported that 1.3 percent of tuberculosis cases were MDR TB in 2011 and almost 83 percent of primary MDR TB cases were foreign-born persons in 2011 (http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/tuberculosis/factsheets/multidrug-resistant.html).

The 2nd-line drugs used in cases of MDR TB are often less effective, more costly, and more likely to cause side effects, and the cure rates decrease from over 90 percent for nonresistant strains of TB to 50 percent or less for MDR TB. It is estimated that 70 percent of XDR TB patients die within a month of diagnosis (http://www.tballiance.org/why/mdr-xdr.php ). - Mod.ML
