Anthrax outbreak in Bulgaria's Elenovo
--------------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak has been reported in the Bulgarian village of Elenovo, municipality of Popovo, district of Targovishte. After examining a sample from a calf with worsened health condition in the lands of the village of Elenovo, the District Food Safety Directorate announced anthrax outbreak in the settlement. The results were positive, the press office of the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency announced. All susceptible animals in the village will be vaccinated -- 329 cattle and 533 sheep. The farm where the infected animal was found will undergo disinfection.

[For a map of Bulgaria, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/bulgaria.jpg. Targovishte is in north east Bulgaria in what was once the Oblast of Ruse; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targovishte_Province -- with Popovo on its northern border.

Anthrax is sporadic in Bulgaria with Sumen being most commonly affected latterly, or reported. Ruse's last outbreak was in goats in 2010. Vaccination became local in 2010 from having been national a few years before. This is the usual pattern for surveillance and control once the incidence has become truly sporadic and in a few years, if vaccination is targeted at these sites, livestock anthrax will have effectively disappeared. That is if these "pop up" outbreaks are quickly reported so that they can be properly dealt with and ongoing contamination stopped. - Mod.MHJ
