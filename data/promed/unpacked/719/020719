During Week 49 (3-9 Dec) in 2017, 2 severe cases of enterovirus infection were newly confirmed (Figure 1); both of the cases were caused by EVD68. There have been 13 enterovirus infection cases with severe complications (EVSC) in 2017, including one death due to Coxsackie B3 infection. The majority of cases were below 6 years old (Table 1). The cases were caused by EVD68, Coxsackie A6, Coxsackie B3, ECHO 5, Coxsackie A2, and EV71. Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of these cases according to their residence [See URL for figures].

Even though enterovirus season has passed, there has been a recent increase in enterovirus-D68 cases, mainly found in children aged 5 years or less. EV-D68 infection presents mainly with fever, running nose, and cough; less frequently with herpangina or hand-foot-mouth disease typical of enterovirus infections. Taiwan CDC would like to remind parents to be aware of your kids' health. If children show acute limb paralysis, please seek medical assistance as soon as possible.

Taiwan CDC indicated that 2 additional cases of enterovirus infection with severe complications were confirmed last week. These were a 13-year-old living in northern Taiwan and a 5 year-old living in central Taiwan. The 2 cases began to have fever, cough, and running nose in late November and early December 2017, respectively, followed by upper or lower limb weakness. Laboratory testing confirmed infection by EV-D68.

As of today [12 Dec 2017], the 5-year-old child has been discharged from hospital, and the 13-year-old is still being treated in the hospital's ordinary ward. Of the 20 cases of EV D68 infection found this year [2017], 6 were confirmed enterovirus infections with severe complications.

["Enterovirus infection with severe complications" is reportable in Taiwan. Active surveillance began after the EV-71 outbreak. The case definition, however, tries to include all enterovirus infections, creating some complications. Cases classified to be "enterovirus infection with severe complications" have limb "weakness," which in Chinese can sometimes be interchangeable with "paralysis."

Enterovirus infections are common among infants and children and usually peak in spring and summer months, especially between April and June.

In Taiwan, enterovirus outbreaks occur approximately every 3-4 years. In 2005, the nation reported 142 cases of enterovirus infection with severe complications; in 2008 there were 373, and in 2012, a total of 153 cases were reported.

Human enterovirus D68 belongs to the enterovirus D species, enterovirus genus, Picornaviridae family. Biologically close to rhinoviruses, EV-D68 mainly has been associated with acute respiratory infection with clinical presentation ranging from mild to severe disease requiring intensive care. An epidemiologic association between AFM and EV-D68 infection among children with respiratory illness has been noted. Temporal associations have been reported between AFM clusters and increases in hospital admissions for respiratory symptoms and detection of EV-D68 in AFM case-patients. But a gap remains demonstrating cause and effect, which continued surveillance with timely and comprehensive specimen collection and testing for EV-D68 may help fill. - Mod.LK
