Physicians are investigating the cause of the disease, which caused
the death of a youth in Mirassolandia, 480 km (298 mi) from Sao Paulo
[city]. Parents of the victim and more than 20 people from the same
neighborhood sought medical attention with similar symptoms. The
16-year-old girl died after receiving medical attention at the city
health post.

The youth had 3 days of fever, headache, body ache, and vomiting. On
Sunday [31 Jan 2010] she was very ill and did not withstand her
transfer to the base hospital in Rio Preto.

The mother of the girl, her father, and a sister of 11 years also were
admitted to the hospital with the same symptoms. In Mirassolandia,
more than 20 people received first aid. All were from the same
neighborhood in which the [dead] youth resided. They presented with
fever, body ache, headache, and vomiting.

The health coordinator of Mirassolandia, who was not in the city,
reported by telephone that the results of the investigation, which
will reveal the cause of death of the youth, are awaited.

[This is interesting. There are several possibilities, one is
encephalitis (arbovirus?), even dengue (very likely). More details are
needed. - Mod.LJS]

[As Mod.LJS implied, the generalized symptoms that these cases
presented make a specific diagnosis difficult. In addition to the
arboviruses mentioned, other infections, such as leptospirosis and
hantavirus infections, need to be ruled out. ProMED-mail requests
further information as it becomes available.
