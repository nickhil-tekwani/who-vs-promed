LABOKRO, Ivory Coast, Aug 26 (Reuters): [The corn broth responsible for the
deaths of 27 Ivory Coast villagers, [the youngest 17 months old, appears
to have been contaminated with rat poison.
The woman who sold the broth showed no signs of illness and villagers said
she did not drink the broth. She [is being held for her own protection by
the local paramilitary gendarmerie, [who are treating the case as one of
accidental killing.
Maize "baca" is a cheap breakfast in the West African country, where
villagers typically survive on the equivalent of a few hundred dollars per
year. The woman selling the baca had helped support her family for years by
selling the broth without incident, and some said she could have added the
poison to her mixture by mistake. "She cooked the broth after nightfall, in
the dark," said Solange Ndri, explaining how the woman might have confused
sugar with poison for the rats infesting the village. Many villagers
suspect [she realized her mistake but, unaware of how deadly the rat
poison was, could not bear to lose the 4000 CFA franc (US $5.50) from
selling the broth.
The woman's 80 year old mother was among the dead, who vomited blood and
suffered severe diarrhea before expiring. It took a while for villagers to
notice [that something was wrong. The death of the first child did not
cause widespread alarm in a region where children often succumb to disease.
Villagers said the woman's responsibility was indicated in a local ritual
for finding witches and murderers in which one of the dead, in this case a
14 year old boy, is consulted. "We asked the body what was the cause of his
death. And the two people who were carrying the body were driven to her
courtyard, in front of the bowl where she used to cook the broth," local
councillor Aubin Kouadio Kouame said.
