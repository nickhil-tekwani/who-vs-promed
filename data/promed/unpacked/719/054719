3 teams were affected by a viral epidemic at the 3rd stage of the [Biathlon] World Cup in the Slovenian city of Pokljuka [in the Gorenjska statistical region]. Teams of athletes from Belarussia, Austria and Canada who were staying in the same hotel experienced serious health problems and did not take part in the competition.

On the eve of the Belarusian biathlon, one competitor was hospitalized in Ljubljana, and later another was hospitalized with gastrointestional symptoms. Minor ailments were also experienced by a 3rd athlete.

During the race a Canadian athlete became ill, fainted and fell on a downhill track.

Almost the entire Austrian national team was affected by the unknown virus. According to team doctor Burchart Huber, the true reason is not clear. "However, the most likely culprit is an airborne virus."

[Comment: While there is no official information, some sort of enterovirus may be affecting sportsmen in Slovenia. This could be rotavirus, norovirus, enterovirus, or other viral agents, transmitted via the fecal-oral or droplet route. - Corr.VM.

Acute gastroenteritis is one of the most common diseases in humans. You are most likely to contract viral gastroenteritis when you eat or drink contaminated food or water, or if you share utensils, towels or food with someone who is infected. A number of viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including:
- Noroviruses. Both children and adults are affected by noroviruses, the most common cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities. It's especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces. In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water, although person-to-person transmission also is possible.
- Rotavirus. Worldwide, this is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, who are usually infected when they put their fingers or other objects contaminated with the virus into their mouths. The infection is most severe in infants and young children. Adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms, but can still spread the illness -- of particular concern in institutional settings because infected adults unknowingly can pass the virus to others. A vaccine against viral gastroenteritis is available in some countries, including the United States, and appears to be effective in preventing the infection.
Excerpted from http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/viral-gastroenteritis/basics/causes/con-20019350.

Other possible causes of acute gastroenteritis include astrovirus, calicivirus and enteric adenovirus; and less commonly toroviruses, coronaviruses, picobirnaviruses and pestiviruses, which are increasingly being identified as causative agents of diarrhea.

Any additional information would be appreciated. - Mod.LK
