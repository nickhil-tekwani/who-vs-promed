Laboratory tests on samples collected from victims of the wedding reception food poisoning in Tanjung Dawai, which claimed 4 lives last week, confirmed chicken served was contaminated with salmonellae.

State Health Department director Dr Ismail Abu Taat said the 2nd test on the samples confirmed the presence of the bacterium, which can cause a food borne illness. However, he said that salmonella bacteria are commonly found in livestock, and the department concluded that those who prepared the dish failed to clean the chicken properly.

Dr Ismail said earlier investigations revealed that the chicken used for the ayam masak merah dish had been sent to the host in Kampung Huma a day before the wedding reception. "The chicken was sent to the house on Friday [4 Oct 2013?] evening, but it was only cooked at 4:00 pm the next day. This had allowed the bacteria to replicate in the chicken."

"Investigation also revealed that the chicken was contaminated and gave off a foul smell. However, those who prepared the dish only removed the spoiled portion and cooked the meat," he said.

More than 280 guests, including the bride's family, suffered symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting; after the feast, 4 guests died.

Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam said illness can also occur when there is a long delay between preparing and consuming food.

The Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Ministry will investigate the claim that chicken imported from Thailand was the cause of foodborne illness that killed 4 people in Kedah recently. Its minister, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, said that, so far, the ministry had not received any report on this claim, but that it will be investigated to determine whether the imported chicken contained life-threatening bacteria.

"We will inform and seek the cooperation of the Health Ministry to further investigate the matter."

Four people died after consuming a chicken dish, "ayam masak merah," said to be contaminated with salmonella bacteria, served at a wedding feast in Kampung Huma, Tanjung Dawai in Merbok, Kedah on 28 Sep 2013.

[Salmonellosis may well have a fatal outcome, particularly in the very young and the elderly and those with immunodeficiencies, especially involving the humoral immune system. Co-existing illnesses in the fatalities were not, however, mentioned.

ProMED thanks Philip Henika for the 2nd report. Whether the fowl originated in Thailand or Malaysia or even the USA is really a moot point, since the reports strongly imply that kitchen hygiene and refrigeration were quite inadequate. - Mod.LL
