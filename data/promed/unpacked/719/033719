NEW DISEASE OUTBREAKS - OIE
BSE - DENMARK
----------------
[See also BSE - Denmark 20000229195753
BSE - Denmark (02): European response 20000303094222
BSE, regulations - Denmark 20000303083507]
The second case of BSE in Denmark has been identified by the Danish
Veterinary Laboratories and confirmed by VLA at Weybridge, UK. The only
other case of BSE in Denmark was 8 years ago in August, 1992 in a 5 year
old cow imported from the UK in 1988. A ban on feeding ruminant protein was
introduced in June 1990 and extend to include mammalian protein in January,
1997.
The current case was killed on 20 January, 2000 after suspicion of BSE. The
affected cow was born and reared on a farm in Jutland which has not
purchased animals since its founding in 1976. There are 30 dairy cows, 20
pregnant heifers and 20 "young bovines" as well as 4 sows. Animals were fed
crops from the farm and supplemented with feed from a local feed mill. The
source of the infection is unknown. The OIE report states that the herd has
been placed under quarantine.
[Preben Willeberg, the Chief Veterinary Officer, has issued reports
subsequent to the OIE text (for details see BSE, regulations - Denmark
20000303083507). He indicates that the herd will be slaughtered and
incinerated. Surveillance will be enhanced for emergency slaughter
situations and fallen stock ("downer cows"). Attempts will be made to
confirm that the source of infection is suspected supplemented feed - a
conclusion based on the absence of other likely sources. Surveillance
cohorts of exposed animals will be identified if possible. Consumer safety
measures and export restrictions have been implemented. It will be
interesting to see if we have a repeat of the single case that occurred in
1992 despite the difference in the epidemiology, or if there a trickle of
cases or a flood. We will do our best to keep abreast of things. -Mod. PC]
WHITE SPOT DISEASE, SHRIMP - PANAMA
------------------------------------------
In January, 1999 white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was reported in Central
America. Initial sampling of 20 farms in Panama has revealed 11 positive
farms in the provinces of Veraguas, Herrera, Los Santos, Cocle and Panama.
Sanitation, movement restriction and diagnostic support efforts have all
been implemented.
[This virus is an entirely different entity from a parasitic disease called
"White Spot" or Ick, commonly found at local pet fish stores. WSSV has had
devasting effects on shrimp in Asia and might be interesting case study in
the emergence of disease. I wish I knew more details - how do you like that
for an invitation? - Mod. PC]
FOLLOW-UP REPORTS ON OUTBREAKS - OIE
WEST NILE VIRUS - USA
-------------------------
On 18 Febuary, Alfonso Torres, Deputy Administration, USDA Veterinary
Services, issued a report stating that the West Nile Virus outbreak has
ended. The last reported case in a wild American crow _Corvus
brachyrhynchos_ was on 5 Nov, 1999. The report contains summary
information, a useful map depicting human, bird and horse infections in
several states along the crowded eastern seaboard
corridor and a website which gives detailed information depicting the
course of the outbreak at <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ep/WNV/summary.html>
