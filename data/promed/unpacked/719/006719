China reports new outbreak of bird flu - FAO
--------------------------------------------
China today reported a new outbreak of deadly bird flu which has infected
128 geese and ducks in the north western Xinjiang region, killing 63 of
them, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) told Agence France-Presse.
The outbreak -- the 3rd reported by the Chinese government in the past 2
months -- occurred in Changji city near Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang,
the FAO said, citing Chinese government information. "We got this
information from the Ministry of Agriculture [MOA] this afternoon," said
Noureddin Mona, the FAO's representative in China. "The report said 128
geese and ducks were infected; 63 have died."
Citing the MOA report, which has not been made public, Mona said that
authorities have culled 1490 birds, including the infected geese and ducks
and those raised in nearby farms. "The MOA said it's under control," Mona
said. "No human cases were reported."
The infected birds were diagnosed by a national bird flu laboratory and
determined to have died from the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, Mona said.
The MOA report did not say when the outbreak occurred.
Earlier [in June 2005], 1042 geese were infected with H5N1 at a farm in
Tacheng city in northwestern Xinjiang, near the border with Kazakhstan,
with 460 of them dying, state media had reported.

[A 2nd outbreak of H5N1 in Xinjiang, to the south east of the recently
notified one on the Kazakh border, underlines the spread of the virus into
central Asia. A previous Kazakh newswire on an H5N1 outbreak in Xingiang,
adjacent to their border (see 20050620.1735), also mentioned ducks, though
the Chinese notification referred to geese only. Official information from
China would help to clarify the situation. - Mod.AS]
