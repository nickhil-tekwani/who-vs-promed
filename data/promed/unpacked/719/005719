In the Yucatan Peninsula, the 1st 7 cases of animal rabies are registered, affecting cattle, revealed the federal Ministry of Health when establishing that until the 1st quarter of the year [2021], Campeche is free of this deadly disease.

From January to March of this year [2021], 87 rabies animals were already confirmed in the Mexican Republic, distributed in 15 states, with a decrease of 4.4% compared to the same period in 2020, when the sum was 91.

According to the National Center for Disease Control and Preventive Programs (Cenaprece), the highest incidence of cattle with rabies was in Veracruz, with 18 animals; followed by Nayarit, with 14; Hidalgo, 10; 8 in Guerrero; 7 in Chiapas; and 6 in Jalisco and Yucatan.

In Yucatan, the problem is 20% higher than in the 1st quarter of the previous year [2020], when there was one infected dog and 4 cattle. [I wonder if COVID fears kept people from checking their animals or from vaccinating? - Mod.TG]

From a regional point of view, the greatest distribution is in Yucatan, since in Quintana Roo there is only one laboratory-confirmed case.

The coordinator of the Zoonosis Program of the Yucatan Health Secretariat (SSY), Daly Gabino Martinez Ortiz, declared for more than 20 years in the state there have been no cases of rabies in humans, transmitted by pets, so it is remarkable the achievement obtained with the vaccination campaigns.

However, the deadly pathology prevails in the entity and is transmitted by wild animals, such as badgers, raccoons, skunks and blood-sucking bats, infected dogs and cats, as well as production animals, such as cows, bulls, etc.

After the verification of an animal with hydrophobia, actions are immediately applied in accordance with the guide for the care of rabies focus and NOM-011-SSA2-2011, for the prevention and containment of human rabies, as well as in dogs and cats.

A domestic cat having attacked its owner in Davidson County on Wednesday [5 May 2021] has tested positive for rabies, according to a Davidson County Health Department news release.

The domestic, unvaccinated cat attacked its owner in the Ridge Road area of Davidson County. On Friday [7 May 2021], the DCHD were told the cat tested positive for rabies. The owner is working with authorities and is receiving appropriate medical treatment.

Animal control has been sent to the home where there are an undisclosed number of domestic cats whose vaccination statuses are unknown.

This comes just weeks after a skunk tested positive for rabies in the northern part of Denton after a fight with 2 domestic dogs. Both dogs were up-to-date on their vaccinations and received the necessary boosters after the incident.

North Carolina law requires all domestic dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies by 4 months of age and kept current.

To protect yourself, family, friends, and pets, beware of wild animals, especially those out during the daytime. Stay away from animals unfamiliar to you.

If your pet comes in contact with an unknown animal, seek care from a veterinarian immediately regardless of the vaccination status of your pet. Never touch a dead animal with your bare hands.

If you see stray dogs, cats, or wildlife in your neighborhood, call Animal Control. If you have questions regarding your own exposure to any animal, please contact your healthcare provider to discuss your situation.

[3] Brazil (Rio de Janeiro): bat, dog

The Rio de Janeiro Municipal Public Health Laboratory (Lasp) diagnosed a case of animal rabies this week. Rio has not registered cases of rabies in dogs and cats since 1995. The case was referred by a veterinarian from Duque de Caxias, who attended to a dog having died on 6 May [2021].

According to the Municipal Institute of Sanitary Surveillance, Zoonosis Control and Agriculture (Ivisa-Rio), the State Health Secretariat and the Notifiable Disease Information System (Sinan) were informed, and the sample taken from the animal was sent to the Pasteur Institute to determine the viral variant.

According to Ivisa-Rio, the animal had direct contact with a bat on 26 Mar [2021], and there was no aggression against the dog's guardian or the health professionals who attended to it.

The institute said rabies vaccination will be carried out on 15 and 22 May [2021] in neighborhoods neighboring the municipality of Duque de Caxias. This Saturday [15 May 2021], the animals of Parada de Lucas, Vigario Geral, and Jardim America will be immunized, in the northern zone of Rio de Janeiro.

[4] USA (Keith County, Nebraska): cattle

A positive rabies case has been confirmed in a cow in Keith County, according to the Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department (SWNPHD).

"Rabies in cattle occurs less often than in dogs or cats," said Public Health Nurse Melissa Propp. "The only way to diagnose rabies is with a laboratory test performed after death. Because signs in cattle may mimic other more common diseases, people may be exposed to the infected animal while it is contagious. The best method to prevent human exposure is to ensure that livestock, horses, and pets are protected against rabies with current vaccinations."

SWNPHD said in cattle, as in other warm-blooded animals, rabies is a severe, rapidly progressing neurological disease. It is transmitted via saliva, most commonly through bite wounds from an infected wild animal. Although clinical signs may appear anytime from 2 weeks to several months after exposure, on average clinical signs appear 4-8 weeks after the exposure. Death usually occurs 2-4 days after the animal begins to show clinical signs.

According to SWNPHD, rabies should be suspected in all livestock showing a sudden onset of rapidly progressing neurological signs. However, cows with rabies may also show a wide range of clinical signs that resemble other more common diseases:

- Depression
- Difficulty with eating or drinking
- Increased aggression
- Lameness and/or incoordination
- Loud bellowing
- Excessive drooling
- Odd behavioral changes, nervousness, irritability
- Convulsions or seizures

[This posting clearly shows rabies is no respecter of animals. Large or small, mammals are susceptible to this nasty viral disease, which also can affect human beings.

The issue of rabies in cattle has surfaced in the past. The list of frequently observed clinical signs (noted above) in cattle does not fully explain the loud bellowing. I have heard this in cattle that were rabies positive. It is the oddest noise I have ever heard coming from a bovine. Yes, it is loud, but it sounds like something more out of a horror movie than from an animal. It was, well, a bit creepy. Unfortunately, in cattle, slobbering also occurs when animals get a piece of a branch stuck in their upper mouth or wedged like a bridge across the upper or lower arcade of teeth. Many individuals have been exposed to rabies by trying to remove a non-existent twig from a cow's mouth. The lesson here is to be careful.

However, this posting also shows all animals should be vaccinated against rabies. Yes, even cattle and horses, and especially our companion animals the cats and dogs.

There are no vaccines for bats, nor is there ever likely to be; bats are notorious carriers of the rabies virus.

For travelers, it is wise to pay attention to the action of animals as they may be carrying rabies. - Mod.TG]
