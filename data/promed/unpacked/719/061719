[It appears that this is a goat dairy and breeding farm. Q fever is mostly
commonly found in cattle, sheep, and goats. Organisms are excreted in milk,
urine, and feces of infected animals and are particularly abundant in
amniotic fluid and placenta during parturition.
Transmission to humans is by inhalation of airborne particles via foodborne
mechanisms but can also occur by tick bites. For a more detailed summary of
disease characteristics, please see Moderator LL's comments in: Q fever -
