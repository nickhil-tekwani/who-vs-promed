The African swine fever (ASF) has now spread to wild animals in Mizoram, and it appears that vaccination is the only option left to contain the outbreak of the killer pig disease, a senior official said on Saturday [6 Aug 2022]. The state government has decided to write to the Centre requesting it to import vaccines against the viral disease from Viet Nam, animal husbandry and veterinary department joint director (livestock health) Dr Lalhmingthanga told PTI.

"Samples extracted from carcasses of wild boars found in 2 forest areas in Champhai district were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal. It has recently confirmed that they died of ASF," he said. Carcasses of 2 female wild boars and a piglet were found in a jungle about 6 km [3.7 mi] from Leisenzo village in Champhai district on 19 Jul [2022]. Cadavers of wild pigs were also found in a forest in Samthanga area in the same district, he said.

Earlier, ASF was reported only from farms and households in the north eastern state. "It is now believed that the disease cannot be eradicated through the existing containment measures being taken according to the National Action Plan, as the outbreak is now considered endemic," Lalhmingthanga said. He said that vaccination is the only solution to contain the outbreak right now. "Vaccines (against ASF) are available in Viet Nam, but the Centre's approval is required to import them," the official said.

The state government would write to the Centre next week to inform it about the detection of ASF in wild boars. The central government would also be requested to provide vaccines from Viet Nam, he said.

According to the data released by the state animal husbandry and veterinary department on Thursday [4 Aug 2022], altogether 9891 pigs and piglets have died due to the ASF outbreak since February this year [2022]. The administration has also culled a total of 8486 pigs and piglets to prevent the disease during the same period.

The data revealed that 43 308 pigs and piglets have died and over 19 300 culled since March last year [2021] because of ASF. At least 134 villages and localities in 10 districts have been currently affected by the outbreak. ASF was first reported on 21 Mar last year [2021] at Lungsen village in south Mizoram's Lunglei district bordering Bangladesh. Although the outbreak was considered more or less contained in December [2021], it resurfaced in February 2022.

[ASF was initially suspected in wild boar during the first-recorded ASF event in India (Arundachal Pradesh, May 2020; ProMED post 20200516.7343308, item 2). Samples were collected and submitted for lab confirmation. Their results have not become publicly available to ProMED and would be appreciated.

For some detail on the new ASF vaccine, suggested to be imported from Viet Nam, subscribers are referred to ProMED post 20210510.8354736 and to some background details available at https://www.pigprogress.net/health-nutrition/vietnam-develops-an-asf-vaccine-what-is-the-context/. The vaccine strain is the outcome of research at USDA/ARS Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). In December 2019, after years of development, the research team announced they had found a vaccine that could create sterile immunity against ASFv, based on a field isolate that was obtained from the country of Georgia. In that virus, the gene I177L was deleted.

Further research and trials have been conducted in collaboration with the Vietnamese Department of Animal Health (DAH) and the Navetco National Veterinary Joint Stock Company. Eventually, a large-scale field trial on production pigs was undertaken in Viet Nam. In phase 1, Navetco produced 600 000 pilot vaccine doses to monitor their quality and coordinated with locales to select herds of varying sizes for pilot vaccination. The subjects selected for pilot vaccination, ranging from 8 to 12 weeks old, were kept in 24 locales in units of 4 sizes: herds with fewer than 500 pigs, 500 to 1000 pigs, 1000 to 5000 pigs, and over 5000 pigs. Contracts are made to supervise the sampling and monitor the effectiveness of the vaccine after vaccination.

According to the Vietnamese digital newspaper Nongnghiep, dated 2 Aug 2022, vaccinated pigs have exhibited "good response." The collected information is to be submitted to the authorities to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine (https://vietnamagriculture.nongnghiep.vn/piloting-the-navet-asfvac-vaccine-against-african-swine-fever-d328826.html).

Final results of the trials presenting the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in field conditions, and updated information on its licensing and commercialization timeline, are expected. - Mod.AS
