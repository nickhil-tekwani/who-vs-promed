When any of the 5300 inmates at Pleasant Valley State Prison begin
coughing and running a fever, doctors do not think flu, bronchitis,
or even the common cold. They think valley fever; and, more often
than they would like, they are right.
In the past 3 years, more than 900 inmates at the prison have
contracted the fever, a fungal infection that has been both
widespread and lethal. At least a dozen inmates here in Central
California have died from the disease, which is on the rise in other
Western states, including Arizona, where the health department
declared an epidemic after more than 5500 cases were reported in
2006, including 33 deaths.
Endemic to parts of the Southwest, valley fever has been reported in
recent years in a widening belt from South Texas to Northern
California. The disease has infected archaeologists digging at the
Dinosaur National Monument in Utah and dogs that have inhaled the
spores while sniffing for illegal drugs along the Mexican border.
In most cases, the infection starts in the lungs and is usually
handled by the body without permanent damage. But serious
complications can arise, including meningitis; and, at Pleasant
Valley, the scope of the outbreak has left some inmates permanently
disabled, confined to wheelchairs, and interned in expensive
long-term hospital stays. About 80 prison employees have also
contracted the fever, Pleasant Valley officials say, including a
corrections officer who died of the disease in 2005.
What makes the disease all the more troubling is that its cause is
literally underfoot: the spores that cause the infection reside in
the region's soil. When that soil is disturbed, something that
happens regularly where houses are being built, crops are being sown,
and a steady wind churns, those spores are inhaled. The spores can
also be kicked up by Mother Nature including earthquakes and dust
storms.
The epidemic at the prison has led to a clash of priorities for a
correctional system that is dealing with below average medical care
and chronic overcrowding. In the fall of 2007, heeding advice from
local health officials and a federal receiver charged with improving
the state's prison medical care, the Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation delayed plans to add 600 new beds out of concern that
the construction might stir up more spores.
Officials at the prison blame the construction of a state hospital
nearby for causing a spike in valley fever. The construction was
under way from 2001 to 2005, and valley fever hit its peak here in
2006, when the disease was diagnosed in 514 inmates.
This year [2007], about 300 cases have been diagnosed among inmates
at the prison, which sits along a highway lined with almond groves
and signs advertising new "semi-custom homes." Felix Igbinosa, the
prison's medical director, said "the No. 1 reason" was thought to be
the soil disturbance from new construction.
California reported more than 3000 cases of valley fever in 2006, the
most in a decade. Explanations for the spike have included increased
residential development and changes in weather patterns that have
resulted in increased blooms of the fungus. Other prisons in the
Central Valley of California have had increases in the number of
fever cases in recent years, but in none has the rate of infection
been higher than at Pleasant Valley, where about one inmate in 10
tested positive in 2006.
Early symptoms of the disease, which is clinically known as
coccidioidomycosis, mimic the flu, with symptoms that include a
cough, lethargy, and a fever. Most of those who become infected
recover with little or no treatment and are subsequently immune. In
about 2 percent to 3 percent of the cases, the disease spreads from
the lungs and can attack the bones, liver, spleen, and skin.

[Primary infection with "cocci" can be asymptomatic or influenza-like
or can present as a community-acquired pneumonia which may be
associated with erythema nodosum especially in females. It is, as
noted, acquired by the inhalation of infectious endospores, which are
produced as the mold-form of this dimorphic fungus grows in the soil.
When the endospores germinate in the human respiratory tract, the
yeast form (or spherule) is produced which is the form that
replicates at body temperature and may spread from the primary
respiratory focus outside the lung. Spread of the fungus can occur in
the immunocompromised host and may be more common in certain ethic
groups. Among the sites that classically are associated with
extra-pulmonary spread include the skin, the skeletal system, and the
meninges. Other dimorphic fungi (which grow as a mold at room
temperature and a yeast at human body temperature in the USA include
_Histoplasma capsulatum_ and _Blastomyces dermatitidis_
