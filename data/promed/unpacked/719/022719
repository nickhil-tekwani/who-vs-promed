Sri Lanka's health authorities Monday warned of an outbreak of a cholera
epidemic in the capital city Colombo, health sector sources said Tuesday.
More than 300 cholera cases had been reported from all parts of the island
country from January 1 to June 10 this year. Already seven positive cases
of cholera have been discovered within the city and they are being treated
in the Infectious Diseases Hospital, the sources said.
The Colombo Municipal Council is taking all measures to combat the spread
of the epidemic. Colombo's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tissa Seneviratne has
ordered that all hotels, tea kiosks, other eating houses, food stalls and
bakeries found to be in an unhygienic condition in Colombo city be closed
down with immediate effect. Twenty-seven health officials have already been
deployed to conduct raids on such establishments since Monday. The sources
added that health education programs throughout the country are being
launched by the health authorities while special programs are being given
to school students to educate them about cholera.
