Re: chickenpox in Southeast Asia
--------------------------------
The Gideon [Global Infectious Disease & Epidemiology Network] graph
on chickenpox prevalence is very interesting [see: Chickenpox -
Singapore (02): background SE Asia 20081231.412], but some
explanations are needed.

Essentially the incidence of chickenpox is proportional to, almost
equal to the birth rate in the community. That is because chickenpox
is contagious and usually saturates the population over time. The
incidence varies between years -- some may be outbreak years (R =
greater than 1) while others would therefore have R = less than 1.
However, if the median age is known, within that number of years the
incidence will average out as R = 1 and incidence = birth rate (or
about 90 percent of birth rate on account of subclinical infections
and missed infections).

Obviously vaccination will reduce incidence and reporting efficiency
will affect the case reports over time. Thus, birth rate, vaccination
coverage, age spread of cases, and reporting efficiency need to be
considered in interpreting such varying rates as in Singapore and
Hong Kong versus other countries.

One relatively not-well-known piece of information is that the age
spread of chickenpox in Singapore is much wider than in Europe and
North America. The median age of chickenpox in the USA was about 4
years (prior to vaccination) when it was over 12 years in southern
India. Singapore, Sri Lanka, southern Thailand, and southern India all
have common first-time chickenpox in adults even up to 45-50 years --
this is the normal epidemiology -- the phenomenon is related to
nearness to equator and applicable in Asia but not in Africa or the
Americas (as far as I know).

I hope Gideon will investigate age distribution and vaccination
coverage in Asiatic countries.
