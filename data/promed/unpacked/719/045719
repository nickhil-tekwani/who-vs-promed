RE: Unexplained deaths, bovine - Yemen: RFI 20100101.0010
----------------------------------------------------------
I have contacted Dr Mansoor Al-Qadassi,
Director-General of Animal Resources and
Veterinary Quarantine and the Chief Veterinary
Officer of the Republic of Yemen, a good friend
and trusted colleague, about the news reports you
published because of the concern it could raise
in some minds about an occurrence of rinderpest, as has happened in the past.

He has informed me that he had read in the media
that a boat with animals had been rejected from
Qatar and was on its way to Yemen. A few days
later he received a report saying that some
carcasses were found on one of islands in the Red
Sea (given in the media as the Honish
archipelago) where there are neither people nor
livestock living. A team sent to the islands,
including 2 veterinarians, confirmed the finding
of the carcasses of some 50 small ruminants,
suspected to be of Somali origin (presumably
because of their characteristic appearance), but
no cattle carcasses. No obvious signs of disease
were seen in the carcasses. The Iranian boat is
understood not to have entered Yemeni territorial waters.

To my knowledge, the disposal of livestock
carcasses into the sea is a common event
associated with the heavy trade of livestock into
the Arabian Peninsula by dhow from eastern
Africa, as well as by other ships from sources
further afield. Losses during transit can
sometimes be very high from a number of diseases,
including peste des petits ruminants.

Thus, in my opinion, the finding of a few small
ruminant carcasses cannot be considered such an
unusual event and does not signify any major change in disease pattern.

Dr Mansoor Al Qadassi kindly consented to the submission of this information.

[Thanks to Peter and Dr Al-Qadassi, we are one
down and one to go. From personal experience the
Somali sheep and goats are different to those
outside Somalia and the Ogaden. When I was in
Somalia in 1980 I was told that some 5-10 percent
of the livestock shipped from Berbera to Jeddah
for the Haj would die en route. Discreet
enquiries are in hand to determine what exactly happened in Qatar. - Mod.MHJ

The Middle and Near East countries are major
importers of live animals for slaughter;
misfortunes like the one described from Yemen's
waters are not rare. A recent one occurred when
the Panamanian-flagged cargo ship MV DANNY F II,
carrying 83 people and thousands of livestock,
capsized and sank off the Lebanese coast on
Thursday (17 Dec 2009) in bad weather in the
Mediterranean Sea, 11 nautical miles (20 km) from
Tripoli, Lebanon, while sailing from Montevideo,
Uruguay, to Tartarus, Syria, carrying 6
passengers, 77 crew, 10 224 sheep and 17 932 head
of cattle. All of the livestock perished as the
ship sank. (see at
