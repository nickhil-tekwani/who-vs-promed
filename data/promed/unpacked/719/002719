MYCOBACTERIA & SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING: REQUEST FOR INFO
*******************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Dr. Tjandra Y Aditama <doctjand@link.net.id>

I have just finished collecting data from 8 laboratories in 6 cities in
Indonesia about [_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_] sensitivity patterns. The
problem is [that] each laboratory may use [a] different technique and
different recording and reporting systems. Is there any experience
performing large scale [analyses of] TB drug resistance patterns that could
be used for a country like Indonesia (200 million people, more than 10,000
islands).
Do you have any suggestions?

[Standardization of procedures for testing and reporting antimicrobial
susceptibility are well established for routine bacteriological analyses.
Antibiotic susceptibility testing for _Mycobacterium_ sp. is commonly
performed in more specialized laboratories. Would someone with expertise
in this area provide suggestions? Reference(s) might be helpful. - Mod.ES]
