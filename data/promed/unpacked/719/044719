The owners of 3 flocks of sheep imported from Belgium to produce milk are
losing their animals because of the possibility they were infected with a
sheep equivalent of mad cow disease. The disease, officially known as
bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, affected some 180 000 head of
British cattle and has been linked to a similar illness in humans, known
as new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or nvCJD. More than 50 people have
died so far in Britain after apparently eating contaminated beef.

Tests on 4 slaughtered sheep from a Greensboro farm found evidence of
disease in their brains possibly indicating the presence of BSE, U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials said Friday as they ordered the
3 flocks of 376 animals destroyed. The results don't mean the animals
definitely have the same disease causing the outbreak in Great Britain, but
they could have.

"Even the remotest possibility it could be that, I think we have to take
all precautions to protect the livestock industry and subsequently the
public health," said Linda Detwiler, senior staff veterinarian for the USDA.

[The owner of 120 of the animals, said the tests were incomplete and his
animals had shown no symptoms of BSE.

"There has never been a sheep in the whole world that has gotten mad cow
disease," said [the owner. Officials said that was true, although
researchers have been able to infect sheep with BSE in laboratories.
[Experimentally only! - Mod.TG In addition, sheep are susceptible to
scrapie, a disease similar to mad cow disease.

The sheep, a breed called East Friesians, have been quarantined since 1998,
two years after the first of them arrived from Belgium. However, the
farmers have been allowed to sell cheese made from the animals' milk. The
sheep came from an area of Belgium where BSE has been found. They are the
only such flocks in the United States.

The disease is spread when animals eat feed made from the brains of
infected animals, and the USDA said there was a possibility the sheep in
Vermont ate contaminated feed before they were imported. [However, this is
not documented, and the BSE found in Belgium was in cattle, not sheep. -

[The test used is not a validated test and it is my understanding the test
USDA is using is not accepted by the EU. If someone has additional
information with regard to the test used or if the EU is accepting these
testing measures, please provide me with the information. - Mod.TG

Sheep imported to Vermont from Europe are to be destroyed after tests
showed they could be infected with a variety of BSE.

The US Agriculture Department ruled that the 376 East Friesian milking
sheep posed a "real danger to the national economy" when routine tests on 4
slaughtered animals found their brains to be infected with a type of
spongiform encephalopathy, possibly Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
[But scrapie is a Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy, similar to BSE.
- Mod.TG

Officials said sheep had never been known to have contracted BSE on farms,
but scientists had been able to infect sheep with BSE in the laboratory.

Farmers brandishing "Save Our Sheep" signs protested the government tests
were inconclusive. Larry Faillace, an East Warren farmer who imported 120
of the sheep for cheese production, said: "There has never been a sheep in
the whole world that has gotten 'mad cow' disease."

British to consult with U.S. scientists over 'mad sheep'

British government scientists are to hold urgent talks with their
counterparts in the United States over the discovery sheep imported from
Europe are showing signs of a disease possibly linked to bovine spongiform
encephalopathy(BSE) - "mad cow disease" - in cattle.

Three flocks quarantined in Vermont are being destroyed under the orders of
the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), which has begun tests to establish
whether the disease believed to have spread to humans has also transferred
to sheep. [BSE has only experimentally been produced in sheep. There has
never been a documented case and currently there are no valid scientific
test. - Mod.TG

British scientists have long feared this is possible, although the disease
has been introduced to sheep only in laboratory tests. Now government
experts have commissioned a risk assessment to quantify the threat to human
health if BSE were found in Britain's 40 million sheep.

Beginning in January, all British sheep will be tagged as part of European
Union measures to track major diseases. [The US has a traceback system for
cattle that could be applied to these sheep. - Mod.TG

"There is nothing to suggest what they have discovered in America is BSE at
the moment," said a spokesman for the British Ministry of Agriculture. "But
whatever they discover we will look at with interest."
The USDA investigations could take several years. Four of the 376 sheep
were found to have a BSE-like disease, which could be a new form of
scrapie, a sheep disease long endemic in Britain but not known to be
dangerous to humans.

The tests will be conducted at a secure facility at Plum Island, near New
York. The animals were dairy sheep imported from Belgium and the
Netherlands in 1996 and their milk, and cheese made from it, has been sold
for some time. Their lambs have also been sold for food. [The British have
sold calves from animals later testing positive for BSE. When the animals
are below 30 months there does not seem to be concern. So why is there a
concern about these lambs? - Mod.TG

Britain has banned some parts of sheep, including the head, from entering
food for some years but is slightly relaxing controls as a trade-off for
EU-wide measures.

Scrapie is increasing in Britain, with nearly 600 cases reported last year.
The actual incidence may be 8 times as high. It is mostly identified in
older sheep.
