This case indeed is remarkable. In all of the previous few human survivors, no viral DNA [RNA] was demonstrated, and recovery was attributed to natural immune responses. The protocol was apparently basic excellent supportive care and tells us that even in a comatose patient, it is still potentially beneficial to provide such care till brain death is documented.

Did this boy have antibody in serum and spinal fluid? Was there really viral DNA [RNA] in serum and spinal fluid, and by what method? Most of us will now wait with great interest for the detailed publication of this case in a peer review journal.
