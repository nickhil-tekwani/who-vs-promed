Vet at center of canine circovirus outbreak in Michigan issues dire warning to cat lovers: they can get it, too. Here's an update on our story on the outbreak of the deadly, new dog disease known as canine circovirus. It comes from Dr Lindsay Ruland. She owns a 24-hour small animal ER clinic in Michigan and is on the forefront of breaking the story in Michigan.

She tells me that fearful dog lovers are coming in in droves. But that some of those fears might be overblown. "Some of the testing we have submitted is coming back as negative for circovirus," she said.

But that doesn't mean there is nothing to fear. And Dr Ruland has a dire warning for cat lovers who might not realize that their feline pets can fall prey to the disease, too.

"The disease, at least in our area, is picking up speed and we are seeing more cats with it now," Ruland warned. "The cats have not fared well and of the 6 cats we recently had hospitalized with signs, 4 of them passed away from multiple organ failure and acute respiratory distress. The dogs that are coming in are showing more neurological signs as well consistent with cerebral edema."

"All we are able to tell owners is to monitor all pets for signs and get them to a vet if they begin acting lethargic, have swollen submandibular lymph nodes when they previously were not enlarged, and become anorexic," Ruland said. "We have become Ground Zero in a sense for these cases in Michigan and we have been finding that the animals who already have elevated liver and kidney values need extremely aggressive supportive care and many of them are not surviving once they get to the neurologic phase."

[Circovirus is an emerging disease in dogs and possibly cats. Currently there is not much known about it in dogs, and less about it in cats, if it does affect them. How many tests have come back positive on cats? Or, conversely, how many circovirus tests are negative on these cats?

Outbreaks in California and Ohio previously thought to be circovirus in dogs have proven not to be the case. This vet indicates most of the suspected cases in her area are also negative for the virus. It may prove that cats are not susceptible either.
