On July 23, 1999 the Texas Department of Health's laboratory confirmed the
first case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) identified in the state
since October, 1997. On July 29, subsequent serology performed at the
University of New Mexico laboratory identified the etiologic agent as Sin
Nombre virus.
The patient, a 51-year-old white, non-Hispanic, male from the Texas
Panhandle, first exhibited symptoms of illness on April 19, 1999. On April
22, he was examined by a nurse practitioner who diagnosed "influenza" and
advised him to rest and take aspirin. On April 26, he was taken to the
local hospital where fluid described as "molasses" was aspirated from his
lungs. The patient was immediately transferred to an Amarillo, TX hospital
and placed on full life support. He was discharged on May 7. The hospital
utilized two commercial laboratories which reported positive serology for
"hantavirus".
The patient requested that his physician not report this case to the Texas
Department of Health due to the anticipated publicity it might generate;
the physician complied with the request. Texas Department of Health
Zoonosis Control personnel first learned of the case on July 8, 1999 when
contacted by the patient. The man was concerned about his potential for
further exposure to the virus in his residence.
Arrangements were made to obtain serological specimens from the patient for
confirmation testing at the state health department's laboratory. An
environmental evaluation was conducted on July 22. The patient lives on a
farm with an abundant rodent population. Several possible points of
exposure exist: rodents within his residence; dust generated while loading
and unloading oat seed; or dust created when removing hay from a barn.
Serum samples from a family living in a separate dwelling on the farm were
tested. Two of the individuals (males) were serologically negative and one
(female) was "equivocal". In addition, a serum sample has been submitted
from the patient's daughter who spent one or more nights at the residence.
Environmental cleaning and rodent control have been instituted on the
property. The physician has been reminded of the statutory requirement to
report cases of notifiable diseases, including HPS.
