In Xinyang, Henan Province, 4 elderly people recently died of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS] (tick transmitted disease) and one person is receiving treatment. Mr H, a family member of the deceased old man, said that another old man in the same village had also died of tick disease before, and 3 old people, including his father, helped to clean and dress the deceased. There was close contact.

The tick is about the size of a flea. After biting the host it continues to suck blood, and the body will swell. The various pathogens it carries infect the human body and can cause local damage or some tick-borne diseases that can be fatal.

The case that caused the deaths of 4 people happened in Xinyang, Henan Province. An old man, over 70 years old, had a high fever and was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tick disease). He died after returning to the village. According to local customs, the deceased should be cleaned and a shroud put on before burial. At the request of his family, Mr H's father and other 3 people went to the deceased's house to help, and died of infection after contact with the blood from the deceased remaining on the medical equipment.

Ticks are arthropod parasites of the arachnid class Acari subclass, Ixodoidea superfamily, about the size of a matchstick head, and feed on blood. When the tick is not sucking blood, it is the size of a grain of rice, and when it is full of blood, it will swell to the size of a fingernail.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome is a natural focus of disease caused by a new type of bunyavirus, usually transmitted by ticks, and can also be transmitted from person to person through direct contact with the blood or bloody secretions of patients. The symptoms are fever and multiple organ failure, and the disease is often accompanied by thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.

Tick diseases are mainly distributed in Henan, Hubei, Shandong, Anhui, Liaoning, and other provinces in the mainland. Xinyang area of Henan is a high-incidence area, and the onset date is mostly concentrated from April to October each year. Some experts have pointed out that the tick in the Xinyang Mountains is known as longhorned tick, which feeds on blood. This tick lurks on the grass and plants in the hills, and likes to hide on the back of the tea leaves. Xinyang City is the origin of Xinyang Maojian, one of the top 10 famous teas in China, and tea is grown on a large scale throughout the city. Most tea farmers have tick bite scars on their legs.

The website of the Fuzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention stated that once a tick is found to have bitten or burrowed into the skin, do not touch it directly with your hands, or even squeeze it, let alone flush it with water when bitten. Alcohol can be applied to the tick to loosen the tick's head or [kill it], and then remove the tick with pointed tweezers. Do not pull hard to avoid scratching the skin or leave the tick's head in the skin. After taking it out, use iodine or alcohol for local disinfection, and observe your physical condition. If you have symptoms such as fever, inflammation and ulceration at the bite site, and erythema, you should seek medical attention in time to determine whether you have a tickborne disease to avoid missing the best time for treatment.

[The report above does not give the dates when the individuals became infected with severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, became ill, and the 4 died. This is the season when ticks that are vectors of SFTS virus are active. More cases are reported in Henan and other provinces where SFTS virus is endemic. SFTS virus infections have been occurring in China and elsewhere in East Asia over the past 13 years, and again this year (2022), with the cases mentioned above. The longhorned tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is the virus vector. There is no vaccine and avoidance of tick bites is the only currently available preventive measure.

In 2012, Zhang and colleagues (reference below) proposed that the name of the syndrome be designated as Huaiyangshan hemorrhagic fever (HYSHF) and the virus Huaiyangshan virus (HYSV) as a substitute for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and virus. Their proposal has not been adopted, as subsequent reports continue to refer to SFTS.
