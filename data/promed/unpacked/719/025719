MALARIA Â­ INDIA, (MUMBAI): URBAN MALARIA COMMENT

It comes as no surprise that Mumbai would be
experiencing urban malaria; probably has for a
long time but is now being more widely recognized
(and reported). As urbanization increases in
India one can presume 'urban' malaria will become
more of an issue in the future.

Regard subject posting below (Malaria, Fever -
India: (Mumbai), RFI) [14 Jul 2010] I would like
to comment on the last remark provided in the
communication : [Malaria mosquitoes (Anopheles
spp.) do not breed in the water sources mentioned
here, but dengue vector mosquitoes (Aedes spp.)
do. It is likely that the fever cases referred to
are cases of dengue. - Mod.JW] [ProMED-mail
regrets that due to technical difficulties the
following discussion was not posted when
originally sent in July 2010. - Mod.MPP]

Comment: On the contrary, the potential larval
habitats mentioned in the article (i.e., "Water
stagnation -- be it in puddles on the road, in
discarded rubber tyres, in water tanks, or even
in buckets used to store water inside homes -- is
what makes Mumbaikars vulnerable to mosquitoes,
said doctors.") can, in fact, all be acceptable
aquatic sources for _Anopheles stephensi_ in
urban areas. Moreover, this species serves a
primary malaria vector along the northwestern
coastal zone and western interior of India.

As far back as 1908 a severe epidemic was
reported "in the densely crowed city of Bombay,
the epidemic being due to the establishment of
_A. stephensi_ in the wells and cisterns
throughout the city, an unexpected adaptation
which only this species has displayed." (Boyd,
1949. Malariology). [Actually a few other
species, notably, _An. claviger_ show this
tendency of 'urbanization' under ideal
conditions]. _Anopheles stephensi_ is the only
anopheline in India (and Pakistan) which can
readily adapt to the conditions available in many towns and cities.

This species has also been implicated as the
primary vector responsible for past outbreaks in
Kolkata, Bangalore and other cities in India and
Pakistan (Karachi) -- often exhibiting very
localized but intense transmission. "In such
situations it breeds in wells, cisterns, roof
gutters, fountain basins, garden tanks, tubs,
discarded tins, and receptacles of all
descriptions" (Covell, 1928. Malaria in Bombay,
Bombay Govt Press; In: Boyd, 1949.). _An.
stephensi_ is atypical for an anopheline (also,
interestingly tolerant of relatively high
pollution); therefore mistaking such container
habitats as Aedes 'only' is understandable except
when dealing with this species.

Not discounting the possibilities of dengue
contributing to these reported illnesses (or
concurrent with malaria infections), it seems
unlikely that many local health care
practitioners would mistake dengue for malaria
infection. For Mumbai, one would assume (hope)
that many of cases of "malaria" (versus those
reported as "fever") would have been reliably
confirmed by the majority of private and public hospitals.

During a decade or more of intense malaria
eradication efforts in India (late 1950's thru
the 1960's), _An. stephensi_ was effectively
brought under control and urban malaria became an
extremely uncommon occurrence. However, from 1970
onwards that all began to change with the shift
in national control priorities. As a result,
malaria transmission rapidly resurged, both in
rural and urban areas. The fact that Mumbai would
now experience outbreaks of malaria should come as no surprise.

More troubling for India and Pakistan is that
with the explosive urban expansion in both
countries the subsequent increase in suitable
ecological conditions for this mosquito will
likewise place a larger proportion of the human population at risk.

[ProMED thanks Michael Bangs for his comments and
detailed information on the habitats for
different malaria vectors on the Indian
subcontinent. The point that increasing
urbanization is driving increased transmission is
well taken. ProMED will be happy to post a
comment from health authorities in India and Pakistan. - Mod.EP]
