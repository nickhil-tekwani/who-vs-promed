Bluetongue virus (BTV-8) in France: updated situation assessment no 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Helen Roberts, Jonathan Smith]

The French Authorities have been undertaking a wide surveillance programme (design prevalence of 5 per cent and 95 per cent confidence) across breeding cattle in mainland France. To do so, 30 farms with breeding cattle have been randomly assigned for each of the 21 regions and 60 cattle from each farm were tested (provided 60 were present) (Bournez et al, 2015). A full description of the surveillance programme can be found at https://info.agriculture.gouv.fr/gedei/site/bo-agri/instruction-2015-785.

To date [25 Oct 2015], a total of about 38 400 cattle on over 1300 holdings have been tested. Where a positive farm has been identified, in the majority of cases only one cattle tested positive out of the 60 sampled. In addition, report cases are made as part of the passive surveillance programme in France, where animals showing clinical signs suggestive of notifiable disease are followed up. The number of monthly reports has significantly increased, showing the increased awareness of farmers and vets, with over 140 suspicions since mid-September [2015]. A map of these cases is also available from Bournez et al.

Given the increased restriction zones, TRACES, the EU trade notification system, has been further interrogated, looking at consignments since mid-June 2015. There have been several direct cattle, sheep, and goat consignments from regions which are now under the increased restriction zones, so livestock owners should be aware of the possible risk and consult with their veterinary surgeon prior to arranging trade from France. All consignments tested after arrival in the UK (for compliance purposes under the Vet Checks Directive, 90/425/EEC) have tested negative.

At the recent PAFF [Plants, Animals, Food, and Feed] meeting in Brussels, France presented their surveillance information and latest results. On genotype sequence sampling, full typing is still under way but, to date, 95 per cent of the sequence shows full homology to the strain circulating in 2007 in Northern Europe, including the UK. Vaccine stocks are limited and therefore vaccination is prioritised for herds where at least animal has been confirmed with disease (from surveillance for example), animals in specific breeding programmes and animals destined for EU trade and under certain bilateral agreements for 3rd country exports (http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/ag_2015100708-bt-france_en.pdf).

Conclusion
----------
The risk of introduction from France to the UK at present is considered to be very low. It could occur through several pathways:
1. Via infected midges. Currently considered negligible risk, given the outbreak locations suggest there has been limited spread in France and as weather conditions and reducing temperatures reduces midge activity.
2. Infected and viraemic animals consigned from an affected area not under restriction. Currently considered very low risk, and mitigated by checks made at the premises of destination.
3. Use of germplasm. Currently considered negligible risk, given the origin of consignments (outside restricted areas) and the measures in place at the approved semen collection centres.

There is still some uncertainty around the source of disease although we now have better information about the distribution in France. Interestingly, in 2012/2013 of 8 sites where wild ruminants were surveyed, 5 per cent of the animals were seropositive for BTV but all PCR negative. Therefore it is possible the disease may have been circulating at a very low level in wildlife and it is only this year [2015], when vector numbers reached a high level and herd immunity dropped below a threshold, that disease was able to circulate in livestock again.

We will continue to report any further updates.

[Following the publication of the DEFRA assessment above, France submitted its 7th follow-up report to the OIE (2 Nov 2015), adding 15 new BTV-outbreaks, for a total of 71 BTV-8 outbreaks since the start of the event on 21 Aug 2015. This refers to a total of 133 cases in cattle and 11 in sheep (see archive no 20151105.3769159).

The assessment above includes information on the genotyping of the pathogen, which is yet to be completed; preliminary results are indicative of homology to the strain circulating in 2007 in Northern Europe, including the UK. The raised assumption that the virus has continued its circulation, in wildlife (deer?), since 2007 is noteworthy. Future surveillance in wildlife may be considered.
