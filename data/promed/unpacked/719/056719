The State Department of Health (DOH) reported 2 new monkeypox cases. The individuals included an Oʻahu resident whose case is not related to travel and a non-resident diagnosed on Oʻahu whose case is related to travel outside of Hawaiʻi. This brings the total number of statewide cases to 18. DOH continues to conduct contact tracing and follow-up with all reported cases.

"While the risk to most Hawaiʻi residents remains low, local transmission of monkeypox is occurring," said Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Nathan Tan in a press release.

"The growing number of cases in Hawaiʻi underscores the importance of vaccination. If you are eligible, please take this step to protect yourself and our community."

The JYNNEOS vaccine is available statewide to Hawaiʻi residents 18 and older. Vaccination eligibility includes:
- Close contact in the last 14 days with a person with known or suspected monkeypox infection;
- Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and transgender individuals who have multiple or anonymous sex partners;
- Persons with severe immune compromise (e.g., advanced or poorly controlled HIV infection, active cancer treatment, high-dose steroids) or certain skin conditions, such as eczema; AND who have a household member or sex partner at high risk for monkeypox.

Monkeypox is mainly spread through close, intimate contact with body fluids, lesion material, or items used by someone with monkeypox. It may be spread through large respiratory droplets that generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged contact is required.

Nationwide, the current cases are primarily spreading among social networks of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. In Hawaiʻi, at least some of the cases have been reported among gay or bisexual men. However, anyone who has close contact with someone with monkeypox is at risk of infection, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Individuals with monkeypox symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, or new or unexplained rash or sores, should immediately contact their healthcare provider. Testing and treatment are available through healthcare providers.

Part 2. Epidemiology update

2.1 Current epidemiological situation

Cases of monkeypox infection were identified in England from 6 May 2022. As of 15 Aug 2022, there were 3195 laboratory-detected cases of monkeypox in the UK. This includes 3081 confirmed and 114 highly probable cases, collectively referred to as 'cases' in this briefing for simplicity and defined respectively as those who tested positive with a monkeypox and orthopox polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Positive results for _Orthopox_, the genus of viruses that includes monkeypox, are considered highly probable due to the rarity of other _Orthopox_ viruses in the UK.

Of all cases, 75 were in Scotland, 27 were in Northern Ireland, 43 were in Wales, and 3050 were in England.

Table 1. Number of confirmed and highly probable monkeypox cases by devolved administrations, 6 May to 15 Aug 2022
UK nation / Total / Confirmed cases / Highly probable cases
England / 3050 / 2936 / 114
Northern Ireland / 27 / 27 / 0
Scotland / 75 / 75 / 0
Wales / 43 / 43 / 0
Total / 3195 / 3081 / 114

In England, a high proportion of cases were known to be London residents (overall 71%, 2141 out of 3035 with reported home address), see Table 2. The number of cases in other regions has been steadily increasing, particularly in the South East and North West of England (Figure 2). Accordingly, the proportion of cases in London has declined over time, to approximately 58% in August [2022] to date (Figure 3).

Where gender information was available, 2989 out of 3025 (99%) confirmed cases in England were men, and 36 were women (Figure 4). The median age of confirmed and highly probable cases in the UK was 36 years (interquartile range 31 to 44).

Table 2. Number of confirmed and highly probable monkeypox cases by region of residence, England, 6 May to 15 Aug 2022
Region of residence / Total confirmed
East of England / 109
East Midlands / 43
London / 2141
North East / 37
North West / 180
South East / 281
South West / 80
West Midlands / 98

This Saturday [20 Aug 2022] the Ministry of Public Health has detected the 1st case of monkeypox in the country. This is a male of Italian nationality who arrived in Cuba as a tourist this past 15 Aug [2022].

During his stay, he resided in a rented house and visited various places in the western provinces of the country. On 17 Aug [2022], he presented with general symptoms and went to health services on 18 [Aug 2022] given [symptom] persistence.

During his 1st medical attention, his symptoms worsened that required urgent movement for hospitalization and intensive treatment, arriving at the hospital with cardiac arrest from which he recovered.

In his physical examination, skin lesions were identified that led to clinical suspicion of monkeypox. Samples were taken and sent to the national reference laboratory of the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical Medicine where the infection was confirmed by real-time PCR on the morning of 20 [Aug 2022]

The patient is in critical, life-threatening condition. Possible associated conditions that could have [contributed to] his serious state are being studied. Also, epidemiological investigation is also deepened, and actions for control of the focus are performed, as provided in the approved protocol to deal with this disease in the country.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
A monkeypox virus outbreak is currently spreading in multiple non-endemic countries since May 2022. The atypical clinical profile of patients has led to a very likely underestimation of the number of cases at the beginning of epidemic. The detection and quantification of the monkeypox virus genome in sewersheds in Paris (France) correlated temporally with the identification of the 1st case of infection and the spread of the disease within the population connected to the sewage system.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
Since May 2022, monkeypox cases have been reported in non-endemic countries, and the disease was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Rapid identification of new cases is critical for outbreak control. Environmental surveillance can be used as a complementary tool for detecting pathogens circulating in communities. This study aimed to investigate whether monkeypox DNA can be detected in wastewater from a transportation hub. There were 20 samples collected in Italy's 1st airport in Rome and tested using published and modified real-time PCR assays targeting the G2R region (TFN gene), F3L, and N3R genes. Nested PCR assays were also used for confirmation by sequencing. There were 3 samples that tested positive by real-time PCR and/or by nested PCR, confirming the occurrence of the virus in the airport's wastewater. Wastewater surveillance can be quickly adapted to investigate emerging threats and can be used to track the introduction and/or the diffusion of the monkeypox virus in communities.

[9] Australia (New South Wales): 1st case
Date: Sun 21 Aug 2022
Source: ABC News [edited]
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-21/nsw-records-one-case-of-monkeypox-acquired-in-state/101355388


Key points
- There are currently 42 cases of monkeypox in NSW.
- People with symptoms are urged to avoid close contact with others.
- An infectious diseases specialist says vaccination and education are key to containing the virus.

The 1st locally acquired case of monkeypox has been recorded in New South Wales.

So far, 42 people across the state have contracted the virus, with the majority of those infected overseas. There are 2 who acquired their infection in other parts of Australia.

Sunday's [21 Aug 2022] announcement is a 1st for NSW and comes more than a week after the rollout of the JYNNEOS smallpox vaccination program started for those most at risk.

In a statement, NSW Health urged the community to protect itself.

"NSW Health is urging the community, particularly gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), to continue to be vigilant for the symptoms of monkeypox following local transmission of the virus in NSW," they said.

"NSW Health is urging the community, particularly gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), to continue to be vigilant for the symptoms of monkeypox following local transmission of the virus in NSW," they said.

Regardless of whether people have travelled to high-risk areas overseas, they are being encouraged to be aware of the virus declared a "communicable disease incident of national significance" by Australia's Chief Medical Office.

Infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake said the latest findings were concerning. "As of a week or 2 ago, we were quite comfortable, in the sense that they [monkeypox cases] were mainly from returned travellers," he said. "But now there is local transmission, and we see what's happening in Europe and the Americas as well. I think we have to be very worried about this.

"If we have a huge outbreak of monkeypox, we do not have enough vaccine at the moment.

"As we've seen with COVID, if you allow enough people to get infected where the virus replicates, who knows what it might do, so it's important to have it under control."

On 8 Aug [2022], NSW Health started administering its supply of 5500 doses of the JYNNEOS smallpox vaccine. An additional 30 000 doses are expected in early September and October [2022] with another 70 000 in early 2023.

High-risk groups including men who have sex with men, gay, bisexual men, and men who have sex with men who are homeless have been prioritised in the rollout.

[10] Virus on surfaces

ref: Pfeiffer J A, Collingwood A, Rider L E, et al. High-High-contact object and surface contamination in a household of persons with monkeypox virus infection -- Utah, June 2022. MMWR. 2022
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In May 2022, the Salt Lake County Health Department reported 2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed travel-associated cases of monkeypox to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services (UDHHS). The 2 persons with monkeypox (patients A and B) lived together without other housemates. Both persons experienced prodromal symptoms (e.g., fatigue and body aches). Then 8 days after symptom onset, patient A experienced penile lesions; lesions spread to the lips, hands, legs, chest, and scalp by day 10. Patient B experienced prodromal symptoms 8 days after illness onset of patient A; patient B experienced a lesion on the foot, which spread to the leg and finger by day 11. Although both patients had lesions in multiple anatomic areas, the overall number of lesions was small, and lesions varied in presentation from "pimple-like" or ulcerated, to characteristically well-circumscribed and centrally umbilicated. Both patients had mild illness. The time from symptom onset to resolution was approximately 30 days for patient A and approximately 22 days for patient B.

To assess the presence and degree of surface contamination of household objects contacted by monkeypox patients, UDHHS swabbed objects in the home of the patients. The patients identified high-contact objects and surfaces for sampling; the patients also described cleaning and disinfection activities performed within the home during their illness and locations within the home where they spent substantial amounts of time while ill. The patients had isolated at home for 20 days before their home was entered for sampling. The patients were still symptomatic at the time UDHHS collected specimens from their home. The temperature in the 2-story home ranged from 69 deg F (20.6 deg C) to 75 deg F (23.9 deg C) during their period of isolation. CDC monkeypox-specific cleaning and decontamination guidance was shared with the occupants at the time the home surfaces were swabbed.

UDHHS personnel entered the residence discreetly wearing recommended personal protective equipment. They performed targeted environmental sampling using published methods. Specimens were obtained from 30 objects in 9 areas of the home and were transported to the Utah Public Health Laboratory for shipment to CDC where they were processed and tested with both nonvariola _Orthopoxvirus_ and West African monkeypox virus-specific real-time PCR assays. Viral culture was only pursued if the qualitative PCR result was positive. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

Among the 30 specimens, 21 (70%) yielded positive real-time PCR results, including those from all 3 porous items (i.e., cloth furniture and blankets), 17 of 25 (68%) nonporous surfaces (e.g., handles and switches), and one of 2 mixed surface types (i.e., chair) (Table). No specimen yielded a positive viral culture result. During the period of isolation both residents of the home reported showering once or twice each day, performing hand hygiene approximately 10 times daily, laundering bedding and clothing weekly, and performing routine household cleaning (e.g., mopping and daily use of a multisurface spray on most high-contact surfaces). The cleaning spray used was not listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's List of Disinfectants for Emerging Viral Pathogens.

Monkeypox virus DNA was detected from many objects and surfaces sampled indicating that some level of contamination occurred in the household environment. However, the inability to detect viable virus suggests that virus viability might have decayed over time or through chemical or environmental inactivation. Although both patients were symptomatic and isolated in their home for more than 3 weeks, their cleaning and disinfection practices during this period might have limited the level of contamination within the household. These data are limited, and additional studies are needed to assess the presence and degree of surface contamination and investigate the potential for indirect transmission of monkeypox virus in household environments.

Monkeypox virus primarily spreads through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact with the rash, scabs, lesions, body fluids, or respiratory secretions of a person with monkeypox; transmission via contaminated objects or surfaces (i.e., fomites) is also possible. Persons living in or visiting the home of someone with monkeypox should follow appropriate precautions against indirect exposure and transmission by wearing a well-fitting mask; avoiding touching possibly contaminated surfaces; maintaining appropriate hand hygiene; avoiding sharing eating utensils, clothing, bedding, or towels; and following home disinfection recommendations.

[11] Expired vaccine
Date: Fri 19 Aug 2022
Source: Politico [abridged, edited]
https://www.politico.eu/article/thousands-expired-us-monkeypox-shot-vaccine-viable-tests/


A total of 400 000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine that had expired and were destined to be destroyed have been tested from American stockpiles and found to still be viable, the chief executive of vaccine manufacturer Bavarian Nordic told POLITICO.

The Danish firm is carrying out tests, at the request of the United States, on some of the 28 million doses that expired around 2 years ago, Bavarian Nordic boss Paul Chaplin said in an exclusive interview. So far, the news is good. The youngest batches of expired doses remain of a high quality with vaccine levels at sufficient concentrations. Tests are ongoing, but up to 1 million doses could pass muster from the batches now being analyzed, Chaplin said.

The news comes as countries struggle to secure enough doses of the only licensed monkeypox vaccine to protect people most at risk from the painful viral infection, which is endemic in parts of Africa but has over the past 4 months spread around the world, mainly among the gay and bisexual communities. The US, despite a long-standing partnership with the company to develop and stockpile the shot, has been caught short.

[There is a lengthy discussion of how this vaccine shortfall occurred and what is being done to overcome production barriers. Interested readers can access the full report at the above URL. - Mod.TY]

[A 19 Aug 2022 report states that "federal health leaders are ramping up the monkeypox vaccine production pipeline as the disease spreads around the United States. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced an agreement between Bavarian Nordic and Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing (GRAM), a Michigan-based pharmaceutical maker, to make the JYNNEOS vaccine domestically.

"'The Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the HHS Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), has ordered 5.5 million vials of JYNNEOS from Bavarian Nordic to be filled, finished, and delivered from US government-owned bulk vaccine stored in Denmark,' the HHS announcement said. 'Under the procurement, Bavarian Nordic agreed to complete a technology transfer that would allow for 2.5 million of those vials to be filled and finished by a US-based contract manufacturer.'" - Mod.TY
