A sandwich shop that closed after several people became sick with _E.
coli_ reopened overnight Thursday [9 Oct 2008]. "They met all the
requirements we asked of them," Public Health epidemiologist Nisha
Alden told the Boulder Daily Camera. "They thoroughly cleaned and
sanitized their restaurant. They're starting with a new supply of
food, and they've screened their employees to make sure they're healthy."

Alden tells the paper 18 people have been sickened by the bacteria.
The 1st sickness was reported 16 Sep 2008.

[2] Public Health report
Date: 9 Oct 2008

<http://www.bouldercounty.org/health/pr/2008/100908EColiOutbreak.htm>


Boulder County Public Health is investigating an outbreak of _E.
coli_ cases in Boulder County. There are currently 17
outbreak-related cases, although the source of the outbreak has not
yet been determined. The primary symptoms of _E. coli_ are bloody
diarrhea and severe stomach cramping.

To avoid contamination and spreading disease, it is recommended that
people wash their hands thoroughly after handling or preparing raw
meats and clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that have come
into contact with raw meats or their juices. Ensure that meats are
cooked thoroughly, and do not consume raw milk products and
unpasteurized juices.

[3] Microbiology report
Date: Mon 20 Oct 2008
From: Joyce Knutsen <jknutsen@smtpgate.dphe.state.co.us>


The outbreak was confirmed at the Laboratory Services Division of the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to be a
sorbitol-negative _E. coli_ O157:NM, stx1 & stx2 positive by PCR. To
date, there have been approximately 15 cases confirmed to match by
PFGE. There have been several articles on the local news websites and
the Boulder County Health Dept website regarding this investigation.

The vehicle of transmission and source of the bacteria have not been
identified yet. At this time, the investigation is still ongoing. The
Boulder County Health Department and the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment are working together to complete this
investigation as quickly as possible.

This investigation was beginning as another STEC investigation from
Arapahoe County was ending. That outbreak came to the attention of
the Tri-County Health Department due to the infection, HUS and
subsequent death of a 3-year-old male child who attended an
unlicensed daycare. There were at least 7 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7,
stx2 positive by PCR and 3 cases of a probable non-O157 STEC that was
unable to be isolated at the CDPHE laboratory. The probably non-O157
STEC was identified by running PCR on GN broth cultures from stool
samples that were collected from the daycare attendees. The were 2
cases of broth cultures that were positive for stx1 by PCR but
negative for stx2 and only produced sorbitol-fermenting colonies,
none of which tested positive for shigatoxin by PCR. One other case
was positive for not only the non-O157 STEC but also was
culture-positive for the _E. coli_ O157:H7 strain as well. The GN
broths that were positive for stx1 were sent to CDC for further
confirmation and isolation attempts.

[ProMED thanks Ms. Knutsen for not only submitting the post but also
for supplying useful microbiologic information regarding this
outbreak. Although most _E. coli_ O157:H7 strains are not tested
specifically for the presence of the H7 flagellar antigen but rather
identified by virtue of being non-sorbitol fermenting and producing
one or both shigatoxins, _E. coli_ O157:NM (non-motile, also referred
to as O157:H-), the non-motile variants of O157, seems to be
relatively unusual at least in the western hemisphere. Bopp, et al
(1) reported on all strains of _E. coli_ submitted to CDC over a
3-year period and found 200 were O157:H7, 6 were O157:H7 and 2 were
non-O157. Subsequent to that report, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:NM
was also reported from California associated with recreational
exposure to lake water (2).

ProMED has previously reported regarding sorbitol-fermenting _E.
coli_ O157 strains in Europe. Not stressed in these postings was that
these were O157:NM strains. Although 1st recognized in Germany in
1988 (3), sorbitol-fermenting, verotoxigenic _E. coli_O157 was
thought to be restricted to continental Europe (4) until an isolation
in Australia in 2002. The 1st isolation in the UK was reported in
2002. Cattle have been shown to be a reservoir for this non-motile
strain (5). It is important to note that these European
sorbitol-fermenting strains of _E. coli_ O157:NM appear to be more
pathogenic, not due to a different genotype or amount of toxin
produced but rather seemingly related to increased curli production
with more exposure to the colon mucosa (6). Curli are the major
proteinaceous component of a complex extracellular matrix produced by
many _Enterobacteriaceae_ (7).
