Latest annual reports on HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and preliminary data for the 1st 6 months of this year [2016], published by the HSE [Health Service Executive] Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) show increases in notifications of HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhoea in Ireland, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) (1,2).

While the number of cases of most STIs [sexually transmitted infections] remained relatively stable in 2015 compared to 2014, the multisectoral national group established early in 2016 to respond to these recent increases has expressed concern about a 50 percent increase in syphilis, and a 30 percent increase in HIV cases in 2015.

Although some of the increase in HIV can be explained by a change in the notification procedures for HIV and an outbreak in people who inject drugs, these increases have largely been seen in men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM account for 4/5 of the syphilis cases, and more than half of the HIV cases.

For HIV, an increasing proportion of MSM born abroad, and particularly from Latin America, who were HIV positive before coming to Ireland, has contributed to this. There are also increases in the number of MSM from abroad who report acquiring HIV in Ireland.

In addition, although gonorrhoea numbers in 2015 were similar to 2014, latest data for 2016 show that gonorrhoea rates in men have risen by 63%. This has been seen only in men, suggesting that this increase is occurring mainly in MSM. In 2015, 55% of cases of gonorrhoea were in this group [MSM].

A recent survey on sexual behaviours in MSM in Ireland (MISI 2015 [Internet Survey Ireland]) (3), reported that 25 percent of men have had condomless anal intercourse with more than one partner in the last year, posing a risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV and STIs. 37 percent of men had never been tested for HIV and 38 percent had never been tested for an STI.

Promoting condom use and regular testing remain key to limiting the spread of HIV and STIs in men who have sex with men.

The Gay Health Network along with the HSE and other partners, including peer groups, are continuing to promote sexual health awareness, encourage testing and support safer sex among MSM through the http://www.man2man.ie programme. The Gay Men's Health Service is offering a new clinic in Dublin on Monday afternoons, on a pilot basis, to improve access to testing for MSM. Furthermore, in partnership with the Gay Health Network, outreach workers are being employed on a pilot basis to deliver peer support and interventions among the MSM community, in particular among Latin American MSM in Dublin.

Safer sex using condoms is an effective way of preventing HIV and other STIs. Men who have sex with men and who have taken a sexual health risk are encouraged to get tested for HIV and STIs. Details of free HIV and STI testing services, condoms, support, and information are available at http://www.man2man.ie or from Gay Switchboard Ireland or <ask@ghn.ie>.

[Provisional data for the 1st 6 months of this year (2016) have been published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) (references 1 and 2 above). For gonorrhea, the number of reported cases increased 58.7 percent in the 1st 2 quarters of 2016 compared to the 1st 2 quarters of 2015, that is, 873 vs 550, respectively; and for HIV, the number of cases increased 34 percent in the 1st 2 quarters of 2016 compared to the 1st 2 quarters of 2015, that is, 273 vs 203, respectively. However, there has been no rise in reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases; the number of cases of P&S syphilis remained stable in the 1st 2 quarters of 2016 compared to the number in the 1st 2 quarters of 2015, that is, 105 vs 107, respectively. In the 1st 2 quarters of 2016, for gonorrhea, 40 percent of cases occurred in MSM and for syphilis, 82.9 percent occurred in MSM. - Mod.ML
