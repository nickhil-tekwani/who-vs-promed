Antigenic Similarity of Current Northern and Southern Hemisphere Isolates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccine strains in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres are "tailored" to
the virus subtypes currently circulating in that region. The H3N2 subtype
isolates in either hemisphere are antigenically similar (the same can be
said for the H1N1 subtypes isolates, as well as the influenza B virus
strains), so a vaccinated individual from one hemisphere should have good
protection when traveling to the other hemisphere.
Having said that, I certainly agree that some formulation of the influenza
virus vaccine should be available to individuals traveling to the other
hemisphere during an influenza season. Since the vaccine only provides
protection for a limited time and the influenza seasons occur at different
times of the year in the 2 hemispheres, there is a chance that Dr.
Woodall's immune response to influenza virus is waning, making him more at
risk. If still available, a boost with the Southern Hemisphere formulation
would have been a good precautionary measure.
