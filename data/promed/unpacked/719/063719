After a fish die off on the southern end of Clear Lake raised recent concern, a second large kill was noted, this time off the shores of Lakeport.

According to a statement released by Lake County's Department of Water Resources, this is most likely the consequence of nutrients, cyanobacteria and warm water temperatures adversely affecting water quality, primarily dissolved oxygen.

Fish rely on oxygen to breathe and process nutrients in their bodies. Warm water fish such as those living in Clear Lake need to have about 5 parts per million (ppm) dissolved oxygen to thrive.

Like many other lakes in California, nationwide and around the world, Clear Lake has this summer been host to a large, dense, persistent cyanobacteria bloom (sometimes called blue-green algae). The bloom has been lake-wide with various intensities due to wind, water depth and nutrient cycling (phosphorus).

These dense blooms produce ample oxygen during the day, but consume oxygen during the dark hours at night.

Warm water conditions also contribute to the problem because warm water holds less dissolved gases (including oxygen) than cold water but warm water also increases the fish's metabolic rate. So the fish need more oxygen to digest and thrive, but the water cannot hold as much oxygen as it can in the spring, winter and fall months.

According to the statement, at the current water temperatures of Clear Lake (80-84 F) [26-29 C], the dissolved oxygen saturation point is about 7.9 ppm.

Recent monitoring by the California Department of Food and Agriculture has shown the dissolved oxygen concentration off the shores of Lakeport during the day have been as high as 30 ppm or more. At night, when the bacteria begin to respire or use oxygen, the dissolved oxygen concentrations plummet, bottoming out at 1 ppm or less.

In the same area off Lakeport, the dissolved oxygen concentration dropped to near zero 17 nights between 5 Jul and 1 August [2017].

"These factors have come together in a perfect storm of sorts on Clear Lake -- very warm water, dense cyanobacteria blooms, plenty of nutrients for the bacteria in the form of phosphorus from the landscape, wildly vacillating dissolved oxygen concentrations and fish that are already under stress in the warm water," the statement read.

Cyanobacteria blooms may, at times, produce toxins that can adversely affect pets and people. For this reason Water Department personnel cautions people to avoid heavy algal scums in the water. Pets should not be allowed to swim in the lake as they may ingest the algae or scum.

Caution should be exercised when young children interact with the water because they too may ingest the water and be more prone to adverse health effects due to their smaller body size.

The department advises people to rinse off pets and people thoroughly with clean water after swimming and do not use raw lake water for cooking -- boiling does not remove the toxins. Before eating fish from the lake, throw away the guts and thoroughly rinse the filets with tap or bottled water.

[There are a number of very toxic blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. The toxin may be present even if the algae are not, and likewise the algae may be present but the toxin may not be. However, safety for humans and animals means avoiding bodies of water with any blue-green algae.

There are a number of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as 'pond scum.' Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.

Many different species of blue-green algae occur, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp, _Aphanizomenon_ sp, _Microcystis_ sp, and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species can change over the course of the season.

Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appears clear, if a 'bloom' is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.

One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. Microcystis can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin microcystin. When microcystis die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

People swimming in dense microcystis blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US; however, Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

The most common route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water, followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, microcystis blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people who consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people who frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports microcystis blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of microcystis cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water containing microcystis or through ingesting algal mats.

A microscopic look at microcystin can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcystis_aeruginosa and https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/cyanobacteriacyanotoxins. The 2nd link also has pictures of how the water looks with this organism.
