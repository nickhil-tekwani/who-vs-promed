[Further to the ProMED-mail posting referenced above, we have
obtained the following information from Dr Juan Lubroth:]

Iraq has reported to FAO that cases of mortality in livestock were
due to hemorrhagic septicemia and not RVF (Rift Valley fever) as
previously reported.

Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], endemic in the country,
may also have complicated clinical recognition, identification,
reporting, and diagnostic confirmation as FMD infections are known to
be sometimes fatal in young animals from myocarditis and infarctions.

[We are most grateful to Dr Lubroth for the prompt response.

According to OIE's (World Organization for Animal Health) disease
fact sheets (see <http://oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/a_A080.htm>),
the differential diagnosis of RVF included also the following
diseases:

- Bluetongue
- Wesselsbron disease
- Enterotoxemia of sheep
- Ephemeral fever
- Brucellosis
- Vibriosis
- Trichomonosis
- Nairobi sheep disease
- Heartwater
- Ovine enzootic abortion
- Toxic plants
- Bacterial septicemias
- Rinderpest and Peste des petits ruminants (PPR)

Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS), reported by the Iraqi authorities as the
disease which was confused with RVF, is a highly fatal disease of
cattle and water buffalo, caused by 2 serotypes of _Pasteurella
multocida_. Contrary to RVF, HS does not affect sheep and goats and
is not zoonotic.

HS is an important disease in Asia, Africa, some countries in
southern Europe, and the Middle East. The highest incidence is in
Southeast Asia. For further reading, see
