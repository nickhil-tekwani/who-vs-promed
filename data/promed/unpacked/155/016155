Commenting yesterday on the present yellow fever hype in Rio de Janeiro and
in Brazil, moderator Dr. Jack Woodall refers to the epidemiology
coordinator of the city Health Secretariat as "he". Dr. Meri Baran is a
woman.
It is difficult to see why, on the basis of one confirmed case of yellow
fever, already well past the infectivity period, a mass vaccination
campaign against yellow fever can be proposed. Brazil has a population of
over 160 million people, a very large part of which living in areas
infested by _Aedes aegypti_. The decision to vaccinate Rio de Janeiro (the
city? the State? Greater Rio?) would certainly generate an outcry (how many
people are able to distinguish _Aedes_ from ubiquitous _Culex_ ?) to
vaccinate the whole country - and then there would not be enough vaccines
available (I understand there are some 40 million doses in stock),
especially since the index case in Rio was actually diagnosed because two
other persons that had visited the same area in Goias State were found to
be sick with yellow fever (one of them died). Besides the expenses
involved, the number of doses in stock could be made dangerously low, in a
situation where most of the country is vulnerable to a virus that is
already here.
It should be considered also that by far and large, most Brazilians (more
that 80%) live nowadays in cities. The number of people entering areas of
sylvatic yellow fever transmission is not inordinately high. Nevertheless,
there seems to be presently an extension of the epizootic zone - a common,
recurring phenomenon - with transmission occurring in more southerly areas.
That would of course increase the number of exposed persons.
And why not vaccinate Rio? Is one detected case any different, from an
epidemiological point of view, from nought detected cases? If it is not,
then we must most urgently vaccinate 150 million people - because infected
individuals can at this very moment be returning to any place in Brazil.
There would be not enough vaccines, though.
What needs to be done, and hasn't so far, is to promote yellow fever
awareness to people travelling to areas with sylvatic yellow fever (in
Brazil), or with urban yellow fever, elsewhere. Travellers to infected
areas in Brazil should be vaccinated, and advised to take mosquito
precautions - the carriers of sylvatic yellow fever are mosquitoes of the
genus _Haemagogus_, that, contrary to _Aedes_, will bite outdoors, and have
nocturnal activity. The latter precautions would also help prevent malaria,
another disease that is not recognised by health authorities as a threat to
Brazilians travelling inside Brazil (the Fundacao Nacional de Saude,
National Health Foundation is the only case in the world that I know of a
health authority NOT recommending anti malaria chemoprophylaxis to people
exposed to [malaria.
On the other hand, considering the safety record of the 17D yellow fever
vaccine produced in Brazil, its high degree of immunogenicity, and the long
duration of protection, the timely vaccination of the whole Brazilian
population should be undertaken, as it already is being considered by the
Government.

[It is not clear to me whether this message is meant to suggest
country-wide vaccination or the opposite. After all there has been only
one case and YF virus has been known for decades to occur enzootically in
Brazil.
As for Jack making the error of indicating that Dr. Meri Beran is a male
when, indeed, she is a female, I am sure he would apologize to Dr. Beran in
person, if given the opportunity. Like so many of us, Jack is not perfect.
I here insert the missing letter: "s". - Mod.CHC
