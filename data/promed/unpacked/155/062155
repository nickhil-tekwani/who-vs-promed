Five Indonesian people from a family related by blood were confirmed
to be infected by avian influenza virus after tests by the country's
laboratory, health ministry officials said here Saturday.
Director General of Disease Control of the ministry, I Nyoman Kandun,
said that the 5 people from Indonesia's North Sumatra province had
had contact with fowls and pigs. He said that their blood samples had
been sent to the World Health Organization's (WHO) affiliated
laboratory in Hong Kong. Their tests results were positive, Kandun
told Xinhua.
The 5 are a 29-year-old woman, 2 men aged 19 and 35 who died at the
end of April 2006, and 2 other men (25 and 35 years old) who survive,
according to the director. They are from one family, he said.
The director said that 3 others from the family were suspected of
having the virus, including a 40-year-old woman and a 10-year-old
boy, both of whom have died, and a 35-year-old man who survives.
According to Kandun, the WHO has confirmed that 26 out of 35 people
[who contracted] the virus have died.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, which has killed more than 90
people, is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia.
The WHO has said that the virus may mutate [into] a certain form that
could infect [and be transmitted from] human to human, which would
turn the outbreak into a pandemic that could kill millions of people
because they would have no immunity.
