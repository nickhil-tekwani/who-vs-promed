[1] Co-circulation of influenza virus types (A and B) and type A subtypes (H1 and H3) in Kathmandu, Nepal
Date: Wed 17 Jan 2018
From: Sher Bahadur Pun <drsherbdr@yahoo.com> [edited]


Over the past few days, there have been an increasing number of patients presenting with influenza like illness (ILI) to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (OPD), Kathmandu. Patients have contracted influenza type A (subtypes H1 and H3) and type B. Interestingly, most of the patients were found to be infected with influenza B viruses. However, so far government laboratory does not further elaborate influenza B viruses to identify its lineages, i.e. Yamagata or Victoria lineage. It is, in fact worth knowing lineages of influenza B, which can be helpful in selecting vaccine candidates for this country.

A total of 5 people have died and more than 100 people have been taken ill due to flu at Khadachakra Municipality-3 and 4 in Kalikot district in the last 2 weeks.

The District Health Office (DHO) said 5 people, including 3 children, died after they were struck down by of flu. According to Dhan Singh Kami, the ward chairman of Khadachakra-4, viral fever has taken the lives of 3 children all under the age of one in 2 weeks. At Khadachakra-3, flu has led to the deaths of BP and MP.

A seasonal outbreak of influenza [Influenza A/H1N1] claimed another life in Multan on [Thu 18 Jan 2018], taking the death toll to 24. The deceased, a 22-year-old girl hailing from Layyah (District in Punjab Province), was under treatment at Nishtar Hospital (Multan), informed hospital officials.

The spokesperson for the Multan's health department remarked that 3 more influenza [Influenza A/H1N1] patients have been admitted to Nishtar Hospital in the last 24 hours. At least 197 patients have been admitted to the hospital in last month [December 2017], of which 103 were diagnosed with influenza [Influenza A/H1N1], the spokesperson shared, adding that the doctors are waiting for the reports of 8 patients.

Influenza [Influenza A/H1N1] has claimed 24 lives in Multan in the past month and 25 patients are currently under treatment at the hospital.

The New Year has begun with a health alert for Rajasthan, which is facing it's worst ever outbreak of swine flu (H1N1/Influenza/A) that has sickened 374 people and caused 24 deaths in a little over 2 weeks.

Until [Tue 9 Jan 2018], Rajasthan had reported 195 cases and 7 deaths, but cases have almost doubled since then. Updated data from the state, likely to be added up by next week, will push up the national numbers from the current 220 cases and 10 deaths. In 2017, India witnessed 85 H1NI cases and 5 deaths in the corresponding period, with the year [2017] ending with 38 810 cases and 2264 deaths.

The state has begun screening people for flu symptoms around every swine flu case within 24 hours of a case being reported. "An audit of every swine flu death from [Mon 1-Thu 11 Jan 2018] is being done. Most of the people who died were in the 51-64 years, showed an investigation of the 16 deaths," said additional director (Rural Health) Dr Ravi Prakash Mathur.

Apart from increasing awareness by distributing pamphlets in the affected areas, screening is will be done at night shelters, hostels, schools, and paying guest facilities, he said.

H1N1 is still the predominant virus strain in circulation in India, as compared to the US, which is reporting an outbreak of 2 strains of influenza viruses-- H3N2 and H1N1. "In India, the predominant virus strain so far is H1N1 and not a single sample of H3N2 has been picked up by our surveillance system, but with the global spurt in H3N2 cases, we are constantly testing samples for other influenza strains," Dhariwal said.

Flu cases report an increase inâ€‰January in the north and around February-March in peninsular India, causing symptoms like fever, lethargy and cough.

It is a self-limiting infection, with hospitalisation needed only for high-risk populations, such as people over 65 years and children.

Between [Mon 8 and Sun 14 Jan 2018], 160 out of every 100 000 inhabitants of Belgium consulted a general practitioner because of a flu syndrome, a ratio that is slightly above the epidemic threshold of 141 consultations per 100 000 inhabitants, the Scientific Institute of Public Health, ISP disclosed on [Wed 17 Jan 2018]. This marks the 1st time the threshold has been crossed for this season.

For an epidemic to be declared, the threshold must be crossed for 2 consecutive weeks, which means that if the number of consultations rises above the 141 limit this week, the ISP will announce formally that there is a flu epidemic in Belgium.

Since early January [2018], the severity and intensity of the flu is also being monitored through a network of 6 hospitals around the country, which report all cases of hospitalization for severe respiratory infections to the ISP.

At this stage of the flu outbreak, the ISP has noticed an increase in the number of hospitalizations.

A new influenza virus was detected in Bulgaria. Yesterday [Thu 18 Jan 2018], the National Reference Laboratory at the National Center for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases has demonstrated in four samples from the Sliven region a new strain of group B virus - "Victoria". Of the 300 samples tested, there were 100 positive results, indicating an epidemic spread. Up to 84 percent are from group B, which is surprising - most of them are from the Yamagata strain. The 12 strains are group "A". This was announced by Professor Todor Kantardzhiev, Director of the National Center for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, before the Bulgarian National Television.

There is a complication in group B that affects the central nervous system. Prof. Kantardjiev urged hospital directors to be ready in the neurological wards to accept such cases. Areas with increased data on diseases - Sofia, Plovdiv, Blagoevgrad, Sliven and Bourgas. There must be carefully monitored the instructions of the Center for infectious and parasitic diseases, the expert also said. According to him, the vigorous beginning of the flu should be carefully monitored, not to underestimate the symptoms and seek medical attention.

[Influenza viruses are negative single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae and cause worldwide epidemics of influenza with high rates of illness and death. Human influenza A and B viruses cause a self-limited acute respiratory infection. This infection has an abrupt onset and causes fever, chills, headache, cough, and myalgia. Every year, different strains of influenza viruses emerge because of continuous antigenic drift and interspecies gene reassortment, which cause antigenic shifts. Severe complications of influenza can involve the lower respiratory tract (pneumonia), heart (myocarditis), and central nervous system (encephalitis, myelitis, meningitis, febrile and afebrile seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cerebellar ataxia) and can lead to death [1].

Although type A and B influenza viruses might induce neurologic complications, most published studies on virus neurotropism have focused on influenza A viruses, with an emphasis on the new A(H1N1) pdm09 virus strain after 2009 [2]. The pathogenic mechanisms behind the influenza CNS complications are unknown.

Influenza B virus, which was 1st isolated from a child in 1940, has steadily adapted to humans without a stable animal reservoir [3]. The earliest report of a case of influenza B viral encephalitis was in London, UK, in 1946, but only sporadic cases with neurologic manifestations have been reported, especially in children and adolescents. Influenza B is generally considered a mild disease with less frequent neurologic complications than influenza A. However, there have been numerous reports of influenza B associated neurological symptoms. Influenza B neurologic manifestations have been reported mainly in children. In 1998-1999, an outbreak of influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy (148 cases, mostly linked with influenza A/H3N2 infection, only 17 with influenza B viruses) was observed primarily in children less than 5 years of age in Japan [4]. Popescu et reported an unusually high number of adults infected with influenza B virus with neurologic complications at a tertiary care facility in Romania in early 2017 [5]. The above report from Bulgaria does not specify the age group of the effected cases, the continuous evolution of influenza viruses has given rise to emergence of virulent strains that may produce unpredictable clinical presentations, particularly in largely unvaccinated populations. - Mod.UBA
