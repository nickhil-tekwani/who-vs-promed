The S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control has referred 11 people to their private health care providers for post-exposure treatment after being potentially exposed to a rabid cat in Richland County near Chapin.

After roaming outdoors, the family cat returned home on 29 May 2015 with visible wounds caused by an unknown animal, DHEC officials said. The incident was reported to DHEC once the cat began showing symptoms of rabies around 25 June 2015. During that period, the cat exposed family members and the veterinary clinic staff who treated the animal. The cat was not current on its rabies vaccine. It was confirmed rabid on 26 June 2015.

"Although wild animals contract rabies most often, domestic pets can contract the disease as well," said Sandra Craig of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services (BEHS). "To reduce the risk of getting rabies, we recommend that people avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild. About 275 South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies every year, with most exposures coming from bites or scratches by a rabid or suspected rabid animal. If you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a bite, scratch, or the saliva of a possibly infected animal, immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water," Craig said. "Be sure to get medical attention, and report the incident to DHEC."

Craig said it's possible that outdoor pets can come in contact with wild animals. Having your pet up-to-date on its rabies vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your family from possible exposure to this fatal disease. If a pet returns home with visible wounds that might have been caused by another animal, seek medical treatment for your pet immediately and inform your local DHEC Environmental Quality Control office. "Time is of the essence," Craig said, "because a beloved pet might be saved if treated properly and in a timely manner. This is also important in order to protect the people who come in contact with the pet. Informing DHEC enables us to take the proper steps to help reduce further exposure to both people and pets."

There were 139 confirmed cases of rabies in animals during 2014 in South Carolina. There have been 75 confirmed cases in animals statewide this year [2015]. This animal is the 5th to test positive in 2015 from Richland County. There were 5 animals that tested positive for rabies in that county in 2014.

[Richland County is in the middle of South Carolina. See: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/south_carolina_90.jpg.

This was an instance of obvious human exposure and the need to vaccinate those in contact with this rabid cat. And because by the nature of my research as a veterinary epidemiologist and awareness of the risks of exposure, I made sure my vaccination status was always up to date, but I do know of instances of human "exposure" that were at best uncertain. Rabies death is a horrible fate and only rarely stoppable once symptoms have started.

A recent study in Oregon has pointed up the frequency of over PEP treatment there. See: "Half of people who get rabies shots shouldn't, King County health study finds;" by JoNel Aleccia, Seattle Times, http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/half-of-people-who-get-rabies-shots-shouldnt-king-county-health-study-finds/.

With the oversight of Affordable Care, I think we can expect to see other studies like this with the intention of reducing a perceived unnecessary cost. I won't argue with the report conclusion that many PEP treatments were not needed, and better medical training and guidance will help. On the other hand, I cannot help but note that zero rabies incidence in properly treated exposed (real or just perceived) individuals is a result of treatment and vaccination. What we see constantly in these ProMED reports of human rabies are times when possible treatment was denied or overlooked. Where a better PEP decision lies between caution and hyper-caution I don't know, though experience would tell one that it must exist, cognizant of the risks. - Mod.MHJ
