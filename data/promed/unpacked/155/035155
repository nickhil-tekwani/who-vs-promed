50 Feared Dead in Typhoid Outbreak
----------------------------------------
More than 100 people are critically ill in hospital and 50 others are
feared dead in what is claimed to be a typhoid outbreak.
The 50 are said to have died in Embu and its environs over the past 2
weeks, but medical authorities in the district would not comment on the issue.
The hardest hit areas include Embu town, Manyatta and Runyenjes. Cases are
also said to have been reported in the neighbouring districts of Mbeere,
Kirinyaga and Meru South.
Most of the victims of the suspected outbreak were admitted to the Embu
Provincial General Hospital, while others have sought treatment at the
local rural health centres.
At the provincial hospital, journalists found more than 100 critically ill
patients sharing beds in the medical wards, while others were sleeping on
the floor.
Nurses said they have been admitting more than 10 typhoid cases daily. They
were fearful the hospital might not be able to cope with the increasing
number of patients if urgent measures are not taken to contain the situation.
Other patients are admitted to Kyeni and Mwea Mission Hospitals, while
others are seeking treatment at local private health institutions.
Patients who talked to the press blamed their illness on the use of dirty
water being supplied in many parts of the district. There are reports that
residents of Embu town, Kithimu and Kithegi are using untreated water.
A source at the Health Ministry said they did not have enough facilities to
cope with a disease outbreak.

[From time to time we see reports of outbreaks of typhoid-like disease in
Kenya, but I can find no examples in the ProMED-mail archives of
confirmation of the diagnosis (see references cited above). We would
appreciate further information on this outbreak. - Mod.ES
