RHODOCOCCUS EQUI, FOWL - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: CORRECTION
*******************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
[see: Rhodococcus equi, fowl - Dominican Republic 970901161803]

I really meant foals (young horses) [not "fowls," as in the original we
received - Mod.JW] so this was an "equine only" outbreak, not a cross
species transmission of disease.
