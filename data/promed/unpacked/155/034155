New cases of Congo plague but appears contained
-----------------------------------------------
Doctors have found at least 60 new cases of plague in eastern Congo, but the
disease does not appear to be spreading beyond the mining town where it broke
out, aid workers said on Mon, 28 Feb 2005.
Pneumonic plague, which is highly contagious, broke out 2 months ago in
Zobia, a town that was home to at least 7000 diamond miners, some 300 km (186
miles) north of the provincial capital Kisangani.
"There are still cases coming into Zobia, but these are restricted to the
mining area. It does not seem to have spread any further," Eric Bertherat,
head of a WHO team, told Reuters by phone from Zobia.
Aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) said it had registered new cases in
the town, which is in Congo's lawless Ituri district, where fighting over
minerals has raged for years.
"We have registered 61 fresh cases, including a death," Philippe Havet, MSF's
emergency coordinator said on Mon, 28 Feb 2005. "There were 15 new cases
yesterday, but these people are limited to the mine, no further."
Doctors had feared the disease might have spread when 4000 of the miners left
Zobia and disappeared into the bush 2 weeks ago, fleeing the disease and
clashes involving various factions of the security forces guarding the mining
area.
Pneumonic plague infects victims' lungs, can be easily transmitted between
people, and kills within 48 hours if not treated immediately, doctors say.
Aid agencies and government health officials have scoured the bush for
infected miners who may have fled Zobia but say they have found none so far.
Initial reports suggested that 61 people had died in the outbreak. Bertherat
said all the recorded deaths are being re-examined by the teams on the ground
now to reconfirm the causes of those deaths. "Although we are finding more
cases in Zobia, it seems that, overall, there are fewer cases than the 400 we
originally thought there were," he said. "We are also trying to change the
way that people deal with their dead. The local custom here is for the body
to be washed and dressed, but this is very dangerous as the plague is so
contagious," he said.
Congo is struggling to recover from a 5-year war and decades of chaos which
left its health system in tatters. The conflict in the former Zaire was
officially declared over in 2003 but clashes still erupt, especially in the
east.

[In our previous post it was reported that MSF had discovered a new case in
the town of Buta after sending an emergency team of doctors to the area.
This town is substantially separated from Zobia. Now it seems possible that
the case was either unrelated to the Zobia cases or was not plague at all.
Even if the infection is confined to the area, the continuing number of cases
is of significant concern and demonstrates ongoing person-to-person
transmission. - Mod.LL]
