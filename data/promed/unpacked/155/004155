Total tally nears 200 over 5-year project -- more elk go to slaughter
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wyoming Game and Fish Department personnel loaded 13 elk into a stock
trailer and hauled them to an eastern Idaho facility for slaughter
Tuesday morning [9 Feb 2010] after the animals tested positive for
exposure to the contagious disease brucellosis. 10 of the animals
originated on the Scab Creek elk feed ground, while the other 3 were
from the Muddy Creek feedground.

Meat from the animals will be brought back to Wyoming for free
distribution, while tissue samples are harvested for further
brucellosis research.

This concludes the 5th and final year of the program aimed at
reducing the brucellosis exposure rate of elk using 3 feedgrounds in
the Pinedale herd unit. In all, just less than 200 cow elk were
slaughtered during the 5 years after they tested positive for
exposure to brucellosis.

The program began in 2006 with testing on the Muddy Creek feedground,
with 171 cow elk sampled and 58 with positive exposure results. In
2007, testing was repeated at Muddy Creek again, with 79 elk tested,
13 of which tested positive. The pilot program expanded in 2008 to
include both the Muddy Creek and Fall Creek feedgrounds. A total of
154 elk were tested at Muddy, with 21 positive exposure tests, and
191 elk tested at Fall Creek, with 21 positives.

The 2009 testing program was the only year that all 3 feedgrounds
were included. 114 elk were tested at Muddy Creek, with 8 testing
positive for exposure. At Fall Creek, 158 cow elk were tested, with
11 positives. At Scab Creek, 149 elk were tested, with 31 positive
results. The winter of 2009-10 has been relatively mild, and elk
feeding has not occurred at the Fall Creek feedground. Trapping at
Muddy Creek this final year resulted in the testing of 141 elk, with
7 testing positive for exposure. Trapping at Scab Creek also involved
141 elk, with 27 positives.

The program, a recommendation of the Wyoming Brucellosis Coordination
Team, will now be subject to a reassessment by this group, involving
both livestock and wildlife representatives and animal health and
public health officials.

[The Wyoming Game & Fish Department is to be congratulated. Herding
elk sufficiently for blood testing is neither straightforward nor cheap.

Muddy Creek is SW of Rawlins on the I-80 and near the Colorado
border. Scab Creek is on the west side of the Wind River Range, near
Pinedale. - Mod.MHJ]
