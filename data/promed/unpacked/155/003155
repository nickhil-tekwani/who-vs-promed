The 1st outbreak of equine flu in Cumbria, [England], has been confirmed by animal health officials. The Animal Health Trust says the horse affected was an unvaccinated non-Thoroughbred that had recently arrived on a private yard in the county following post-purchase movement from another part of the UK.

A report on the AHT website said the horse had shown signs of mild fever, coughing, and nasal discharge shortly after arriving and tested positive for EI [equine influenza] by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab on 15 Mar 2019. The only other horse on the property, says AHT, was vaccinated and had so far shown no clinical signs of the disease.

Paragon Veterinary Practice, based in Dalston, near Carlisle, posted a message on their Facebook page confirming the equine flu outbreak in the county. Leading Paragon equine vet Paul May said they would advise limiting horse travel if possible for the next few days until the scale of the outbreak in Cumbria can be determined.

"If your horse is going to or returning home from events, it is sensible to take its temperature daily," said Mr May. "Horse owners should not panic; just be vigilant. The majority of outbreaks in recent weeks have been in unvaccinated horses; however, minor signs of infection have been seen in vaccinated horses. We recommend that all horses are vaccinated, as this is the best protection against flu and will reduce the length and severity of the disease."

Some events and venues, said Mr May, now require 6 monthly vaccination. "So it is important to check what they require from you for competing. EI is still popping up in various parts of the country, and there seems to be a new case every day, so if you have any concerns that your horse may have the flu or want further advice, please get in touch to speak to our equine vets," he added.

So far AHT has confirmed 50 positive outbreaks of equine flu in the country since January [2019], with 10 so far in March [2019], including the one in Cumbria.

The AHT spokesman said: "Vaccinated horses should have a level of protection to this new strain. If vaccinated horses are exposed to the virus, clinical signs should be milder, and they should get better faster than an unvaccinated horse. This has been demonstrated in the vaccinated cases seen so far this year [2019]. We continue to emphasise the importance of vaccination in protecting horses against equine flu."

"Reassuringly, we can confirm that vaccines are providing a better degree of protection than was initially thought when disease outbreaks became apparent in Europe, especially when recent boosting has been implemented. We recommend that all horse owners revaccinate their horse if the booster vaccination was given more than 6 months ago.

"It is clear that this strain of the virus (Florida Clade 1 H3N8) is not going away and is taking advantage of any given opportunity to spread among our horse population. Collectively, we all need to do everything we can to minimise these opportunities."

[Equine influenza [EI], an OIE-listed disease, is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenza virus_ A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. According to OIE's Manual, chapter 3.5.7 (last adopted May 2016), EI viruses [EIV] of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.07_EQ_INF.pdf).

While normally confined to equids, EIV H3N8 has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Infections of dogs have been reported in North America, generally producing mild fever and coughing, but fatal pneumonias have been recorded. Although EI has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described, primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus.

EI is endemic in the UK, but the current event, starting earlier this year (2019), is caused by a newly introduced strain, Florida Clade 1 H3N8. This strain has recently been recorded in several other western European countries; it is, reportedly, the same virus strain that shut down racing in Australia for 3 months in 2007, affecting more than 10 000 horses. The strain is endemic to North and South America. - Mod.AS
