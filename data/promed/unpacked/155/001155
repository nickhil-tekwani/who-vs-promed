Outbreak of Poliomyelitis in Dominican Republic and Haiti: Low Vaccination
Coverage with Oral Polio Vaccine allows Sabin-Derived Vaccine to Circulate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: A current outbreak of poliomyelitis in Dominican Republic and
Haiti has raised serious concerns because the Western Hemisphere has been
free of wild poliovirus circulation since 1991, and because the virus
identified is an unusual derivative of the Sabin type 1 oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV), according to Dr. Ciro de Quadros, who directs the Pan
American Health Organization's Division of Vaccines and Immunization.
The Ministries of Health of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, with the
assistance of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are investigating the outbreak to
determine the extent of spread and evaluate the reasons for the outbreak.
Aggressive control measures have already been put in place. A mass
vaccination campaign with OPV has already started in the Dominican
Republic, initially covering the 3 provinces with suspected cases, followed
shortly by the rest of the country. In Haiti, 3 nationwide vaccination
rounds with OPV are planned for January, February and March 2001. Since 12
Jul 2000, a total of 3 laboratory-confirmed cases due to [vaccine-]derived
poliovirus type 1 isolates have been identified. An additional 16 persons
with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) are now under investigation in the
Dominican Republic. In Haiti, a single laboratory-confirmed case due to the
[vaccine-]derived type 1 virus has been reported to date, with paralysis
onset on 30 Aug 2000. After intensive case-finding activities, no other
cases have been found so far. The virus detected, first isolated by the
PAHO Poliovirus Laboratory at the Caribbean Epidemiology Center and
subsequently characterized at the Poliovirus Laboratory at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is unusual because it is derived from
OPV, has 97 percent genetic similarity to the parental OPV strain, and
appears to have assumed the characteristics of wild poliovirus type 1, both
in terms of neurovirulence and transmissibility. The difference in
nucleotide sequence suggests the virus has been either replicating for a
prolonged period in an immunodeficient individual, or circulating for as
long as 2 years in an area where vaccination coverage is very low,
resulting in ongoing genetic changes in the original Sabin virus that gave
it the properties of wild poliovirus.
Prolonged circulation of OPV-derived polioviruses in areas with very low
OPV coverage has been documented in only one other setting -- type 2
OPV-derived virus circulated in Egypt for an estimated 10 years (1983-1993)
and was associated with more than 30 reported cases. In this instance,
vaccination coverage was very low in the affected areas, and circulation of
a vaccine-derived poliovirus was terminated rapidly once OPV vaccination
coverage increased. The key factor for control of circulating OPV-derived
viruses is the same as that required to control wild poliovirus
circulation: achieving and maintaining high vaccination coverage. Dr. de
Quadros said that: "No evidence for circulation of OPV-derived virus has
ever been found in any area with high coverage. The current outbreak is a
powerful reminder that even polio-free areas need to maintain high coverage
with polio vaccine until polio eradication has been achieved. Nearly 4
decades of experience with OPV has shown that it is very safe and effective
in preventing poliomyelitis. OPV is the vaccine of choice for the
eradication of wild polioviruses. However, it is crucial to maintain high
OPV coverage to protect against imported wild polioviruses and to prevent
person-to-person transmission of OPV-derived viruses." He added that: "It
is also important that all countries maintain high quality AFP and
poliovirus surveillance, that current activities to complete the global
eradication of wild polioviruses be accelerated, and that a global strategy
is developed for the orderly cessation of immunization with OPV after
global certification of polio eradication is achieved."
Travelers to the Dominican Republic and Haiti who are not adequately
immunized must be considered at risk of acquiring poliomyelitis, and should
make certain they are fully immunized against poliomyelitis. Those
countries using OPV for routine immunization recommend at least a 3-dose
primary vaccination series.
