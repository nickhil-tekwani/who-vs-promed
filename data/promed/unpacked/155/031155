A resident of Gawalmandi Chowk area of Quetta was brought to Fatima Jinnah Chest and General Hospital on suspicion of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, commonly referred to as Congo fever, on Sunday [1 Aug 2021], Dunya News reported.

The blood samples of the affected person were sent to the laboratory for testing and found positive for the disease. It is pertinent to mention here that 6 persons were brought to hospital on suspicion of Congo virus, out of which 4 were found positive for the disease.

Congo fever is a tickborne viral disease which is mainly transferred to humans from pets. The symptoms of the viral disease may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. Complications may also include liver failure.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by a tickborne virus, _Orthonairovirus_, of the family Nairoviridae that causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever. The virus is primarily transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases occur in individuals involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission can result from close contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

During the last week, 5 CCHF cases have been reported from Quetta (personal communication), while at least 20 confirmed cases have been reported from Balochistan province in 2021. The recent increase in cases may be attributed to close exposures during Eid ul-Azha (Feast of Sacrifice, 19-23 Jul 2021), which entails large-scale movement and sale of cattle and livestock.

In absence of an effective vaccine, it is essential to take measures to prevent exposure to the virus in order to prevent tick-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-human transmission in the community. Educating the general public about handling sacrificial animals and raw meat/blood, etc., can help minimise exposure and potential transmission.

The WHO recommendations to prevent CCHF are available at https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever. - Mod.UBA
