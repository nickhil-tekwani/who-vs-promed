Eastern equine encephalitis confirmed in Cumberland [County, North Carolina] horse
------------------------------------------------------------------
Although no cases of the rare disease ['infrequent human disease' probably more accurate. - Mod.MHJ] eastern equine encephalitis have been reported in humans this year [2015] in the state, the North Carolina Department of Public Health has confirmed the death of a Cumberland County horse identified as having the disease. The case, which was reported to the state on [7 Jul 2015], indicates the disease is present in the county, and state and local public health officials are advising people to take precautions to protect themselves and their horses, a news release from the Department of Public Health said.

Because of the case, and because the disease is transmitted through mosquito bites, the Cumberland County Department of Public Health is giving away free mosquito insecticide to Cumberland County residents while supplies last, the release said. County residents can pick up a 4-month supply of Mosquito Dunks at the Health Department, at 1235 Ramsey St, Monday through Friday between 7:30 am and 5 pm. There are extended hours on Tuesdays from 5 to 7 p.m. It can be picked up at the Environmental Health section on the 3rd floor.

It is commoner in the eastern part of North Carolina than in other areas of the state, the release said. The viral illness, transmitted by some species of mosquitoes, attacks the central nervous system by causing inflammation of the brain and can be fatal to animals and humans, the release said. Wild birds serve as reservoirs for the virus. Mosquitoes bite the birds and subsequently, can transmit the virus to humans and animals.

North Carolina averages about one human case of eastern equine encephalitis and about 10 equine cases each year, the release said. About 50 per cent of human eastern equine encephalitis cases are fatal, with young children and the elderly most at risk. Symptoms can develop from a few days to 2 weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito and can resemble the flu with rapid onset of fever and headache.

Survivors of eastern equine encephalitis infections may suffer from long-term effects to the nervous system. Therapy is limited to treating the symptoms of the disease, but there is no specific cure. There is a vaccine for horses, but not for humans, the release said.

For people, the best defense against eastern equine encephalitis infection is to avoid mosquito bites. Reduce time spent outdoors, particularly in early morning and early evening hours when mosquitoes are most active, wear light-colored long pants and long-sleeved shirts and apply mosquito repellent to exposed skin areas.

The best defense for horses is to vaccinate them against eastern equine encephalitis, the release said. [It is frequently fatal in unvaccinated horses. - Mod.MHJ] The American Academy of Equine Practitioners now recommends that eastern equine encephalitis vaccine be administered to all horses as a component of a core vaccination program. Visit http://aaep.org/info/guidelines for additional details.

To reduce mosquito breeding areas around your home and farm: Remove any containers that can hold water. Keep gutters clean and in good repair. Repair leaky outdoor faucets and change the water in bird baths and pet bowls at least twice a week. Use screened windows and doors and make sure screens fit tightly and are not torn. Keep tight-fitting screens or lids on rain barrels.

[When she was the Louisiana State public health epidemiologist, the late Louise McFarland and I would have many discussions about human cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Louisiana. While we had plenty of equine cases, human cases were far less frequent, and if the patient was hospitalised they recovered well. I think that in 30 years there was just one case that went home with permanent damage, no deaths. Our mutual opinion was that it probably reflected the year around presence of mosquitoes here. A frost merely buys us 7-10 days of mosquito freedom, and we can have winters with no frosts. And thus we probably have plenty of sub-clinical EEEv exposures. Put another way, the risk of severe human EEE cases is possibly proportional to the climatic severity of the local winters. Our problem is persuading the horse owners to vaccinate their horses each spring against EEE and WEE (western equine encephalitis). We routinely see deaths of unvaccinated horses. An unnecessary and expensive tragedy.
