I understand that there is a probable case of cutaneous anthrax in Jutland, Denmark, in a 69-year-old injection drug user (IDU), who is said to have purchased heroin in Germany 3 weeks ago.

I also understand that the 2 German strains of _Bacillus anthracis_ are most likely identical by genotyping.

These are unconfirmed reports.

[We would appreciate getting an independent confirmation from our Danish members in regard to Bob's communication. He is sound and in a position to be privy to such information, but confirmation is needed.

Thanks to Bob for this heads up. - Mod.MHJ
