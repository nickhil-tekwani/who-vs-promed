Walworth County health officials have identified and linked at least a
dozen cases of salmonella poisoning to the Walworth County Fair.
Sue Pruessing, public relations manager for the fair, said the county's
public health nurse and the Wisconsin Department of Heath notified fair
officials 19 Sep 2005 about the connection. 7 cases had been identified at
that time.
The minor outbreak was traced back to the swine barn, said Pat Grove,
health officer with the Walworth County Health and Human Services Department.
"I think the common denominator was they were all people who were in (the
swine barn), showing (swine) or had brothers, sisters or friends who were
in the swine barn," Pruessing said.
Since the discovery, samples of pig feces were analyzed as a possible
source of the bacteria. All tests returned negative, Pruessing said. The
barns had been cleaned before the testing, and samples were limited, Grove
said.
Grove said all 12 of the infected people, including an adult and 11
children between ages 4 and 17, have recovered. 1 victim was hospitalized
overnight and since has been released, Grove said.
The Wisconsin Division of Health was contacted because of the number of
confirmed cases, according to a news release from the Walworth County
Health and Human Services Department. The fairgrounds was studied because a
multicounty or multistate outbreak was possible, because of the wide
geographical range of people who attended the fair, the release states.
However, Grove doesn't expect any other cases to be directly linked to the
fair because the disease's incubation [period] has passed.
These were the first reports of salmonella poisoning linked to the fair
since it started 156 years ago, Pruessing said. "The fair has taken
significant precautions to avoid this," Pruessing added.
Anti-bacterial hand-washing stations are set up at many of the animal barn
entrances, and signs encourage fairgoers to wash after leaving animal
barns. No food is allowed inside animal barns.
"The fair really tried to get the word out there to practice good personal
hygiene," Pruessing said.

[The classic _Salmonella_ serovar of pigs is _choleraesuis_, but many
others are common and may be more common. These serovars include
_Typhimurium_ var. Copenhagen, Derby, Heidelberg and

strains. - Mod.LL]
