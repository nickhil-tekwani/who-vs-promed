[1] Russia: case surge
Date: Fri 18 Jun 2021

Russia is facing a sharp increase in the number of new COVID-19 infections, while at the same time hosting European Championship football matches in its 2nd city.

The mayor of Moscow has spoken of an "explosion" of cases, and authorities say the numbers are close to last year's [2020] peaks. Twenty million people live in Moscow region, and compulsory vaccinations have now been ordered for service sector staff such as catering and public transport.

St Petersburg, which is hosting 6 Euro 2020 games, is facing a steep rise too. Doctors across Russia have seen a 30% increase in cases in the past week, say officials, amid a significant spread in the Delta variant that originated in India.

This need not have happened. Russia was one of the 1st countries to announce the development of a COVID vaccine and mass vaccinations began last December [2020]. But uptake of vaccinations has been poor.

A variety of restrictions have been imposed across Russia's vast territory, including bans on mass gatherings, reduced capacity at entertainment venues, and greater enforcement of face coverings.

Moscow is now seeing infection numbers as high as December last year [2020], and hospital admissions in the capital are up 70% on last week. Some experts have warned the city could run out of COVID beds in 2 or 3 weeks.

The capital's chief COVID doctor, Denis Protsenko, admitted the situation was difficult but said the healthcare system was adapting to the rapidly changing conditions "in a flexible manner." Mayor Sergey Sobyanin stressed that the entire region was "at the crossing of many roads."

"Moscow is suffering the most frightening blows of the epidemic. That's why we need reliable defence against the disease, against thousands of new deaths among Muscovites," he wrote on the city's website.

Under the new defence plan for the service sector, it is now obligatory for state bodies and private businesses to ensure at least 60% of staff in public-facing roles are vaccinated within a month. That includes staff at cafes and restaurants, public transport, all entertainment venues, beauty salons, and gyms.

Russian health experts have been sounding the alarm for months, warning that the more infectious Delta variant would reach Russia eventually and spread rapidly. Russia has not had a national lockdown, and restrictions have always varied regionally.

The official Coronavirus HQ death toll stands at nearly 130 000. But Russia's Rosstat statistics agency said this month [June 2021] that 270 000 people had died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 by the end of April [2021].

Moscow has had some of Russia's toughest restrictions, including "non-working" weeks to keep public transport numbers down. But experts say that encouraged more mixing in public places.

Russia is one of the 11 host countries, and Sweden play Slovakia at the St Petersburg Arena on Friday [18 Jun 2021] afternoon. Some doctors have voiced concerns that fans from abroad and Russia's regions will be mixing in the city, spreading the Delta variant even faster.

There has been a small cut in the hours for food sales in fan zones. But authorities have to balance the need to revive the economy and tourism with halting a new COVID wave.

Russia has been vaccinating people since the end of last year [2020] with its aptly named Sputnik V. It has developed and registered 2 more vaccines since.

President Putin and other politicians and celebrities went public when they were vaccinated, and yet the numbers have been sluggish. Only 12.8% of Russians had received a single dose by 16 Jun 2021, and 9.9% were fully vaccinated, according to <statistika-vaccinacia.ru>, which collates regional figures.

Those numbers have begun to pick up, but are still far below levels in the US, UK, the rest of Europe, Israel, and elsewhere. One May [2021] opinion poll suggested 40% of Russians would refuse vaccination under any circumstances, and just over 20% said they would only do so if it meant they could not travel abroad.

Sociologist Denis Volkov of the Levada centre, which conducted 5 polls in the past year, believes many Russians appear to have adopted a wait-and-see strategy. He says they may be looking for more information about the safety and effectiveness of Russian vaccines, including from abroad.

"First, people said that they didn't want to get vaccinated because it's a new disease and the vaccine was developed too fast," he said. Then, half said they did not trust COVID numbers: "Some think the figures are underestimated, some that they are overestimated to sell more face masks and disposable gloves."

The authorities want the vaccination campaign to speed up. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov admits the rollout is going badly. But, asked whether Russia could see compulsory vaccinations for the entire population, he said, "This course of action was not considered at present."

Reports from across Russia speak of employees being threatened with suspension from their jobs until they get vaccinated. Hardline leader Ramzan Kadyrov has gone as far as to warn people in the southern republic of Chechnya that the authorities will be "forced to turn to harsh restrictive measures" unless uptake improves.

[Russia recorded 17 262 coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the highest daily number since 1 Feb 2021, the anti-coronavirus crisis center said on Friday [18 Jun 2021]. The total case count has reached 5 281 309 (https://tass.com/society/1304429).

As with the Copa Americana and the upcoming Olympics, large sports events or events of any kind where masses of people gather are high risk, especially when vaccination rates are low, or vaccines not highly effective. - Mod.LK]

[2] Reinfection; Secondary infection, GBS variant - Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) news
[2A] Reinfection

https://consumer.healthday.com/b-6-17-less-than-1-of-people-whove-had-severe-covid-get-re-infected-2653386067.html


People who have had severe COVID-19 and worry about going through another bout of it can relax: New research finds that less than 1% of people who've had a severe coronavirus infection get re-infected.

For the study, University of Missouri researchers analyzed data from more than 9100 COVID-19 patients at 62 health facilities in the United States. Only 0.7% of patients with severe COVID-19 infection contracted the virus a 2nd time, with a mean reinfection period of 116 days. Of those who were reinfected, 3.2% died.

Non-white patients had a higher risk of reinfection than white patients, according to the study published recently in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases [Qureshi AI, Baskett WI, Huang W. Re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing serial laboratory testing. Clin Infect Dis. 2021; ciab345; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab345].

"Our analysis also found asthma and nicotine dependence were associated with reinfection," said lead researcher Dr. Adnan Qureshi, a professor of clinical neurology at the University of Missouri's School of Medicine, in Columbia. "However, there was a significantly lower rate of pneumonia, heart failure, and acute kidney injury observed with reinfection compared with primary infection," Qureshi added in a university news release.

People were considered to be reinfected if they had 2 positive tests more than 90 days after the initial infection resolved, as confirmed by 2 or more consecutive negative tests.

"This is one of the largest studies of its kind in the USA, and the important message here is that COVID-19 reinfection after an initial case is possible, and the duration of immunity that an initial infection provides is not completely clear," Qureshi said.

[2C] Guillain-Barré syndrome
Date: Thu 17 Jun 2021
Source: Healio [edited]
https://www.healio.com/news/neurology/20210617/case-reports-describe-unusual-guillainbarre-variants-following-covid19-vaccination


Healio reports 2 Annals of Neurology studies "reported small clusters 'of an unusual variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome' following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to" an American Neurological Association press release. The 11 Guillain-Barré syndrome cases "occurred among individuals who received the vaccine 10-22 days prior to symptom onset," and "while the rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome in these clusters was approximately 4-10 times higher than the anticipated baseline frequency, the 'unusually severe' bilateral facial weakness and timing in relation to receipt of the vaccine 'made these occurrences stand out.'"

In the 1st report [Allen CM, Ramsamy S, Tarr AW, et al. Guillain-Barré syndrome variant occurring after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Ann Neurol. Epub 10 Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.26144], Dr. Allen, of the department of neurology at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of Nottingham School of Medicine, and colleagues reported 4 cases of a Guillain-Barré variant presenting as bifacial weakness with paresthesias. All cases occurred after the 1st dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and developed within 10 days of each other, with symptom onset 11-22 days after the vaccine. The cases included a white man aged 54 years with no relevant medical history; a British-Iranian man aged 20 years with a medical history of ulcerative colitis; a white man aged 57 years with a medical history of asthma and osteoarthritis, as well as bilateral knee replacements and regular use of steroid and salbutamol inhalers, loratadine, omeprazole, and tamsulosin; and a white man aged 55 years with a medical history of hypertension and regular use of amlodipine and lisinopril.

All patients presented with profound bifacial weakness and normal facial sensation. All patients also tested negative for COVID-19 infection. Patients received IV immunoglobulin, oral steroids, or no treatment.

Allen and colleagues noted that, while the patients described in their case report experienced neurological symptoms "temporally" associated with receipt of the vaccine, "causality cannot be assumed." The findings demonstrate the need for "robust post-vaccination surveillance," according to the researchers. Allen and colleagues also noted that "SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are very safe."

In the 2nd report [Maramattom BV, Krishnan P, Paul R, et al. Guillain-Barré syndrome following ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine. Ann Neurol. Epub 10 Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.26143], Dr. Maramattom, of the department of neurology at Aster Medcity in India, and colleagues reviewed 7 cases of severe Guillain-Barré syndrome that developed within 2 weeks of the 1st COVID-19 vaccine.

Researchers identified these cases during a 4-week period between mid-March and mid-April of 2021, by which point approximately 1.5 million individuals in 3 regions of Kerala, India, had been vaccinated against COVID-19. More than 80% of those individuals -- or 1.2 million people -- received the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine, according to Maramattom and colleagues.

The rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome observed in this report "was 1.4- to 10-fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude," according to the researchers. Moreover, the rate at which bilateral facial weakness occurred, which generally develops in less than 20% of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, indicated "a pattern associated with the vaccination," Maramattom and colleagues wrote.

More than half of the cases in India (n = 4) involved women aged between 40 and 70 years, most of whom (n = 3) required mechanical ventilation. All reported cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in India involved bilateral facial paresis, according to Maramattom and colleagues, which generally develops in less than 20% of unselected cases. Other cranial neuropathies, including abducens palsy and trigeminal sensory nerve involvement, developed in 4 patients (57%), which are uncommon among reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome in India, as it occurs in less than 5% of cases, the researchers noted.

Maramattom and colleagues emphasized that a link between COVID-19 infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome has not been determined, making an increase in the rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome following COVID-19 vaccination "unlikely." They also noted that the benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 "substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome," according to the case report. However, they stated that clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination, as most patients in their report required mechanical ventilatory support.

In a related editorial, the neuromuscular and statistical editors for Annals of Neurology detailed "an additional similar case" in a patient in the United States who received the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, according to the press release. The editors also examined cases of severe bilateral facial weakness with or without Guillain-Barré syndrome reported to the US-based Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. More than half of the cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome with bilateral facial weakness in the United States (n = 5 of 8 cases) occurred in people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, while only 3 such cases were observed in "the much larger number" of people who received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

These findings indicated that, like the cases of thrombocytopenic thrombosis reported with adenovirus-based vaccines, Guillain-Barré syndrome with bilateral facial weakness represents "a rare, but specific, complication," according to the press release from the ANA. The release also noted that it is important for clinicians to be aware of this complication "so that they can identify it and promptly treat it with standard therapy," such as IV Ig.

["Perspective [from source article, above]
Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute polyneuropathy that is often preceded by infection or, occasionally, vaccination. These reports both highlight a cluster of cases of a serious Guillain-Barré syndrome variant occurring within 2-3 weeks of the 1st dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Guillain-Barré syndrome and its variants have been previously described in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, an analysis of prior post-vaccination periods, such as the years after the swine flu and H1N1, have not revealed an increased incidence of post-vaccination Guillain-Barré syndrome. Therefore, although these clusters of patients developed Guillain-Barré syndrome temporally associated with vaccination, causality cannot be assumed. The benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk for this relatively rare outcome, and robust post-vaccination surveillance programs remain essential to definitively establish causality."

An icddr,b [International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh)] study found 68% of the coronavirus cases in Dhaka city are of the highly transmissible Delta variant.

Between [25 May and 7 Jun 2021], the scientists at icddr,b analysed the genome sequence of 60 samples taken from COVID-19 patients in the capital.

Of those, 41 or more had the Delta variant [B.1.617.2, first detected in India] of the coronavirus, icddr,b officials confirmed. They also found 22 cases of the Beta variant [B.1.351, first detected in South Africa], 2 cases of the [variant first detected in Nigeria], and 3 Alpha variants [N.1.1.7, first detected in the UK].

[The number of samples described above for whole-genome sequencing is confusing. Two or more variants could be detected in some of the 60 samples investigated. Or, the number of the samples investigated could have been 68. - Mod.PKB]

The B.1.617.2 strain, known as the Delta variant, is worrying health officials across the world, as it caused a major health crisis in India.

In an earlier study by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, 40 of the 50 samples examined turned out to be of the Delta variant.

Of the 40 cases, only 2 were in Dhaka and the rest in Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Bagerhat, Jhenidah, Pirojpur, Chapainawabganj, Gopalganj, and Khulna.

The latest findings indicate the Delta variant has started dominating transmissions in Dhaka city. Experts fear that this has the potential to turn Dhaka's situation as bad as that of Khulna and Rajshahi.

On [8 May 2021], health officials in Bangladesh detected the 1st case of the Delta variant.

In the 24 hours preceding 8:00 a.m. yesterday [17 Jun 2021], 63 people died with COVID-19, up from 60 the day before.

Of those who were reported dead yesterday [17 Jun 2021], 8 died at home, according to a press release from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

Of those who were reported dead with COVID-19-like symptoms yesterday [17 Jun 2021], at least 5 were in Jhenidah, 34 in Satkhira, 38 in Khulna, and 20 in Chapainawabganj districts.

Many hospitals in Khulna and Rajshahi divisions have been at capacity amid the rising number of COVID-19 patients.

Experts say the number of daily tests was too low to represent the true picture.

"Most of the infected people remain undetected. There must be many unreported deaths in places where the transmission is higher," infectious diseases specialist Prof Ridwanur Rahman told The Daily Star.

Of those reported dead yesterday [17 Jun 2021], the highest 20 were in Khulna division, followed by 13 in Rajshahi, 11 in Chattogram, 10 in Dhaka, 3 in Barishal, and 2 each in Rangpur, Mymensingh, and Sylhet.

At least 3840 people tested positive for COVID-19 while the positivity rate declined to 15.44% from 16.62 the previous day.

Officials in Gopalganj imposed restrictions on movements and outdoor activities in areas under the municipalities of Gopalganj and Moksudpur, and the unions of Latifpur and Kashiani to curb the spread of the virus.

Another 11 districts have enforced the restrictions before. But transmission in most of those areas continues to rise, according to DGHS data.

Even as India's 2nd COVID-19 wave has been steadily declining since mid-May [2021], more than 50 000 deaths from the virus have been reported in the 1st 16 days of June [2021], making this month's toll already the 2nd highest after May's [2021].

However, the story of COVID deaths in June [2021] is a little complicated. In the 17 days of the month so far (with Thursday's [17 Jun 2021] deaths added), the country's coronavirus toll has increased by 52 538. Of these, at least 19 329 (37% of total) are "backlog" deaths, fatalities from a previous period added to the toll in June [2021]. Many of these deaths had occurred during April-May [2021], or even earlier, and are being acknowledged only now.

In official records, there were over 119 000 fatalities in May [2021] (the highest COVID toll in any country for any month) and around 48 700 deaths in April [2021]. The backlog deaths are an acknowledgement, at least by some states, that the toll in these months was even higher than these numbers.

Maharashtra has declared by far the highest number of backlog deaths so far: at least 21 585 since [17 May 2021], of which 11 427 have been in June [2021]. Bihar has added 3951 old deaths, all declared on [9 Jun 2021]. Uttarakhand has announced close to 800 backdated deaths, most of these in May [2021], and Punjab has added 163 between [13 and 31 May 2021].

India recorded 62 331 fresh cases and 1182 deaths on Thursday [17 Jun 2021], in addition to 400 old fatalities announced by Maharashtra. The daily numbers do not include data from Jharkhand, which couldn't be accessed till past midnight. The day's toll was the lowest recorded in the country in over months since [14 Apr 2021].

Nepal's coronavirus caseload reached 614 216 on [Wed 16 Jun 2021] with 2014 more people testing positive for the infection in the past 24 hours.

The highest single-day total logged in Nepal was on [11 May 2021], where 9317 infections were logged.

Meanwhile, the total coronavirus recoveries stand at 543 521 with 3082 discharges recorded today [16 Jun 2021].

In the past 24 hours, 52 more COVID-related fatalities were logged, taking the total death toll to 8558.

As per the latest data provided by the health ministry, 13 022 total tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, of which 8687 were PCR tests while 4335 were antigen tests. With this, a total of 3 240 299 PCR tests have been carried out till date [16 Jun 2021].

Similarly, antigen tests have confirmed 814 positive cases in the past 24 hours. The total number of single-day infections from both the RT-PCR and antigen tests add up to 2828.

Nepal's COVID-19 recovery rate stands at 88.5% on [Wed 16 Jun 2021], while, on the other hand, the fatality rate stands at 1.6%.

The country's active COVID-19 case count has dropped to 62 117 with daily recoveries exceeding daily infections.

The number of active cases of COVID-19 in the country has declined by 65% in about 2 months, and positivity rate continues to hover around 3% for the last 2 weeks, according to data shared by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC).

The number of patients admitted to hospitals, which was around 7000 in [April 2021], was 2746 as of [17 Jun 2021]. Meanwhile, 1119 cases and 46 deaths were reported in a single day with positivity rate of 3.01%.

During the previous 2 waves of the pandemic, the country hit the figure of 50 000 active cases, and then the number of cases started decreasing.

During the 1st wave of the pandemic, number of active cases surpassed the figure of 50 000 in June 2020, but later it started decreasing and finally dropped to less than 6000 in September last year [2020].

The number of cases again started rising in October 2020, due to which the NCOC declared it 2nd wave of infections, and the number of active cases surpassed the figure of 50 000 in December [2020].

Then again the number of active cases started decreasing and reached around 16 000 in February 2021. Again, the number of cases started increasing, due to which 3rd wave of infections was declared, and number of cases surpassed the figure of 50 000 for the 3rd time on [31 Mar 2021]. The number continued increasing and surpassed the figure of 90 000 in April [2021].

In the last week of April [2021], the NCOC decided to seek the help of the Pakistan Army to ensure the implementation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to curb the spread of coronavirus.

The provinces and the administrative units sought help of armed forces for implementation of the SOPs. Because of the move, implementation of the SOPs was improved. Moreover, lockdown was announced from [8 May 2021] due to which number of cases declined.

According to the NCOC data, the number of active cases across the country was 36 215 as of 17 Jun 2021]. The number was around 65% less as compared to April this year [2021] when the number of active cases was over 90 000.

The data further showed that 282 ventilators were in use of COVID-19 patients across the country.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 18 Jun 2021 at 08:53 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 29 762 793 / 383 521 / 275
Pakistan: 946 227 / 21 913 / 97
Bangladesh: 841 087 / 13 345 / 80
Nepal: 615 984 / 8597 / 290
Sri Lanka: 233 064 / 2425 / 113
Afghanistan: 98 844 / 3943 / 99
Maldives: 71 365 / 201 / 366
Bhutan: 1882 / 1 / 1

Over the last 7 days, 487 970, 20 692, 7490, 14 297, and 11 128 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 700 473, 14 415, 10 149, 24 751, and 11 088 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the sharp decreasing trend in India, Pakistan, and Nepal; a stable trend in Afghanistan; but the continuation of the upward trend in Bangladesh. In Sri Lanka, a declining trend was also seen over the last 7 days when 16 930 cases were detected against 20 290 over the previous 7 days.

The daily case positivity in Bangladesh was above 15% over the last 2 days. Recent sequence data of the virus from samples collected from different parts of the country and recently from the capital city Dhaka revealed the predominance of the Delta variant (previously called B.1.617.2), a variant of concern. The high case positivity of the disease being seen over a period of 2 weeks or so in the country is probably due to community transmission of the variant, which is more transmissible than the Alpha variant. However, the simultaneous presence of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta variants (B.1.351) was also detected in the country, as indicated in item [1] above.
