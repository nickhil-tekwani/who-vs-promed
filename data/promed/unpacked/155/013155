The Rockford Public School District announced today [14 Mar 2018] that there is a confirmed case of varicella, more commonly known as chickenpox, at Rolling Green Elementary. A letter sent home to parents this week says students at the school may have been exposed to the person with chickenpox but that the person is no longer in school and is receiving treatment. The letter encourages parents to watch their children for chickenpox symptoms and to contact their doctor if they start to see any of the symptoms. The district also says parents can call the nurse at their child's school, the RPS 205 Health Services Office, or the Winnebago County Health Department if they have any questions regarding chickenpox.

More than 10 villages under Derabishi block in Kendrapara district are under the grip of suspected chickenpox cases, as the Community Health Centre (CHC) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in Derabishi areas are now packed with patients. A medical team from the district government hospital rushed to the villages to treat the patients.

Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily through coughs and sneezes of an infected person and is also highly contagious for those who are not immune to it, for which isolation of the patient is a primary step to check the spread. Chickenpox has an incubation period of 2-3 weeks. While there is no medication to speed up the healing process of chickenpox, the itching and sores can be soothed with over-the-counter calamine lotion, said Kendrapara chief district medical officer (CDMO) Baishnaba Charan Sahoo. Many villagers alleged that the authorities have failed to provide medical help to many villages; as a result, many persons are suffering from chickenpox.

"Chickenpox is spreading its tentacles in the villages as the authorities have failed to provide potable water to the people. A large number of tube-wells are not working, and the authorities are yet to repair all the tube-wells; as a result, people are compelled to drink polluted water," said Paresh Das, a social worker of Balia village. Many villagers of Balia, Chata, Panchupandab, Barimila, Nahanga, Mugabadi, Nikirei and Indupur are suffering from fever and joint pains, the symptoms of chickenpox.

Locals have alleged that they are not getting medicines freely from the hospitals, for which they are being compelled to purchase medicines from outside. Poor villagers have no money to purchase medicines from the shops, and as a result, they are left to suffer.

But the CDMO refuted the allegation of the villagers. "We have distributed medicines freely to the patients," Dr Sahoo said. Due to non-availability of doctors at many Community Health Centres, gullible villagers are compelled to depend on village quacks. Several quacks have been minting money by providing improper treatment to the affected villagers, said Rabindra Sahoo of Balia.

[Varicella-zoster virus, the causative agent of chickenpox, spreads easily from people with chickenpox to others who have never had the disease or who have not been vaccinated. The virus spreads mainly by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people that get into the air after they breathe or talk, for example.

The virus is not spread by polluted water, suggested in the report above, although drinking non-potable water may be the cause of other diseases such as cholera, amoebiasis, dysentery, diarrhea, Hepatitis A, and more.
