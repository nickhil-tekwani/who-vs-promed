Ukraine: Number of Hepatitis A Cases in Sukhodilsk Approaches 500
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Kiev: Almost 500 people have been hospitalized with symptoms of hepatitis A
after drinking contaminated water in an eastern Ukrainian town, officials
said on Sat 28 Jun 2003. The Health and Emergency Ministries said the
number of new cases doubled last week, with 340 adults and 139 children in
the town of Sukhodilsk being treated for the illness. So far, 375 people in
the town of 23 000 have been diagnosed with the disease, but the number is
expected to increase significantly because the incubation period is 30 days.
The outbreak began 9 Jun 2003 after high levels of stagnant subsoil waters
caused the town's water supply and sewage system to overflow. A regional
spokeswoman said the outbreak was connected with the closure of coal
mines,which began in 1997. The mines have filled up with water but
authorities don't have money to pump them out, she said. To stem the
disease's spread, authorities have begun replacing pipes, overhauling
sewage systems, pumping water out of dwellings, and distributing fresh
drinking water to residents, the Emergency Ministry said.

[The incubation period for hepatitis A ranges from 2 to 6 weeks which
suggests that contamination of the water supply may have occurred some time
ago. Hopefully the repairs to the system now in progress will bring the
outbreak to a rapid end. - Mod.CP]
