Alerted by the death of 500 -1000 chickens in a poultry farm located in Hayathnagar mandal in Ranagreddy district, the animal husbandry department suspected it might be a case of bird flu. A team of veterinary doctors were rushed to the farm on Thursday [7 May 2015] to conduct postmortem [investigations], and collect samples from the dead and live birds at the farm.

In April 2015, bird flu was detected in a poultry farm located in Thorrur village of the mandal. Lakhs [multiples of 100 000] of birds were culled to contain the infection.

Incidentally, the farm where fresh deaths of chickens were reported on Thursday is located beside Thorrur village.

The samples are slated to be sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, on Friday [8 May 2015]. Officials of the department said that the Union government instructed the samples could be tested only by the institute located in Bhopal, and not by any other institute.

Director of the department Dr D Venkateswarlu said that anything about the infection can be confirmed by NIHSAD.

When bird flu hit the state in April 2015, a 1-km radius of the infected farm was declared as infected zone, and 10-km around it as
surveillance zone. Poultry birds in the infected zone were culled, eggs, and feed served to the birds was destroyed, as part of measures to contain spread of infection.

The department was scheduled to collect samples over the coming few months from poultry farms located in the surveillance zone to check for infection.
