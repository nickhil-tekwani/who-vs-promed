[According to the report above, a total of 82 885 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 2 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (5 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases are in Shanghai and Guangdong (one case each) and both are imported cases. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. Taiwan reported one new case.

There were 6 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, all local cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 880, and 81 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. While there had been locally transmitted cases in both Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, there has been 1 new reported case in Guangdong on [6 May 2020] and no reports of cases in Heilongjiang since [30 Apr 2020]. In recent days the main concern are importations.

In Gyeonggi Province, 1 case was confirmed yesterday [6 May 2020]. Today, 1 contact of this case was also confirmed. Infectious disease prevention and control measures are taking place at the places visited by the confirmed cases. Contact investigation and testing are under way.

KCDC asked everyone to actively participate in the "distancing in daily life" campaign, intended to help people pursue their everyday life and infectious disease prevention at the same time, by carefully following the "5 basic infection prevention rules for everyone":

1. stay home for 3-4 days if you're sick;
2. keep a distance of 2 arms' length between you and other people;
3. wash your hands for 30 seconds. Cough/sneeze into your sleeve;
4. ventilate your space at least twice a day. Disinfect regularly;
5. keep in touch with family and friends even during physical distancing.


The elderly (65 y/o or older) and other high-risk groups should also:
1. remember to take medications for existing chronic illnesses;
2. stay home;
3. call public health center and visit screening clinic when sick;
4. stay away from any enclosed/crowded space that makes it difficult to keep 2 meters of distance from other people;
5. stay in touch with loved ones on a regular basis.

- For the upcoming Parents' Day (8 May 2020), KCDC advised people to refrain from visiting older parents in nursing homes or convalescent hospitals since they can be highly vulnerable to infection.

For effective infectious disease prevention at community level, each community (such as school, church, care home) should ensure the following:
1. all members should work on infection prevention/control together as a community;
2. designate an infectious disease prevention/control manager within the community;
3. create and follow community guidelines for infectious disease prevention and control;
4. the infectious disease prevention/control manager should be proactive in carrying out the role;
5. community members should actively cooperate with the infectious disease prevention/control manager.

KCDC again stressed that the transition to "distancing in daily life" does not indicate easing of infectious disease control/prevention measures nor an end of social distancing.

Noting the possibility that a return to Enhanced Social Distancing may be required if situation becomes worse in the future, KCDC urged everyone to work together to keep COVID-19 away by practicing distancing measures in their everyday life.

In light of the recent long holiday weekend during which a lot of traveling and social gathering took place, KCDC reminded the public to stay home and not go to work if having fever or respiratory symptoms and to call the KCDC call center (1339 or area code + 120) or contact a local public health center if having prolonging fever over 38 deg C [100.4 deg F] or aggravating respiratory symptoms.

KCDC urged people to visit a screening center to get tested especially if 2 or more persons within a household unit or travel group unit develop COVID-19 suspected symptoms.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 4 cases and 1 death compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (5 to 6 May 2020) when there were 2 newly confirmed cases and 1 death. A total of 10 810 confirmed cases and 256 deaths were reported today (6 May 2020), up from 10 806 cases and 255 deaths yesterday (5 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 35 consecutive days and below 50 for 28 consecutive days. Gyeonggi region reported the only local case while the remaining three newly confirmed cases were imported cases, one each in Daejeon, Chungbuk, and quarantine facility. While it is too soon to conclude that transmission has been interrupted, the move to social distancing helped impact local transmission. As they move to the next phase "distancing in daily life", all eyes will be on the country to see if they can maintain the level of control they have had.

New coronavirus infections in Iran have risen sharply since the country relaxed its restrictions on movement.

Tehran on [Wed 6 May 2020] reported 1680 new infections; nearly double the figure 4 days ago and the highest daily figure since [11 Apr 2020] when it allowed a phased return to work amid fears of economic collapse. A ban on travel between cities and business at shopping malls has since also been lifted.

"We are witnessing a rising trend in the past 3 or 4 days," said a health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, blaming "our behaviour, especially in the past 2 weeks. A part of society has apparently had a change of attitude."

Iran has reported more than 100 000 COVID-19 cases and nearly 6500 deaths.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 263 092, including 74 799 deaths, an increase from 1 237 633 cases and 72 271 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 333 491 (26.4%) cumulative case reports and 3352 (13.2%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in California (1879 -- 7.4% of total), New Jersey (1354 -- 5.3%), Illinois (2270 -- 8.9%), Texas (1211 -- 4.7%), Massachusetts (1754 -- 6.8%), Pennsylvania (991 -- 3.8%), Texas (1092 -- 4.3%), and Maryland (1046 -- 4.1%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Connecticut.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Russia, New Jersey, Turkey, and Brazil as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Pennsylvania, 18 Peru, 19 Belgium, and 20 India. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City would be between the UK and France (it would be number 5).

The US military has confirmed 7604 cumulative cases, with 78 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 10 154 cumulative cases and 383 new cases today (6 May 2020). There have been 2465 cases reported from federal prisons (40 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2559 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (85 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1968 cases (44 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available on the daily update website. That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 684 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24 hour period from 3 to 4 May 2020, bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 220 325 [253 682] as compared with 219 329 [250 561] confirmed cases on 5 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 44.24, a continual slow decrease over the past 27 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 44.24 today (6 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 220 325 [253 682] cases, approximately 120 466 (54.6%) [47.5%] -- an additional 857 cases have been hospitalized and 11 082 (5.0%) [4.4%] an additional 51 cases were admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to the ICU.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7309725,43. Catalonia, Castile and Leon, and La Rioja are still the most affected communities by population-based rates, even though their rates are dropping. Castile and Leon and neighboring La Rioja are located in the northern part of the country and Catalonia in the north east. - Mod.UBA]

[7] Pakistan: prisons
Date: Thu 7 May 2020

After the 1st case of COVID-19 was reported in Camp Jail, Lahore on [20 Mar 2020], official numbers confirmed on [21 Apr 2020] that at least 97 prisoners nationwide had contracted the virus; 59 of them were in Lahore, 9 in Dera Gazi Khan, 7 in Gujranwala, 3 in Jhelum, 2 in Bhakkar, and one each in Hafizabad, Kasur and Faisalabad. However, this number was dropped to 86 infected prisoners, without any explanation on [26 Apr 2020].

There has been no reporting of the number of COVID-19 cases in prisons since then, nor have authorities disclosed any fatalities that may have resulted or the number of prisoners who have recovered. Given the extremely contagious nature of the disease and massive overcrowding, it is highly likely that more prisoners have contracted the virus than official figures suggest.

"As tempting as it is to believe that the virus has been contained so effectively in prisons across Pakistan, unfortunately, we believe the reality shows a different picture. Given the likelihood that there is a significant number of undiagnosed and unreported cases, it is cause for serious concern if authorities have halted testing or are failing to disclose the number of cases in prisons," said Rimmel Mohydin, South Asia campaigner at Amnesty International.

Protective measures in prison must be implemented
In March [2020], the provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab announced measures such as early release and testing in prisons. The Islamabad High Court also issued directives to immediately release vulnerable and pre-trial or remand detainees. However, on [30 Mar 2020], the Supreme Court of Pakistan suspended all orders granting bail, stating that a suo motu (a decision made by a judge at their own discretion, without the prompting of another party) could only be issued by the highest court in the country, and not the Islamabad High Court.

Given that the Supreme Court has blocked attempts to reduce the prison population, it is the government's duty of care towards inmates that all reasonable protective measures are taken. The conditions in Pakistan's prisons -- which are overcrowded, unsanitary and under resourced -- serve to increase the chances of a COVID-19 outbreak, making access to testing even more urgent.

However, no information about the number of tests in Pakistani prisons has been made public, save for the 512 tests that were conducted in Camp Jail, Lahore. "While testing has been a challenge for many countries, it is critical to ensure that healthcare is just as available to prisoners as it would be to the community at large - including in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19. If prison populations cannot be reduced, then authorities must ensure that the necessary measures are in place to protect them," said Rimmel Mohydin.

Background
Pakistani authorities must ensure that all people affected by the coronavirus have access to adequate health care, including those detained in prisons.

The right to health is guaranteed under several human rights treaties. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) includes the "prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases" as a part of the right to health. In the context of a spreading epidemic, this includes the obligation on states to ensure that preventive care, goods, services and information are available and accessible to all persons.

Under the right to health, health care goods, facilities and services should be available in sufficient quantity within the state; accessible to everyone without discrimination; respectful of medical ethics and culturally appropriate; and scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality. To be considered "accessible", these goods and services must be accessible to all, especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population; within safe physical reach for all sections of the population; and affordable for all. The right also includes the accessibility of health-related information.
