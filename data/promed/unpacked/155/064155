During the summer of 2006, wound infections in
bathers caused by _Vibrio_ species were reported
from several European countries. In Germany, 3
people were reported to have developed _Vibrio
vulnificus_ infections (1), and 3 people from
southeast Sweden were infected with
non-agglutinating and non-toxin-producing _V.
cholerae_ (2). The 3 patients from Germany and 2
patients from Sweden had underlying (chronic)
illnesses. All these infections were associated
with contact with water in the Baltic Sea. In
Denmark, the clinical microbiology departments
have diagnosed 15 human infections with seawater
bacteria of the genus Vibrio in 2006, mainly skin
and ear infections with _V. alginolyticus_ and
_V. parahaemolyticus_ (3).
On 24 Jul 2006, 3 people in the Netherlands were
reported to have developed infections due to
_Vibrio alginolyticus_ after swimming in the
Oosterschelde, a large inlet on the North Sea, at
separate but nearby locations. Patient A was a
73-year-old woman who had fallen on her knee,
resulting in an injury; _V. alginolyticus_ was
isolated from the synovial fluid of the knee
joint. Patient B was an 18-year-old woman who had
a wound on one of her hands from which the
bacterium was cultured. Patient C was an
11-year-old boy who developed otitis after
swimming. _V. alginolyticus_ was isolated from
one of his ears. The patients were treated with
amoxicillin-clavulanate and rapidly recovered
after antibiotic treatment. No new cases have
since been reported.
Water samples were taken from the Oosterschelde
on 28 Aug, 4 Sep and on 4, 11 and 18 Oct 2006.
Both _V. alginolyticus_ and _V. parahaemolyticus_
were frequently detected in 0.1-1.0 mL volumes of
these samples.
_V. alginolyticus_ is a halophilic Gram-negative
bacterium that is part of normal marine flora.
The bacterium is able to multiply in salty waters
at elevated water temperatures (4). _V.
alginolyticus_ is one of 12 recognized marine
_Vibrio_ species that have been identified as
being pathogenic for humans (5). It has been
associated with wound infections (6), ear
infections (7), but also with gastroenteritis (8)
and bacteremia in immunocompromised patients
after consumption of raw shellfish (9). _V.
parahaemolyticus_ infections have been associated
with gstroenteritis after consumption of
contaminated seafood (5), and the _V.
parahaemolyticus_ bacterium can also infect open
wounds exposed to warm seawater (10).
High temperatures were recorded throughout Europe
in summer 2006, and the increase in water
temperature was favorable for the growth of
_Vibrio_ species. Climate changes, leading to a
northerly shift of warm summer weather and
elevated water temperatures in the moderate
climate regions of northwestern Europe in future
years are expected to increase exposure of
bathers to indigenous waterborne pathogens for
which growth opportunities increase (11), such as
pathogenic marine _Vibrio_ species.

[Heat waves in the USA and the EU caused clusters
of cases of _Vibrio_ infections either
transmitted from direct contact with the salt or
brackish water or from shellfish.
The Oosterschelde (Eastern Scheldt) is an estuary
in Zeeland, the Netherlands, between
Schouwen-Duiveland and Tholen on the north and
Noord-Beveland and Zuid-Beveland on the south.
