H5N1 HPAI spread in Nigeria and increased risk for neighbouring countries in West Africa
------------------------
Summary
On 16 Jan 2015, Nigeria confirmed the presence of H5N1 HPAI to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). This was the 1st occurrence of H5N1 HPAI in the country since the last epidemic between 2006 and 2008. The virus involved is similar to recent isolates taken from birds in Bulgaria, India and Viet Nam as well as an environmental sample from China.

The disease has so far spread to nearly 400 enterprises including live bird markets (LBMs) and farms in 9 per cent (71 out of 775) of local government areas (LGAs) in 49 per cent (18 out of 37) of states across Nigeria.

While the Nigerian Government has responded by implementing quarantine, culling and compensation, outbreaks continue to be reported. Agro-ecological drivers of HPAI H5N1 similar to those present in endemic regions of South East Asia are present in Nigeria and West Africa, thus implying an increased risk of disease spread in the region. Traditional trading patterns, both formal and informal, between Nigeria and neighbouring countries provide an opportunity for cross-border or inter-regional disease spread. The recent incursion into Burkina Faso only emphasizes this potential risk.

Currently, countries at immediate risk of spread are Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, the Niger and Togo. Other countries that had reported outbreaks in the past are also at risk. These include the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti and the Sudan. These countries need to prepare to detect and respond in a timely manner to possible incursions of the disease.

[The following, final section of the above review is copied for readers' convenience:

"Conclusions (and looking ahead)
--------------------------------
"The reoccurrence of H5N1 HPAI in Nigeria confirms the constant risk posed by this virus. The poultry in Nigeria and in bordering countries are highly susceptible to HPAI H5N1. All countries are officially free of this disease. It is expected that HPAI H5N1 will spread widely within Nigeria and may affect a high proportion of poultry until effective biosecurity measures are imposed. Continued circulation (that is, persistence) within the Nigerian poultry population is possible, but given previous experience with the disease during 2006-2008, this may be unlikely. The veterinary services of Nigeria have shown their ability to eliminate HPAI H5N1 during the 1st outbreaks of the disease in 2006-2008, and this could be replicated if resources are available to implement control measures.

"Affected areas located in conflict zones such as Kaduna State, where the actions of veterinary services are limited, may result in continued spread. Currently, the outbreak continues to spread, and patterns are distinct from that of the previous epidemic. The current epidemic has spread faster and wider geographically than the previous epidemic (data not shown). Based on this evidence, the risk of the virus spreading throughout Nigeria is high.

"The risk of spread to bordering countries will depend on quarantine controls at land borders with Nigeria that target the various routes through which infection could spread, including the movement of live birds, people or fomites. Establishment in bordering countries will also depend on the ability of the countries' surveillance systems to detect and respond to new incursions rapidly, if they do occur.

"During the previous HPAI H5N1 incursion, almost all countries affected in the region were able to eliminate the disease with international support coordinated by FAO. However, regular training of veterinary services staff in the region in disease recognition, investigation and response is needed.

"The outbreaks in Nigeria are currently concentrated in areas bordering Niger in the north and Benin in the south west. Movement of poultry from northern areas of Nigeria to be sold in the southern areas of Niger has been known to occur. Movement of people from south western Nigeria to Togo through transhumance [seasonal migration of livestock. - Mod.SH] is also likely. Given their proximity to Nigeria (through sharing of the border) and commercial trading links, the following countries are at immediate risk of disease spread: Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. These countries have important poultry industries, and the potential consequences of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks there would be significant. Other countries that had reported outbreaks in the past are also at risk. These include Burkina Faso, Djibouti, the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and Sudan.

"FAO stands ready to provide assistance to member countries in West Africa to prevent the introduction of H5N1 HPAI to reduce the risk of disease spread and to safeguard vulnerable, livestock-related livelihoods. FAO assistance should be focused on improving capacities of animal health systems for
i) rapid detection and disease early warning;
ii) laboratory capacity building;
iii) risk management;
iv) surveillance; and
v) prevention and control.

"Countries at risk in West Africa are recommended to:
- review and assess their level of preparedness for possible incursions of HPAI, including their country's contingency plan for H5N1 HPAI and levels of surveillance;
- conduct proper field disease investigation procedures and the measures required to manage the risks for poultry and human populations, including biosecurity;
- review and assess the diagnostic capabilities relative to the specific requirements for laboratory analysis of H5N1 HPAI, including laboratory procedures, appropriate equipment and supplies;
- review and assess communication and awareness strategies;
- review coordination mechanisms between in-country, regional stakeholders, including compensation strategies;
- evaluate technical capacity development needs, utilizing current knowledge and previous assessments;
- consider the means of identifying and addressing resource needs for enhanced avian influenza prevention and control programmes.

"At-risk countries would benefit from knowledge and information sharing by relevant countries in the region. FAO provides and assists countries with technical capacity to respond to emergencies. It also has a role in facilitating information exchange and collaboration between Nigeria and other countries at risk in West Africa."
