[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases and other
forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of 4 Jul 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following figures show the number of suspect cases of CJ referred
to the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number of deaths of
definite and probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated
in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease
thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).

Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 4 Jul 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 115
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 49
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 164

Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 3

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 167

These data indicate that the number of definite or probable cases of
vCJD has increased by one since the end of May 2008, whereas the
number of patients alive remains unchanged.

These data are still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak
in the UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995 and the
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in
2007, and only one so far in 2008.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 4 Jul 2008 in the UK, so far there have been 66 referrals, 38
deaths from sporadic CJD, 4 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 2 from GSS,
one from familial CJD, and one from vCJD.

This document lists the numbers of confirmed and probable cases of
all forms of CJD recorded in France from 1992 to 2008. The original
text should be consulted for a full breakdown of the figures. During
that period there were 23 cases of vCJD, all now deceased. They
occurred between 1996 and 2007: one case in 1996, one in 2000, one in
2001, 3 in 2002, none in 2003, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 3 in
2007, and none so far in 2008. There were 12 male and 11 female patients.

Their ages at time of death ranged from 19 to 58 years (mean 39); 6
of the patients resided in the Ile-de-France [Paris] and 17 in the
provinces. All the cases were met-met homozygotes for codon 129 of
the prion protein gene. No special risk factors were evident, which
distinguished these patients from those with other forms of CJD
(sporadic, genetic, iatrogenic). However one patient had visited the
UK at regular intervals.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 30 Jun 2008 in France, so far in 2008 there have been 722
referrals, 26 deaths from sporadic CJD, one death from iatrogenic
CJD, 3 from familial CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

[In summary the are differences between the numbers of referrals (772
in France compared with 66 in the UK) and the numbers of all types of
CJD diagnosed (30 in France compared with 46 in the UK), which are
not explained by the numbers of vCJD cases detected. - Mod.CP]

Preamble to [3] and [4]
-----------------------
[In prion diseases an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc))
is generated by post-translational modification of the cellular prion
protein (PrP(C)). PrP(Sc) is relatively resistant to proteinase K
(PK) digestion. This property is used as the physicochemical basis
for distinguishing between PrP(C) and PrP(Sc).

PrP(C) is a glycoprotein that contains 2 Asn-linked glycosylation
sites; it is present in the cells in 3 different glycoforms,
including an unglycosylated form. Hence, for different prion strains,
PrP(Sc) exhibits different glycoform patterns with different ratios
of the 3 forms by Western blot analysis. Recently, phenotypes of
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) have emerged that
exhibit PrP(Sc) with different glycoform patterns and/or mild PK
resistance in comparison with previously described typical cases.

Regarding sheep scrapie, atypical scrapie cases that are represented
by Nor98 have been reported among sheep previously presumed to be
genetically scrapie-resistant. Moreover, atypical bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) cases have been reported. These are classified
into 2 phenotypes (H-type and L-type) based on the molecular weight
of unglycosylated band of PK-digested PrP(Sc). Atypical (Nor98)
scrapie cases in sheep were diagnosed for the 1st time in Norway in
1998. They are now identified in small ruminants in most European
countries and represent an increasingly large proportion of the
scrapie cases diagnosed in Europe.

Atypical scrapie isolates (Nor98) have been shown to be
experimentally transmissible into transgenic mice and sheep but the
properties of the agent involved, like its biological and biochemical
features, are clearly distinct from the agent involved in classical
scrapie. The exact origin of this sporadic TSE strain is still
speculative, but a spontaneous, non-contagious origin, like sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, cannot be excluded. Further
transmission and epidemiological studies are needed to better address
this hypothesis.

The Abstracts of the 2 papers reproduced below review current
knowledge of the epidemiology of atypical forms of sheep scrapie and
bovine BSE. - Mod.CP]

Abstract
--------
Background
----------
The development of active surveillance programmes for transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies of small ruminants across Europe has led
to the recent identification of a previously undetected form of ovine
prion disease, 'atypical' scrapie. Knowledge of the epidemiology of
this disease is still limited, as is whether it represents a risk for
animal and/or public health. The detection of atypical scrapie has
been related to the use of only some of the EU agreed rapid tests.
Information about the rapid tests used is not, as yet, available from
public reports on the surveillance of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies in small ruminants. We collected detailed results of
active surveillance from European countries to estimate and to
compare the prevalence of atypical scrapie and classical scrapie in
sheep for each country stratified by each surveillance stream;
healthy slaughtered and found dead adult sheep.

Results
-------
From the 20 participating countries, it appeared that atypical
scrapie was detected in Europe wherever the conditions necessary for
its diagnosis were present. In most countries, atypical scrapie and
classical scrapie occurred at low prevalence level. The classical
scrapie prevalence estimates were more variable than those for
atypical scrapie, which appeared remarkably homogeneous across
countries, surveillance streams, and calendar years of surveillance.
Differences were observed in the age and genotype of atypical scrapie
and classical scrapie cases that are consistent with previous
published findings.

Conclusions
-----------
This work suggests that atypical scrapie is not rare compared to
classical scrapie. The homogeneity of its prevalence, whatever the
country, stream of surveillance, or year of detection, contrasts with
the epidemiological pattern of classical scrapie. This suggests that
the aetiology of atypical scrapie differs from that of classical scrapie.

Abstract
--------
The paper describes how the comprehensive surveillance of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and studies carried out on these data
has enhanced our knowledge of the epidemiology of BSE.

Around 7000 BSE cases were detected through the screening of about 50
million cattle with rapid tests in Europe. It confirmed that the
clinical surveillance had a poor capacity to detect cases, and also
showed the discrepancy of this passive surveillance efficiency
between regions and production types (dairy/beef). Other risk factors
for BSE were being in a dairy herd (3 times more than beef), having a
young age at 1st calving (for dairy cattle), being autumn-born (dairy
and beef), and being in a herd with a very high milk yield. These
findings focus the risk on the feeding regimen of calves/heifers.

Several epidemiological studies across countries suggest that the
feed borne source related to meat and bone meal (MBM) is the only
substantiated route of infection -- even after the feed ban --, while
it is not possible to exclude maternal transmission or milk replacers
as a source of some infections. In most European countries, the
average age of the cases is increasing over time and the prevalence
decreasing, which reflects the effectiveness of control measures.
Consistent results on the trend of the epidemic were obtained using
back calculation modelling, the R0 approach, and Age-Period-Cohort models.

Furthermore, active surveillance also resulted in the finding of
atypical cases. These are distinct from previously found BSE and
classified in 2 different forms based on biochemical characteristics;
their prevalence is very low (36 cases up to 1 Sep 2007), affected
animals were old and some of them displayed clinical signs. The
origin and possibility of natural transmission is unknown.

[Terry S Singeltary Sr has commented that cases of atypical BSE have
only been found in countries having implemented large active
surveillance programs. It is noteworthy that atypical cases have been
found in countries that did not experience classical BSE so far, like
Sweden, or in which only few cases of classical BSE have been found,
like Canada or the USA. And last but not least, similarities of
PrPres between H-type BSE and human prion diseases like CJD or GSS
have been put forward, as well as between L-type BSE and CJD. These
findings raise questions about the origin and inter species
transmission of these prion diseases that were discovered through the
BSE active surveillance. - Mod.CP]
