Cows on Bloomer farm died of disease
------------------------------------
There was no evidence of animal abuse or neglect on a town of Bloomer
farm where 18 head of cattle were found dead this week, according to
the Chippewa County Sheriff's Department.

The cattle found on a farm, died of disease, said Chippewa County
Sheriff's Department Chief Deputy Jim Clark, relying on information
obtained through an investigator assigned to the case.

Sheriff's deputies 1st went to the farm on Tuesday [25 Mar 2008] in
response to an anonymous report of dead animals.

A deputy found about a dozen dead cattle under a tarp at the farm,
with a few more at various locations around the barn. [The farmer]
told the deputy he couldn't move them all to the same place because
his skid steer broke down.

He said he had a strain of pneumonia move through his small herd,
though 2 animals died because of problems delivering a calf.

Clark said no charges are anticipated in the case. A rendering
company was scheduled to pick up the carcasses on Friday [28 Mar 2008].

[This article does not tell us if any diagnostics were performed or
any necropsy was conducted. It does not tell us if a veterinarian
examined the animals prior to death, or if the producer is only
making a guess as to why the animals died. This is a large number of
animals to die from pneumonia unless there are mitigating
circumstances, such as harsh weather, poor feed or no feed, or
pneumonia induced by shipping the animals.

The article does not tell us if any of the remaining animals were ill.

Without evidence of a necropsy or diagnostics or a veterinarian's
visit, I am concerned as what diseases may be affecting his animals.
Furthermore, it could be a toxin. This many animals dead at one time
on a premises is suggestive that regulatory authorities such as the
office of the state veterinarian should be involved.

Since it is possible this is a disease moving through the area, if
there is more authoritative information available on this case,
ProMED-mail would be grateful if you would share it with us. - Mod.TG]
