Origin and genotypes measles viruses strains imported in the USA
----------------------------------------------------------------
Of the 288 measles cases, 280 (97 percent) were associated with importations from at least 18 countries. The source of measles acquisition could not be identified for 8 (3 percent) cases. 45 direct importations (40 US residents returning from abroad and 5 foreign visitors) have been reported. Almost half (22 [49 percent]) of these importations were travelers returning from the Philippines, where a large outbreak has been occurring since October 2013. Imported cases were also associated with travel from other countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (7 cases), as well as countries in the WHO South-East Asia (8), European (4), Americas (3), and Eastern Mediterranean (1) regions. Measles genotype information was obtained from 103 (36 percent) of the 288 measles cases. Four measles virus genotypes were identified: B3 (67 cases), D9 (23), D8 (12), and H1, as follows:

Country of origin / Measles virus genotype

Pakistan / B3
Dublin, Germany, England / B3
France, Belgium / D8
Republic of Georgia / B3
Brazil / B3
Chile / D8
India / D8
China / H1
Micronesia / B3
Philippies / B3, D9
Saipan (Marianna Islands) / B3
Singapore / D8
Viet Nam / D8

Viruses also originated from Indonesia, the Netherlands, South Korea and Thailand, but the genotypes were not determined.

Genotype was determined based on methodology described in the WHO measles virus nomenclature 2012 update: Wkly Epidemiol Rec 2012;87:73-80. Genotypes listed are those identified in a sample from the imported case or from a case that is epidemiologically linked to that importation.

Middlesex Hospital [Connecticut] said it became aware of a suspected case of measles in a patient in the emergency room on Sunday [22 Jun 2014]. The state's Department of Public Health was notified and is taking the necessary steps to address this situation, hospital officials said.

Staff, patients and guests were all alerted about the possible measles case, and continue to be informed, as the measles infection is highly contagious and can be caught by simply being in the presence of someone with measles. Anyone who contracted measles would see the 1st signs within 1 or 2 weeks. Symptoms include fever, spots which could sometimes be in the mouth, and a rash.

In the last week, 37 new measles cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), according to the weekly report released [23 Jun 2014]. The national total is 514 cases, which is higher than any yearly total since 1995. The measles outbreak in the Amish community in Ohio accounts for 68 percent of the reported illnesses. In 1995, the United States recorded 906 cases of measles for the entire year. The current total for 2014 has exceeded the 1996 total of 508 and is continuing to grow.

The Ohio Department of Health releases a daily update on the number of measles cases in that state. As of [23 Jun 2014], the state reports 348 illnesses in 9 counties. The 1st patient in this outbreak reported symptoms on [24 Mar 2014], while the latest patient had an onset of symptoms on [20 Jun 2014]. The youngest patient to date was under 6 months of age. The oldest patient is reported to have been age 53.

Despite the large number of illnesses due to the measles virus, it is noteworthy that no one born prior to 1961 has been infected. The measles vaccination program was begun nationally in 1963, according to the CDC. Prior to that, virtually everyone experienced the illness during childhood and became immune to further infections. The demographics of the Ohio outbreak appear to confirm a measles immunity exists for those in late middle age and the elderly, even in the Amish community.

So far in 2014, the CDC has reported 514 cases in 20 states, with 16 outbreaks representing 87 percent of the reported cases this year. During most years since 2000, fewer than 100 measles cases have been reported in the US.

Earlier this month [June 2014], 3 cases were confirmed in Johnson County [Kansas]. The Kansas City metro area has 27 confirmed cases, according to the communications director for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. "We hope we don't see a widespread outbreak in the state," said Charlie Hunt, state epidemiologist for KDHE. "That would be an unfortunate circumstance. Measles can cause complications like ear infections and pneumonia. For every 1000 children with the disease in the US, 1 or 2 will die, according to the CDC. Those most at risk for complications are children under 5, adults over 20, those with compromised immune systems and pregnant women, according to the CDC.

Local public health officials are investigating 8 confirmed cases of measles among members of the same extended family in south King County, and a single suspected case in Pierce County [Washington state]. These cases are linked to another case who returned to the United States from the Pacific Islands on [26 May 2014] with measles. Given the unfolding investigation and uncertainty about places where the people with measles may have visited, anyone residing in south King County or Pierce County should:
- be aware that measles cases are occurring in the community,
- be up to date on measles vaccine,
- and follow the recommendations below if they develop symptoms of measles

Known public exposures occurred at several MultiCare healthcare facilities where the infected individuals were treated, including a hospital in Tacoma [Pierce County, Washington]. Details about these exposures will be updated regularly at the MultiCare website. These medical facilities are directly contacting persons who were present -- clients, visitors, and staff -- during the times of potential exposure.

Anyone who lives or works in south King County should be alert for an illness with fever or illness with an unexplained rash, for at least the next 3 weeks. A combination of these signs or symptoms is a strong indicator of measles: fever, rash, cough, and red, watery eyes. Members of the south King County household were unvaccinated because they were too young to receive the vaccine or simply missed their vaccinations. Public Health-Seattle & King County is working closely with a community from Micronesia connected to the outbreak, and is conducting extensive outreach to ensure as many people as possible in this community are vaccinated.

A measles outbreak in a North Korean province bordering China has left at least 3 children dead this week in what is believed to be the worst attack of the highly contagious disease in 7 years. The deaths occurred on Monday [23 Jun 2014] after the disease, which mainly affects children, hit a district near Sinuiju, the capital of North Pyongan province in the northwest of North Korea and a gateway to China, a source told RFA's Korean Service. North Korean authorities have tried to hush up the outbreak and have blamed it on North Korean shipping crews traveling to and from China.

North Pyongan province is bounded by water on the west by the Korea Bay and the Yellow Sea, called the West Sea by Koreans. But the source said Pyongyang has imposed travel restrictions to contain the problem and the Ministry of Health has begun immunizing residents in Yongchun district and Sinuiju.

"Recently measles broke out in Yongchun district near Sinuiju and spread rapidly," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity from Sinuiju, which borders China's Dandong city. According to the source, the measles outbreak was not reported by the North Korean media, and it is believed the North Korean Ministry of Health is keeping a tight lid on the issue to avoid being reprimanded "for failing to undertake anti-epidemic measures."

It is believed to be the worst outbreak in North Korea since 2007, when at least 4 people died. At that time, a massive vaccination campaign was initiated by the World Health Organisation in response to a significant measles outbreak in which 3500 cases were reported in 30 counties in all of North Korea's provinces, with densely populated areas particularly affected. To prevent measles from spreading, the North Korean government prohibited people living in south of Yongchun district from visiting Sinuiju and also prohibited residents living in Sinuiju from visiting Yongchun district," according to reports.

Some 43 inmates at the Cebu Provincial and Rehabilitation Canter (CPDRC) are displaying measles-like symptoms, prompting the Regional Epidemiological Surveillance Unit (Resu 7) to monitor their condition. The Director of Resu 7 said there were initially 22 cases last week [week ending 22 Jun 2014]. He considered the sudden jump to be of epidemic proportion. He said they've confined those whom they suspect of having measles in separate cells to keep them away from healthy inmates.

The Director said 11 inmates who initially gave blood samples all tested positive for measles. He said those with fever were given supportive treatment: medicine for fever and vitamin A, as measles depletes the patient's vitamin supply, causing poor eyesight. If left untreated, he said, the disease might damage the eyesight permanently. Measles, he said, may also lead to pneumonia. The Director blamed jail visitors for infecting the inmates, adding that congestion and poor ventilation had helped spread the virus. The CPDRC is home to 1971 inmates.

[The WHO recommends that all children (and socially deprived adults) in developing countries diagnosed with measles should receive 2 doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This treatment restores low vitamin A levels during measles that occur even in well-nourished individuals and can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements have been shown to reduce the number of deaths in children from measles virus infection by 50 percent.

Cebu is an island province in the Philippines, consisting of the island itself and 167 surrounding islands. Its capital is Cebu City, the oldest city in the Philippines, which forms part of the Cebu Metropolitan Area together with 4 neighbouring cities (see map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu). - Mod.CP]

On the eve of the World Ice Hockey Championship, which was held in Minsk from 9-25 May 2014, Belarusian epidemiologists warned of the possibility of importation into the country of measles and other infectious diseases and recommended the implementation of preventative vaccination, according to BelaPAN. Imported measles case[s] from Russia had been recorded in Minsk in April this year [2014]. On that occasion, measles was transmitted from these cases to 7 local people.

According to the local medical authorities, measles cases are regularly imported into Belarus on an annual basis. Thus in 2013, one resident of Minsk contracted measles in Ukraine and another in Russia. Last year [2013] in Minsk one unvaccinated child, less than 12 months in age, was identified and vaccinated. Measles vaccination is carried out in Belarus at 12 months with re-vaccination at 6 years. According to the World Health Organisation, measles cases in 2013 were reported in 36 countries of the European region and 31 617 cases were recorded. Most of these measles cases were recorded in Turkey and Ukraine among unvaccinated people.

Currently a suspected case of measles has been registered in Khakassia in a child 7 years old living in the Ust-Abakan area. According to the Rospotrebnadzor Khakassia press service, no measles cases have been recorded in the region since 2007. The sick child had been residing outside Khakassia in St. Petersburg for 2 weeks prior to illness, where the infection most likely happened. The child had not been vaccinated against measles on account of medical contraindications. Daily medical supervision was provided for all those in contact with the sick child.

Epidemiologists believe that the cases of measles importation into Russia originate from exposure in Thailand, China, Turkey and Indonesia -- countries which are traditionally visited by Russian tourists. Measles is more severe in adults than in children, and in adults 3 percent of measles cases are complicated by pneumonia, bronchitis, otitis media, sinusitis, encephalitis. Mortality in acute measles encephalitis may reach 10 percent.

Vaccination is the main weapon against measles. This is especially relevant for those who regularly travel to measles disadvantaged countries and regions of the Russian Federation.

A threat of a measles outbreak has been growing in Russia in connection with the arrival of refugees from Ukraine, said Anna Popova, head of the Federal Consumer Protection Service (Rospotrebnadzor) at a news conference on Tuesday, 24 Jun 2014. The level of vaccination against measles among Ukrainian refugees is 2-3 times lower than that of the optimal 95 percent.

The refugees, like Russian citizens, should have been vaccinated against measles and poliomyelitis free of charge, Popova said. A maximum rate of vaccination of Russian citizens and refugees from Ukraine will be ensured in areas where refugees arrive. The dates for vaccination will be set for each particular region, Popova said.

Measles in Kharkov
------------------
According to City Watch, those affected are predominately people who have not been vaccinated previously. Furthermore, more than 40 percent belong to the migrant Roma population. Since the beginning of 2014 the Kharkov region has recorded more than 93 000 cases of infectious diseases. Although this represents a 9.3 percent decrease, the situation remains unsatisfactory. There have been decreases in the incidences of salmonellosis, shigellosis, respiratory tuberculosis, mumps, rubella, acute viral hepatitis B and C, and other infectious diseases.

However, in the Kharkov region, as well as in Ukraine in general, there has been an increased incidence of measles. The incidence has been sporadic in most cases. 6 family groups with 3-6 cases [each] have been identified. The vast majority of measles patients have not received vaccinations against measles, more than 40 percent in the case of those having Roma ethnicity.
