H5N1 strains in Egypt show increased ability to bind to human cells
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H5N1 avian influenza viruses in Egypt have branched into new
sublineages and have shown a mutation that helps them bind more
readily to human cell receptors in the lower respiratory tract, which
may indicate an increased pandemic potential, according to a study
published yesterday [26 May issue of PLoS Pathogens -- see below for
reference, author summary, and abstract - Mod.CP].

Researchers from Egypt, Japan, and Thailand conducted a phylogenetic
analysis of H5N1 viruses isolated from 2006 to 2009 in Egypt. Using
reverse genetics, they found that several new sublineages have
acquired an enhanced receptor-binding affinity of the viral
hemagglutinin to alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid (SA), which is a
receptor-binding trait of human influenza strains. The mutation was
associated with increased attachment to and infectivity in the lower
respiratory tract but not the larynx of humans and also demonstrated
increased virulence in mice.

The authors conclude, "Our findings suggested that emergence of new
H5 sublineages with alpha-2,6 SA specificity caused a subsequent
increase in human H5N1 influenza virus infections in Egypt, and
provided data for understanding the virus's pandemic potential."

Author summary
---------------
"Even though highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses lack an
efficient mechanism for human-human transmission, these viruses are
endemic in birds in China, Indonesia, Viet Nam, and Egypt. Hotspots
for bird-human transmission are indicated in areas where human cases
are more than 80 percent of total H5N1 influenza cases. Circulation
among hosts may allow H5N1 virus to acquire amino acid changes
enabling efficient bird-human transmission and eventually human-human
transmission. The receptor specificity of viral hemagglutinin (HA) is
considered a main factor affecting efficient transmissibility. Several
amino acid substitutions in H5 virus HAs that increase their
human-type receptor specificity have been described in virus isolates
from patients, but their prevalence has been limited. In contrast, we
show here that new H5 sublineages in Egypt have acquired a change in
receptor specificity during their diversification in birds. We found
that viruses in those sublineages exhibited increased attachment and
infectivity in the human lower respiratory tract, but not in the
larynx. Our findings may not allow a conclusion on the high pandemic
potential of H5N1 virus in Egypt, but helps explain why Egypt has
recently had the highest number of human H5 cases worldwide."

Abstract
--------
"Highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 is currently
widespread in Asia, Europe, and Africa, with 60 percent mortality in
humans. In particular, since 2009 Egypt has unexpectedly had the
highest number of human cases of H5N1 virus infection, with more than
50 percent of the cases worldwide, but the basis for this high
incidence has not been elucidated. A change in receptor binding
affinity of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) from alpha-2,3- to
alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid (SA) is thought to be necessary for H5N1
virus to become pandemic. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic
analysis of H5N1 viruses isolated between 2006 and 2009 in Egypt. The
phylogenetic results showed that recent human isolates clustered
disproportionately into several new H5 sublineages suggesting that
their HAs have changed their receptor specificity. Using reverse
genetics, we found that these H5 sublineages have acquired an enhanced
binding affinity for alpha-2,6 SA in combination with residual
affinity for alpha-2,3 SA, and identified the amino acid mutations
that produced this new receptor specificity. Recombinant H5N1 viruses
with a single mutation at HA residue 192 or a double mutation at HA
residues 129 and 151 had increased attachment to and infectivity in
the human lower respiratory tract but not in the larynx. These
findings correlated with enhanced virulence of the mutant viruses in
mice. Interestingly, these H5 viruses, with increased affinity to
alpha-2,6 SA, emerged during viral diversification in bird populations
and subsequently spread to humans. Our findings suggested that
emergence of new H5 sublineages with alpha-2,6 SA specificity caused a
subsequent increase in human H5N1 influenza virus infections in Egypt,
and provided data for understanding the virus's pandemic potential."

These conclusions are derived from phylogenetic analysis, _in vitro_
experiments with fixed tissue and cultured cells, and reverse genetic
constructs in laboratory mice. They clearly indicate that the
emergence of a new H5 sublineage with alpha-2,6 SA binding specificity
caused a subsequent increase in human H5N1 influenza virus infections
in Egypt. These genetic changes affect the transmissibility of avian
influenza A/(H5N1) virus from birds to humans, but do not on the basis
of the epidemiology in Egypt appear determine transmissibility of
infection among humans. - Mod.CP]
