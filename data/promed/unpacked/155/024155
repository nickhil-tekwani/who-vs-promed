I have seen no answers from ecologists or mammalogists to this query
concerning rodents and cultivation. Perhaps because there is so large a
bibliography on the subject, no expert felt it worth the effort to answer.
Just look through the Journal of Mammalogy. Any student of mammalogy or
ecology knows that a field under cultivation harbours a smaller number of
species, but in higher densities than surrounding areas with more diverse
vegetation.
Furthermore, it is difficult to address such questions without a more
detailed knowledge of the species involved. Local successive populations
explosions due to frutification of plants, as certain species of bamboo in
South America, as one travels from north to south, descending in latitude,
are usually and traditionally described as "waves of migrating rats".
