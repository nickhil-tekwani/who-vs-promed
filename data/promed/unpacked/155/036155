The FBI says laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of ricin in letters mailed to a US senator and to President Barack Obama.

The FBI said Thursday [18 Apr 2013] that further tests are still being done, but that lab results show the toxin was used in the mailings.

There are no known illnesses from the exposure.

Paul Kevin Curtis, of Corinth, Mississippi, is suspected of sending the letters to Obama and US Sen. Roger Wicker. He appeared in federal court Thursday [18 Apr 2013] on charges of threatening Obama and others, but he did not enter a plea.

His attorney said that the arrest was surprising and that Curtis maintains that he's innocent.

[Ricin is made from the mash remaining after the castor oil has been pressed out of the castor bean. While the mash can make toxin ricin powder, the castor oil has no toxic properties.

The lab must have been close to the exposure and been prepared for the letters. Perhaps the lab performing the test was the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) in Washington DC. The proximity may explain why the test was so rapid. But there are a number of laboratories capable of doing this test, all within an hour or so of the capital city. - Mod.TG
