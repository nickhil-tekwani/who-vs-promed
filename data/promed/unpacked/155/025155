Another woman has tested positive for Ebola in a village in northern Sierra Leone already under quarantine after the death of a 67-year-old woman a week ago, President Ernest Bai Koroma said.

Koroma said the new case, confirmed on Sat [5 Sep 2015], had been in contact with the woman who died on 28 Aug [2015] in the village of Sellu Kafta in Kambia district.

"The incident is a reminder that Ebola is still here, so we must continue to adhere to the precautionary measures made by the health authorities," he urged.

"As a government, we have (recently) extended the state of public health emergency to deal with such occurrences. The fact that we still have new cases (emerging) means that we need the regulation, and we will continue to use it to halt the transmission chain," the president stressed.

The latest death had brought to an abrupt end the optimism fuelled by the release of what had been Sierra Leone's last known Ebola patient from hospital in the central city of Makeni in late August [2015].

District health officials in Kambia told AFP the new Ebola patient was the "niece" of the woman who died in Sellu Kafta.

The village of almost 1000 people was put under a 3-week quarantine lockdown after officials announced on Tue [1 Sep 2015] that the woman, a food trader, had died after being sick for up to 10 days without the authorities' knowledge.

Reports from Kambia said "residents are in a somber mood and trying to relieve themselves from the shock of the 1st Ebola death about a week ago," said 46-year-old cashew-nut farmer Morlai Koroma.

Health officials also said the experimental "Guinea ring vaccine" that has been administered by a World Health Organization team in the village since Fri [4 Sep 2015] was "progressing very well."

[This is very disappointing but not unexpected, as the infected individual is a relative of the index case. A question is whether this individual was vaccinated on Fri [4 Sep 2015] before showing signs of infection with Ebola virus and whether this may improve her chances of recovery.
