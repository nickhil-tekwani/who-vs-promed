Comment in relation to earlier ProMED-mail posts concerning A(H1N1)pdm09 activity, including archive numbers 20131229.2142139; 20131224.2134839; and 20131222.2131051
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As elsewhere in North America, influenza activity has recently been increasing in British Columbia (BC), Canada. In particular, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza at the BC Public Health Microbiology and Reference Laboratory was less than 5 percent prior to December [2013] but has increased to more than 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, and 45 percent each successive week (49-52) since. As in other jurisdictions, A(H1N1)pdm09 is the dominant subtype detected, representing more than 80 percent of influenza viruses typed/subtyped in BC to date [1]. We have also, as elsewhere, received anecdotal reports of serious outcomes in young and middle-aged adults. These cases have been cited in the striking absence of other more typical early warning signals of influenza circulation such as school or long-term care facility (LTCF) outbreaks for which clustered activity is more readily recognized and reported than other community indicators.

To help understand this pattern of influenza infections in BC and similar patterns reported elsewhere, we would like to share findings from a recent serosurvey we undertook to gauge population-level immunity to A(H1N1)pdm09 since the 2009 pandemic. Using methods described previously [2], we assessed a convenience sample of anonymized residual sera collected at community-based laboratory centers in the greater Vancouver area of BC, including 100 sera per decade of life collected in the spring 2010 (as previously published [2]) and 50 sera per decade of life more recently collected in spring 2013 (unpublished data). Per convention, we assigned seroprotection based on antibody titre of 40 or higher to A/California/07/2009 measured by haemagglutination inhibition assay. To date, all A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterized in Canada have been described as antigenically similar to A/California/07/2009 [3].

In the spring 2010, shortly following the 2009 pandemic wave and immunization campaign (of which more than 95 percent of vaccine delivered in Canada was the AS03-adjuvanted product with coverage of about 40 percent [2,4]), an overall age-standardized prevalence of seroprotection approaching 50 percent was observed. We noted a U-shaped age-related pattern: among those less than 20 years and those 80 years or older, seroprotection was comparably high at about 70 percent but it was lower among those 20-79 years at about 30-40 percent [2]. In the spring 2013, following the 4th consecutive year of A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation (albeit at low levels) and its inclusion as a trivalent vaccine component (with about 30 percent annual coverage [5]), we identified the same overall age-standardized seroprevalence approaching 50 percent but with slight modification in age-specific findings. Seroprotection to A(H1N1)pdm09 was now lowest (less than 20 percent) in young children under 5 years of age (most of whom were not alive during the 2009 pandemic) and highest (60 percent or more) in school-aged children and elderly adults 70 years of age or older, remaining lower in younger adults 20-39 years (45-50 percent) and those 40-69 years (35-40 percent) of age.

Our age-related observations for the spring 2013 suggest pre-school children and young or middle-aged adults are currently the most susceptible to A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. These findings may help put current surveillance trends into context. Given the greater seroprotection identified in school children and the elderly, it could be speculated that A(H1N1)pdm09 is propagating more surreptitiously through adult contact networks without the usual school or LTCF outbreaks as expected surveillance signals and with dampened activity levels overall at the community level.

A demographic shift in disease burden toward adults following the 2009 pandemic has previously been suggested in mathematical models from Canada and the United States [6]. Earlier comparisons of pandemic versus epidemic influenza mortality have suggested it may take several decades before the more youthful burden associated with pandemic viruses reverts to a more typical seasonal profile of disproportionate mortality in the elderly [7]. Other reasons for greater mortality observed with A(H1N1)pdm09, particularly in the young and more so in the Americas than Australia, New Zealand, or Europe have also recently been discussed and may warrant fuller consideration in the context of recent A(H1N1)pdm09 disease trends [8]. Absent evidence of antigenic change or increased virulence in the virus itself, other factors in the agent-host interaction, including pre-existing antibody, need also to be considered in explaining current A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemiology.

Our serosurvey findings are limited by the specific context in which they were assessed and should ideally be repeated elsewhere. We further acknowledge variability inherent in the sampling frame, laboratory assay and titre threshold applied. No age group can be considered exempt from A(H1N1)pdm09 risk and our findings do not address individual risk of serious outcomes by age IF infected (such as per case fatality), which may show a different age-related risk profile particularly important for the elderly. In that context, absolute seroprotection rates shared here should not be over-interpreted but age-related trends in serosusceptibility may nevertheless help inform real time population risk assessment and response. Reinforcing protective measures for young and middle-aged adults as well as pre-school children appears supported by recent surveillance and serosurvey findings and earlier modeling simulations. Such considerations may be especially relevant given increased social mixing across age groups during the holiday period.
