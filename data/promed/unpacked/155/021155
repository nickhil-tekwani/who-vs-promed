The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) has reported a dramatic rise in the number of norovirus cases in the UK this year [2012], leading to the closure of 45 hospitals across the country. Some 53 outbreaks of the winter vomiting bug [norovirus] have been reported at the NHS [National Health Service] trust hospitals so far in the ongoing year. The number has risen largely by almost 50 percent more than the last year [2011], taking the toll up from 1301 to 1975 cases in just one year.

However, Shropshire has remained lucky with the least number of cases being reported there. It has reported a total of 35 cases in 2012-13 so far, while almost no hospitals have been closed to admissions during this same period. Doctors are still recommending that people with suspected symptoms remain away from their sick relatives in the hospitals, as the highly contagious virus has affected thousands across Britain. The number reported this year [2012] is the highest in 5 years.

Norovirus usually strikes in winter and is thus called the "winter vomiting bug." Its symptoms are vomiting, fever, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. It is highly communicable and spreads through contaminated food and water and being in contact with infected persons and surfaces.

If you are suspicious of having contracted the disease, you should contact NHS via http://www.nhs.uk, or make a call to 0845 4647, or consult your GP.

[The HPA Weekly Update of norovirus activity, dated 26 Nov 2012, provides an up-to-date record of hospital outbreaks: http://www.hpa-bioinformatics.org.uk/noroOBK/home.php.

In the last 2 weeks (between 12-25 Nov 2012), the HPA hospital outbreak reporting scheme (HNORS) recorded 53 suspected or confirmed outbreaks of norovirus. Of these, 45 (85 percent) led to ward/bay closures or restrictions to admissions, and 35 (66 percent) outbreaks were recorded as laboratory confirmed due to norovirus. In this season (since week 27 of 2012), 283 outbreaks have been reported, 244 (86 percent) of which reported ward/bay closures or restrictions to admissions, and 160 (57 percent) were reported as laboratory confirmed norovirus outbreaks. In the last season (week 27 of 2011 to week 26 of 2012), there were 1653 outbreaks, of which 1291 (78 percent) led to ward closures, and 1075 (65 percent) were laboratory confirmed as due to norovirus. From these data, it would seem that Shropshire has been more fortunate than most counties in the current year [2012].

ProMED-mail does not normally record outbreaks of norovirus infection on account of their characteristic sudden onset and rapid resolution. However, it would seem that norovirus infection has been particularly severe in the UK this year [2012], perhaps as a consequence of the prolonged and severe rainfall this winter, causing the population to remain indoors.

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhoea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 C/100.4 F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear one to 2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a couple of days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection.
