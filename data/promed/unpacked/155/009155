The Fiji Health Ministry has reported 2 dozen typhoid cases in Bua [Northern division] since the beginning of 2015, prompting them to advise the public about proper hygiene and sanitation. The Fiji Times reported the typhoid cluster is understood to have started abruptly after a New Year's function at a village in the province.

Typhoid fever is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi. _S._ Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever can have the bacterium in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. In addition, a small number of persons, called carriers, are infected with the typhoid fever bacillus without symptoms. Both ill persons and carriers shed _S._ Typhi in their feces.

You can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding _S._ Typhi or if sewage contaminated with the bacterium gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is more common in areas of the world where handwashing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage.

[Typhoid fever is the classical human infection caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi. Unlike most salmonellas, _S._ Typhi is not zoonotic, being a pathogen only of humans, and may cause constipation and not diarrhea. As a reminder, the incubation period is 7 to 21 days, which is substantially longer than non-Typhi salmonellosis and this depends on, among other things, how large a dose of bacteria has been taken in.

Additionally, the term abdominal typhus is still used in some places to refer to typhoid fever, since typhus (caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_) and typhoid fever (caused by _Salmonella_ Typhi) present quite similar symptoms, such as the fever pattern, the rash, and the cloudy mental state (also called coma vigil).

For travelers to the developing world, especially VFRs (visitors to friends or relatives), there are 2 basic modalities to avoid this infection:
1. avoidance of risky drinks and foods and
2. vaccination.

CDC summarizes these modalities on its website (http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/typhoid_fever/):
1. "Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it"
- If you drink water, buy it bottled or bring it to a rolling boil for 1 minute before you drink it. Bottled carbonated water is safer than uncarbonated water.
- Ask for drinks without ice unless the ice is made from bottled or boiled water.
- Avoid popsicles and flavored ices that may have been made with contaminated water.
- Eat foods that have been thoroughly cooked and that are still hot and steaming.
- Avoid raw vegetables and fruits that cannot be peeled. Vegetables like lettuce are easily contaminated and are very hard to wash well.
- When you eat raw fruit or vegetables that can be peeled, peel them yourself. (Wash your hands with soap first.) Do not eat the peelings.
- Avoid foods and beverages from street vendors. It is difficult for food to be kept clean on the street, and many travelers get sick from food bought from street vendors.

2. Vaccinations
If you are traveling to a country where typhoid is common, you should consider being vaccinated against typhoid. Visit a doctor or travel clinic to discuss your vaccination options.

Remember that you will need to complete your vaccination at least 1-2 weeks (dependent upon vaccine type) before you travel so that the vaccine has time to take effect. Typhoid vaccines lose effectiveness after several years; if you were vaccinated in the past, check with your doctor to see if it is time for a booster vaccination. Taking antibiotics will not prevent typhoid fever; they only help treat it. - Mod.LL
