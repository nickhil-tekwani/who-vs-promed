Two people have been hospitalized in an outbreak of _Listeria_ that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says is connected to a specific type of mushroom. The CDC says both people, one from Nevada and one from Michigan, ate enoki mushrooms or "at restaurants with menu items containing enoki mushrooms."

The same strain of _Listeria_ was previously found in a sample of enoki mushrooms collected by the Food and Drug Administration.

The exact size of the outbreak is still not known and could involve other states. The CDC believes more people may have been sickened and didn't seek medical care. Recent illnesses also may not yet have been reported, as it takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Investigators are still working to identify specific brands of the mushrooms that may be contaminated.

The CDC previously reported a _Listeria_ outbreak in enoki mushrooms in 2020, resulting in more than 20 recalls.

_Listeria_ can cause severe illness with symptoms that can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, in addition to fever and muscle aches. Pregnant people typically have fewer symptoms, but _Listeria_ can cause pregnancy loss or premature birth.

_Listeria_ Outbreak Linked to Enoki Mushrooms
---------------------------------------------

Investigation notice
--------------------
_Listeria_ is especially harmful if you are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system. If you are in any of these groups, do not eat raw enoki mushrooms. Cook enoki mushrooms thoroughly to kill any foodborne germs.

Investigators are working to identify specific brands of enoki mushrooms that may be contaminated with the outbreak strain of _Listeria_. However, many brands of enoki mushrooms have been recalled since the 2020 _Listeria outbreak_ linked to enoki mushrooms. [See ProMED post Listeriosis - USA: fatal, enoki mushrooms, 2016-2019, recall, alert].

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 2
Hospitalizations: 2
Deaths: 0
States: 2 [Michigan, Nevada]
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

Enoki mushrooms are white and have long, thin stems. They are often sold in a bunch with roots in sealed plastic packaging. They are popular in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean food, and they are almost always eaten cooked in soups, hot pots, and stir-fried dishes.

In 2020, CDC investigated the 1st known _Listeria_ outbreak in the United States linked to enoki mushrooms. [See ProMED post Listeriosis - USA: fatal, enoki mushrooms, 2016-2019, recall, alert]. This outbreak resulted in 3 recalls of enoki mushrooms that were imported from Korea. Since then, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and public health officials from several states have been collecting samples of enoki mushrooms and found _Listeria_ in many samples, resulting in more than 20 recalls of enoki mushrooms.

Source of the outbreak
----------------------
Information collected so far shows that enoki mushrooms are the likely source of these illnesses. Both sick people reported eating enoki mushrooms or eating at restaurants with menu items containing enoki mushrooms. The outbreak strain was previously found in one sample of enoki mushrooms that FDA collected at import. However, to date [17 Nov 2022], the firm associated with this sample has not been identified as a potential source of enoki mushrooms in this outbreak. Investigators are working to identify specific brands of enoki mushrooms linked to these illnesses.

Investigation details
---------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US FDA are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections.

Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that enoki mushrooms contaminated with _Listeria_ are making people sick. Investigators are working to identify specific brands of enoki mushrooms that may be linked to these illnesses.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 15 Nov 2022, 2 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ have been reported from 2 states (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/enoki-11-22/map.html). Sick people's samples were collected from 5 Oct 2022 to 8 Oct 2022 (see timeline at https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/enoki-11-22/epi.html).

The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Listeria_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported, as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Public health officials collect many different types of information from sick people, including their age, sex, other demographics, and the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. This information provides clues to help investigators identify the source of the outbreak.

The 2 sick people are 30 and 42 years old, and they are both males. Both have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. Both sick people reported eating enoki mushrooms or eating at restaurants with menu items containing enoki mushrooms.

Laboratory data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS).

WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

In November 2021, FDA found _Listeria_ in one sample of enoki mushrooms that they collected at import, as part of the FDA's strategy to prevent _Listeria_ outbreaks linked to imported enoki mushrooms. These enoki mushrooms were destroyed. The _Listeria_ from this sample is closely related genetically to the _Listeria_ that made the people in this outbreak sick. However, to date [17 Nov 2022], the firm associated with this sample has not been identified as a potential source of enoki mushrooms in this outbreak.

Public health actions
---------------------
CDC advises people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system to not eat raw enoki mushrooms. CDC also advises restaurants to not serve raw enoki mushrooms. Cook enoki mushrooms thoroughly to kill any foodborne germs.

Currently, FDA has issued 3 import alerts that include enoki mushrooms.

[ProMED recently posted an FDA report of an outbreak of 2 cases of listeriosis (ProMED post Listeriosis - USA (09): 2 cases, RFI 20221113.8706715). A cluster of listeriosis cases is usually declared a common source outbreak if the _Listeria_ clinical isolates have similar genotypes, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), which the CDC report above now confirms. The outbreak strain of _Listeria_ genetically matched the _Listeria_ strain isolated from one sample of enoki mushrooms that the FDA collected at import, which identified this sample as the likely source for this outbreak. However, no recall has been issued as yet.

The CDC above warns not to eat raw enoki mushrooms and restaurants to not serve raw enoki mushrooms, although enoki mushrooms that are thoroughly cooked, which will kill _Listeria_, are safe to eat. - Mod.ML
