More than 150 students and staff from the International French School in Ang Mo Kio have contracted food poisoning after eating from its canteen. The cafeteria has been closed this week as a precaution, said the school.

As at noon on Fri 23 April 2021, 151 people had reported symptoms of gastroenteritis, the Ministry of Health and Singapore Food Agency told The Straits Times. So far, none have been hospitalized.

The school's communications director, Mr Sebastien Barnard, said that the problem surfaced on Tue 20 Apr 2021 after several parents reported that their children had gastrointestinal symptoms after eating from the canteen. "We ceased canteen operations immediately and are now working with our canteen supplier to conduct a full investigation into the possible causes," he said. He added that students' health was of the utmost importance and that the school was taking it very seriously. "We are applying extra precautionary measures to ensure the safety of our students," Mr Barnard said.

The International French School has students from kindergarten age all the way through to high school. According to its website, catering is provided by Chartwells, a company which was also involved in cases of food poisoning at the residential colleges of the National University of Singapore in 2019.

[To best assess epidemiologically the cause or causes of this outbreak, it would be useful to know more about the symptoms, including whether nausea and vomiting or diarrhea was the predominant symptom and whether fever was present. Additionally, a curve of case onset over time would be useful. Certainly, microbiological data are needed to identify and confirm the cause, and a food history of those affected and not affected can be useful in implicating a specific vehicle. - Mod.LL
