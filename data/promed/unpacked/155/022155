Health authorities are awaiting the reports that could confirm or discard [the diagnosis] of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Ñuble province [Bío Bío region].

The 69 year old man, resident of the Cachapoal locality in the San Carlos community, remains hospitalized in the Chillán Hospital, suspected of having contracted the virus, as was confirmed by the Health SEREMI [Director of the regional ministerial administrative unit], Mauricio Careaga. The Hospital Director, Rodrigo Agendaño, reported that the patient presents with respiratory insufficiency and is in the intensive care unit.

The hospital stated that the corresponding samples were taken and were sent to the ISP [Public Health Institute] that will soon deliver the [test] results.

If [the infection] is confirmed, this will be the 4th case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Bío Bío region so far this year [2016].

[The conditions under which this man acquired his hantavirus infection are not given, and neither is it indicated whether there will be an epidemiological investigation of the area where he worked and resided.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Infections are acquired when people are exposed to virus-containing excreta from infected rodents. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
