Epidemic of _P.falciparum_ malaria in Manaus
--------------------
The Amazon capital Manaus registered 16 944 cases of malaria in the
first 3 months of this year, 815 percent higher than the same period
last year, which had 1850 cases. It is the biggest epidemic reported
in the city -- having its peak in March 2003, when 6908 persons
(about 223 cases per day) were affected by the illness, transmitted
by a parasite of African origin [_P.falciparum_, we suppose].
The deforestation carried out by homeless persons who invaded
[previously undisturbed] areas of the city, the intensification of
rains, and the suspension of fumigation (application of insecticide)
at night in neighborhoods considered endemic are [all] factors
considered for the outbreak of malaria.
In November 2002, workers of the Fundacio Nacional de Saude (Funasa)
complained about the lack of infrastructure to combat malaria after
the service of the Ministry of Health was decentralized and turned
over to the Secretaria de Estado da Saude (SUSAM) [State Health
Department]. With the decentralization, SUSAM inherited 565 workers
from Funasa, as well as equipment and a monthly budget of R$ 1 300
000 [approx. $383 000 US]. Yesterday, SUSAM decided to intensify the
action plan to combat malaria, hiring 86 epidemic control agents and
increasing the number of diagnostic sites. The mayor's office put
physicians from the program Medicos da Familia at the disposal of the
plan. A Manaus newspaper, Amazonas em Tempo, ran similar stories and
commented that the epidemic so far was not as bad as that of 1999.
There is no mention of the species of malaria involved, although one
might expect both _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ to be present. No
deaths were reported by either newspaper, although 8 were reported
during 2002.

[An increase in vector capacity due to reduced emphasis on mosquito
control is a classic cause of rise in number of malaria cases. -
