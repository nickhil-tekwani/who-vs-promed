Cases of mumps in health care workers at the Hopital Fleurimont and Hotel-Dieu in Sherbrooke [Quebec] have been confirmed by the Estrie Public Health Department.

The reported cases, 4 confirmed and 1 probable, have all been investigated and there is no evidence of transmission of the disease among contacts of the patients at this time. Control measures were immediately put in place to limit the spread of the infection.

Mumps is a notifiable contagious disease that manifests as fever and swelling of the parotid glands in front of the ears. The disease usually resolves by itself in 3-10 days, but complications are relatively frequent.

The people who circulated between 1 and 13 Dec [2016] in the areas (surgery, radiology, emergency, intensive care, and the fetal and maternal clinic of the Fleurimont Hospital and surgery of the Hotel-Dieu, hospital) are asked to keep a look out for the appearance of symptoms and to consult a physician if necessary.

People with symptoms are advised to wear a mask when visiting their doctor or other healthcare setting. The infectious period extends from 2 days before to up to 5 days after the onset of symptoms, according to a press release.

According to the Public Health Directorate, the 5 workers were removed from the workplace and urged to wear a mask until the end of their contagious period. Staff and physicians who were in close contact with these workers were advised to withdraw immediately from work if symptoms consistent with mumps developed.

In addition, other workers who may have been in contact with infected persons have been advised to monitor their symptoms and to consult a physician if they develop. All of these people were advised to check their immunization status and update it as needed.

The disease resolves itself in 3-10 days, without treatment, the authorities said. It is transmitted by contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. The symptoms appear between 12 and 25 days.

"The potential complications of mumps are relatively frequent, but permanent sequelae are rare," says Dr Melissa Genereux, director of public health in the Eastern Townships.

In most cases, this disease does not cause a major health problem. On the other hand, some complications can occur, including meningitis (10 percent), inflammation of the testicles (20-30 percent in pubertal men) or ovaries (5 percent in pubescent women). More rarely, mumps [can] cause pancreatitis (2-5 percent of cases), encephalitis (1 to 2 cases per 10 000), deafness (1 in 20 000 cases), arthritis, or inflammation of the thyroid gland. The disease can cause a miscarriage in pregnant women in the 1st trimester.

Mumps [is] present all over the world and outbreaks continue to be recorded. This disease is rather rare in Quebec since vaccination because the last outbreak occurred in 2010 with 674 confirmed cases.

People born before 1970 are [assumed to have acquired natural immunity to mumps]. For people born after 1970, it is possible to prevent this disease through vaccination.

In Quebec, the free vaccination program includes 2 doses of mumps vaccine in the same vaccine as the measles and rubella vaccine. Prior to 1996, a single dose was administered. A person who has received at least 1 dose is considered to have adequate vaccination.
