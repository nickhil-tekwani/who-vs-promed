Encephalitis kills 6 in western Bangladesh
--------------------
Six people have died from encephalitis disease in western
Bangladesh's Kushtia district in the last 3 days, which has created
panic among people as the number of patients rises everyday.
Doctors at Kushtia General Hospital said that more than 50 people are
being treated at the hospital and the number of patients is growing
day by day, The Daily Star reported Thursday [12 Apr 2007].
According to the hospital and Civil Surgeon's office, the disease 1st
broke out in Khajanagar and Kaburhat villages in Kushtia district a week ago.
Those attacked by the disease were aged between 12 and 60.
According to Kushtia General Hospital doctors, initially the victims
died for lack of proper treatment as the disease could not be identified.
The symptom of the disease is high fever and one stage the patient
loses sense. A virus causes the disease, the doctors said.
The patients should be kept quarantined during treatment.
Civil Surgeon Dr Abu Taher with a team of specialist doctors from
Kushtia General Hospital visited the areas.

[Upon reading the above newswire, this moderator is reminded of the
types of descriptions of the newswires that accompanied the
henipavirus outbreaks in Bangladesh and India in 2001, 2004 and 2005.
(see references below). While in the earlier outbreaks, Japanese
encephalitis (JE) was often speculated as the etiology of the
outbreaks, the clinical picture described (with henipavirus
infection) was more severe, more rapid in evolution and was
associated with a higher case fatality rate than usually seen with
JE. In the initial outbreak in 2001, cases occurred in all age
groups; in subsequent outbreaks there was a preponderance of cases in
the childhood population. In the January 2005 outbreak, illness was
associated with drinking juice made from local palm fruit.
Speculations were that the juice was made from fruit contaminated by
fruit bat droppings or from fruit the bats had half-eaten. In the
above outbreak, there is mention of 6 deaths out of 50 cases (a case
fatality rate of 12 percent - much lower than the observed 40 percent
case fatality rates associated with henipavirus).
The above newswire mentions a fairly wide spread age distribution
(ages 12 through 60 years) . That fact, combined with an observation
that this is not the usual JE season, suggests that this outbreak is
most likely not due to JE. Given the geography, and prior history of
outbreaks in Bangladesh, henipavirus seems a possible candidate as an
etiology of this outbreak. Another virus that has been implicated in
outbreaks in neighboring India is Chandipura virus. A caution to an
interpretation of the differential diagnosis here is the mention of
high fever and then an apparent accompanying delirium... a clinical
picture that could also be consistent with cerebral malaria. Rather
than continue to speculate, ProMED-mail would like to request further
information from knowledgeable individuals in the region.
Looking at a map of Bangladesh, Kushtia is in the west of the country
near to the border with West Bengal India
(http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/bangladesh_pol96.jpg>).
It is not far from Rajbari where earlier outbreaks of henipavirus
occurred (see
