Residents, leaders, and health experts in the Ankole region and the country at large are worried following the outbreak of the deadly Rift Valley fever (RVF).

The outbreak of this hemorrhagic fever has already been reported in the districts of Isingiro, Kiruhura, Sembabule, Mbarara, Ibanda, and Kasese. In the Isingiro district alone, 2 people have died. Reports indicate that more than 5 people have died in different areas, while up to 7 people are currently undergoing treatment in various hospitals in the region.

RVF is in the category of hemorrhagic fevers along with Marburg and Ebola, which is why the outbreak has put the region and the country on alert. This acute viral disease primarily affects domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels but also infects humans. It is spread by either touching infected animal blood, consuming meat and milk products from an infected animal, or being bitten by infected mosquitoes.

Mbarara district health officer Peter Ssebutinde is cautioning Ugandans against eating meat and consuming products of dead animals to avert the spread of RVF. Isingiro District Resident District Commissioner Herbert Muhangi said more vigilance among the population is needed if the fight against RVF is to be successful.

Alison Ayetoranire Byamukama, the former Special Presidential Assistant for Buhweju Affairs, wants the ministry of health as well as partners like WHO to provide the region with more experts to boost the fight against this outbreak. "We need more experts to come and support the health teams in the region. Also, we need to fund the hospitals in the region to establish isolation centres for the RVF patients; we also need funds to enable these facilities to extend the best treatment," she said.

[The WHO report above indicates that there are 8 human cases (6 confirmed) and 3 deaths. Both reports state that cases are geographically widespread and have occurred in 6 regions. No mention is made of vaccination of domestic animals in either report.

As noted earlier, although people can become infected through contact with sick animals or their tissues and secretions, RVF virus can also be transmitted by mosquitoes. An earlier report indicated that this year's [2018's] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water have enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus has increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.

The RVF virus is endemic in the Eastern Africa region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths, resulting in significant economic loss.

The RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness, and bleeding from the gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births or treating the animals, and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses. - Mod.TY
