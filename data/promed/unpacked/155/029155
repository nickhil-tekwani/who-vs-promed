China: Avian Influenza situation - WHO Update 4
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has reported the country's 12th
laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case occurred in a 20-year-old female farmer from the
south-central province of Hunan. She developed symptoms on 27 Jan
2006 and was subsequently hospitalized with severe pneumonia. Symptom
onset followed the culling of poultry raised by her household. She
died on 4 Feb 2006.
As of 13 Feb 2006, China has reported 12 laboratory-confirmed cases.
Of these, 8 have been fatal.

Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 3
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 13 Feb 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has
confirmed an additional 2 cases of human infection with H5N1 avian
influenza virus. Both cases were fatal.
The 1st case occurred in a 22-year-old woman who developed symptoms
on 25 Jan 2006 and died on 10 Feb 2006. Her neighbors kept chickens.
Samples from these chickens and from pet birds in a market near the
woman's home are being tested by Indonesia's animal health authorities.
The 2nd case occurred in a 27-year-old woman who developed symptoms
on 31 Jan 2006 and died on 10 Feb 2006. Deaths of chickens in her
neighborhood were reported 4 days prior to symptom onset.
The 2 women resided in different sub-districts of West Java Province.
The newly confirmed cases bring the total in Indonesia to 25. Of
these, 18 were fatal.

[This is the official notification of confirmation from WHO, which
was reported by local sources yesterday (12 Feb 2006). Confirmation
of another suspected human case of avian influenza is still pending.
A male patient who contracted infection in November 2005 and
recovered has now been confirmed positive according to local sources
(see below). This brings the total of laboratory-confirmed cases of
human avian influenza in Indonesia to 26, with the total of
fatalities remaining 18. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia: 26th Case of Avian Influenza Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
An Indonesian source said on Mon 13 Feb 2006 that the World Health
Organization has confirmed the country's 26th human case of bird flu,
while a Minister said infections of the virus in poultry must be
reported faster. Hariadi Wibisono, Director of Control of
Animal-borne Diseases at the ministry, said a WHO-recognized
laboratory in Hong Kong had confirmed a November 2005 case in which
the patient survived. "It was an old case, but we only recently
received the confirmation. He was admitted on 25 Nov 2005 but became
well again," Wibisono told Reuters, adding the man in question was
from Central Java province.
Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country, has reported 18
human deaths from avian flu that have been confirmed by the WHO.
Local tests also showed a 23-year-old man died of bird flu on Friday
[10 Feb 2006], and tissue samples have been sent to the same Hong
Kong laboratory. [If confirmed, the avian influenza infection total
will become 27 and the number of deaths 19. - Mod.CP]
7 of the confirmed Indonesian fatalities have been in 2006, making
Indonesia the country with the most bird flu deaths so far this year.
While the virus mostly affects birds, the H5N1 strain of avian flu
has killed at least 90 people in 7 countries since 2003, according to the WHO.
While the virus remains hard for humans to catch from birds, experts
fear the virus will mutate to become easily passed between humans,
triggering a pandemic. The highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has
affected birds in 2/3rds of the provinces in Indonesia, an
archipelago of about 17 000 islands and 220 million people.
Agriculture Minister Anton Apriyantono said the reporting of possible
bird flu cases among fowl needs to be quicker. "We will repair the
reporting system, which so far has often been late. Frequently, the
media reports are faster than the reports from the ministry's own
team," he told reporters.
"There is an increase in the intensity of bird flu cases in several
areas in West Java," he said. Indonesia has millions of chickens and
ducks, many in yards of rural or urban homes, making it likely more
humans will become infected with the virus. For financial, social and
political reasons, Indonesia has been reluctant to undertake the mass
culling of fowl seen in some other countries, concentrating instead
on selective culling, and on public education and hygiene measures
aimed at prevention.

[4] Iraq - 6 suspected cases in south

Iraq: 6 Suspected Cases of Avian Influenza Under Investigation
-----------------------------------------------
Iraqi doctors are investigating 6 suspected human cases of avian
influenza in southern Iraq, including one in which a 25-year-old
fisherman died after contact with birds he was keeping in his yard,
Iraqi and American health officials said on Sun 12 Feb 2006. Tests
are now being performed to determine whether the fisherman, who died
recently in a hospital after exhibiting symptoms of bird flu for more
than 2 weeks, was infected with the A(H5N1) strain of the virus that
causes bird flu, said Dr. Ibitsam Aziz, a spokeswoman for an Iraqi
government committee looking into avian influenza. A(H5N1) is the
strain that scientists believe was carried by migrating birds from
Asia, where it was 1st identified, into the Middle East, Africa and
parts of Europe. It has raised concerns of a possible human pandemic.
The fisherman entered the hospital a week after developing a fever,
Dr. Aziz said. He had a high fever and a cough, but X-rays showed no
pneumonia, she added. 2 weeks after the fever began, the man had
difficulty breathing, and his white blood cell count rose sharply. 5
of the fisherman's cousins, who had all been living with him in the
city of Amara and had also come in contact with the birds in his
yard, are also being tested. A positive result would show that the
H5N1 virus had spread to the impoverished Shiite heartland of
southern Iraq, where the quality of communications and health care is
much lower than elsewhere in the country.
The only confirmed human case of avian influenza in Iraq was reported
in late January 2006 in Iraqi Kurdistan by health officials, after
tests showed that a Kurdish girl had died from bird flu. 2 other
suspected cases in the same area are being investigated.
But the symptoms of bird flu mimic those of many other serious
respiratory illnesses and, in other countries with bird flu
outbreaks, many people with suspected cases turned out not to have
the disease. This is partly because people tend to rush to hospitals
at the 1st sign of medical trouble, even if they have had little or
no contact with birds.
In December 2005, Turkish authorities reported an outbreak of avian
influenza in the Kurdish region of southeastern Turkey, right across
the border from Iraq. So far, almost all humans infected with the
virus have caught it from birds, but international health
organizations are deeply concerned about the possibility that the
strain will mutate to allow widespread human-to-human transmission.
Dr. Sam Yingst, an American veterinarian and virologist who led an
international animal investigation team to Kurdistan last week, said
the disease was currently an "agriculture problem" rather than a
"human health problem." The disease was not yet "definitely under
control," but the Kurds were "doing the best they can" under the
circumstances, Dr. Yingst said at a news conference with Dr. Aziz
here on Sunday [12 Feb 2006], just hours after he returned from
Kurdistan. Dr. Yingst estimated that in the effort to halt the bird
flu outbreak there, at least 200 000 chickens had been slaughtered in
Sulaimaniya Province, in the north, and tens of thousands in
neighboring Erbil Province.
Many Iraqis are now shunning chicken dishes, a basic staple of the
diet here, and chicken restaurants have shut their doors across the
affected region, Dr. Yingst said, warning of serious and unnecessary
damage to a crucial part of Iraq's agriculture industry. He said
chickens could still be eaten if killed and cooked using basic
sanitation methods. Rumors of an outbreak in the south in the last
few days have been fomenting "unnecessary panic," Dr. Yingst said.
"Fear of a dead pigeon on the side of the road," he said, "is
unnecessary panic."

Greece: 2 People Placed in Quarantine
---------------------------------------------
The Greek authorities said on Mon 13 Feb 2006 that 2 people had been
placed in quarantine pending the results of tests for possible avian
influenza, just 2 days after confirming the disease in 3 dead swans.
In both cases, initial tests have been negative, but the results of a
2nd round of tests are expected in the next one to 2 days, officials
said. "The procedure now requires that the 2 be placed under
quarantine," Panayiotis Efstathiou, head of the government
coordinating committee on bird flu, told Greek radio.
The 1st case involves a 15-year-old boy who came into contact with a
swan 9 days ago and showed flu-like symptoms. The 2nd was a
29-year-old hunter who killed 3 wild ducks a week ago. Both are in
quarantine in separate hospitals in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki, close to where the initial cases of H5N1 bird flu were
found last week [2nd week February 2006].
Last week [2nd week February 2006], the deadly strain of the bird flu
virus was found in 3 wild swans, while tests are now being conducted
on a wild goose from the Aegean island of Skyros.

[The A/H5N1 avian influenza virus has killed at least 88 people in
Asia and the Middle East since early 2003, but there have been no
authenticated reports of human cases of avian influenza further west
than Turkey and none in countries of the European Union. All cases of
avian influenza in humans have been associated with food preparation
and consumption of diseased poultry, or proximity to poultry and pet
birds. So far, no human cases have been attributed to contact with
free-living species of birds. - Mod.CP]
