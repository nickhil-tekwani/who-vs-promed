Cases of the H7 flu virus have been identified following the
discovery of avian flu at a smallholding near Corwen in North Wales.
By 10 AM this morning, Sat 26 May 2007, 26 people have been
identified in Wales as being possible contacts of avian flu. Eleven
of the 26 people are cases with symptoms of a flu-like illness or
conjunctivitis. No one is seriously ill.
The National Public Health Service (NPHS) is using the following
definitions of cases and contacts: A case is an individual with
influenza-like illness (fever above 38 C, aches and pains, cough/head
cold, sore throat or conjunctivitis) who has been in contact with
affected premises or with known infected poultry (handling/within one
meter) or close contact with another human case.
A contact is defined as an individual who has been in contact with
affected premises or with known infected poultry (handling/within one
meter) or has had close contact with another person with confirmed or
presumptive avian influenza).
The National Public Health Service for Wales has received test
results from 9 people in Wales so far. These are from swabs taken
from the nose and throat and also blood tests. They have been tested
for the Influenza A viruses, including the H7 subtype that has been
isolated from the affected poultry. Two tests have been reported as
positive for H7 subtype.
People with symptoms of conjunctivitis and flu have been given
treatment. They have been advised to stay at home until they are
better. All well contacts are being given medication to reduce the
severity of any impact from the infection.
Dr Marion Lyons, Lead Consultant in Communicable Disease Control for
the National Public Health Service for Wales, said: "We do not
believe there is a significant risk to public health in Wales. Bird
flu is still primarily a disease of birds. Cases of spread to people
remain very unusual and are usually associated with very close
contact with birds. We are contacting every individual who has been
in close contact with the people who are cases, so people who are not
contacted by us should not worry. People we have identified as
contacts are being offered medication to reduce the severity of any
impact from the infection. We are continuing to investigate and
identify potential contacts today."
An updated Q&A information sheet prepared by the NPHS is available to
download from the link: Q&A Avian Influenza in North Wales (updated
26 May 2007). Situation updates are also available from the Welsh
Assembly Government website at:

A map detailing the Avian Influenza Restricted Zone declared in
accordance with Article 55 of the Avian Influenza and Influenza of
Avian Origin in Mammals (Wales) (No. 2) Order 2006 is also given on
the Welsh Assembly website at:

11 ill as bird flu tests continue
----------------------------------
The H7N2 avian influenza outbreak was confirmed at a Conwy
smallholding on Thursday [24 May 2007]. Officials investigating 2
possible cases of bird flu in north Wales have traced 26 people who
may have been in contact with the disease. 11 of these people have
shown flu-like symptoms, but none has been seriously ill. Officials
said there was not a "significant risk" to public health. One mild
form of bird flu has been confirmed at a smallholding in Conwy, and
tests should reveal whether there is a 2nd case on a Llyn Peninsula farm.
The National Public Health Service for Wales defined possible
contacts of bird flu as people who had been in contact with affected
premises, or have either handled or come very close to known infected
poultry. It also included those who had had close contact with
another person who has or is suspected as having bird flu.
Four people -- 2 from Wales and 2 from northwest England -- have been
found to have contracted bird flu following the outbreak at Corwen. A
further 4 are being treated as having had the disease. The latest
figures come as officials examine 2 properties. The confirmed case
involved a smallholding at Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, near Cerrigydrudion, Conwy.
Owners [of the affected holding], who have tested negative for the
virus, called in a vet after their Rhode Island Red chickens began to
die. They bought the chickens at Chelford Market at Macclesfield,
Cheshire, some 70 miles (112 km) away, on 7 May 2007. A total of 30
chickens from the smallholding have now been slaughtered after 15
birds died. Officials have stressed that the disease found at the
Conwy farm was the H7N2 strain of bird flu, not the more virulent H5N1.
The 2nd possible case emerged on Saturday [26 May 2007] about 35
miles (56 km) away at a farm understood to be on the outskirts of
Efailnewydd, near Pwllheli. It has also been linked to the market.
Police are at the scene, but Welsh Assembly Government officials said
the farm would not be closed off unless test results found the
presence of avian flu.
Marion Lyons, of the National Public Health Service for Wales, said:
"We do not believe there is a significant risk to public health in
Wales. Bird flu is still primarily a disease of birds. Cases of
spread to people remain very unusual and are usually associated with
very close contact with birds. We are contacting every individual who
has been in close contact with the people who are cases so people who
are not contacted by us should not worry. People we have identified
as contacts are being offered medication to reduce the severity of
any impact from the infection. We are continuing to investigate and
identify potential contacts today." A helpline has been set up to
offer information about bird flu. The number is 0845 600 3678, and it
is open from 0700 - 2000 BST daily.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) wants
to hear from anyone -- who has not already been contacted -- who
purchased from or supplied to Chelford Market, Cheshire on Mon 7 May
2007 or any poultry keeper who visited the market on that day whose
birds have subsequently become ill. They are asked to contact their
local animal health office or the DEFRA helpline at 08459 335577.
Lines are open between 0900 - 1700 BST 7 days a week.
