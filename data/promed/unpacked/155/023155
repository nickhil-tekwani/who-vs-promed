TRANSFER OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS
The risk of transfer of bacterial resistance to antibiotics from animals to
humans due to the use of antimicrobials in animals has been an issue for the
last 20-30 years. Recently the debate has intensified in connection with the
introduction of a new class of antibacterials, i.e. the fluoroquinolones,
for veterinary use.
Earlier this year the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (the body
responsible for evaluation of documentation in connection with applications
for licencing of drugs for veterinary use within the European Community)
decided to establish an ad-hoc group with the mandate to ... carry out an
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL analysis of the current of antimicrobial resistance in
animal and man and to draw a distinction as to the status of the phenomenon
in the two groups. Should a trend be detected showing an increase in
resistance development, a risk assessment must be completed to analyse the
situation more fully. This risk assessment will aim to assess the likelihood
of the trend increasing in both animal and man and whether the likelihood of
antimicrobial resistance transfer from animal to man will continue at an
unacceptable rate.
The ad-hoc group held its first meeting in London on Maj 16. During the
meeting the question came up whether anybody has in the past attempted to
tackle the problem using a formal risk assessment approach, i.e. has
attempted to systematically identify all hazards and benefits connected with
the use of antibiotics in foodanimals and subsequently attempted to quantify
the risks, costs, and benefits.
So... I would like to hear from colleagues who are present engaged in-, or
have in the past been engaged in this sort of work, or who are aware of any
information on the subject. I would also appreciate to be contacted by
colleagues who are or have been engaged in the "dynamics" in quantitative
terms of antimicrobial resistance development in relation to different use
patterns of antibacterials, different production systems, different animal
species, and in relation to other variables with a possible association to
antimicrobial resistance development in food animals.
