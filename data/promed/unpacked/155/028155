Disease strikes crops
---------------------
Farmers [in Banke district, Mid Western Region] have lost much of their potato and tomato harvests due to the outbreak of a disease as a result of the cold. According to the District Agriculture Development Office (DAO), the disease has affected potato crops on 280 hectares and about 5 percent of the tomato production in the district. Farmers have planted potato and tomato on 5000 hectares each.

The production of tomato and potato is expected to drop this year [2015] due to the disease. An expected 15 tonnes of potatoes can be produced on a hectare of land. As per DAO, output could go down to 8 tonnes per hectare.

The outbreak of the disease has been blamed on the use of potato seeds not recommended by the government. DAO has urged farmers to use the TPS variety which are said to be resistant to fungi. But the farmers had been using substandard seeds imported from India as they are cheaper compared to the local seeds.

DADO said that farmers could minimize the risk of the disease by using appropriate chemicals [and] doing proper weeding. Farmers who use affected seeds are likely to suffer losses.

[A number of potato and tomato diseases have been reported from the region. However, from the description above and since late blight of potato and tomato (PLB; caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_) is rife in the country and the region, this may be the disease referred to above.

PLB is favoured by cool, moist conditions and can cause 100 percent crop losses. It can destroy a crop within a few days. It is spread by plant material, mechanical means, wind and water. Uncertified or farm saved potato seed tubers and tomato seed (or transplants) are known to pose a significant risk of spreading the pathogen (for example in India, ProMED-mail post 20101015.3738). Disease management may include removal of pathogen reservoirs (including weeds, as mentioned above), crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops. Certification schemes for planting material have been set up in many countries and are vital to control outbreaks. (For more information on PLB see links below and previous posts in the archives).
