DPR Korea: Measles Epidemic Information Bulletin No. 1
-----------------------------------------------
This Bulletin is being issued for information only and reflects the
situation and the information available at this time.
Summary
-------
Since November 2006, some 3000 people in 30 counties throughout the
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) have been diagnosed with
measles virus infection. To date, there have been 4 reported deaths,
when on 4 Jan 2007, 2 children and 2 adults died from the illness and
its complications, like pneumonia. Local health facilities throughout
the country are continuing to provide treatment to 1013 patients.
Confirmation of measles came from the country's Ministry of Public
Health (MOPH) on 15 Feb 2007, and information was shared at a joint
meeting attended by representatives from the International
Federation, the DPRK Red Cross Society, the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on 16 Feb 2007,
which is also a public holiday in the DPRK. A mass vaccination
campaign is currently underway.
The Situation
-------------
Since November 2006, some 3000 people in 30 counties throughout the
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) have been diagnosed as
cases of measles. To date, there have been 4 reported deaths, when on
4 Jan 2007, 2 children and 2 adults died from the illness and its
pneumonia-like complications. Measles is caused by a virus and is a
highly contagious respiratory infection. Patients with measles often
suffer from a whole body skin rash and flu-like symptoms, which may
lead to more serious health conditions. Local health facilities
throughout the country are continuing to provide treatment to 1013
patients. Confirmation of measles infection came from the country's
Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) on 15 Feb 2007, and information was
shared at a joint meeting attended by representatives from the
International Federation, the DPRK Red Cross Society, the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) on 16 Feb 2007, which is also a public holiday in the DPRK.
A mass vaccination campaign is currently underway.
Indications of the disease were 1st reported in Ryanggang province's
Pujon ri, Kimhyongjik county in November 2006. The disease was
initially diagnosed as rubella [German measles], based upon the
clinical symptoms of the patients who were 1st identified as having
the disease on 6 Nov 2006 in Pujon ri and some northern areas
including Ryanggang province. As the disease could not be contained
within these areas, it has subsequently spread throughout the
country. According to the MOPH, confirmation of measles virus
infection could only be made on 15 Feb 2007.
Following indications of an epidemic, on 26 Jan 2007 the WHO supplied
the MOPH with testing kits for further investigations into the
possibility of an epidemic. 77 out of 84 samples confirmed the
presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against measles virus.
The process of confirming measles cases faced constraints, as the
disease was thought to have been eradicated from the country in 1992,
and there was an absence of recent cases. The national expanded
program on immunization (EPI) program manager further added that the
country's health care workers are not familiar with this disease due
to its 15 year absence, complicated by the cases' atypical symptoms
and different virus genotype [H1, a genotype previously recorded in
China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia and Viet Nam. - Mod.CP].
Red Cross and Red Crescent Action
---------------------------------
The continued presence of measles is accompanied by a risk of
increasing cases and the further spread of the illness to other parts
of the country. The MOPH has put forward a request to the
International Federation, UNICEF, and the WHO for 5 million doses of
the measles vaccine to immunize people from 7-45 years of age.
Children below the age of 7 are already vaccinated against measles
through routine immunization. Following recommendations from UNICEF,
it was suggested that immunization be aimed at for all people up to
the ages of 39 years (including all infants and toddlers), which will
increase the size of the target group to 12-13 million people.
The MOPH expressed its desire to start this campaign as soon as
possible. It was agreed that UNICEF will take the lead on the
planning and costing of the proposed nationwide measles immunization
campaign and will inform all the stakeholders of the details. It was
also agreed that vitamin A drops will be administered with the
measles vaccines if resources are available, but priority will remain
to measles immunization.
An initial rough estimate has placed the cost of 5 million doses with
disposable syringes at USD 1.5 million. This estimated cost excludes
the costs for transportation, distribution and training of staff,
which would be covered by the MOPH.
Following UNICEF's suggestion, the MOPH will mobilize their EPI stock
of measles vaccines to begin immunizing people in areas at high risk.
UNICEF agreed to look into the availability of vaccines, make cost
calculations and draft a plan of action. The WHO and the Federation
agreed to contact their respective headquarters and back donors for
consultation and support.
The Federation and the DPRK Red Cross have in place a system for the
supply of drugs and medical materials to 2000 health institutions in
more then 60 out of 160 (accessible) counties in DPRK as part of the
national society's annual activities. This complements the national
health system, contributing towards fulfilling the basic health needs
of the country's populace.

[The decision to vaccinate all individuals less than 40 years old,
suggests that the age distribution of cases includes this population,
probably coinciding with the year of introduction of measles vaccine
into routine vaccination activities within the country. As mentioned
in the previous posting, according to the WHO website on vaccination
activities, North Korea has been reporting on single doses of measles
vaccine administered and now may be seeing many cases in individuals
with a history of adequate vaccination according to their schedule.
The decision to vaccinate all individuals suggests a goal of
providing 2nd doses of the measles vaccine to the population defined
as at risk, a significant undertaking, but given the high vaccination
coverages reported in the past 10+ years, the population is well
sensitized to the need for vaccinations and most likely will respond
positively to the vaccination campaign. - Mod.MPP]
