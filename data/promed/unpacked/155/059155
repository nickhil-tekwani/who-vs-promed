As of 7 May 2013 (11:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission, China notified WHO of an additional 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The 1st patient is a 69-year-old man from Fujian province who became ill on 29 Apr 2013, and the 2nd patient is a 9-year-old boy, also from Fujian province, who became ill on 26 Apr 2013.

Additionally, 5 patients reported earlier have died.

To date, a total of 130 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus including 31 deaths have been reported to WHO. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. The authorities in the affected locations continue to implement prevention and control measures.

Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

[2] 131st case

A 79-year-old woman from China's Jiangxi province has been hospitalized with H7N9 avian flu, moving the outbreak total to 131 cases, including 31 deaths. Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP), which cites China's National Health and Family Planning Commission, said in a statement today [7 May 2013] that the woman is in stable condition and that none of her 11 close contacts have shown symptoms so far. A translated report from the Jiangxi provincial health department posted on the FluTrackers infectious disease message board said the woman is a farmer who had free-range poultry such as chickens and ducks at her residence.

The World Health Organization (WHO) posted an update on the H7N9 outbreak today [7 May 2013, posted above], and though it didn't include the new case from Jiangxi province, it had a few more details about 2 other recently confirmed case-patients from Fujian province. One is a 69-year-old man who got sick on 29 Apr 2013, and the other is a 9-year-old boy who became ill on 26 Apr 2013. According to earlier CHP reports, the man is hospitalized, and the boy has been released.

The WHO said contacts of confirmed cases are being closely monitored, but so far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.
