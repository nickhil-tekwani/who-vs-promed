On 24 Jul 2007 a pregnant ewe was found dead, the Navy kit was
positive and the culture also.
The ewe was part of a herd of animals belonging to the
Establecimiento Los Olmos, which belongs to the zone of Isorriesgo
No. 5 of the Program of Alert and Response of the Partido de Azul [In
that area 25 animals died - Mod.MHJ] during the outbreaks occuring
during the months March 2006 to May 2006.
The cattle are on a vaccination plan every 120 days with Sterne
strain and there were no deaths to date.

[Analysis of the outbreaks over 4 decades in the Prov. Buenos Aires
has shown that there is a distinct tendency for them to recur in
relation to specific shallow streams carrying rain runoff. This is an
extraordinarily flat region of excellent grazing with cattle at high
densities. If you stand in the bed of a pickup you can see thousands
of cattle in any direction with great conformation and the nature of
friendly puppies. When I visited the region recently I asked an
estanciero (farmer) how many gauchos he needed to work his cattle
through the shute. "Just myself," he said sounding as if I had asked
a stupid question, which to them it was. I later watched him move 10
working bulls without problems from one field to another on his
horse, walking, with his 2 dogs that frankly were more canine company
than effective working cattledogs. As someone more used nowadays to
murderous Brahma-cross cows it was extraordinary.
There is an active programme to control anthrax in this province and
encourage annual vaccination, specifically in the region around Azul,
which is succeeding slowly. As the Argentine Pampas are traditionally
treeless -- trees have been introduced into urban areas and are found
around some estancia (farm) buildings -- it is not possible to burn
carcasses. Instead the unopened carcass is covered with lime and a
heavy tarpaulin, and left to decompose. After 9 months the bones are
recovered and the lime removed. Occasionally a fox will get at a
carcass and the damage has to be dealt with. It is not an
epidemiologically optimum system for dealing with carcasses but under
the circumstances it is cost effective and better than burying them.
If a carcass is left unopened, i.e., no necropsy and scavengers are
kept away, the interior pH falls rapidly as decomposition occurs, and
within a few days this acid environment is lethal to the vegetative
organism. And thus there is minimal sporulation. - Mod.MHJ]
