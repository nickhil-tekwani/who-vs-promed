[Bill Barton, state veterinarian for the Idaho Department of Agriculture, says a case of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus has been found on an Idaho hog farm]. The farm has been quarantined and the state is working with the farmer to eliminate the virus and prevent its spread, he said.

[Barton] said the virus was diagnosed the week of 10 Feb 2014. Most hog production takes place in southern Idaho, he said, declining to name the specific location. The attending veterinarian on the farm is working closely with the producer to determine the source of the virus and eliminate it from the herd and prevent its introduction on other farms. The veterinarian has put the farm under quarantine. Barton declined to give the number of hogs on the farm, saying it was producer information he cannot disclose. "We always recommend pork producers practice excellent biosecurity measures," Barton said.

The disease was first confirmed in the United States in May 2013. Since then, it has spread through many Midwestern states, Barton said. "We still have a lot to learn about the disease and its roots of transmission," he said. "We do know the most common source is infected feces from pigs, trucks, boots, clothing."

The department is working with the producer and attending veterinarian and industry to complete the plan to eliminate the infection and make sure it does not leave the premises, Barton said.

[This virus likes the cold and even southern portions of Idaho are cold right now. The virus seems to survive in feces, in trucks, in a number of places, and stringent decontamination is required to avoid transporting the virus.

Likewise, one has to wonder if the feed came from Canada as they are investigating swine plasma from infected pigs having been used as an ingredient in feed pellets.
