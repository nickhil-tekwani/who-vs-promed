Montana sheep suspected of bluetongue outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
The Montana Department of Livestock announced today that sheep
producers in Musselshell County are not allowed to transport sheep
anywhere within or beyond county lines for the next 30 days because
of a recent possible outbreak of bluetongue. State veterinarian Dr.
Marty Zaluski authorized the hold order today [10 Sep 2007] in an
effort to reduce potential transmission of the virus. According to
the announcement, about 100 sheep in Musselshell County have died
within the past 2 weeks [26 Aug - 8 Sep 2007]. Several initially
tested positive for the virus in a screening test and when whitetail
deer were also tentatively diagnosed, Zaluski decided to protect
other livestock with the hold order.
Confirmation of the test results are expected this week [10-14 Sep
2007]. Bluetongue, epizootic hemorrhagic disease and other diseases
look similar on screening tests so more specific tests are required
before bluetongue can be confirmed. Bluetongue commonly spreads by
biting gnats, especially in late summer and early fall. Zaluski wants
to limit movement of infected sheep so gnats will not have the
opportunity to bite an infected sheep and then bite a healthy sheep,
spreading the disease.
For more than 25 years, the presence of bluetongue viruses in the
U.S. has blocked the export of USA cattle, sheep and goats to many
major world markets. Canada accepts USA cattle, but requires rigorous
testing before -- the animals may cross the border.

Bluetongue is an insect-transmitted, viral disease of sheep, cattle,
goats, and other ruminants, such as white-tailed deer and pronghorn.
It is particularly damaging in sheep; half the sheep in an infected
flock may die. In cattle and goats, however, bluetongue viruses cause
very mild, self-limiting infections with only minor clinical consequences.
A bluetongue virus infection causes inflammation, swelling, and
hemorrhage of the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and tongue.
Inflammation and soreness of the feet also are associated with
bluetongue. In sheep, the tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth
become swollen, hemorrhagic, and may look red or dirty blue in color,
thus giving the disease its name: bluetongue.
The Office International des Epizooties (OIE), the international
animal health standard setting organization, considers bluetongue to
be an OIE List A disease, which means that it has the potential for
rapid spread and has major significance in the international trade arena.
For about 25 years, the presence of bluetongue viruses in the United
States has blocked the export of USA cattle, sheep, and goats to many
major world markets. Currently, these markets include Australia, New
Zealand, and the European Union. Canada accepts USA cattle, but
requires rigorous testing before the animals may cross the border.
Bluetongue was first recognized in South Africa in the late 1800s,
but it was not until the early 1900s that it was described in detail.
The disease was reported in Cyprus in 1943 and subsequently in
Israel, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Pakistan, India, and the United
States during the 1950s.
Bluetongue is a seasonal disease generally observed in the late
summer and early fall in the United States. Virus transmission begins
in the early spring with the onset of insect flight activity and
continues until the first hard frosts.
How it Spreads
Bluetongue viruses are spread from animal to animal by biting gnats.
In the United States, the disease is most prevalent in the southern
and southwestern states. It is almost non-existent in the upper
north-central and northeastern states, where biting flies do not
appear able to transmit the viruses.
Animals cannot directly contract the disease from other animals.
Clinical Signs
The severity of signs in an animal infected with bluetongue viruses
depends on the virus serotype, the infecting dose of virus, and the
age, condition, and resistance of the animal. Bluetongue should be
suspected when a number of sheep or cattle show several of the following signs:
- Depression with heavy breathing or panting;
- High fever;
- Superficial hemorrhages or open sores or vesicles on the tongue,
mouth, or nostrils;
- Redness of the skin, face, neck, and possibly body;
- Lameness accompanied by an engorged red dish-blue area around the
base of the horns and on the coronary bands of the feet;
- Loss of condition and muscular weakness;
- Loss of wool.
Bluetongue disease is not severe in cattle; less than 5 percent of
adult animals usually show signs of disease.
When clinical illness does occur in cattle, it is similar to
bluetongue in sheep, including foot lesions, which could lead to
confusion with foot-and-mouth disease. Bluetongue in cattle also
closely resembles or may be identical to a cattle disease in parts of
the United States known as "myotic stomatitis."
Goats are more resistant to bluetongue viruses than sheep or cattle.
However, some cases of disease in goats with signs resembling those
in sheep have been reported, and bluetongue viruses have been
isolated from goats.
White-tailed deer and pronghorn in the United States are affected
much more severely than cattle and often even more severely than
sheep. In deer and pronghorn, the mortality rate can be extremely
high. Bluetongue signs in white-tailed deer are identical to those
from infection with epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) viruses. Both
bluetongue and EHD virus infections cause a fulminating hemorrhagic
disease and sudden death in white-tailed deer.
Prevention and Control
Livestock owners in areas of the United States affected by bluetongue
viruses can help protect their herds from bluetongue virus infections by:
- Keeping animals indoors at night, especially at dawn, during peak
hours for night-flying insects;
- Keeping flocks or herds away from areas where biting insects are numerous;
- Moving animals to higher altitudes during insect seasons;
- Eliminating breeding areas for biting gnats, which are the primary
vectors and classified in the genus Culicoides;
- Vaccinating sheep with the appropriate vaccine.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Role
The existence of bluetongue in the United States has been an
impediment to moving cattle to Canada, New Zealand, and the European
Union, which are classified by the OIE as being free of bluetongue;
parts of Australia have been regionalized as bluetongue-free.
In an effort to gain USA producers greater access to Canadian
markets, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
has engaged in a number of activities.
In FY 2002, APHIS' Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health
conducted a bluetongue surveillance pilot project in collaboration
with three states and USDA's Agricultural Research Service. Up to 65
cattle in each of 120 herds in North Dakota, South Dakota, and
Nebraska were bled twice, during a 2-year study, to detect antibodies
to bluetongue viruses. During the summer of 2002, traps were set on
27 farms in North and South Dakota to collect Culicoides, a biting
gnat that transmits the viruses. The farms were selected based on
prior vector trapping experiences in the three states.
Very few animals in North Dakota were positive for bluetongue virus
antibodies. The distribution of Culicoides sonorensis, the primary
U.S. vector of bluetongue viruses, was limited to Nebraska and the
southwest parts of South and North Dakota, similar to the
distribution found in 2001.
APHIS also supported related bluetongue studies in a joint
Montana-Alberta (Canada)-USDA project testing for the prevalence of
bluetongue virus antibodies to evaluate the prevalence of virus
exposure in selected States.
What the U.S. Livestock Owner Can Do
Livestock owners are the 1st line of defense against the introduction
of new serotypes of bluetongue virus and the spread of existing
virus. To help prevent any such introduction and to help control and
eliminate bluetongue in the United States, livestock owners should
inspect their flocks and herds frequently for suspicious signs and
report any such conditions to their local veterinarian or to state or
federal animal health officials.
