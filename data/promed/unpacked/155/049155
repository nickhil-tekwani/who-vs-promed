ACR Health, which runs a clinic here [Canton, New York State], now offers free syphilis tests in the wake of what it describes as "escalating rates of syphilis statewide."

The Syphilis Health Check rapid test is a finger prick test that shows results in 10 minutes. If positive, the test is confirmed by a blood draw. ACR Health was approved to administer syphilis screenings following a significant increase in the number of cases in New York State.

Cases are mainly seen among males, especially gay men and men who have sex with men, ACR Health said. The agency says having unprotected sex, multiple sex partners, or a new sex partner can all increase the risk of syphilis infection, as well as other STDs and HIV.

Syphilis symptoms include a large painless sore at the infection site (usually genitals, and can also be around the rectum, mouth, or other areas) and a rash, usually on the hands and feet. These symptoms will go away on their own, but the infection is still in the body, ACR Health said. Syphilis increases the risk of getting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, if exposed. Syphilis is easy to transmit, and many people don't have symptoms, ACR Health said.

Using condoms does reduce the risk of infection. Strategies to prevent HIV [infection] (PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] and serosorting) do not protect against syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, ACR Health said.

ACR Health provides free and confidential testing services for syphilis, hepatitis C, HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia at 4 of our offices and at other designated locations in the community every month. Drop in testing is available in Canton during business hours, 8:30 am to 4:30 pm, on weekdays. Appointments are preferred: (800)475-2430 or <testing@ACRHealth.org>.

[Incidence rates of primary and secondary of syphilis reported annually in the United States declined dramatically in the 1940s to reach a low in 2000. After 2000, syphilis rates rebounded and continued to increase during 2005-2013, except for a brief plateau during 2009-2010 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6318a4.htm). Increases have occurred primarily among men, and particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). In the US in 2013, 75 percent of primary and secondary syphilis cases occur in MSM. This has been attributed to a variety of reasons that promote unprotected sex, such as engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own in an attempt to avoid using condoms (serosorting), taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs," multiple anonymous sex partners, use of smartphone apps that facilitate anonymous "hookups," etc.

More information on the specific situation in Canton, NY from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

The finger stick test referred to in the news report above may be the test ProMED-mail recently posted (ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA: rapid point-of-care test 20150112.3085761). It is a rapid (10 minutes) blood test for the detection of antibodies against _Treponema pallidum_ (the bacterium that causes syphilis) at the point-of-care (such as, doctors' offices, sexually transmitted diseases clinics), using finger stick blood samples. All positive tests should be followed up with further syphilis serological laboratory testing and clinical evaluation before final diagnosis (http://www.trinitybiotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Syphilis-Health-Check-Brochure.pdf). The test may be negative during the 1st few weeks of infection with _T. pallidum_.

ACR Health is a not-for-profit, community-based organization providing support services to individuals with chronic diseases, including HIV/AIDS in upstate New York (http://www.acrhealth.org/about/who-we-are).
