A Glacier National Park resident is undergoing rabies vaccinations after being scratched by a rabid bat.

In a press release, GNP officials said last Thursday [22 Aug 2019] that the Glacier County Health Department confirmed that a bat that scratched a park resident in the St. Mary area was rabid. The person is currently undergoing a series of rabies vaccinations. This was the 1st known case of a rabid bat in Glacier National Park this year [2019].

Health officials said typically rabies does not cause large outbreaks in bat colonies and tends to be limited to a small number of individuals. Less than one percent of bats have rabies.

Glacier National Park joined partner county health agencies and National Park Service wildlife veterinarians in urging people to become aware of rabies risks in bats and skunks.

If a bat or skunk has had human contact, it's vital to safely capture the animal and submit it for rabies testing. Without testing, it is impossible to tell whether the animal is carrying rabies, and the exposed person should undergo a preventative series of rabies vaccinations for humans. There is no cure for rabies once a human contracts it.

People can take additional precautions by properly screening homes and seasonal cabins. Historic buildings with gaps, outbuildings, and other structures that are routinely left open are particularly susceptible to bats.

"Rabies is not something that most people think about on a regular basis," said Glacier National Park Superintendent Jeff Mow. "However, if you come into physical contact with a bat, it's important to know that there are resources available to you and testing procedures you must follow to protect your health and that of your family."

While bats do pose a small rabies risk in humans, they also play an important role in area ecosystems, eating a number of nighttime insects, including agricultural pests.

Living sustainably alongside bats can often be accomplished with the right tools and timing of mitigation measures. Most of the bat roosts in the St. Mary park area are maternity roosts, and due to time of year, pups still cannot fly. Therefore, the park will seal any indoor roost spaces it discovers after bats have left in September.

This is a vulnerable population at a sensitive time of year. Little brown bats have been significantly impacted by white-nose syndrome in other parts of the country. Since bats typically only have one pup per year, survival of that pup is important for sustaining the population. White-nose syndrome is not yet in Montana, but it continues to spread across the country.

Public health and human safety are always the priority. The park also strives to protect the health of bats.

Taking responsible measures to exclude bats from buildings whenever possible and seeking testing and/or treatment following an exposure are important steps to take when living alongside this species. Bat exclusion is an ongoing task in park buildings, many of which are older and are vacant for a significant portion of the year.

People exposed to a bat or skunk should be aware of testing protocols [see: flatheadhealth.org] and call their county health department immediately for specific instructions.

In order to test a bat or a skunk for rabies, the brain/head must be intact and must be refrigerated until sent for testing (do not freeze).

Caldwell County went 3 years without a confirmed case of rabies, but now it has had 2 just 2 weeks apart.

Caldwell County Animal Control was notified Friday [23 Aug 2019] by the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health that a bat found in a house in Colletsville tested positive for rabies, a potentially fatal virus that attacks the central nervous system of warm-blooded animals.

On 9 Aug 2019, the state lab notified the county that a fox found in the Green Mountain Park area tested positive for rabies, which was the 1st confirmed case of rabies in Caldwell County since 2016, according to state records.

Human cases of rabies are rare; in North Carolina, there has been just one case since 1955, which was in Jones County in eastern North Carolina in 2011, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

Humans contract the disease only by coming in contact with the saliva, tears, or brain or nervous system tissue of an infected animal, such as by being bitten, handling a pet that has been attacked, or cleaning an animal killed while hunting.

However, the disease must be treated early. If you are uncertain, report the contact so a health care provider can evaluate whether treatment is needed.

In North Carolina, rabies is most often found in raccoons, accounting for almost half of all confirmed cases, but it also is commonly found in skunks, foxes, coyotes, wolves, groundhogs, beavers and bats. In 2018, rabies cases in North Carolina involved 142 raccoons, 55 foxes, 24 bats, 56 skunks, 13 cats and 3 dogs.

In 2016, Caldwell had 4 confirmed cases of rabies, involving one dog, 2 raccoons and a skunk, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

Catawba County has had the most cases of rabies in this region in recent years. It had 14 cases confirmed in 2018 and has had 6 so far in 2019, according to state records.

Wilkes County had 4 cases in 2018 and has had 6 this year [2019]; Burke County had 4 in 2018 but none so far this year; Alexander County had 3 in 2018 but none this year; and Watauga County had 2 in 2018 and none this year.

Because rabies is fatal and can also be transmitted to people, vaccination of dogs and cats against rabies is required by state law.

[For information on bats as reservoirs of rabies in the USA, go to https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/bats.html.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus.

Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, as infections that are almost always fatal unless treated. Also, of course, a dog, cat or ferret infected with a bat rabies virus can then infect a human. - Mod.PMB
