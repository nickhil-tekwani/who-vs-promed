Gravely ill, [the patient] lost parts of his arms and legs, as well as the skin of his nose and part of his upper lip. The cause was _Capnocytophaga_, a germ from [his dog] Ellie's mouth or from another dog he encountered.

_Capnocytophaga_ is commonly found in the saliva of cats and dogs and almost never leads to people getting sick, unless the person has a compromised immune system. But [the patient] was perfectly healthy. In fact, he doesn't think he'd ever used his health insurance before he fell ill. The case is extremely rare, and doctors at his hospital, Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin, had no explanation for his illness. But over the last 10 years, there have been at least 5 other healthy people who have had severe reactions to the germ. A team of researchers connected with Harvard Medical School has developed a theory on why -- a gene change in all the victims. And their finding means doctors can't rule out the _Capnocytophaga_ bacteria could strike [the patient] and other victims again.

[The patient] thought he was getting the flu in June 2018. He had a fever, vomiting and diarrhea. But when he started getting confused, his family took him to the hospital. Doctors did blood cultures and found _Capnocytophaga_, which caused sepsis, a severe blood infection that led to his blood pressure dropping and many of his organs shutting down. "Do what you have to," he told the doctors. And so he persisted, through more than 20 surgeries, including amputations of his left and right arms just below the elbow, and legs through the middle of the knee.

Meanwhile, researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, connected to Harvard Medical School, as well as Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center had been investigating cases like his. The team has done genetic testing on 5 otherwise healthy people who suffered _Capnocytophaga_ infections to see if they could find anything in common. They discovered all had a gene connected to the immune system that was working differently -- a genetic variant.

"It was a really thrilling moment," said Elizabeth Fieg, a genetic counselor at Brigham and Women's Hospital. "The stakes are so high with these cases and the patients have gone through so much." They believe it makes those people more susceptible to developing severe medical problems from _Capnocytophaga_. But they are also trying to determine if there are other risk factors. Of the 5 in the study, 3 survived with amputations and 2 did not. Fieg hopes their research can determine why some did not survive. She also hopes if their theory is confirmed, it will help diagnose cases faster, and perhaps save lives and limbs. Researchers need to gather more evidence, but hope to publish their study in the next year to 18 months.

The results of [the patient]'s genetic tests are expected in 3 to 4 months. Fieg said people with the gene variant are at increased risk for recurrent _Capnocytophaga_ or other infections in the future. While [the patient] doesn't like the sound of that, he said Ellie has accidentally scratched him since he's been home and even licked his mouth. He's been fine. And even if he does have the gene variant, he said, it changes nothing. "We didn't even bother testing her," said [the patient]. "We weren't going to get rid of her if it was her that caused it anyway. We just love her to death."

[_Capnocytophaga canimorsus_, a gram-negative bacillus (rod-shaped) previously classified as CDC Group Dysgonic Fermenter-2 (DF-2), is a slow-growing bacterium that requires carbon dioxide for growth. This organism has been isolated from the saliva of healthy dogs and cats as a component of the normal flora. _C. canimorsus_ has been detected in 76 of 109 dogs (69.7%) and 57 of 104 cats (54.8%) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745627).

In most (77%) human cases, infection with this organism is preceded by a bite or other exposure to dogs; since 1961, 200 human isolates of _C. canimorsus_ have been sent to the CDC for identification (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019514.htm). Whole genome sequencing of _C. canimorsus_ strains from severe human infections or healthy dogs suggested that only a subset of _C. canimorsus_ is dangerous for humans (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4576167/).

Other _Capnocytophaga_ species are recognized as part of the human oral microbiota (https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/ijsem/58/2/324.pdf?expires=1569682974&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=94EDA63B806A1AE24105A4E012891CCD).

_C. canimorsus_ causes self-limiting cellulitis following a dog or cat bite that can progress rapidly to fulminant sepsis, septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with a case fatality rate of 25%. Gangrene of the extremities, as well as gangrene of skin, the tip of the nose and ears can be a consequence of sepsis, septic shock and DIC. Most fatal infections have occurred in persons with a history of asplenia [absence of normal spleen function], alcoholism, or hematologic malignancy, but has also been described in seemingly healthy persons.

This organism is susceptible to many antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, cefoxitin, and clindamycin). Empiric antibiotic treatment has been recommended for this bacterium following an animal bite in high-risk patient populations.

The patient in the news report above, a seemingly healthy individual who developed life-threatening fulminant sepsis due to _C. canimorsus_, is likely the same patient presented in the news report posted by ProMED-mail in August 2018 (Capnocytophaga infection - USA: (WI) quadruple amputation 20180805.5946644). What is new here is that a genetic mutation has been found in these healthy people that predisposes them to severe and perhaps recurrent _Capnocytophaga_ infection. - Mod.ML
