Two children have died and dozens of cases of hepatitis have been recorded in the Al-Riqama village [Homs governorate] in Syria (28 km -- approx. 17 mi -- east of Homs city) in central Syria because of using water from contaminated wells after the municipality stopped pumping water to the village.

Smart News learned from a local source in the village on [Tue 31 Oct 2017] that the lack of sewage network had led to leakage of sewage to the water wells used by the people, which caused contamination of water. The source pointed out that the epidemic hit the livestock in the village as well.

The residents of Al-Riqama village had informed the village's mayor, Hussein Hamadi, about 5 months ago of the risks of the outbreak. However, lack of budget halted pumping drinking water or rehabilitating the sewage network in the village.

[The illnesses in this cluster are, as yet, undefined. In the usual circumstances, hepatitis A in children tends to be mild, often totally without symptoms. In war torn Syria, however, with malnutrition and other stressors, increased morbidity and even mortality can occur. It is also possible that an alternative etiology is present, including non viral infections as well as toxins.
