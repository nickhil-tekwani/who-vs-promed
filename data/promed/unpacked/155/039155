Ghana on Friday [16 Sep 2022] declared the end of the Marburg virus disease outbreak, a haemorrhagic fever almost as deadly as Ebola, 2 months after recording 3 cases, 2 of them fatal, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced.

"Ghana's Ministry of Health has declared the end of the epidemic after no cases were recorded for 42 days," the WHO announced in a statement.

"Although the country has no experience with the virus, Ghana's response has been swift and robust," Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, was quoted as saying in the statement.

This was the 1st time the haemorrhagic fever had been detected in Ghana, which has confirmed a total of 3 cases, 2 of them fatal, in the outbreak, which was declared on [7 Jul 2022].

"Marburg is a scary disease because it is highly infectious and deadly. There is no vaccine or antiviral treatment. Any outbreak of Marburg is a major concern," Moeti added.

The Marburg virus disease is transmitted to humans by fruit bats and is spread in humans through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected persons, or surfaces and materials.

WHO announced the end of the 1st Marburg virus outbreak in West Africa in September 2021, 42 days after a single case was identified in Guinea.

Sporadic outbreaks and cases had previously been reported elsewhere in Africa, including Angola, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The onset of the disease is sudden, with high fever, severe headache and eventual malaise. Case fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% in previous outbreaks, depending on the virus strain and case management, according to the WHO.

Although there are no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments for the virus, oral or intravenous rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival rates.

[This small, 3 case outbreak of Marburg virus occurred in an unfortunate family as a cluster of 3 cases, with 2 deaths. As with Ebola virus outbreaks, interfamily transmission is a risk especially as in the Ghana situation where Marburg virus is new and likely not known to the populace. Information received from Ghana suggested there were around 180 contacts that were followed up on and timely tracing by WHO teams made sure that none were missed. No further cases occurred.

As noted above and in the previous post, this is not the 1st time that Marburg virus has been found in West Africa. Last year (2021) there were 2 confirmed cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Gueckedou, the Republic of Guinea. Although these were the first confirmed human infections with this virus in West Africa, the virus was found previously in neighboring Sierra Leone in 5 Egyptian rousette, or fruit bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) (see Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone: bat 20200125.6916732 and Amman BR, Bird H, Bakarr IA, et al. Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 510; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8).

Tests for Marburg virus infections should be included among those for hemorrhagic diseases that are endemic in West Africa for timely and accurate differential diagnosis. - Mod.TY
