The Pennsylvania Department of Health, along with federal health officials, report investigating multiple clusters of non-respiratory _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex (Bcc) infections associated with ultrasound gel produced by Eco-Med Pharmaceuticals Inc.

To date, a total of 65 positive Bcc cultures from 14 facilities located in Philadelphia (7), Montgomery (2), Dauphin (2), Allegheny (1), Bucks (1), and Chester (1) counties have been identified.

The positive Bcc cultures were obtained from the following sources: blood (55), sputum (4), abdominal fluid/drainage (2), wound (1), amniotic fluid (1), peritoneal fluid (1), and bile (1). No patients in these heterogenous clusters are known to have cystic fibrosis.

On 18 Aug 2021, the FDA issued updated information regarding Eco-Med ultrasound gels and lotions, expanding the limited voluntary recall issued on 4 Aug 2021 to now include all ultrasound gels and lotions manufactured by Eco-Med Pharmaceutical, Inc. The FDA is asking all healthcare providers and healthcare facilities to immediately stop using and discard all Eco-Med manufactured ultrasound gels and lotions due to the concern for contamination with _Burkholderia cepacian_ complex bacteria.

According to the CDC, _Burkholderia cepacia_ (also called _B. cepacia_) is the name for a group or "complex" of bacteria that can be found in soil and water. _B. cepacia_ bacteria are often resistant to common antibiotics.

_B. cepacia_ poses little medical risk to healthy people. However, people who have certain health problems like weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis, may be more susceptible to infections with _B. cepacia_. _B cepacia_ is a known cause of infections in hospitalized patients.

[_Burkholderia cepacia_ complex (BCC) is a group of related, non-lactose fermenting, Gram-negative bacterial species, formerly classified as _Pseudomonas cepacia_, that, in individuals with impaired host defenses, is pathogenic and can cause life-threatening infections (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16217180). BCC infections include respiratory tract infections, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis, bacteremia in the presence of an infected indwelling intravascular catheter or contaminated intravenous fluids, skin and soft-tissue infections, surgical-wound infections, and urinary tract infections (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/outbreak-of-burkholderia-cepacia-bacteremia-caused-by-contaminated-chlorhexidine-in-a-hemodialysis-unit/85154B587466D8DD5BFC9F9971CDF95E and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272638600701636). In one of these outbreaks in a hemodialysis center, BCC infection was due to contaminated water used to dilute the chlorhexidine solution that was used for disinfection of skin prior to catheter insertion and during follow-up care.

BCC is resistant to many antiseptics and disinfectants and can contaminate antiseptic solutions, such as quaternary ammonium salts, chlorhexidine, and iodine products, and is known to survive in these antiseptics and disinfectants (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25794566). Biofilm formation is thought to be one of the factors that accounts for the survival of BCC in chlorhexidine (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3088199/).

BCC is also usually resistant to aminoglycosides, 1st- and 2nd-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin and ticarcillin, and polymyxin B (http://www.antimicrobe.org/b19.asp). BCC is often susceptible to trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, and minocycline, and has varying susceptibility to tigecycline and fluoroquinolones. - Mod.ML
