Update on avian influenza as of 12 Feb 2004
-------------------------------------------
Since the last EID update on 5 Feb 2004, 4 new human cases of avian
influenza have been confirmed in Viet Nam, out of whom 3 have died, and 1
more in Thailand who is still alive. To date, 2 countries have reported
human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection (Viet Nam and
Thailand), with a total of 25 people affected, 6 of whom are still alive
[27 laboratory confirmed cases and 20 deaths as of Sat 14 Feb 2004. - Mod.CP].
The scaling up of surveillance for the early detection of new cases, along
with the availability of detailed information on current cases, are both
essential in order to evaluate the pandemic potential of avian influenza
virus H5N1. To this end, WHO has published its Guidelines for Global
Surveillance of Influenza A/H5 as well as its Preliminary Clinical and
Epidemiological Description of Influenza A (H5N1) in Viet Nam.
According to the WHO update of 11 Feb 2004 on possible person-to-person
transmission, the results of the study carried out on the virus isolated
from the 23 year old person belonging to the group of cases from one
Vietnamese family, indicate that the genetic material in this case is of
avian origin and does not contain any of the genes from the human influenza
virus. Several countries experiencing poultry outbreaks have weak health
infrastructures as well as a low capacity for case diagnosis and detection,
particularly in rural areas where the majority of domestic birds are
raised. Moreover, the full clinical spectrum of H5N1 illness is unknown.
Milder cases of illness could be occurring yet fail to come to the
attention of health-care staff. For this reason, the current number of
laboratory-confirmed cases cannot be taken as an accurate indication of the
magnitude of the disease nor of its potential threat to human health.
Of the 10 countries that have reported outbreaks of avian flu in birds, 4
have documented widespread epizootics. This week, China reported a new
outbreak to WHO. No detailed plan has yet been formulated to control
influenza in animals and thereby reduce the risk to the human population.
Over the past 4 decades, only 18 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian flu
have been reported throughout the world, most of them caused by the
different H5N1 strains. Previous outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian
influenza associated with human infections occurred in areas such as Hong
Kong and The Netherlands, with industrial poultry production and
well-developed health and agricultural infrastructures. Both outbreaks were
eventually controlled through the immediate culling of infected flocks,
quarantining and disinfecting farms, strict biosecurity, restrictions on
the movement of animals, and compensation for farmers.
Given the present situation, controlling the outbreaks of highly pathogenic
avian influenza is especially difficult. Rural areas in several countries
have been affected, in places where raising domestic birds is a common
practice. Therefore, H5N1 virus could become established in bird
populations in this geographical region, making it possible for it to
spread to other parts of the world. Existing evidence available does not
provide enough information on which to base any universal recommendations
that could be applied to ensure rapid and effective response in the
affected countries. Therefore, any control measures taken should be
tailored to each countrys unique epidemiological situation and unique
capacity, with the health and agricultural sectors working together. The
agricultural authorities are faced with the immediate challenge of rapidly
eliminating the H5N1 poultry reservoir. The authorities from all the
affected countries need to work in a coordinated manner.

Feb 2004)" in a tabulated form that cannot be reproduced here. Readers are

Progress in H5N1 Human Vaccine Development
------------------------------------------
This communication is an update on the development of a human vaccine
against H5 avian influenza virus. The National Institute for Biological
Standards and Control (NIBSC) has generated a reassortant candidate vaccine
strain containing the HA and NA of a human H5N1 influenza virus isolated
recently in southeast Asia (A/Vietnam/1194/04). This was achieved by
reverse genetics. During the rescue process, the HA was modified to remove
a well-recognised pathogenic characteristic (a stretch of basic amino acid
residues at the HA cleavage site) from the HA segment to make the virus
safe for vaccine manufacturers and to allow the virus to grow to high
titres in eggs. The other 6 viral genome segments were supplied by the
laboratory virus A/PR8/34. This candidate strain is now undergoing safety
and antigenic characterisation tests. These should be complete within about
2 months, at which time the candidate strain can be released to vaccine
manufacturers. These viruses are derived and will be made available at no
charge to industry and specialist research centres to support pandemic
influenza vaccine R&D on behalf of the WHO. H5 candidate human vaccine
strains were generated in 2003 by St Jude Children's Research Hospital,
Memphis, USA and by ourselves at NIBSC. However, the H5 strains currently
causing disease in South East Asia are recognised poorly by antiserum
generated against 2003's H5 vaccine strains, and so it was necessary to
re-derive new reference viruses.

[A reassortant virus with the H5 and N1 antigens of the highly pathogenic
avian virus and remaining genes from a standard laboratory strain should
exhibit reduced egg lethality. Such a virus can be expected to grow to high
titre in embryonated eggs. After purification it will be a suitable
substrate for preparation of an inactivated vaccine. Consequently, the use
of reverse genetics in production of the appropriate reassortant virus
should not introduce any additional regulatory hurdles which might delay
its use in human populations. - Mod.CP]
