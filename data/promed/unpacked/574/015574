New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: (Ilut) Ilut, Kineret, Hazafon
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Feb 2009
Outbreak status: Resolved (12 Feb 2009)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Goats / 1 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Sheep / 26 / 3 / 0 / 26 / 0

Affected population:
Symptoms were detected in a herd of 10 ewes, 3 rams, 13 lambs and one
goat (male). Four of them were affected with limping and vesicles on
the feet. All the herd has been destroyed and buried on spot [see commentary].

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or
inconclusive; Fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.)

Epidemiological comments:
A radius of 10 km around the farms has been put under movement
control of animals. The status of vaccination of all the ruminants in
this radius has been evaluated, and animals were revaccinated when
necessary. The serotype was found to be O, which is the only serotype
that could be found in the outbreaks which occurred in the last 20
years in Israel.

Control measures
Measures applied
- Quarantine
- Movement control inside the country
- Screening
- Vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)
- Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
- Modified stamping out [see comment]
- No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Virology Department, Kimron Veterinary
Institute (National laboratory)

[According to the information available in OIE's WAHID animal health
interface (which was inaugurated in 2005), FMD was notified by Israel
in 2005 (1 outbreak), 2007 (31 outbreaks) 2008 (1 outbreak) and 2009
(2 outbreaks so far). All those outbreaks were caused by FMDV
serotype O (for the topotype and strains, see
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/isr.htm>).
The 33 outbreaks reported during 2005-2008 included a total of 11 128
cattle, 2547 small ruminants (sheep and goats) and about 1300
wildlife (gazelles), of which -- respectively -- 863, 652 and 69 were
clinically affected, and 25, 288 and 28 died. Throughout the said
period, no culling or slaughtering of affected or exposed animals
were applied, excluding one single gazelle in 2007 (see posting
20070324.1025). It is thus rather surprising that, according to the
current follow-up report, the entire affected flock, comprising 27
small ruminants, has been stamped out, though the virus seems to be
similar to the one affecting Israel in previous years and in the 1st
outbreak in cattle during 2009 (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7776>).
An explanation concerning the background of this decision will be helpful.

It is also interesting to note whether possible contact, direct or
indirect, between the 2 affected holdings may have taken place,
leading to the spread. The distance between the 2 foci is
approximately 55 km. Maps are included in the follow-up reports.

FMD seems to be spreading in the region recently; outbreaks in Saudi
Arabia and Iraq have been discussed in previous postings.

FMD has recently been suspected or confirmed in 3 additional Middle
Eastern countries, namely Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, though
serotyping has not been available in all cases. On Mon 16 Feb 2009,
the Saudi daily Al-Watan reported that AlAhsaa county's local
veterinary diagnostic laboratory detected and confirmed 9 FMD
positive submitted samples collected from several cattle herds across
the county (translated from Arabic and summarized by the
California-based FMD News at Davis; see
<http://www.alwatan.com.sa/news/newsdetail.asp?issueno=3062&id=90574&groupID=0>).

It will be interesting to obtain their final observations as well as
information from other countries in the region, such as Iran, Syria,
Lebanon and Turkey. - Mod.AS]
