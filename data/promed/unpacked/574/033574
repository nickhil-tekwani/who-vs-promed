Dr Hatem Ali Taher, expert in the field of entomology, said in the training workshop organised by the Sudanese Association of Public Health yesterday [28 Nov 2012] in the Astak laboratory, speaking to students specializing in entomology, that the collapse of insecticide monitoring stations may have led to the emergence of vectors and epidemics which have caused the outbreak of yellow fever in the Darfur states.

He called for the return of political support to fight the yellow fever epidemic and confirmed the possibility of the emergence of the disease in Red Sea State. He indicated that the spots where there are vector is found in the Sudan include the states of South Darfur, South Kordofan, Sennar, Blue Nile, and North Kordofan, adding that the during the [life] phases of the vector it breeds in bricks, broken pipes, and [old] tires.

For his part, Dr Hassan Suleiman, a Consultant Internal Medicine, said that the mortality rate of the disease, is 50 per cent, pointing out that the vaccine protects against this disease which has no cure. [Of all yellow fever virus infections, approximately 15 per cent develop severe disease. Of these severe cases 30-50 per cent are fatal. - Mod.TY]

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail report on the presence of yellow fever virus (YFV) vectors in Sudan during this outbreak.

The entomologist mentioned in the report above that the possibility of the emergence of the disease in Red Sea state was confirmed. However, it is not clear if there are mosquito vectors in Red Sea state or only a possibility that they could become established there. He goes on to indicate that vectors are present in the states of South Darfur, South Kordofan, Sennar, Blue Nile, and North Kordofan. Curiously, he does not mention anything about East, West, and North Darfur, where YF cases have been occurring. It is worth mentioning these places where vectors are established, as it underscores the risk of YF virus being introduced there by viremic travelers starting another focus of infection.

ProMED requests additional information about the presence and abundance of YF vectors (_Aedes aegypti_) throughout Darfur. Spraying in some Darfur sites has been mentioned in previous reports. However, unless water catchments that serve as mosquito breeding sites are eliminated, spraying will provide only temporary vector control.
