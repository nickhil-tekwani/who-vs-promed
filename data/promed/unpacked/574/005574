Usutu virus: after several cases detected in France, should we fear a new epidemic?
-----------------------------------------------------------
A second case of the Usutu virus was identified in France on 10 Nov 2022 in New Aquitaine. These 2 cases were detected in local patients, in other words, in people who have been in French territory. Should we be worried that mosquitoes present on mainland France carry the virus?

This disease is transmitted by mosquitoes, like dengue or chinkungunya [viruses], and most often occurs in people who have traveled abroad. This is not the case for these 2 new patients. Should we be worried that French mosquitoes are carriers of the disease and should we fear an epidemic?

Local patients
--------------
On 18 Oct 2022, the Agence Régionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS) [Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine Regional Health Agency] announced a case of the Usutu virus [infection] on its territory, a few weeks later, on 10 Nov 2022, it confirmed the diagnosis thanks to a new analysis. This 2nd case of local people is worrying, since this type of virus, usually transmitted by tropical mosquitoes, rarely affects people who do not leave the country.

They are called local sick people, in other words: people who fall ill without leaving the territory. For a virus whose mode of transmission is the bite of carrier insects, usually living in other countries, these new cases raise questions.

Birds as transmitters
---------------------
The Nouvelle-Aquitaine Regional Health Agency poses that this virus is of African origin, belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It includes viruses responsible for yellow fever, dengue fever, tickborne encephalitis as well as hepatitis C or bovine diarrhea. This is a large group of microorganisms of which mosquitoes are the greatest carriers.

Le Point specifies that, if mosquitoes are vectors of the virus, it is birds that ultimately transmit it to humans. Indeed, mosquitoes carrying Usutu are ornithophiles, in other words: they feed on the blood of birds, unlike anthropophiles, which prefer to bite humans. It is also among these feathered animals that the virus does the most damage, its greatest victim being the blackbird.

The reason cases have been detected in France in people who have not traveled to Africa could be explained by the presence of migratory birds in the territory.

Danger of the virus
------------------
The Nouvelle-Aquitaine Regional Health Agency puts things into perspective. While it is curious that cases have been reported in these patients, the disease does not result in symptoms of alarming danger.

The agency recalls that the infection is very often asymptomatic or causes only minor symptoms. The ailments caused by the virus range from asthenia (fatigue) to headaches to skin rashes. Recovery is rapid and there is an appropriate treatment. However, in 2016, there was an acute case in a patient from Montpellier.

Montpellier patient
-------------------
In 2016, a patient from Montpellier made it possible to discover more about the virus. He presented to Lapeyronie hospital with paralysis of half his face. The 39 year old man was hospitalized for 3 days in a neurological emergency unit. He ultimately recovered. The analysis ended up showing that he was carrying the virus. However, it is difficult to establish a direct link between the virus and this neurological problem.

[There have been sporadic cases of Usutu virus infection in humans and wild birds in a wide geographic area in Central and southern Europe.

Usutu virus, a mosquitoborne flavivirus, was first discovered in South Africa in 1959 and is maintained in bird reservoirs. The first human case was identified in the Central African Republic in 1981. The virus was first detected in Europe in 2001 in wild bird populations in Austria, and the continent's first documented human cases were in Italy in 2009 in immunocompromised patients (ref: https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.14.50.19446-en). These European cases were also the first to exhibit neurological manifestation of the disease, as the only 2 previous cases in Africa exhibited fever, rash, and jaundice. This relatively unknown and emerging zoonotic virus highlights the importance of vectorborne disease surveillance for human health.

Usutu virus was detected in France in 2015. It was detected in 11 _Culex pipiens_ mosquito pools in Camargue (France) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. Phylogenetic analysis of recovered virus sequences identified USUV lineages Africa 2 and Africa 3, demonstrating the simultaneous occurrence of different strains within the mosquito population. This was the first report on USUV in mosquitoes from France that concurrently accompanied the emergence of Usutu virus in blackbirds and a human case in France during 2015/2016 (ref: Eiden M, Gil P, Ziegler U, et al. Emergence of 2 Usutu virus lineages in _Culex pipiens_ mosquitoes in the Camargue, France, 2015. Infect Genet Evol. 2018;61:151-154. doi: 10.1016/j.meegid.2018.03.020).

Subsequent seroprevalence studies and retrospective investigations suggested that the prevalence of USUV infection in humans could be higher than West Nile virus infection (estimated to range between 0.3% and 3%) in areas where both viruses co-circulate (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25230).

With USUV infections occurring in birds and in humans in Central and southern Europe, it is not surprising that USUV human infections reoccur in France. Both USUV and WNV are flaviviruses. There is no commercially available human vaccine for Usutu virus. - Mod.TY
