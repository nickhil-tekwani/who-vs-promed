International tests confirmed the death of a 3-year-old girl from bird flu,
bringing the number of people killed by the disease in Indonesia to at
least 41, a health official said on Friday [14 Jul 2006]. The toddler, from
Cisauk village southwest of the capital, died in a Jakarta hospital on 6
Jul 2006, said Nyoman Kandun, a senior health ministry official. She
apparently had been in contact with infected poultry, Kandun said. A World
Health Organization-recognized laboratory in Atlanta confirmed she had the
H5N1 virus that has ravaged poultry stocks across Asia since 2003, jumping
to humans and killing at least 131 people worldwide.
Indonesia is logging new human cases faster than any other nation and
trails only Viet Nam, where 42 people have died. [No human cases of H5N1
avian influenza have been reported in Viet Nam during the past 6 months.
Most of the human cases of H5N1 avian influenza recorded during 2006 have
been in Indonesia. - Mod.CP]
The cash-strapped government has been criticized for not routinely culling
[poultry] in infected areas, seen as the best way to stop the H5N1 virus
from spreading. It says it cannot afford to compensate farmers across the
sprawling archipelago.

Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 22
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the country's 53rd case
of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was
fatal, occurred in a 3-year-old girl from a suburb of Jakarta. She became
ill on 23 Jun 2006, was hospitalized on 5 Jul 2006 and died the next day.
Specimens collected from the girl were confirmed positive for H5N1 avian
influenza virus.
An investigation found that the girl handled chickens that had died in the
neighbourhood, to dispose of them, 2 days before the onset of her symptoms.
Samples taken from chickens in the neighbourhood were found to be positive.
An investigation has found no further cases of influenza-like illness and
monitoring of close contacts is under way.
Of the 53 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 41 have been fatal.
