[Bluetongue has a marked seasonal distribution in the region
beginning right on schedule this year (2010) in the June-July time
frame and lasting until around the October-November.

We have seen mixed BTV-4 and BTV-1 infections previously and the
epidemiologic comments appended to the BTV-4 report indicate that 3
locations were indeed mixed infections with serotype 1 also present
at these 3 locations. The 22 outbreaks contained in both reports are
spread throughout the country and this is the season, so we can
expect more cases in the near future.

The OIE timeline report indicates that clinical disease was confirmed
in Tunisia, Algeria, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Lesotho
between 2005 and 2009. - Mods.PC/NM]
