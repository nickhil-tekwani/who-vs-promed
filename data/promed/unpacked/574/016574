Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Democratic Republic of the Congo - Update
--------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 11 Dec 2002 the outbreak has affected Bosobolo, Gbadolite,
Gemena, and Karawa areas (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/november/29anovember2002.html>).
Because of persisting communications problems with health personnel
in the field, comprehensive surveillance data for the affected areas
have been difficult to obtain. However, WHO reported the preliminary
results of a retrospective survey conducted by Epicentre and Medecins
sans Frontieres (MSF-France) in Bosobolo covering approximately 300
households. A total of 1245 cases including 18 deaths (case-fatality
rate 1.4 percent) was recorded. The attack rate was 47 percent.
The outbreak in the surveyed area peaked by early November 2002. All
age groups have been affected, with the highest case fatality rate
over 3 percent observed in children under 5 years of age and the
elderly. Preliminary results of blood samples tested at Institut
Pasteur (Paris) indicate recent infection compatible with the current
circulating influenza virus (H3N2). Further testing to characterize
the virus is necessary.
WHO, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF- Belgium), MEMISA, and FOMETRO are
supporting the Ministry of Health in laboratory diagnosis and
provision of supplies.

[This report to some extent confirms the previous prediction in
ProMED-mail that, as recently observed in Madagascar, influenza virus
might be responsible for the current outbreak of acute respiratory
disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo. - Mod.CP]
