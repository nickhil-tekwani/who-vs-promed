[It has not been stated in the alert or subsequently to date how many
cases related to this product have occurred. As with ground beef, if
the veal liver is properly cooked and proper kitchen hygiene is
practiced to prevent post-cooking recontamination in the kitchen, the
number of clinical cases can be markedly minimized. - Mod.LL]
