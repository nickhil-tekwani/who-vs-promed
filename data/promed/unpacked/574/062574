Cholera in tourists returning from Kenya
The increase in long distance tourism has raised the risk of importing
cholera from endemic areas but until now such cases have been infrequent,
suggesting that hotel hygiene is generally good and preventive advice
adequate. Thirteen cases of _Vibrio cholerae O1_ were confirmed in England
and Wales in 1997. Four confirmed cases of cholera (_Vibrio cholerae_
biotype O1 el tor Ogawa) have been reported since January 1998 in British
tourists returning from Kenya, three of whom were associated with one
resort on the coast, south of Mombasa. Eurosurveillance Weekly reported the
first case this year of cholera to be imported to England from Kenya in
January (1). There were anecdotal reports of several foreign tourists ill
at the resort, particularly in the last two weeks of March. These holidays
are often up to three weeks in duration and include short safaris. In
addition to these four, a case of _V. cholerae_ non-O1 infection has been
identified in a tourist who also stayed near Mombasa but stayed at a
different resort.
In January 1998 there were reports of four German tourists who had visited
the same area of Kenya, returning to Germany between Christmas and New
Year, and who became unwell with a clinical diagnosis of cholera (2).
Laboratory confirmation of infection with _V. cholerae - O1 el tor Ogawa
was reported for three of the four clinical cases. The strain from the
fourth case was not available for typing.
African countries currently affected by severe cholera outbreaks at present
include Kenya, Djibouti, Somalia, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, and the United Republic of Tanzania (3). The area south of Mombasa
in Kenya is included among the affected areas. Travelers to Kenya,
particularly to this area, need to be reminded of the importance of hygiene
measures, such as avoiding drinking water [not bottled or eating food
which might [because of its source or appearance be contaminated. The
Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre
(CDSC), in collaboration with other member states of the European Union,
plans to follow up a cohort of visitors to the Kenyan resort at the end of
March to ascertain the size and source of this outbreak. So far only
British cases have been identified for this exposure period: further
information would be gratefully received by CDSC.
