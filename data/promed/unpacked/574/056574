Congo records 3rd new Ebola case from same infection chain -WHO

The Democratic Republic of Congo recorded a 3rd new Ebola case on Mon [13 Apr 2020], a 7-year-old girl who had started showing symptoms after visiting the same health centre as the 2 previous cases, the World Health Organisation said.

After more than 7 weeks without a new infection, Congo had been due on Sunday [12 Apr 2020] to mark an end to the 2nd-deadliest outbreak of the virus on record, until a case was confirmed on Friday [10 Apr 2020] in the eastern city of Beni.

Three new Ebola cases detected in Democratic Republic of the Congo

Fresh cases of Ebola have been detected just days before the deadly epidemic in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo was to be declared over.

The Ministry of Health on Fri 10 Apr 2020 confirmed the death from Ebola of a 26-year-old man in the city of Beni, North Kivu province. An 11-month-old girl treated at the same health centre also died, it was announced on Sun [12 Apr 2020], and a 7-year-old girl is also currently being treated for the virus.

It marks a significant blow for the Central African country, which had recorded its last Ebola case on 17 Feb 2020 and was on the verge of ending an outbreak that has killed more than 2200 people since August 2018.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that even before the announcement, it was prepared for further cases to emerge. "While not welcome news, this is an event we anticipated," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, in a media statement. "We kept response teams in Beni and other high-risk areas for precisely this reason."

As part of the Ebola surveillance system, health teams on the ground are investigating alerts every day. These can either be reports of those with Ebola symptoms or of deaths in areas that are considered high risk. The WHO said 2600 alerts are currently being analysed across the country's eastern provinces.

Health authorities had already planned to remain on high alert for the next 80 days and to provide care for Ebola survivors as part of an 18-month programme of regular check-ups.

Efforts are now underway to find all potential contacts of the cases in order to offer them vaccination and to monitor their health. If no new cases emerge, the DRC will now have to wait another 42 days -- the equivalent of 2 incubation periods for the virus -- until the Ebola epidemic can be declared over.

The setback underlines the huge challenge posed in eradicating a virus. The problem is made worse by the emergence of coronavirus in the DRC last month.

In a statement, Kate Moger, a regional vice president with the International Rescue Committee, called the situation a "triple emergency: Vulnerable populations facing ongoing humanitarian crises, the spread of COVID-19, and now again potentially a re-emerging Ebola crisis," she said.

Flare-ups had been expected in the Congo, which has suffered 10 outbreaks of the virus since it was 1st detected in humans near the Ebola River in 1976. The Ebola virus can remain active on medical equipment for weeks and can be transmitted through semen for over 550 days after a victim has recovered. In rare cases, survivors can also relapse.

A 2019 study warned that the 42-day threshold may not be enough to say with confidence that the epidemic is over because the complex security situation means some cases in the DRC may have gone undetected.

However, officials are confident that the new cases do not necessarily mean the virus will spiral out of control again, particularly because more than 300 000 Congolese have already been vaccinated.

Congo records 2nd Ebola death in days

Congo had been due on Sun [12 Apr 2020] to mark an end to the 2nd-deadliest outbreak of the virus on record until a case was confirmed on Fri [10 Apr 2020] in the eastern city of Beni, Reuters said.

The outbreak has killed more than 2200 people since August 2018 in an area of the country where militia violence hobbled efforts to contain it.

The latest victim was an 11-month-old girl, who was treated at the same health centre as the previous case, and a 26-year-old electrician, said Boubacar Diallo, deputy incident manager for the WHO's Ebola response.

It is not yet clear how the electrician contracted Ebola. He had no known contacts with other Ebola patients and was not a survivor of the virus who could have relapsed, the government said on Fri 10 Apr 2020.

Flare-ups or one-off transmissions are common towards the end of Ebola outbreaks, and a new case does not necessarily mean that the virus will spread out of control again.

The WHO has identified 215 people who came into contact with the electrician, including 53 health workers at 3 facilities the man visited before he died, Diallo said.

...On Sat [11 Apr 2020], a group of angry young men threw stones at a team of WHO workers and Beni's deputy mayor as they attempted to decontaminate the electrician's home and trace his contacts, Mr Diallo said. [The violence perpetrated against healthcare workers unfortunately continues to occur. - Mod LK]

"For them, Ebola is over," he told Reuters. "People here have some problems understanding how this case just came 2 days before the declaration of the end," Mr Diallo said.

Health officials have announced that the necessary arrangements have already been made to cut off all transmission chains, adding that around 100 suspected cases who were in contact with the 1st patient have been listed for immediate follow-up. [Note that the WHO reports 215 contacts of the 1st case compared to the 100 reported here.]

The age of the 2nd fatal case, a child of 11 years or 11 months, is not at all clear, as pointed out in https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/ebola/: "This report raises an immediate question: How old was the 2nd Ebola case, 11 months, or 11 years? Reuters cites WHO as the source for the case being a baby. 7sur7.cd cites "medical authorities" as the source for the child being 11. I have no idea which is correct, but I hope we'll learn more about both cases. It's also worth noting that "young people" in the northeast DR Congo continue to be hostile to Ebola response teams. Some things never change."]

DRC Ebola: Secure burial of 11-year-old girl carried out

The Ebola response team announced on Mon [13 Apr 2020] that the dignified and secure burial of the 11-year-old girl who died in Beni has been completed. Her body had been kept in the morgue of the Beni General Reference Hospital.

The same source reports that 32 contacts were pre-listed around this case, including 4 family members (her mother already vaccinated), 2 motorcycle drivers, 7 co-tenants, 17 co-patients, and 2 nursing staff. The teams continue the listing and the investigations in order to determine the circumstances of contamination.

DRC-Ebola: the investigations extend to the biology [sequencing] to determine the origin of the [latest] cases

The latest case of Ebola virus disease detected on Fri [10 Apr 2020] in Beni continues to fuel debate among scientists. In-depth work is being carried out to trace the origin of this case. After the meetings on Fri and Sat [11 Apr 2020], it was decided to also carry out sequencing, that is to say the determination of the gene sequence.

"It was detected yesterday [10 Apr 2020]. Today, we already have leads on contacts. The research also tends to biology because we will also do the sequencing to understand the origin," said Steve Ahuka Mundeke, Expert at the Technical Secretariat of the Multisectoral Committee of the Riposte Covid-19 in DRC, who also worked in the response to Ebola.

Recent studies on the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone show, for example, that more than 300 genetic modifications have been identified compared to previous viruses.

Meanwhile, in Beni, faced with pressure from civil society, the town hall announces that studies are continuing to shed more light on the latter case.

"The response teams sent part of the response to Kinshasa for examinations as the 1st laboratory. As a 2nd laboratory, there is Katwa. We believe that within 72 hours the results will reach us in Beni. This will allow us to be definitively fixed on the viral situation of the deceased," said the mayor of Beni this Sat [11 Apr 2020].

The city of Beni had notified on Fri [10 Apr 2020] a new case of the Ebola virus disease.

[The genetics of the virus detected in the 3 latest cases may provide information on the origin of these recent cases after an apparent gap of more than 7 weeks without reported activity. The virus may have been circulating at a very low, undetectable level. It is hopeful that there won't be extensive spread since these recent cases have a single source, and contacts have been identified. - Mod.LK]

Beni-Ebola: Civil society demands the unearthing of the new [1st] confirmed case "for an expertise in 3 laboratories"

Beni's president of civil society, Kizito Bin Hangi has stepped up to the plate after the declaration of the new case of Ebola in the region, 2 days before the end of the epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Local civil society demands re-examining the samples to put an end to rumors of a case being created.

"We have received lamentations and complaints from both sides of the population, even the doctors and even the family of the deceased after the new case of Ebola in Beni. The body must be dug up at the expense of the response, the samples taken must be sent to 3 laboratories for comparison, including that of Mangina, Butembo and Katwa, in order to be reassured that this is indeed the confirmed case," he said.

"I call all the people having been in direct contact with the deceased person to present themselves to the response teams in order to pass the test so as not to intensify the virus in the community."

It should be recalled that a new case of Ebola was declared in the city of Beni on Fri 10 Apr 2020. However, unofficial reports say there is a 2nd case in the area [and as of 13 Apr 2020, a 3rd case].

- 14 Apr 2020. Reconvene PHEIC committee
[Voice of America (abridged, edited)]
https://www.voanews.com/africa/who-emergency-committee-meets-ebola-after-new-drc-case

Excerpt:
The WHO said its emergency committee would meet Tue [14 Apr 2020] to discuss whether the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo still constitutes an international health emergency, after fresh cases were detected.

The meeting comes a day after DR Congo had been expected to announce that the outbreak in the east of the country that began in August 2018 was over.

The epidemic has killed 2276 people to date. For it to be declared over, there have to be no new cases reported for 42 days, double the incubation period.

But as the World Health Organization's emergency committee met last Fri [10 Apr 2020] to determine whether its declaration of a so-called Public Health Emergency of International Concern, or PHEIC, could be lifted, a new case was reported.

"We now have 3 cases, 2 people who have died, one person who is alive," WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters in a virtual briefing in Geneva on Tue [14 Apr 2020].

She said that all of the contacts of those cases had been traced and vaccinated and were being followed closely.

DR Congo health authorities announced Fri [10 Apr 2020] that a 26-year-old man was listed as having died from the disease, and a young girl who was being treated in the same health center passed away on Sun [12 Apr 2020].

Both died in the city of Beni, epicenter of the outbreak.

Due to the shifting situation, the WHO decided to reconvene its emergency committee to again evaluate whether or not the outbreak still constitutes an international health emergency, Harris said. It was scheduled to announce its decision later Tue [14 Apr 2020].

DR Congo has meanwhile started a new 42-day countdown to declare an end to its 10th epidemic of the deadly hemorrhagic fever disease.

Congo, Weary From Ebola, Must Also Battle Coronavirus

Congo has been battling an Ebola outbreak that has killed thousands of people for more than 18 months, and now it must also face a new scourge: the coronavirus pandemic.

Ebola has left those living in the country's east weary and fearful, and, just as they were preparing to declare an end to the outbreak, a new case popped up. Now, they will have to manage both threats at once.

The new virus has overwhelmed some of the world's best hospital systems in Europe and ripped through communities in New York. In Congo, it could spread unchecked in a country that has endured decades of conflict, where corruption has left the population largely impoverished despite mineral wealth, and where mistrust of authority is so entrenched that health workers have been killed during the Ebola outbreak.

It's also unclear how forthcoming international support will be when the whole world is battling the coronavirus.

"It all feels like one big storm," said Martine Milonde, a Congolese community mobilizer who works with the aid group World Vision in Beni, which has been the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. "Truly, this is a crisis within a crisis within a crisis. The community suffers from insecurity, and suffered under Ebola, and now may have to face COVID-19."

In early March 2020, an Ebola patient whom many hoped would be the last was discharged, and the outbreak was supposed to be officially declared over Sunday [12 Apr 2020]. But the World Health Organization on Fri 10 Apr 2020 announced a new case in Beni.

Many of the tools used to fight Ebola -- handwashing and social distancing chief among them -- are also key to combating the coronavirus.

In Beni, which has reported 2 cases of the new coronavirus, "the communities here hold on to some hope that they are going to overcome this pandemic the way they had been working to overcome Ebola," said Milonde. "They are counting on the caution, vigilance, and hygiene practices that they have been performing to save their families."

Community advocates in Beni -- who walk around with megaphones to talk about Ebola -- have started to include warnings about the coronavirus.

Messages explaining COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and where to go if sick are being spread on radio stations, through text message blasts and by religious leaders. Schools, churches and mosques are already armed with handwashing kits.

Beni's mayor, Nyonyi Bwanakawa, says many of the measures will be familiar, but the recommendations to stay home are more stringent than what is required for Ebola, and officials are prepared to take "dramatic measures" if people resist.

Unlike Ebola, which kills about half of the people it infects, the new coronavirus causes mostly mild or moderate symptoms in about 80% of people. Spreading Ebola typically requires an exchange of bodily fluids, and people have often been infected when caring for loved ones or mourning in traditional funerals that involve close contact with the body. In contrast, the new coronavirus is far more contagious and mostly spread by people coughing or sneezing, including those with only mild flu-like symptoms.

That means the task of controlling the virus' spread in Congo will be massive: The government has only limited control in parts of the vast country; there are also some dense population centers with poor sanitation and infrastructure; and the country's mineral-rich east is beset by violence from various armed groups.

Dr. Michel Yao, program manager for emergency response at the WHO's Africa office, said implementing robust testing and contact tracing will be key. But getting the community fully involved in fighting the disease might be even more important. That means not just speaking at communities, "but giving them responsibility and roles to play."

Initially, efforts to control Ebola were met with resistance, one of the major contributors to its spread. Amid the insecurity in the country's east, superstitions arose, and some clinics to treat Ebola patients were attacked and health workers killed.

"It's so upsetting to have this 2nd disease. We lost so many people through Ebola, a lot of deaths, now corona," she said. "Everyone is really afraid."

[So much has been learned about how to control Ebola, outside of the vaccine itself. All these lessons on community involvement to build trust, contact tracing, and washing hands will be useful in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. But it is a real challenge for the communities to face yet another virus threat. - Mod.LK
