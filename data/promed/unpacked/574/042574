Replication and Packaging of Norwalk virus RNA in Cultured Mammalian Cells
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Norwalk virus is the type species of the genus _Norovirus_ of the family
_Caliciviridae_. The noroviruses are now recognised to be the predominant cause
of sudden-onset viral gastroenteritis. Research has been hampered by inability
to propagate these agents in cultured cells. A paper by Miyuki Asanaka , Robert
L. Atmar Vivian Ruvolo , Sue E. Crawford, Frederick H. Neill , & Mary K.
Estes, at the Departments of Molecular Virology and Microbiology and Medicine,
Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX, USA reports a
significant advance in this field.
The abstract of the paper summarises the current situation:
"Human noroviruses, the most common cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis, are
characterized by high infectivity rate, low infectious dose, and unusually high
stability outside the host. However, human norovirus research is hindered by
the lack of a cell culture system and a small animal model of infection.
Norwalk virus (NV) is the prototype strain of human noroviruses. We report the
successful replication of NV viral RNA and its packaging into virus particles
in mammalian cells by intracellular expression of native forms of NV viral RNA
devoid of extraneous nucleotide sequences derived from the expression vector,
by the use of replication-deficient vaccinia virus MVA encoding the
bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (MVA/T7). Expressed genomic RNA was found to
replicate; NV subgenomic RNA was transcribed from genomic RNA by use of NV
nonstructural proteins expressed from genomic RNA and was subsequently
translated into NV capsid protein VP1. Viral genomic RNA was packaged into
virus particles generated in mammalian cells. The cesium chloride (CsCl)
density gradient profile of virus particles containing genomic RNA was similar
to that of NV purified from stool. These observations indicate that the NV cDNA
constructed here is a biologically infectious clone, and that mammalian cells
have the ability to replicate NV genomic RNA. This work establishes a mammalian
cell-based system for analysis of human norovirus replication and, thus, makes
it feasible to investigate antiviral agents in mammalian cells."

Hong Kong SAR: Norovirus Detected in Oyster Imports, 2000-2003
--------------------------------------------------------------
More than 10 percent of fresh oysters imported into Hong Kong are contaminated
with norovirus, a common cause of gastroenteritis found in human and animal
faeces, scientists said on Friday [15 Jul 2005]. Oysters, which are filter
feeders, would be contaminated with the virus if they were grown in waters
polluted with sewage.
>From 2000 to 2003, scientists at Hong Kong's Public Health Laboratory examined
507 oysters imported from 11 countries spread across the Americas, Europe and
Asia. They found 53 tainted with norovirus, which causes diarrhoea and
vomiting. Wilina Lim at the laboratory said the tainted samples came from 6
countries, but she declined to name them.
"It's not advisable to eat oysters raw. They may not only carry norovirus, but
also hepatitis A [virus] and bacteria. But a lot of people like them raw, so
they have to bear the risk," she said. Hong Kong imported 1.9 million kg (4.2
million lbs) [approx. 2000 tons! - Mod.JW] of live, fresh and chilled oysters
in 2004.
Norovirus is relatively hardy. Killing it requires cooking in boiling
temperatures for at least 3 minutes, Lim said.

[In recent years noroviruses have become associated predominantly with
outbreaks of self-limited acute gastroenteritis in circumstances where large
groups of people from diverse backgrounds come together in close proximity,
such as hotels, cruise ships, conferences, schools, etc. Such outbreaks have
been particularly troublesome in hospitals and heath-care facilities.
Outbreaks occur in these situations as a consequence of the antigenic diversity
of noroviruses, their abundance in faeces and fomites, and their relative
resistance to inactivation in the environment. Nonetheless, initially these
viruses were more commonly linked with outbreaks of food-borne disease.
Greater awareness of the ubiquity of these viruses and greater attention to
hygiene in food preparation have diminished their prominence in food-borne
disease. However, their association with gastroenteritis caused by consumption
of oysters and some other shellfish remains undiminished. Oysters are very
efficient filter-feeding organisms which can concentrate large quantities of
viruses from water where there is contamination from human sewage. Risk of
human infection is enhanced by the preference of many people to consume oysters
uncooked.
In 2002 Ireland was identified as a source of norovirus-contaminated oysters
exported to Hong Kong. Now 6 of 11 exporting countries are cited but not
identified. These data suggest that the problem of sewage contamination of
oyster beds remains to be solved. - Mod.CP]
