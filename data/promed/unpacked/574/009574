[On 8 Feb 2012, a correction was posted on ProMED-mail (Rabies - Italy (03): Mantova ex India, human, fatal, corr. 20120208.0314) giving the date of admission to hospital 23 Oct 2012 rather than 3 Oct 2012 as erroneously posted. Hence, the estimated incubation period was approximately 4 weeks. - Mod.MPP]

A 40-year-old man was admitted to the public hospital (Mantova, Italy) on 3 Oct 2011 with a suspected rabies infection. At the time of admission, he presented fever, myalgias, and acute respiratory distress. The patient died of rabies on 14 Nov 2011, after 17 days of a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3 [The GCS is scored between 3 and 15, 3 being the worst, and 15 the best. It is composed of 3 parameters: Best Eye Response, Best Verbal Response, Best Motor Response: see: http://www.trauma.org/archive/scores/gcs.html. - Mod.CP]. Ante mortem and post mortem laboratory diagnostic tests for rabies performed at the National Reference Laboratory for Rabies/OIE Collaborating Centre for diseases at the animal-human interface, IZSVe (Padova, Italy) and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Rabies, CDC (Atlanta, GA, USA) confirmed the initial suspicion based on patient clinical history.

The patient was the victim of an episode of severe biting on the left arm and leg by an aggressive dog on 28 Sep 2011 in a suburban area in the city of Manpur, North-East India. He immediately underwent post-exposure prophylaxis, which consisted of vaccination in absence of rabies immunoglobulin administration.

According to the WHO estimates, roughly 36 percent of the world's rabies deaths occur in India each year, with about 20 000 out of an estimated global annual 55 000 rabies deaths, 3/4ths of them occurring in rural areas.

In most cases, appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis can safely prevent the infection in humans. Despite efforts to raise public awareness and to improve medical infrastructures, shortages in rabies immunoglobulin still represent the main constraint for human death prevention, especially in countries where canine rabies is endemic.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs De Benedictis and Gaettti for drawing attention to this unfortunate occurrence.

There have been recurrent reports of rabies treatment failures in India for a variety of reasons. In this case, it is likely that lack of immunoglobulin combined with the severity of the victim's injuries contributed to the fatal outcome, despite the prompt administration of vaccine.
