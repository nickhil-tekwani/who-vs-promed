An African Swine Fever virus [ASFV] vaccine candidate has been adapted to grow in a cell line, which means that those involved in vaccine production will no longer have to rely on live pigs and their fresh cells for vaccine production.

That news was shared by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), a section of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). In a press release [see comment], senior ARS scientist Dr. Manuel Borca said, "This opens the door for large-scale vaccine production, which is a valuable tool for the possible eradication of the virus."

The vaccine candidate has been under development for years at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, part of the ARS, which in turn belongs to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The vaccine candidate revolves around the deletion of the gene I177L from a highly virulent ASFv strain from the country Georgia (ASFv-G). Hence, the official name of the vaccine candidate is "ASFV-G-I"I177L." Only last week the news broke that the vaccine was also proven to be working when given oronasally to pigs, which means that there's potential to use it in bait for wild boar populations.

The latest discovery, highlighted in the peer-reviewed scientific Journal of Virology, overcomes one of the major challenges for manufacturing of an ASF virus vaccine. The newly developed vaccine, grown in a continuous cell line - which means immortalised cells that divide continuously or otherwise indefinitely - has the same characteristics as the original vaccine produced with fresh swine cells.

"Traditionally we used freshly isolated swine cells to produce vaccine candidates, and this constitutes a significant limitation for large-scale production," said senior ARS scientist Dr. Douglas Gladue in the press release. "But now we can retain the vaccine characteristics while simultaneously replicating the vaccine in lab-grown cell cultures. We no longer have to rely on gathering fresh cells from live swine."

The continuous cell line vaccine candidate was tested in a commercial breed of pigs and determined to be safe, protecting pigs against the virus. The research team did not observe any negative effects.

[The ARS press release was published on 6 May 2021 and is available at https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2021/african-swine-fever-virus-vaccine-candidate-now-produced-in-a-cell-line/. Its abstract follows.

Abstract
"African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a virulent, deadly infection in wild and domestic swine, and is currently causing a pandemic covering a contiguous geographical area from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia. No commercial vaccines are available to prevent African swine fever (ASF), resulting in devastating economic losses to the swine industry. The most advanced vaccine candidates are live attenuated strains developed using genetically modified virulent parental virus. Recently we developed a vaccine candidate, ASFV-G-I"I177L, by deleting the I177L gene from the genome of the highly virulent pandemic ASFV strain Georgia (ASFV-G). ASFV-G-I"I177L is safe and highly efficacious in challenge studies using parental ASFV-G. Large-scale production of ASFV-G-I"I177L has been limited because it can only efficiently replicate in primary swine macrophages. Here we present the development of an ASFV-G-I"I177L derivative strain, ASFV-G-I"I177L /I"LVR, that efficiently replicates in a stable porcine cell line. In challenge studies, ASFV-G-I"I177L/I"LVR maintained the same level of attenuation, immunogenic characteristics and protective efficacy as ASFV-G-ÃŽ"I177L. ASFV-G-I"I177L /I"LVR is the first rationally designed ASF vaccine candidate that can be used for large-scale commercial vaccine manufacturing".

The absence of vaccine has been the major obstacle on the road to controlling the devastating ASF panzootic which started in western Georgia in 2007. The efficacy of the above vaccine candidate, capable of inducing sterile immunity against the circulating ASFV strain, was addressed in a 2020 paper (Ref 1). The current development is expected to allow a commercial manufacturing of the vaccine. Both papers have been authored by researchers of the ARS-USDA's Plum Island Animal Disease Center, Greenport, New York, who deserve to be applauded.
