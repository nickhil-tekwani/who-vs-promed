["Monitoring and controlling avian influenza at its poultry source is essential to decrease the virus load in susceptible avian species and the environment. Implementation of biosecurity measures, in line with OIE international Standards, is key to secure the production sector and trade, to safeguard food security and the livelihoods of farmers (in particular in developing countries), as well as to limit the risk of human infection with Avian Influenza strains that have zoonotic potential".
