As both an epidemiologist and a member of The Writers Union of Canada, I
can tell you that different words in the dictionary do not NECESSARILY have
different meanings (remember synonyms?), though, because of historical
usage, they may have different connotations. The problem with basing a
scientific discussion on connotations is that they tend to be culturally
conditioned, so that one person's risk may, or may not, be another person's
danger. This makes for interesting poetry but messy science. In the end,
you are better off just saying what you mean (i.e., do you mean destroy or
simply remove?).

[While waiting for Phil Brachman to reply, we were deluged with
definitions, suggestions, answers, questions, and comments. I am leaving
town for a few days and do not wish to burden my co-moderators, so have
selected this response as the best and am cutting this string. As I
understand it (from all responses taken together), "eradicate" means to get
rid of completely and "eliminate" means to reduce something to a point that
no one notices it is still there. Please, no more help on this. - Mod.CHC
