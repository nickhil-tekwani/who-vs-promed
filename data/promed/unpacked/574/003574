KHV is dead and CNGV is born
-----------------------------
According to research findings in the press, the virus that has been the
cause of high mortalities in Koi populations around the globe has finally
been isolated.
In the forthcoming article "Efficient vaccine against the virus causing a
lethal disease in cultured _Cyprinus carpio_", Ariel Ronen of Department of
Pathology, The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem and his
co-workers not only announce that an effective vaccine has been produced,
but also that the virus previously known as Koi Herpes Virus (KHV) it is
not a member of the Herpes virus family, and that renaming it is in order.
Abstract:
We have isolated a virus which causes a mortal disease in cultured
ornamental Koi and Common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) in many countries
worldwide. This unclassified virus, which causes nephritis and gill
necrosis, and so has been given the name carp nephritis and gill necrosis
virus (CNGV), has a morphology resembling the herpes virus, but bears a
genomic DNA of ca 250-300 kbp. So far, both others and we have been unable
to find CNGV-DNA sequences possessing a significant similarity to known DNA
viruses. The virus induces a lethal disease when water temperature ranges
between 18 and 25 C (permissive temperature). In this report, we
demonstrate that carp exposed to the virus at 23 C for 3-5 days and then
transferred to the non-permissive temperature of 30 C, became resistant to
a challenged infection, and their sera demonstrated a high level of
virus-specific antibodies. We have isolated attenuated non-pathogenic
viruses that render virus-vaccinated carp resistant to the disease.
Furthermore, vaccinated fish developed high levels of antibodies against
the virus. We suggest, therefore, that this attenuated virus could be used
as a live vaccine for the eradication of the mortal disease afflicting
common and ornamental carp fisheries in many countries.

SDK:- So carp nephritis and gill necrosis virus is what it should be called
in future; CNGV for short. And unless the name is seriously challenged in
the scientific press, that is what it will remain [see comment]. Better
start practicing it so your tongue gets used to it. For your information:
Nephritis refers to an inflammation of the kidney and necrosis to the dying
of cells, the most specific symptoms of the disease.

[Koi herpesvirus, an emerging disease associated with devastating losses of
common carp (_Cyprinus carpio carpio_) and koi (_Cyprinus carpio koi_ ) in
North America, Europe, Israel, and Asia, has been the subject of previous
ProMED-mail postings; its definite etiology has yet to be established and
agreed upon by various working groups. The following data are extracted
from the abstract of a recent paper by Gilad et al. ["Molecular comparison
of isolates of an emerging fish pathogen, koi herpesvirus, and the effect
of water temperature on mortality of experimentally infected koi", Journal
of General Virology (2003), 84, 2661-2668]:
"A comparison of virion polypeptides and genomic restriction fragments of 7
geographically diverse isolates of KHV indicated that with one exception
they represented a homogeneous group. A principal environmental factor
influencing the onset and severity of disease is water temperature. Optimal
growth of KHV in a koi fin cell line occurred at temperatures from 15-25 C.
There was no growth or minimal growth at 4, 10, 30, or 37 C. Experimental
infections of koi with KHV at a water temperature of 23 C resulted in a
cumulative mortality of 95.2 percent. Disease progressed rapidly but with
lower mortality (89.4-95.2 percent) at 28 C. Mortality (85.0 percent) also
occurred at 18 C but not at 13 C. Shifting virus-exposed fish from 13 to 23
C resulted in the rapid onset of mortality".
The reader is also referred to a recent paper by Ayana Perelberg et al,
"Epidemiological Description of a New Viral Disease Afflicting Cultured
_Cyprinus Carpio_ in Israel", published in The Israeli Journal of
Aquaculture - Bamidgeh 55(1), 2003,
5-12 <http://www.mop-zafon.org.il/fish/ija/55/55-1_5-12.htm>. - Mod.AS]
[It is perhaps premature to suggest that the _Cyprinus carpio_ virus should
not continue to be considered to be a member of the family
_Herpesviridae_. It would be appropriate for the authors to submit this
proposal, together with its scientific justification, to the
_Herpesviridae_ Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) for evaluation and approval.
Nearly all research on herpesviruses has involved mammalian and avian
herpesviruses, and little is known about the numerous herpesviruses that
infect cold-blooded vertebrates. The most extensively studied member of the
latter group, channel catfish virus (CCV; Ictalurid herpesvirus 1) was
initially classified as a herpesvirus on the basis of its virion morphology
and as a member of the subfamily _Alphaherpesvirinae_ on the basis of its
biological properties. However, analysis of the complete genome sequence
revealed that CCV has no specific relationship with mammalian herpesviruses
at the level of primary amino acid sequence, in that no counterpart of a
protein encoded only by mammalian herpesviruses, such as a structural
protein, was detected in CCV. Salmonid herpesvirus 1 (SalHV-1), another
fish herpesvirus, is clearly related to CCV in at least 18 genes at the
level of amino acid sequence. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic distance
between SalHV-1 and CCV is rather substantial, qualitatively of the same
order as that between members of different mammalian herpesvirus
subfamilies. Moreover, the gene orders in the two viruses are different. In
general, herpesviruses are closely adapted to specific hosts and tend to
evolve with their hosts. It might be expected that a carp herpesvirus would
diverge considerably from other fish viruses and to resemble mammalian
herpesviruses only in terms of morphology. - Mod.CP]
