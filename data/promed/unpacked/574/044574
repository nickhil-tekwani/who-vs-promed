[1] French Guiana, local transmission

In Kourou, 2 cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been diagnosed. These are the 1st patients who have contracted the virus in the department [Guiana], in contrast to the 5 preceding cases that were imported from the Antilles.

For the 1st time since chikungunya virus appeared in St. Martin in November [2013], 2 cases called "autochthonous" have been diagnosed in Guiana. These 2 Kourou residents, who do not go around together, do live in the same quarter. Up to the present, the 5 preceding confirmed chikungunya [virus infection] cases in the department were people who had contracted the virus during travel to the Antilles.

[It is not surprising that there is local transmission in Guiana, given the occurrence of imported cases previously. It does provide reason for increased surveillance not only on the as yet unaffected Caribbean islands, but on the mainland of the Americas where dengue virus transmission is occurring as an indication of abundant competent mosquito vectors for chikungunya virus as well.

[2] St. Kitts

The Federation [St. Kitts and Nevis] has recorded its 1st confirmed case of the chikungunya virus [infection]. A statement from the Ministry of Health Thursday morning [20 Feb 2014] indicated that the 30-year-old male resident of St. Kitts was hospitalized and discharged without complications 2 weeks ago. Confirmation testing was done by the Trinidad-based Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA).

Speaking to WINN FM Thursday morning, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Patrick Martin assured that there was no need to panic. "There is no need for travel or trade restrictions, no need for alarm, no need to panic. If you have the fever and pain, Paracetamol, lots of fluids... don't tire out yourself," Dr. Martin said Thursday.

Like dengue, chikungunya is characterized by fever and pain which appear up 3-7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Other symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and rash.

Acute chikungunya fever typically lasts a few days to a few weeks, but as with dengue, some patients have prolonged fatigue lasting several weeks. There is no risk of bleeding complications with chikungunya which distinguishes it from dengue.

Dr. Martin advised that persons exhibiting symptoms can be treated at, and use over the counter medications except for aspirin and ibuprofen.

Dr. Martin said Thursday [20 Feb 2014] that in all likelihood the virus has been in the Federation [St. Kitts and Nevis] for several weeks and that there have been other cases.

[This report does not indicate whether the chikungunya virus infection was acquired locally on St. Kitts or in another locality where transmission is going on. No mention was made of the individual's travel history off of St. Kitts island, and the Chief Medical Officer mentioned that it is likely that the virus has been present in the Federation for several weeks with occurrence of other cases; these factors suggest that the infection was, in fact, acquired locally.
