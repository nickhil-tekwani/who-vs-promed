Biosecurity SA [South Australia] is reminding beekeepers to be on the lookout for American foulbrood (AFB), found in hives pollinating lucerne in the Tintinara area. Biosecurity SA's new bee biosecurity officer Teagan Alexander is working closely with apiarists in the region to ensure no further spread of the disease.

A notifiable disease, AFB is a bacterial disease that kills honeybee brood, resulting in the weakening and eventual killing of affected hives. The disease is spread via contaminated honeybees, honeybee products, and equipment, potentially not only within an affected beekeepers apiary, but also to surrounding disease-free apiaries belonging to other beekeepers.

Signs of infected brood include:
- sunken and/or perforated cappings;
- irregular brood pattern;
- discoloured brood -- typically light-dark brown;
- brood remains that are ropey, or dried scales adhering to cell base.

Management options for AFB eradication include the removal and sterilization of infected honeybees, honey, and hive equipment.

PIRSA [Department of Primary Industries and Regions, South Australia] Biosecurity SA project manager - Apiaries, Michael Stedman, believes maintaining an effective honeybee program is crucial for the industry. "Maintaining an effective biosecurity program is crucial not only for the honeybee industry but also for the various agricultural and horticultural sectors dependent on honeybee pollination. This latest detection at Tintinara illustrates the importance of reporting AFB detections and following best industry practice," Mr Stedman said.

PIRSA Biosecurity SA bee biosecurity officer, Teagan Alexander, also believes that it is crucial to remain on top of things before further spreading happens. "Given the high densities of hives required to pollinate lucerne [alfalfa], further spread could have a devastating impact on the industry. It is why we are ensuring this outbreak is dealt with as quickly as possible. We are therefore asking all beekeepers and landowners to report instances of neglected hives, and landowners to request evidence that hives used for pollination are disease free," she said.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram positive bacterium known for its ability to cause this severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Its spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age, when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
