Fears over the impact of a new strain of the deadly _Clostridium
difficile_ superbug were heightened today [6 Feb 2008] after it
emerged that 3 more patients have died at the Northern Health Trust
in recent days.

As health chiefs battle to contain a superbug outbreak, which has hit
several hospitals in County Antrim, the number of deaths linked to
_C. difficile_ since last summer [2007] rose to 23 today [6 Feb
2008]. The Northern Trust is currently dealing with an official
outbreak of _C. difficile_, which it declared last month [January
2008] when the level of patients affected by the bacteria rose to
higher than normal levels.

Medical experts have attributed the official outbreak to the
emergence of a more virulent form of the bacteria called ribotype
027. The bacterium causes diarrhoea and can even lead to a rupturing
of the bowel. It tends to affect the elderly. It is understood this
is the 1st time this strain has surfaced in Northern Ireland.

The Trust revealed just over 2 weeks ago that _C. difficile_ had been
linked to the deaths of 16 patients since last summer [2007]. That
toll rose to 20 last week [28 Jan-3 Feb 2008], and then again to 23
today [6 Feb 2008]. The Northern Health Trust was not immediately
able to confirm which hospitals within its responsibility had seen
the most recent deaths. Antrim Area Hospital has been hardest hit by
the new strain.

Speaking to the BBC, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, Dr
Michael McBride, said there was no evidence that other hospitals or
health trust areas across Northern Ireland were facing an increase of
incidence in the same way as the Northern Trust. "It's a sign that
measures in place have contained the infection," he said. Dr McBride
also questioned suggestions that hospital visiting should be
completely banned to cut down on the spread of the bug -- and said
instead visitors should be restricted to 2 people per bed. "We've got
to balance such an approach (banning visitors altogether) with sick
people, some of them terminally ill, who need the support of their
family," he said.

It was reported that Northern Ireland's 4 remaining Trusts -- the
Southern, South Eastern, Western, and Belfast -- were unable to
provide statistics on how many patients had died or were ill with _C.
difficile_ in the same period. Dr McBride said that figures possibly
should be published more frequently in light of "increased interest
and anxiety" among the public. "We need to reassure the public that
we are doing everything we possibly can do to deal with this," he
said. Restrictions on hospital visiting and single rooms for new
hospitals were among an extensive package of measures aimed at
fighting 'super bugs' in hospitals announced by health minister
Michael McGimpsey recently. He said that an additional GBP 9 m (USD
17.66 m) will be invested over the next 3 years in a bid to improve
patient safety and, in particular, to reduce the spread of infections
such as MRSA [methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_] and _C.
difficile_. He has also announced new targets to reduce MRSA by 10
percent and _C. difficile_ by 20 percent.

[County Antrim is one of the 6 counties that form Northern Ireland.
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Antrim>). It is situated in the
northeast of the island of Ireland, in the province of Ulster.
Localized health promotion work is carried out by the Health and
Social Services Trusts in each of the 4 Health and Social Services
Board areas. A map to see the locations of Trusts in the Board area
can be found at

_Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients and
antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor
associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. Recent outbreaks
of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased severity, high
relapse rate, and significant mortality, have been related to the
emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain in North
America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain, which hyper-produces
toxins A and B, is referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1
and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027. These epidemic
strains are characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use
of which is one risk factors for disease due to this ribotype (Drudy
D, Kyne L, O'Mahony R, Fanning S: gyrA mutations in
fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027. Emerg
Infect Dis 2007; 13. Available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm>).

A surveillance program for _C. difficile_, which covered all the
English health regions in 2006, determined that 26 percent of
isolates were ribotype 027. At that time, a small survey of 60
isolates from various locations in Northern Ireland revealed no
isolates of ribotype 027 in the province (see ProMED-mail 20070427.1377).

In addition in the same ProMED-mail post (20070427.1377), another
report linked the 1st documented Irish case of ribotype 027 with the
transfer of a patient from the UK. They also reported 2 subsequent
nosocomial outbreaks due to this strain in 2 other Irish hospitals.

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities
involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized
patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection
control measures, including prompt patient isolation of patients with
_C. difficile_-positive diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms
are not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene
and control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents
(<http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF>).
