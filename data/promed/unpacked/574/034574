The latest Ministry of Health epidemiological bulletin indicates that 344 cases of hepatitis (A, B, C, and D) have been reported so far in 2012 in Vargas state, with 17 cases reported from 1 Jul to 4 Aug 2012.

The epidemiological report indicates that in the 1st week of August 2012, 8 cases were reported, the same as in the previous 2 weeks, and the population with the highest incidence is 25 to 44 years of age.

Hepatitis A virus infection was the most frequent cause of hepatitis in the state, with 6 cases. This is the mildest form of the disease and is transmitted through food or objects contaminated with feces or [rarely] blood from an infected person. Some of its symptoms are yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, fever, and fluid buildup in the abdomen.

The other 2 cases were hepatitis B. This infection is acquired only through blood or sexual contact. Nationally, this disease has increased this year by about 27 percent, from 567 cases in 2011 to 722 during the same period in 2012.

Vargas state is among the 8 states most affected by the virus, the others being Bolivar, Capital District, Tachira, Sucre, Merida, Guarico, and Anzoategui.

[Hepatitis A and hepatitis B are virus vaccine-preventable diseases, and hepatitis C is increasingly becoming controllable by medication. Hepatitis D virus is a helper-dependent defective RNA virus and only present in people already infected with hepatitis B virus. Chronic hepatitis B virus carriers are at risk of infection with hepatitis D virus. Hepatitis D virus is present worldwide and in all age groups. Its distribution parallels that of hepatitis B virus infection, although with different prevalence rates (high in many parts of Europe, Africa, and South America, but lower in China). Hepatitis D virus infection of chronically infected hepatitis B virus carriers may lead to fulminant acute hepatitis or severe chronic active hepatitis.

The Ministry of Health does not record the prevalence of hepatitis E virus infection in Vargas state. Hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. It is usually a self-limiting infection and resolves within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops with acute liver failure, which can lead to death.
