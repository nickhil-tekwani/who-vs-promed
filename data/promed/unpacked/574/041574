The outbreak was managed by local health units and the province of Ontario,
with the assistance of a Laboratory Centre for Disease Control Field
Epidemiologist trainee who is based in one of the health units. Our field
epidemiologist wrote the report which was forwarded to you without the
following source paragraph (I've taken the liberty of rearranging the
authors as there was a mistake in the printed version):
