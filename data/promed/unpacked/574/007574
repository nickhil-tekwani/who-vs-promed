INFECTION CONTROL - TEXAS, USA
==============================
Date: Fri, 31 May 1996 18:25:33 -0400
From: ChasLerner@aol.com

I am a Hospital Epidemiologist at two institutions: San Antonio Community
Hospital and the Rehabilitation Institute of San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas.
We are up to our eyeballs in resistant bacteria:
- 25% of our community-acquired _S. aureus_ isolates are now MRSA.
- 20% of our pneumococci are penicillin resistant but fortunately not yet
ceftriaxone resistant.
- we have ongoing problems with VRE in both hospitalized patients and in the
community
(outpatients).
