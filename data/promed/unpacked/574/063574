Here is a (long) overdue look at what we have learned of the Texas outbreak in 2019:

1. The cases began in late June [2019] with peaks in early July [2019], all ranchers we talked with reported explosions of biting flies on or around the first week of July [2019] with most major deaths occurring by the end of July [2019].
2. Some of the ranches had cases continuing into late August [2019]; there was massive rain in June [2019] regionally with the "typical" hot dry period after those rains.
3. Cases were widespread; Dr. Zack Davis felt it was one of the largest in a lifetime - larger than 2005, which you will recall was also widespread. [See: 9 Jul 2005 Anthrax, cervidae, livestock - USA (TX) 20050709.1944. But the 2001 epidemic killed 80% of the deer in West Texas and was far worse. See links below. - Mod.MHJ]
4. We worked on ranches in Uvalde County, Kinney County, and Val Verde County - collecting samples across 6 properties;
5. We confirmed _B. anthracis_ on all properties sampled and preliminary sequencing confirms at least the usual A4 lineage and Ames-like (not true Ames) lineage were present and from our mapping of all known genotypes, strains fell within the enzootic zone as we expected them to; 2019 ranches close to ranches sampled 2003 - 2016 were positive for the same lineages.
6. We confirmed high rates of infectious dose level bacteria in a biting fly feeding on a carcass within minutes of death - the host and the fly had identical genotype (MLVA-based) and sequences (using whole genome sequencing).
7. On one ranch sampled, a native white-tailed deer ranch with a known history, and no high fences, the mortality rate was about 8%, which is on par with mortalities in nearby ranches in 2001, 2005 and 2010.
8. The diversity of wildlife affected was high, with cape buffalo, audad, axis, red deer, hartebeest, several antelope species (e.g. dama), all affected; we confirmed it with culture and PCR from many of these species.
9. At least 2 of the properties visited had confirmed cases in 2003-2004.
10. One property had confirmed epizootic hemorrhagic disease deaths in white-tailed deer - we confirmed anthrax during the same period on the same property, so both diseases are affecting the populations.
11. Audad and white-tailed deer numbers appeared very high; certainly the most audad I have ever seen dead since I started working with you in Texas. [Audads go in mobs of anything from 20 to 40 head. Therefore the feeding female tabanid flies have plenty close by to feed on and thus the high incidence. - Mod.MHJ]
12. Control strategies varied across properties, some burning, some burial, some surface decon, some left alone entirely until after the carcasses desiccated. Some ranches were advised to put out CTC feed, which requires a script now, and some ranches were vaccinating, some ranches were told to do both at once (dart high dollar animals with vaccine and put out feed - which likely led to lower vaccine efficacy).

[We have been studying anthrax in west Texas over many years. Jason first went out as a graduate student in December 2003 to set up his dissertation research during the following summer on the Rio Vista Ranch. Many returns over the years with careful sampling. Thus his present findings of consistent genotype strains in respect to individual ranches, repeating previous observations. On this visit he took a new team of graduate students, and they were well lodged on one of the wildlife ranches. The ranchers know, respect, and trust us. And you see something new with each visit if for no other reason that of having a deeper knowledge of the area. Coincident epizootic hemorrhagic disease deaths in white-tailed deer with anthrax during the same period on the same property, so both diseases can affect the same populations at the same time. That is new, though obviously it may not be uncommon. People seldom look for diseases, usually just one or the other.

Whilst I have your attention, I would like you to consider "Sampling for _Bacillus anthracis_ spores in the environment:"

The accounts of the extraordinary survivability of anthrax spores are characterized by numerator data, unchallenged by denominators. Thus, the 250-years recovery of live spores from a bone collection found in an archeological excavation of a native boma in South Africa is frequently quoted but not of negative recoveries from other similar bones there or elsewhere. It is the exception, not the rule. In our experience, admittedly limited, the normal mortality in soils is around 30% per year and 3% in laboratory archival collections. Max Sterne's experience was that soil surface contamination in a pasture would last 3 months to 3 years. Logically strains repeatedly recovered from a limited area will have adjusted themselves to survive better there than new strains, or strains seen on another bunch of farms or ranches away from their preferred soils.

The Soviet experience with sampling bovine anthrax graves was that within 5-6 years, they would start recovering phage-negative avirulent strains; our sample of contaminated calcine magnesite from the Compton '72 outbreak had neither pX01 nor pX02 phages among the 200 000 spores/gm of minerals after 20 years sitting in a drawer in a glass vial.

The Chinese experience was that the top 7-8 cms of soil would, in time, have few viable spores. But there would be a layer of viable spores at that depth. Presumably, the heating and cooling of the surface soil and solar u/v light would take their toll. Is this correct?

However, rain will float spores upwards and carry them into the root mass of forage grazing, where they can germinate and multiply until all the nutrients have been used up. At which point they sporulate and are available to infect grazing cattle. How long spores will survive under this forage umbrella is unknown.

What are the dynamics of spore survival in a cattle water-trough? When first deposited by a bathing bloody-buzzard or vulture they are obvious enough and dangerous to any animal visiting that trough, but where do they lurk and what is their mortality rate? What water characteristics - mineral content and pH - make for safer revisiting or more longer dangers? Trough waters are not distilled but dilute crud heated by the sun and cooled at nights. Spore survival is presumably a function of pH and surface characteristics, whether sandy soil or lime coating. What encourages the longest survival?

Spore survival in a sandy loam should be limited. However, nearby "pot holes" or sloughs collect minerals and humus from plants taking advantage of stored rain. And so within a few meters of each other spores will survive and maybe multiply in one spot, but struggle to survive in another. But what are the numbers and rates?

All of these speculative situations are suitable for introducing graduate students to the realities and variances of the environment, and a place for them to learn by measuring and observing. For example a common sampling protocol will be needed such that surrounding possibly contaminated soil does not fall into the hole where the sample was taken, e.g., the need to insert a blocking wooden marker plug. You don't want to sample the same place twice. - Mod.MHJ
