[ProMED-mail is not a clinical listing but sometimes such information is
useful in preventing deaths from illnesses that have already occurred. In
a previous message, I commented on the obvious and considerable differences
in success of treatment of patients wit dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and
dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and asked for expert (proven successful)
opinion or advice as to regimens used. We are grateful to Dr. Lucy Chai
See Lum, University of Malaya Medical Centre, for the following. Obviously,
a critical preliminary issue is clinical acumen, i.e., recognition of the
problem. High survival rates in populations of patients who are
underdiagnosed is cheating. - Mod.CHC]

MANAGEMENT OF DENGUE SHOCK SYNDROME
DHF/DSS is characterised by three features: plasma leakage,
thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The
feature that is clinically dominant and therapeutically most important is
plasma leakage. Patients experience hypovolemic shock as a result of
plasma leakage. Thrombocytopenia and DIC are always present in varying
severity but only become clinically significant if the hypovolemic shock is
left untreated.
In our analysis of 77 patients with DSS, we looked at several factors that
might be associated with severe DIC, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and death
(outcome). Platelet counts at admission or at the time of detection of
hemorrhage, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and hematocrit
are NOT significantly associated with severe outcome. The factor that most
determines the outcome of DSS is the duration of hypovolemic shock
(p<0.00005) and the number of organ failure, which is another reflection of
the duration of shock.
We also studied another 27 patients to see if transfusions of platelets and
fresh frozen plasma will correct the DIC and thrombocytopenia. Not
surprisingly, whether or not patients have hemorrhage these blood products
do not make an impact on the parameters they are supposed to correct.
Patients with DSS should be treated urgently to correct the hypovolemia
with 0.9% saline solution, they should be carefully monitored over the
following 48 hours because they can go into secondary shock again and
again. The safest way to monitor them is clinically: pulse rate, BP, skin
perfusion, urine and serial hematocrit which is done at the bedside every
1-2 hours for the unstable patients. I find the bedside hematocrit most
useful but the result should always be interpreted with clinical
observations. Plasma leakage alone will increase hematocrit; plasma
leakage AND hemorrhage may not change the hematocrit a great deal. In the
latter case the patient's circulation will be unstable.
One should not need to infuse anymore IV fluids after 48 hours from the
onset of shock or if the patient is warm and stable. Onset of shock
usually occurs on day 3-5 of fever. Another factor related to hemorrhage
is trauma, therefore minimize invasive procedures such as CVP monitoring
unless in acute renal failure, no chest drains (do not drain pleural
effusions), if tracheal tubes or gastric tubes are necessary, use the oral
route to avoid trauma to adenoidal tissues which can bleed profusely when
traumatized. If massive pleural effusion occurs try to reduce IV fluids,
or if patient is stable, stop iv fluids earlier than 48 hours. One can try
small doses of frusemide if patient has very stable circulation.
In cases of significant hemorrhage, transfuse the freshest red cells,
platelets and fresh frozen plasma. Try to keep patient alive for 48 hours
after which time the hemorrhage will stop. You will then need to manage the
various organ dysfunction such as liver or renal. If they survive till
this point chances of complete recovery are good. One should look out for
secondary sepsis, in our series it is usually _Enterobacter_ first,
followed by fungal sepsis. The _Enterobacter_ may be the result of
bacterial translocation from the gut during the hypoperfusion state. If the
shock has been prolonged it may be wise to use antibiotics earlier rather
than later.
In some cases, early hemorrhage is covert. All you see is a patient whose
shock does not respond to infusions of normal saline or if there is
response it is only temporary. In these cases the hematocrit may not be as
high as it would be had there been only plasma leakage; or the hematocrit
has reduced but the patient is still unstable. (In the presence of plasma
leakage alone, saline infusion will reduce the hematocrit AND the patient's
circulation will also improve.) Clinical acumen is very important. Blood
transfusion will result in a more stable patient.
In summary, intravenous fluids such as 0.9% saline are the first line of
treatment of DSS. Monitoring the hematocrit, preferably at the bedside and
as frequently as is necessary is the mainstay of monitoring, together with
clinical monitoring. IV fluids should be stopped at or before 48 hours
from onset of shock to avoid too much pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
Blood transfusion will be necessary to stabilize a patient with
significant hemorrhage.
