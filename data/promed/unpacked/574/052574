Re: Undiagnosed deaths, macaque monkeys-Japan (02), RFI
----------------------------------------
The statement was made that the disease "is different from Ebola
hemorrhagic disease that also infects humans." Has Ebola Reston been
excluded? It infects but has yet to cause disease in humans.

[Thanks to Dr Lenoir for this plausible suggestion; the possibility
that Ebola Reston deserves to be taken into consideration in the
differential diagnosis of the described cases has been raised also by
ProMED-mail's moderators Tom Yuill and Tam Garland. There are
additional candidate agents, probably. We are all in wait for
clarifications of the issue or additional data, if/when they become
available from the relevant scientific institute. - Mod.AS]
