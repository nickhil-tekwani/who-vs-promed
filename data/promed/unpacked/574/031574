13 million livestock at risk as deadly disease spreads
------------------------------------------------------
An estimated 13 million sheep and goats in Rift Valley Province are at risk
following an outbreak of a viral disease which has killed hundreds of
animals. Veterinary officers in the province told the Nation yesterday [31
Mar 2008] that the outbreak of peste de petits ruminants [PPR] was of great
concern to them, as the country had no vaccine to contain it. The Ministry
of Livestock and Fisheries Development has placed an order for one million
doses of vaccines from Ethiopia and Sudan.

The provincial director of veterinary services, Dr Geoffrey Muttai, told
the Nation that the disease was first detected in Oropoi and Lokichoggio
divisions of Turkana North District in March 2006 [see commentary].

Dr Muttai said that was the 1st time the disease was reported in Kenya
although it had been prevalent in neighbouring countries. He said it was
suspected that the viral disease spread in the Turkana North District
following the movement of stolen livestock across the Kenya-Sudan border.
"This is a viral disease which mainly affects sheep and goats. A sick
animal normally develops pneumonia before it becomes diarrhoeic. The
disease normally kills an animal within a week or 2," he said.

Dr Muttai added: "We are conducting the vaccination as well as sensitising
livestock owners on how to check the spread of the disease, which has a
high mortality rate. The disease is mainly spread when a sick animal comes
into a contact with a healthy one or when a sick animal contaminates
pasture or water points." He said that following the outbreak the
veterinary department treated 1.4 million sheep and goats in Turkana
District, where hundreds of animals had died, after vaccines were procured
from outside the country.

[PPR (peste des petit ruminants; also known as kata, pseudorinderpest, and
stomatitis-pneumoenteritis complex) is an acute contagious disease caused
by a morbillivirus in the family _Paramyxoviridae_, antigenically very
similar to the rinderpest virus. It affects small ruminants and
occasionally wild animals. PPR causes considerable economic losses, with
mortality -- particularly in goats -- sometimes exceeding 50 per cent in
infected flocks. The clinical disease, which resembles rinderpest in
cattle, is usually acute, characterised by severe pyrexia (which can last
for 3-5 days), serous ocular and nasal discharges, erosive mouth lesions,
and diarrhoea; but unlike rinderpest, pneumonia is a part of the syndrome.
At necropsy, characteristic zebra markings may occur in the large
intestine, but are not a consistent finding. Lesions also occur in the
lungs showing congestion or bronchopneumonia when associated with bacterial
infection.

The disease must be differentiated from rinderpest, bluetongue, foot and
mouth disease, and other exanthemous conditions as well as gastroenteric
conditions caused by bacteria (such as, salmonellosis) and helminths.

PPR occurs in countries in Africa lying between the Equator and the Sahara
including countries of the Horn of Africa; since the late 1980s, the
disease has spread to the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most of the Middle
Eastern countries, and eastwards. Outbreaks of PPR are now known to be
common in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and (since July
2007) China (Tibet). For the timelines of 35 OIE (Office International des
Epizooties; World Organisation for Animal Health) member countries who have
officially reported PPR during the years 2005-2007, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=disease_timelines>. The said
timeline, however, is incomplete; several infected countries, such as
Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and others are listed under "Disease not
reported during this report period". A survey in Syria has shown the
existence of PPR infection.

Though occasionally infected, wildlife does not seem to play a significant
role in the epidemiology of PPR; the disease does not infect humans.

Kenya reported to the OIE its 1st outbreak of PPR in January 2007.
According to the said report, the disease had started on 3 Aug 2006 and was
confirmed on 17 Aug 2006. See the report in ProMED-mail posting 20070117.0226.
