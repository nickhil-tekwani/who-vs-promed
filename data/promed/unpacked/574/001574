Medical team reconfirms no signs of anthrax in sheep
----------------------------------------------------
The Sindh High Court's (SHC) nominated medical team on Sunday again took samples from the imported Australian sheep and reconfirmed that there was no signs or symptoms of anthrax in the animals. The committee included Prof Dr Rafiq Khanani of the Dow University of Health Sciences and 4 other experts. The team will submit its report to the SHC on Monday morning.

On Saturday [22 Sep 2012], the committee had recommended stopping the culling of the sheep after its preliminary findings showed no evidence of anthrax in the sheep.

The court had ordered the constitution of the committee after the importer of the 22 000 sheep had moved the court, seeking a stay against the government's order to cull the animals.

The provincial authorities had claimed that the sheep were infected with contagious scabby mouth disease.

Poultry Vaccine Centre Director Dr Nazeer Kalhoro had submitted before the court that anthrax was detected in the three dead sheep, which had been secretly transferred to another farm by the importer. He had maintained that the decomposition of the carcasses indicated anthrax and that was why they were burnt and buried.

He had also submitted that the sheep were examined and the symptoms indicated that the sheep were infected with scabby mouth. However, his claims were disputed by the petitioner's counsel.

[It seems that an expert veterinary team, believing that the above medical team had diagnosed anthrax, took exception to this; see: http://www.brecorder.com/general-news/172/1241521/
But they pointed out that any confirmatory decision must await results of laboratory examinations and analyses, and that any such reports from Sindh and Islamabad would be unavoidably delayed because of public holidays on the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (21 - 23 Sep 2012). A fair comment.

For the moment the culling has been stopped. - Mod.MHJ
