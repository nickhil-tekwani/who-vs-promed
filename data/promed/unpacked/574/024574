At least 60 people who participated in a celebration of baptism were treated in emergency wards of hospitals in Ambato, Latacunga, and Salcedo with symptoms of food poisoning on the night of Sun 22 Aug and morning of Mon 23 Aug 2021.

As indicated in a statement from the Zonal Coordination 3 of the Ministry of Health, the attendees were residents of the sectors of Huachi Grande (Tungurahua) and Cusubamba (Cotopaxi). The patients presented with a picture of food poisoning from eating food contaminated with _Salmonella_. The document detailed that 35 people were treated at Ambato General Hospital, 4 at Yerovi Mackuart Hospital, 3 at IESS Latacunga Hospital, and 8 at Latacunga General Hospital.

Diego Rubio, an epidemiologist at the Hospital Ambato, said the facility activated emergency protocols and treated 35 adults and 13 children who had mild to moderate symptom such as stomach pain, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. "The patients were hydrated and given antibiotics for their recovery," [he said]. The doctor mentioned that only one girl was kept in the facility due to dehydration, while the other people were discharged.

Rubio assured that, after the investigations of the doctors, it was determined that it was a poisoning caused by the ingestion of poorly prepared foods that were contaminated with _Salmonella_. The epidemiologist mentioned that before eating, it is necessary to verify that [the foods] are in good condition through the smell and taste.

[The post appears to state that the cause of the illnesses was salmonellosis. In general, salmonellosis requires only symptomatic treatment, and antimicrobials are avoided to decrease the risk of chronic carriage.

"Cotopaxi is one of the provinces of Ecuador. The capital is Latacunga. The province contains the Cotopaxi volcano, an intermittent volcano with a height of 19 347 feet (5897 m)" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotopaxi_Province). Its location in central Ecuador can be found on a map at the above link.

Tungurahua, another province in Ecuador, is named after the Tungurahua volcano, an active stratovolcano with a height of 16 480 ft [5023 m]. The capital of the province is Ambato. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungurahua_Province for Tungurahua province's location within Ecuador. - Mod.LL
