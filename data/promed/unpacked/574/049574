There are apparently rumors in North Kivu that the government is using or testing Chinese and/or Russian #Ebola vaccines. That is untrue, @jess_ilunga tells me. The @MinSanteRDC is trying to dispel these rumors via its daily Ebola update.

[The Chinese vaccine has been discussed but is not in general use. Similarly, a Russian vaccine has been administered in Guinea -- see Ebola update (150): Congo DR (NK, IT) cases, summary, Guinea 20181215.6211011. Little is known about the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Only the Merck vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, is being administered to the 1st-line responders, case contacts, and others in need in the DRC. - Mod.LK]

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Wed 19 Dec 2018. Seven new cases and deaths in DRC's Ebola outbreak
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/seven-new-cases-and-deaths-drcs-ebola-outbreak
[byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) ministry of health recorded 7 new Ebola cases -- and 7 new deaths -- in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

Officials have now reported 549 total Ebola cases and 326 deaths. 82 suspected cases are under investigation.

Of the new cases, 3 occurred in Katwa, 2 in Komanda, and 2 in Mabalako. 4 of the 7 new deaths were community deaths (2 each in Katwa and Komanda), which raises the risk of transmission.

Three more healthcare workers infected
--------------------------------------
Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its latest situation report on the outbreak today [19 Dec 2018], noting 3 additional infections in healthcare workers. The healthcare workers are from Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Musiene [North Kivu], and bring the total number of healthcare workers infected in this outbreak to 53. 18 of them have died.

Overall the case fatality rate for this outbreak is 58%. In recent weeks, fewer cases have been reported in Beni, the epicenter of the outbreak throughout much of the past 5 months. But new hot spots have emerged, WHO warned.

"The outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, and new clusters are emerging elsewhere. Over the last 21 days (25 Nov-16 Dec 2018), 120 confirmed and probable cases were reported from 14 health zones, the majority of which were reported from the major urban centres and towns in Katwa (27), Beni (27), Butembo (17), Komanda [Ituri] (16), and Mabalako (12)," WHO said.

WHO also drew attention to a single case in Biena health zone, a newly affected area northwest of Butembo. The case was linked to recent cases in Mabalako, and the agency said the case highlights the risk of disease spread in the region.

Almost 50 000 vaccinated
------------------------
The DRC said ring vaccination with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine continues, with 49 384 people vaccinated in the DRC, including 19 060 in Beni, 9018 in Katwa, and 5335 in Mabalako [North Kivu].

The vaccine also continues to be used among healthcare workers in Goma, the capital of North Kivu, the DRC health ministry said. Most of the vaccine recipients are case contacts. The WHO has more than 30 000 contacts registered to date, and as of 16 Dec, 6430 remained under surveillance.

"The daily follow-up rate among listed contacts by health zones ranged from 90-93%" from 11-16 Dec 2018, the WHO said. Health workers are also responding to an average of 149 alerts of suspected cases per day, of which 81 per day are validated as requiring further investigation.

Situation update: data as reported by Sun 16 Dec 2018
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Situation update:
The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, despite a multitude of challenges. By using proven public health measures as well as novel tools at hand, WHO remains confident the outbreak can be contained and brought to an end. During the reporting period (data from 11 to 16 Dec 2018), 39 new confirmed cases were reported from Komanda (9), Katwa (9), Mabalako (6), Beni (3), Kalunguta (3), Butembo (4), Kyondo (2), Oicha (1), Musienene (1) and Biena (1) -- a newly affected area north-west of Butembo. Epidemiological links have been established between the recent cases in central Mabakalo and Biena health zone. Meanwhile, the recent case in Musienene comes 32 days after the last reported case. These events highlighting the high risk of both spread and reintroduction of the virus to previously affected areas, and the need to maintain vigilance in surveillance and all aspects of the response across North Kivu and Ituri, surrounding provinces and neighbouring countries.

[3] Concerns
- Wed 19 Dec 2018. Ebola fears raise concerns in already fraught Congo election
[CBC, abridged, edited]
https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/congo-election-ebola-fears-1.4952019

What's an election campaign without shaking hands with potential voters? Congolese candidates in the thick of an Ebola outbreak, now the 2nd deadliest in Congo history, are finding out in uncomfortable ways. Jaribu Muliwavyo seeks another term as provincial deputy in North Kivu, the restless centre of the outbreak. He's sad when he arrives in communities and isn't permitted to greet traditional chiefs properly, with a warm clasp of hands. "They take that as an insult," Muliwavyo told The Associated Press. This election, he mused, is "a real puzzle".

The current Ebola outbreak is like no other, and it promises trouble for Congo's presidential election on [Sun 23 Dec 2018]. Unrest by dozens of rebel groups in this Central African nation with 40 million voters already posed a challenge to the long-delayed vote. Then Ebola, a deadly virus spread via contact with infected bodily fluids, emerged in a part of eastern Congo that had never seen it before.

Congolese officials have openly worried about the risks of holding an election in a densely populated, highly mobile border area where health officials are fighting to bring Ebola under control amid rebel attacks. Nearly 550 cases of the virus have been reported so far, with over 300 dead.

Touchscreen voting amid outbreak
--------------------------------
To make things yet more complicated, Congo for the 1st time is using voting machines, a rarity in Africa. The opposition and some observers warn that the technology could be used to manipulate the results. A coalition of armed groups in North Kivu has told the government to stop using the machines or expect violence, and the election commission on [Sun 16 Dec 2018] said unidentified people had tried to attack its warehouses in Beni.

Earlier this month [December 2018], thousands of voting machines were destroyed by arson at a Kinshasa warehouse.

Some living in the Ebola outbreak zone have more immediate concerns, as voters will choose candidates by tapping on a touchscreen. "The election commission tells us that it will use voting machines that many people will be touching and there is the risk of Ebola spreading," said one man who lives in the Beni region, where rebels have killed more than 1500 people over the past 4 years. Between Ebola and the attacks, many people in the community have already fled, he said.

Disinfectant at polling stations
--------------------------------
Never has an election of this magnitude occurred in a large Ebola outbreak, said Dr Marie-Roseline Darnycka Belizaire, who manages the response in the city of Butembo for WHO. "This epidemic is the most challenging we've ever had. And with an election in the middle, you can imagine," she said.

But there has been progress. All political parties have made a declaration about Ebola, recognizing the risks. "Ebola doesn't know politics. Ebola is Ebola, for everyone," Belizaire said. "We have them educating their voters. We have gel in industrial numbers. Handwashing stations in meetings."

The United Nations peacekeeping mission says it has deployed 8 tonnes of disinfectant and hand sanitizer for use in all polling stations in the Ebola outbreak zone, while 3000 troops with its Force Intervention Brigade are in Beni to "neutralize" the armed groups and protect health workers.

Protective gear
---------------
Belizaire is among the Ebola workers who have negotiated with rebel groups for access to "red zones" where insecurity is high. It takes patience and trust, along with extraordinary measures.

A security agent makes an assessment every morning on whether it's safe to go out. Escorts can include Congolese security forces or UN peacekeepers. Belizaire has protective gear that she must be able to put on within 30 seconds.

[There are a number of serious problems on many fronts that must be taken into consideration during the election including decontaminating the touchscreen, people coming to vote are infectious without yet showing overt symptoms, rebel forces, and more. Elections can be a challenge in the best of times. Our hopes are with the country. - Mod.LK]

- Wed 19 Dec 2018. Ebola alert on the border between Uganda and the DRC
[Media Congo, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-45727_alerte_ebola_a_la_frontiere_entre_l_ouganda_et_la_rdc.html

Hands reddened by washing them with chlorinated water, SM has just entered Uganda. She turns around and looks across the bridge to the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Ebola virus continues to spread. "I'm afraid," blows the 50 year old Congolese, who crosses several times a week the muddy river Lhubiriha to buy salt in Mpondwe, Uganda, which she will then sell in her shop. "Ebola has not reached our village yet, but it looks like it's coming," she says, pointing out that a case has been confirmed within 70 km [approx 43 mi] of Lhubiriha, named after the river that it borders.

At the border, Red Cross volunteers organize the arrivals, telling them to disinfect their hands and shoes in chlorinated water and carefully checking their temperature; measures taken to prevent the spread of Ebola on the Ugandan side. "There are people with family in the Congo, small farmers who have a garden here and another in the Congo, there are children who live on one side and go to school on the other", says Samuel Kasimba, who coordinates efforts in Kasese District to prevent a spread to Uganda. During the market days in Mpondwe, twice a week, more than 20 000 people cross the border.

A dreaded Christmas
-------------------
As Christmas approaches, the risk will increase, says Andrew Bakainaga, a senior WHO official in Uganda. "The Christmas period is a concern because we know there is a lot of movement because people buy food or come to visit relatives. We expect the number of people crossing the border to increase from about 300 000 to 500 000 per month," he told AFP.

The DRC is also organizing elections, including the presidential election on [23 Dec 2018]. In this country accustomed to violence, especially political, many fear that people flee en masse to Uganda. In the past year, more than 123 000 Congolese have sought refuge at their neighbor's, fleeing the violence in eastern DRC. "Our goal is to detect any suspicious cases early, before this person has many contacts. We use radio programs and health teams in the villages that educate people about Ebola," says Kasimba. "The epidemic is getting closer to Uganda, God forbid, but we are ready if it happens," he says.

- Thu 20 Dec 2018. Opinion: In DRC Ebola crisis, every red line has been crossed
[Devex, abridged, edited]
https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-in-drc-ebola-crisis-every-red-line-has-been-crossed-94061
[byline: Jean-Philippe Marcoux]

The international community must urgently apply the hard-won lessons from previous outbreaks of Ebola to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the country's deadliest outbreak rages across its conflict-hit eastern provinces.

Within the constraints of this difficult context [in the DRC where the outbreak is taking place], the DRC Ministry of Health is leading the international medical response with WHO, but more support is urgently needed -- specifically, funding for more agile partners who are already on the ground in conflict-hit areas, and are now on the frontlines of the epidemic too.

Many of these partners, such as my organization Mercy Corps, already have long-term and trusted relationships with communities. We are securing safe access to water as well as training health care workers, school administrators, parents, children and the general public on Ebola and how to prevent the disease. Training traditional health practitioners in their response helps us to address the population's fears and misconceptions about Ebola and disseminate accurate information. Community engagement is going to be critical to curbing the spread of Ebola and controlling this epidemic.

A curfew in densely populated North Kivu has slashed the number of hours available to treat victims and work on prevention. Continuing armed group attacks impede the medical response, and the huge number of people forced to flee exacerbates the rate of Ebola transmission. Medical experts see no end in sight, with WHO warning the disease is likely to spread well into 2019, especially after it reached the city of Butembo, home to nearly a million people, this month [December 2018].

Inadequate and short-term funding is a major barrier. Financing just the medical response without simultaneously supporting community engagement undermines the efficacy of the overall response, as does funding that just focuses on the emergency at hand.

Building out a comprehensive response to the outbreak is our best shot at containing this epidemic, preventing future recurrences, and alleviating the suffering of the population of North Kivu who is affected by a continuing armed crisis.

For too long, the humanitarian crisis in eastern DRC has been ignored. A lack of infrastructure, weak governance, and stunted economy has only intensified the suffering of the Congolese. But this resource-rich country heads to the polls on [23 Dec 2018], which could signal change for the African nation. Let's not undermine this by failing to provide adequate support for the worst Ebola epidemic to strike the country.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-crisis-poll/exclusive-ravaged-by-ebola-and-war-congo-named-most-neglected-crisis-of-2018-idUSKCN1OJ009
[byline: Emma Batha]

With an Ebola epidemic raging and millions caught in a forgotten "catastrophe" of conflict and hunger, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was the most neglected crisis of 2018, according to an annual Thomson Reuters Foundation poll of aid agencies. This year's survey was unusual for the high number of "most forgotten crises", with experts also listing the Central African Republic, Lake Chad Basin, Yemen, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Burundi, Nigeria and, for the 1st time, Venezuela.

But Congo's [DRC's] "mega-crisis" barely made headlines, they said, even as the country gears up for landmark elections on [Sun 23 Dec 2018] which some fear could stoke further unrest. "The brutality of the conflict is shocking, the national and international neglect outrageous," said Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council. "I visited Congo this year and have seldom witnessed such a gap between needs and assistance."

Congo, where 13 million people in a population of 82 million need help, also topped the annual Thomson Reuters Foundation poll in 2017, but agencies said the situation had deteriorated. As many as 6 of 21 agencies polled named Congo as the most neglected crisis, including WFP, Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, ActionAid, International Rescue Committee, and Christian Aid.

[4] Recognition
- Thu 20 Dec 2018. Ebola's other unsung heroes: the planners who keep the response running
[StatNews, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/12/20/ebola-unsung-heroes-logisticians-response/
[byline: Helen Branswell]

When we think of Ebola outbreak responses, chances are what come to mind are courageous doctors and nurses caring for people afflicted by one of the cruelest and most deadly diseases known to man. What we tend to overlook is the mountain of work needed to ensure there is a treatment unit in which to care for the sick, and that there are boots and gloves and aprons and face shields to protect the medical staff.

Outbreak logisticians are the people who supply the response teams, who find them beds to fall into at the end of exhausting days, and food to sustain them and vehicles to transport them. It's their job to create the conditions in which the people who know how to stop Ebola can get that essential task done.

When the right equipment is in the right place and in the right amounts, it "seems like magic," Molinaro [chief of operation support logistics for WHO's emergencies program] said. But in reality, it's a lot of hard work. Molinaro's crew is supporting the upward of 300 people working for the WHO in north eastern Congo to extinguish this latest Ebola outbreak, which is now the 2nd largest in history. As of [Wed 19 Dec 2018] there have been 549 cases and 326 deaths since the outbreak began, likely in late April [2018].

In addition to WHO, there are several dozen international agencies and non-governmental organizations assisting the Congolese government in the battle to end this outbreak. They all need accommodations, meals, medical equipment, power generators, structures in which to care for the sick, vehicles in which to move from town to town, satellite phones or cellphone SIM cards, and more -- much more.

[The support staff behind the scenes are the backbone of the response, just as they are in other situations, whether it be the lighting and sound technicians behind the scenes in the theatre or building maintenance behind the scenes in a laboratory or school. When everything is running smoothly, we do not even think about them, but blame falls on them when things go wrong. These hardworking dedicated individuals are not sufficiently recognized for their efforts. Helen Branswell has written an important piece reminding us how much these individuals bring to the effort to control Ebola.

While much of the world is celebrating the joy of this holiday season, many others in the world are suffering from starvation, disease, poverty, and more. The DRC is in the midst of an Ebola outbreak, which is complicated by the holidays. Elections where many people come together are approaching on 23 Dec 2018, people are crossing borders and visiting with each other exacerbating control of transmission of the virus, and provisions needed for the control effort are slowed during the holidays. While we hope for the best, the country and all the selfless individuals working there must maintain vigilance to prevent the outbreak from going out of control during these times. - Mod.LK
