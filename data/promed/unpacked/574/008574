[1] South Sulawesi - 7 more suspected cases

Seven people showing symptoms of bird flu have been admitted to a hospital
in Makassar, South Sulawesi. The patients, most less than 10 years old,
were being treated in the Pakis isolation room at Wahidin Sudirohusodo
Hospital on Thu [5 Oct 2006] for high fever and vomiting. "Our preliminary
clinical diagnosis was that they were infected with the bird flu virus, so
we moved them to the isolation room," said M. Halik, who is responsible for
bird flu treatment at the hospital.
Halik said the 7 patients' blood had tested negative for the H5N1 bird flu
virus. To be certain of the diagnosis, however, he said doctors needed the
results of tests on the patients' nasal mucus from a laboratory in Jakarta.
"We've sent the specimens to Jakarta and are waiting for the test results,"
he said. Family members said chickens near the patients' homes had been
falling ill and dying rapidly without any clear reason, Halik added.
The Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital is somewhat overwhelmed by the increasing
number of suspected bird flu patients it is treating. Two isolation rooms
designed to hold 2 patients each have had to accommodate twice that number.
According to the Ministry of Health, a total of 69 people have contracted
bird flu in Indonesia. Of those, 52 have died.
Meanwhile, in Central Java, many chickens have fallen ill and died in
recent days in a possible outbreak of the disease. The H5N1 virus is
believed to be killing poultry in 17 kampongs in the Central Java regencies
of Semarang, Temanggung, Purbalingga, Pekalongan and Pemalang, according to
Kurmaningsih, the head of the Central Java Livestock Husbandry Office.
Rapid tests on dead chickens in Lebdosari kampong, Gisikdrono, in Semarang,
indicated they had the virus. Local authorities later culled 35 other
chickens in the kampong to prevent the disease from spreading.
Kurmaningsih said her office had asked for 10 million more doses of H5N1
vaccine from the central government. "We currently have 12 million doses of
the vaccine, but we want more in order to be ready for a much bigger
outbreak," she said in Semarang on Thursday. Kurmaningsih explained that
despite the massive poultry vaccination drive launched earlier this year
through a program called the National Movement against Avian Influenza, the
infections which started hitting the province in 2003 have continued to
spread. Kurmaningsih said under the program, her office distributed 50
million doses of vaccine to poultry owners in the province in 2004, 14
million doses in 2005 and another 22 million doses this year. "We culled
chickens in Boyolali in 2004. But now we have no plans to do so because the
social impacts (of culling) are so widespread. Besides that we still don't
know whether there will be compensation for the culled chickens," she
explained.
In a related development, the Ministry of Health plans to build modern
laboratories in North Sumatra to diagnose bird flu infections, Aswin Soefi
Lubi, dean of the School of Medicine at the Islamic University of North
Sumatra, said Thu [5 Oct 2006]. Aswin said one of the laboratories will be
built at his medical school. They will be used to test blood from suspected
bird flu victims without having to send the samples to Jakarta.

[Preliminary diagnostic testing has not confirmed that any of these
patients are suffering from avian influenza. The observation that most are
less than 10 years old and experiencing vomiting suggests that the
diagnosis of avian influenza will not be confirmed by further testing.
Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]

[2] Bali, Java & Sumatra - bird viruses unchanged

The bird flu virus that's killed one person a week in Indonesia this year
hasn't mutated to become more contagious to people, the country's
Agriculture Ministry said, citing an analysis of virus samples. Tests on 49
samples taken from birds on the islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali showed
the H5N1 avian influenza virus has undergone no major changes, the Ministry
said in a statement today [Thu 5 Oct 2006]. The analysis was undertaken by
a World [Health?] Organization for Animal Health reference laboratory in
Geelong, Australia.
Flu viruses make minor genetic changes when they reproduce, though most of
the time they don't become more infectious in the process. Disease trackers
are monitoring H5N1 to check whether it has mutated to become easily
transmissible between people. Millions could die if the virus sparks a
global outbreak.
In the past 3 years, H5N1 is known to have infected 252 people in 10
countries, killing 148 of them, the World Health Organization said on 3 Oct
2006. Almost all human cases have been linked to close contact with sick or
dead birds, such as children playing with them or adults butchering them or
plucking feathers, according to the United Nations agency. Indonesia has
reported 69 human H5N1 cases, including 52 deaths, since July 2005. So far
in 2006, at least 40 people have died from the virus, mostly through
contact with infected fowl. About 300 million poultry are raised in
backyards in the world's 4th-most-populous country.
Samples of the H5N1 virus taken from birds were collected between September
in 2005 and March, Elly Sawitri, an official at the agriculture ministry's
avian flu center, said in a telephone interview today. Animal health
authorities will dispatch samples collected in the past 6 months for
analysis, Sawitri said. Indonesia agreed to deposit avian flu genetic
information in public databases, such as GenBank, 4 months ago to help
scientists better track dominant variants of the virus and to speed
preparations for vaccines to fight a human outbreak.
The virus may have infected as much as 27 percent of fowl and caged birds
in the Southeast Asian nation, Musny Suatmodjo, Indonesia's director of
animal health, said last week. The Health Ministry and Singapore's Temasek
Life Sciences Laboratory Ltd. are developing a diagnostic kit to speed the
diagnosis of human H5N1 cases. The kit may be available within a year, Tan
Kok Keng, Temasek Life's chief operating officer, told reporters in Jakarta
today.

[What constitutes a genotypic change enabling H5N1 avian influenza to be
transmitted from human-to-human can only be conjectured at this juncture.
It must be assumed that the statement, "The H5N1 avian influenza virus has
undergone no major changes", means no more than that no progressive or
cumulative changes have been observed in a comparison of 49 isolates of
avian influenza virus isolated fro birds on 3 Indonesian islands. - Mod.CP]
