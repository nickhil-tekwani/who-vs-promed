TICK BORNE ENCEPHALITIS STATISTICS: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
===========================================================
Does anyone have figures for the number of Tick Borne encephalitis cases,
by country, by year, for the last ten years or so? WHO Geneva doesn't have
the data.
I would be happy to receive data from any individual national health
authorities who might have this information.
If the information can't be sent by e-mail, my postal address is listed
below.
