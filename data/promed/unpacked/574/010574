["The first line of defense against avian influenza is the early detection and reporting of disease outbreaks to allow a rapid response. Putting in place accurate warning systems is thus essential to efficiently prevent and control the disease.

"Because of its capacity to rapidly spread across regions, timely reporting of cases is key to enable countries to anticipate and get prepared for potential new outbreaks of avian influenza."

"Strict biosecurity measures and good hygiene practices are essential to prevent avian influenza outbreaks, because of the resistance of the virus in the environment and its highly contagious nature.

"Relevant measures notably include keeping poultry away from contact with wild birds, ensuring good hygiene in poultry housing and equipment and reporting bird illnesses and deaths to the Veterinary Services" (https://www.woah.org/en/disease/avian-influenza/#ui-id-3).

"The transmission of avian influenza from birds to humans is usually sporadic and happens in a specific context. People who are in close and repeated contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments are at risk for acquiring avian influenza.

"However, due to ongoing circulation of various subtypes, outbreaks of avian influenzaâ€¯continue to be a global public health concern" (https://www.woah.org/en/disease/avian-influenza/#ui-id-1). - Mod.CRD
