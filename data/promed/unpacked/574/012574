In 2021, 180 cases of leptospirosis were confirmed, compared to an average of 117 annual cases over the period 2008-2021. With 67 cases reported, the month of April concentrated the maximum number of cases, 3 months after the peak of rainfall recorded in January. Most of the cases focus on the period from March to May. The sex ratio (M/F) of cases reported in 2021 was 2.7 (131 men and 49 women). The median age was 26 years old. Two-thirds of the cases (67.2%) were between 15 and 64 years old, and 30% were under 14 years old. The sample was taken during hospitalization for nearly 1/3 of confirmed cases (30.9%).

Among the 52 people who could be contacted, at least one risky activity or exposure had been found in 44 of the cases, or 84.6%. These included agricultural activity (most often without wearing boots and gloves) for 20 cases, river activity such as swimming or laundry for 14 cases, or the presence of rats in or near the home for 27 cases.

Leptospirosis is a worldwide bacterial zoonosis (more common in the tropics) caused by _Leptospira_ spp. These bacteria are likely to infect a large number of wild mammals (rats, tengues, shrews, etc.) and domestic ones (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs), which excrete them in their urine. Infection in humans occurs through direct contact with the urine of infected animals or through contact with an environment contaminated with urine, such as surface water or soil. Leptospires can penetrate through broken skin and mucous membranes.

Clinical manifestations range from mild flu syndrome to potentially fatal multi-organ failure. Asymptomatic forms are commonly described during epidemiological investigations. In its typical expression, leptospirosis begins after an incubation of 4 to 19 days, with the sudden onset of fever with chills, myalgia, headache, and digestive disorders and can progress to sepsis with visceral damage: liver, kidney, meningeal, pulmonary...

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings.

Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. The rainy season in Mayotte occurs between November and April, when the monsoon from the north floods the island (https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/indian-ocean/myt-climate.htm). Human activities that place people at increased risk for leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming and doing other water sports in rivers, gardening or farming, and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886).

Mayotte (pop. almost 300 00 residents as of January 2022), consisting of several islands, the largest of which is Grande-Terre, is one of the overseas departments of France (together with Guadeloupe, La Reunion, and French Guiana); it is located in the northern Mozambique Channel in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Southeast Africa, between northwestern Madagascar and northeastern Mozambique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayotte).
