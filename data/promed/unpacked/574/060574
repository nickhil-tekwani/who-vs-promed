A recent outbreak in Dulovo belies the fact that measles rates in Bulgaria
and surrounding countries have decreased considerably in recent decades.
See graph:
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/measles-bularia.png>.

We may assume that decreasing rates are the result of excellent vaccine
coverage, which currently exceeds 90 per cent for all countries in the
region. See graph:

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Berger for provision of these data. The high
rates of vaccine coverage and the consequent success in elimination of
measles virus infection in Bulgaria and neighboring countries contrasts
with the poorer performance of some western European countries and the UK
in particular. - Mod.CP]
