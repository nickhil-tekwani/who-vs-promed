Update on polio in central Africa -- polio confirmed in Equatorial Guinea, linked to outbreak in Cameroon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Equatorial Guinea, 3 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported, the 1st polio in the country since 1999. Genetic sequencing indicates these cases are linked to an ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Cameroon which has subsequently been detected in Equatorial Guinea. The cases had onset of paralysis on [28 Jan 2014], [19 Jan 2014] and [24 Mar 2014], from Centro Sur, Bioko Norte and Litoral. Outbreak response in Equatorial Guinea is currently being planned, including National Immunization Days (NIDs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) on [21-24 Apr 2014]. An estimated 40 percent of children are fully immunized against polio in the country.

On [17 Mar 2014], the World Health Organization (WHO) had elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to 'very high' (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_03_17_polio/en/). The risk assessment was elevated due to: confirmation of 3 additional WPV1 cases (with onset of paralysis on [6, 25 and 31 Jan 2014]) from 3 new regions of Cameroon, confirming continued WPV transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of 4 cases in October 2013; gaps in surveillance; and, influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic. The confirmation of new cases in Cameroon resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity on [11-13 Apr 2014], and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality of immunization campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.

Immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity are also being assessed in neighbouring countries, in particular in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. In Gabon, a nationwide immunization campaign is planned for [22-26 Apr 2014] (targeting all children aged less than 15 years), and in the Republic of Congo, a nationwide activity will be conducted on 1 May 2014.

It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health (http://www.who.int/ith/chapters/en/) recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

Data in WHO as of 16 Apr 2013 for 2013 data and 15 Apr 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
- In central Africa, a new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in Equatorial Guinea. In total, 3 cases have now been reported from the country; genetic sequencing indicates the cases are linked to an ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Cameroon. Outbreak response in the country is currently being planned.
- On [17 Mar 2014], the World Health Organization (WHO) had elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to 'very high.' The risk assessment was elevated due to: confirmation of additional WPV1 cases from 3 new regions of Cameroon confirming continued WPV transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of 4 cases in October 2013; gaps in surveillance; and, influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic.
- Immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity are also being assessed in neighbouring countries, in particular in Gabon and the Republic of Congo, and additional immunization activities are being planned in these countries for May [2014].

Afghanistan
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [25 Feb 2014], from Muhmand Dara district in Nangarhar province, Eastern Region. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 is 4, and 14 for 2013.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3, with the most recent cVDPV2 case in March 2013 from Kandahar province, Southern Region.
- Nationwide SIAs using bivalent OPV are planned for [20-22 Apr 2014].

Nigeria
- No new WPV cases were reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 remains at 1 and for 2013 at 53.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is 1, and for 2013 is 4. The most recent cVDPV case had onset of paralysis on [9 Feb 2014] (from Damboa, Borno).
- Analysis of recent Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) indicates that the overall quality, i.e. coverage, continues to improve, including in highest-risk areas. According to Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), almost 90 percent of Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the 11 high-risk states achieved coverage of at least 80 percent during IPDs in March [2014]. This compares to less than 65 percent of LGAs in these same states achieving the same level of coverage just 12 months ago.
- The most recent nationwide IPDs took place on [12-14 Apr 2014], using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV. Subnational IPDs in northern Nigeria are planned for May and June [2014].

Pakistan
- A total of 4 new WPV1 cases were reported this week including 2 from South Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas -- FATA, one from Bannu district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and one from Karachi (Khiorangi), Sindh, bringing the total number of cases for 2014 to 47. The most recent reported case had onset of paralysis on [30 Mar 2014] from Khiorangi, previously a polio-free district.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV case had an onset of paralysis [8 Mar 2014], from North Waziristan, FATA. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 45 for 2013, and 7 for 2014.
- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in the world (both wild and cVDPV2). Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in all areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighboring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- The densely populated Peshawar valley is considered to be the main 'engine' of poliovirus transmission, alongside North Waziristan, due to large-scale population movements through Peshawar from across this region, and into other areas of Pakistan. The quality of operations must be urgently improved in Peshawar, and immunization activities urgently resumed in North Waziristan.

Central Africa
- In Equatorial Guinea, a new WPV1 case was reported this week from Bata district, Litoral province, with onset of paralysis on [16 Mar 2014]. The total number of WPV1 cases reported from Equatorial Guinea for 2014 is 3.
- Due to continued poliovirus circulation in Cameroon, gaps in surveillance quality and influx of vulnerable populations from Central African Republic (CAR), WHO had elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to 'very high' in March of 2014.
- Since confirmation of the outbreak in Cameroon in October [2013], 6 nationwide campaigns have been conducted. However, the quality of implementation has varied greatly by region, and serious coverage gaps remain. As many as 40 percent of children remain under-immunized (with 30 percent having received zero doses) during SIAs.
- The recent confirmation of new cases in Cameroon has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity on [11-13 Apr 2014], and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June [2014]. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns so that all children are reached multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.
- Immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity are also being assessed in neighboring countries, in particular in Gabon and the Republic of Congo, and additional immunization activities are being planned in these countries for May [2014].
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac province). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- NIDs with both trivalent and bivalent OPV were held in Chad in February [2014] (trivalent OPV) and March [2014] (bivalent OPV) and Sub-National Immunization Days are planned for May [2014].
- In CAR, additional campaigns are currently being planned, in response to the very high risk of international spread of polio from Cameroon.

Horn of Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region had an onset of paralysis on [5 Jan 2014], from Somali region in Ethiopia. It is the 1st and only case in the Horn of Africa in 2014.
- The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is 218 since the beginning of the outbreak in April 2013 (194 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 10 from Ethiopia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. Recommendations from the recently held Horn of Africa Technical Advisory Group (TAG) are now actively being incorporated into outbreak response planning. The TAG had underscored that the initial response to the outbreak was appropriate, however expressed grave concern that gaps in SIA quality and surveillance remained in key infected areas of the region.
- In particular, the TAG expressed concern at critical quality gaps in implementation in key areas of Ethiopia. The group recommended that infected countries should focus efforts on high-risk and infected areas, by conducting high-quality SIAs no more than 4 weeks apart.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance in Israel since [3 Feb 2013] and continue to be detected in 2014 (12 positive samples collected this year, the most recent of which was collected on [2 Mar 2014]; in 2013, 132 positive samples were collected).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national routine immunization schedule. However, no additional supplementary campaigns with OPV are being planned.
- Positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip, the most recent positive sample was collected in the Gaza strip during the week of [5 Jan 2014].
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week from the Middle East. The most recent WPV1 case in the region was from northern Baghdad, Iraq, with onset of paralysis on [10 Feb 2014].
- The total number of WPV1 cases reported from the Middle East is 40. In Syria, 39 cases: 34 cases reported by the Ministry of Health, and 5 cases from contested areas not yet reflected in official figures. In Iraq: 1 case, with onset of paralysis on [10 Feb 2014] from northern Baghdad.
- Mass polio vaccination campaigns took place in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Turkey and Lebanon last week [week of 7 Apr 2014], aiming to reach more than 20 million children over 5 days. For Iraq, this was the 1st nationwide vaccination campaign since a case of polio was confirmed by the Ministry of Health on [30 Mar 2014] in a 6-month-old boy from Rusafa, northern Baghdad.
- During previous vaccination campaigns in Iraq which took place between October 2013 and March 2014, approximately 95 percent of children were reported to have been reached, though coverage has varied by area. WHO and UNICEF estimates from 2012 put routine immunization levels in Iraq at 70 percent. Routine immunization levels in Baghdad are estimated to be 81 percent.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. Since October 2013, 23 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been conducted across the region to reach more than 25 million children with multiple doses.
- The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation.

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- National campaigns were conducted in West Africa [22-25 Nov 2013]. Further national campaigns are planned for April and May [2014] (multi-country).

[3] Pakistan, army to assist in polio vaccination
Date: Sat 19 Apr 2014
Source: Dawn.com [edited]
http://www.dawn.com/news/1100898/army-to-help-govt-eradicate-poliovirus-in-conflict-zone


The recurring polio cases in North Waziristan and no vaccination there since 2012 has prompted the Pakistan Army to extend a helping hand to the government in eradication of the deadly poliovirus from North and South Waziristan agencies and Bara tehsil of Khyber Agency, relevant officials said.

The army personnel will provide security to health workers to ensure administration of oral polio vaccine to children in the militancy-stricken areas of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas [FATA]. The officials said that this would put brakes on the virus circulation and safeguard children in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from infection with virus from FATA.

They said that a meeting of the officials of FATA Secretariat, the Pakistan Army and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department on Thursday [17 Apr 2014] took notice of the increasing number of polio cases in North Waziristan tribal region and lack of vaccination in Bara tehsil of Khyber Agency. They said that it decided to strengthen security of the vaccinators in the conflict zone to ensure that no child below age 5 [years] missed the vaccination.

The army is conducting security operations in North and South Waziristan agencies, while in the rest of the 5 agencies the security operations were done by the Frontier Corps (FC), the officials said. There are 3 areas of concern with regard to the polio eradication programme for which the Pakistan Army has expressed willingness to support the health workers and the government in eradication of poliomyelitis. These areas include Bara tehsil of Khyber Agency, and North and South Waziristan agencies, they said.

Islamabad-based health officials said that the Pakistan Army was an institution of the government and it was mandatory for it to help the government in implementation of its programmes when and where required.

They said that in North and South Waziristan, the army would support the political administrations to reach the target children. They said that the army's help had been sought in view of non-vaccination of over 300 000 children in Waziristan where the militants had banned vaccination in mid-2012.

North Waziristan has recorded 33 polio cases in Pakistan's total tally of 47 in 2014 so far and the health officials fear a massive outbreak of the vaccine-preventable childhood ailments if immediate vaccination is not undertaken, they said, adding that all those who tested positive in North Waziristan hadn't received any dose of the OPV because of the militants' restrictions.

Similarly, South Waziristan has recorded 2 cases, Khyber 1 and Frontier Region, Bannu, 2 cases, they said. The officials, who attended the meeting held on Thursday [17 Apr 2014] at the GHQ Rawalpindi, said that the federal government had been asked by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to ensure vaccination of children in FATA.

They said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had detected virus from FATA in the local children, thus threatening its vaccination efforts. The provincial health department has also expressed concern over presence of poliovirus in Bara, Khyber Agency, which could affect children in Peshawar.

Early this month [April 2014], the WHO found virus from Bara in water sample taken from Peshawar that prompted the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to request the federal government to vaccinate children there and help stop transportation of virus to Peshawar.

The federal government, which directly governs FATA, has asked the Pakistan Army to help vaccinators in the conflict-prone areas, the officials said, adding that the FC would provide security assistance to the political administration in Khyber Agency in the coming campaigns.

[Since the last ProMED-mail polio update on 28 Mar 2014 (Poliomyelitis - update (08): Iraq, SEAR certified polio-free, global 20140328.2365125), there has been an increase of 14 cases -- 11 in endemic countries (specifically Pakistan) and 3 in non-endemic countries (2 in Equatorial Guinea and 1 in Syria). In addition, the 2013 global tally increased from 406 to 414 cases due to presumably delayed identification/confirmation/reporting of cases from Syria. In prior reports there was mention that "The total number of WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) cases in the country is 37: 25 cases have been reported by the Ministry of Health and 12 cases from contested areas (Aleppo, Edleb and Deir Al Zour) not yet reflected in official figures." In the above report (section [2]) there is mention that "5 cases from contested areas not yet reflected in official figures." As dates of onset of these 5 cases are not mentioned, it is possible they are from 2013, and possibly some new ones in 2014.

It is noteworthy that there hasn't been a case of WPV confirmed in Nigeria since the case with date of onset 1 Feb 2014, suggesting that transmission of the WPV has slowed (and to be optimistic, has been interrupted) in Nigeria. The information on results of coverages following vaccination efforts in Nigeria have been very positive, supporting a possibility of control and interruption of transmission. That being said, there was one cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) case reported in Nigeria this year, with date of onset 8 Feb 2014 (see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx). The presence of cVDPV cases serve as an indicator of pockets of low level vaccination coverage that support the circulation of these viruses (an in turn would support the circulation of the WPV as well). In 2014 to date there have been a total of 8 cVDPV2 identified, the 1 case in Nigeria and 7 in Pakistan (date of onset of most recent case in Pakistan 8 Mar 2014).

Another noteworthy observation is the intervention of the Pakistani military to provide safe passage for vaccination workers into areas that have not been reached due to civil strife. As a reminder, there has been violence against vaccinators in Pakistan (and Nigeria), resulting in injury and death of vaccinators while doing their work bringing vaccine to communities.

Areas for concern are the countries surrounding Cameroon, where WPV is now circulating and vaccination coverages have receded to low levels.
