25 children die of food poisoning in Philippines
----------------------------------------------
25 elementary pupils of a school in Mabini, Bohol in central Philippines,
died of food poisoning Wed, 9 Mar 2005, initial reports said.
The local television network ABS-CBN News said more children are expected
to have been poisoned according to school officials, adding that most of
their 476 pupils succumbed to stomach ache. The victims, all pupils of San
Jose Elementary School, ate sweetened cassava earlier in the day. They
later complained of stomach ache and were rushed to various hospitals.
Doctors at a hospital in Tagbilaran City said they admitted 5 children Wed
morning, 9 Mar 2005. 2 already died. The other children are confined in
various hospitals in the province. Dr. Elpidio Bonita in Ubay town's
hospital said 69 pupils were already admitted. 7 died.
At Garcia Memorial Hospital, 45 children were admitted. 6 have been
reported to be "in serious condition" while the rest were "under
observation" as of posting time.
Doctors said the children died of cyanide poisoning, adding that cyanide is
produced by the digestive system after eating raw cassava. Cassava is a
widely grown root crop, which accumulates 2 cyanogenic glucosides,
linamarin and lotaustralin. Linamarin accounts for more than 80 percent of
the cassava cyanogenic glucosides. Linamarin is present in all parts of
the cassava plant and more concentrated on the root and leaves. All cassava
plant species are known to contain cyanide.
The local government of Bohol already alerted its health workers for fear
that the death toll would rise by Wed evening, 9 Mar 2005.

Food poisoning kills 29 children
---------------------------------
Nearly 30 elementary school children in the Philippines have died after
eating fried cassava balls obtained from a vendor, a local official told CNN.
14 children died Wed, 9 Mar 2005, before reaching hospitals and 13 died
upon arrival, a spokesman for Ubay Mayor Eutiquio Bernales said. 2 more
children also have died, but it was not clear when. 35 more are in critical
condition.
The victims suffered severe stomach pain, then vomiting and diarrhea after
eating the snack during morning recess, The Associated Press
reported. They were taken to at least 4 hospitals near the school in
Mabini, a town on Bohol Island, about 610 kilometers (380 miles) southeast
of Manila, AP said.
"Some said they took only 2 bites because it tasted bitter and the effects
were felt 5-10 minutes later," Dr. Harold Gallego of Garcia Memorial
Provincial Hospital in the nearby town of Talibon told AP. The vendor who
sold the cassava balls insisted nothing was wrong with them and ate a few
to prove the point. Now she, too, is in critical condition.

[Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) is the most important food crop in the humid
and semi-humid tropics. It is a hardy plant needing little water to
survive. As noted in the 1st piece above, the root contains glucosides
called linamarin and lotaustralin. The glucosides are hydrolized by the
enzyme linamarase, with liberation of cyanohydrins that can break down to
highly toxic hydrogen cyanide.
When ingested, hydrogen cyanide can lead to acute intoxication and death.
Regular exposure to sublethal quantities, ingested or inhaled during
cooking, can cause epidemic spastic paraparesis, in central Africa known as
'konzo'; tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN); worsening of iodine deficiency
disorders such as goiter and cretinism; and increased risk of diabetes.
Normally, the more bitter cultivars of cassava are processed, and
traditional processing (including combinations of several methods --
peeling, slicing, soaking, retting, fermenting, boiling, drying, and
roasting among others) lowers cyanide contents to safe levels. Because of
changing socioeconomic situations (such as famine and war), people are
often unable to follow traditional preparation methods because they tend to
be very time-consuming.
This change in preparation procedures leads to an increase in related
diseases. Also, since bitter cultivars usually have higher yields, they
account for a growing share of cassava cultivation. - Mod.LL]
