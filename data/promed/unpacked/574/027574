From: Carlos Brisola Marcondes <cbrisola@mbox1.ufsc.br>

To confirm my former information, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo of today
(29 Apr 1998) reports that the Instituto Adolfo Lutz, Sao Paulo, confirmed
that a farmer from a municipality in the Northwest of this State actually
died of hantavirus. The locality is 10 km away from that of a woman (a
teacher), who died in March.
This man is the second victim in the state this year and ninth since 1993
in the country. A serologically positive person was found in the locality
of the woman. No infected rodent has been found so far by a team from the
Aldolfo Lutz Institute.
The director of the Virology Service of the Institute [is reported to have
said he supposed that the occurrence of two cases in the same region could
be linked to the
growth of the rodent population, perhaps caused by climate [change or by
[increased availability of food.
