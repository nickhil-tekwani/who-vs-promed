Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Venezuela - Guanarito Virus
---------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Noelba Lopez, Director of Epidemiology for the Ministry of Health and
Social Development, confirmed the presence of 18 cases of Venezuelan
hemorrhagic fever in isolated hamlets in the states of Portuguesa (15
cases) and Barinas (3 cases). So far this year, the causal agent, an
arenavirus called Guanarito virus, has caused 2 deaths (one in Portuguesa
and one in Barinas). The samples from patients with a suspected infection
are being analyzed by the National Institute of Hygiene.
Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, also known as Guanarito hemorrhagic fever, is
characterized by high fever, headache, sore throat, weakness, loss of
appetite, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and nose and gum bleeding. The
fatality rate ranges between 30-40 percent. It can be mistaken for dengue
fever, hepatitis, leptospirosis and other viral [hemorrhagic diseases. It
has also been reported in the states of Cojedes, Guarico, and Apure. In
1995, the Pan-American Health Organization warned that this pathogen, along
with other South American viruses, is a clear example of how the
exploitation of new territories for human habitation and agriculture, will
result in a higher probability of emerging infectious diseases.
Because of this outbreak, the ministry reinforced measures such as the
elimination from the homes of the [rodents that transmit the infection
[and the implementation of other measures for personal protection.

[Arenaviruses are zoonotic agents maintained within rodent hosts in a
chronic carrier state. Guanarito virus (genus _Arenavvirus_,
family_Arenaviridae_) is a New World arenavirus which is transmitted by the
rodent _Zygodontomys brevicauda_. Argentinean, Bolivian and Venezuelan
hemorrhagic fevers are clinically very similar diseases caused by related,
but distinct viruses, transmitted by different rodents that are commensal or
semi-commensal with the human population. In general the habitat preference
of the rodent host determines the epidemiological pattern of disease in the
human population. - Mod.CP
