Young and old migratory birds that don't have the stamina to make the trip
from Tasmania to the Arctic have been dropping dead on Guam shores, but a
government veterinarian said there's no cause for concern.
Millions of dollars' worth of federal money is being made available for a
nationwide monitoring of migratory birds as part of efforts to keep avian
influenza from reaching America. But the short-tailed shearwater ocean
birds that have been sighted on Guam are not the primary cause for concern
in connection with bird flu, said Tom Poole, the Guam Department of
Agriculture's territorial veterinarian. There have been sightings since
last week of dead shearwater birds washing up on Guam shores.
"If they are concerned, then I don't want them to be concerned," Poole
said. "The principal species to be concerned about when talking about avian
influenza are chickens and domestic ducks," he said, adding that most wild
birds don't get bird flu.
"What people should worry about and report is if they see lots of chickens
dying quickly," he said. According to Poole, when 1 or 2 chickens die in a
flock, that's nothing to worry about. But if, for example, an entire flock
gets wiped out in 48 hours, Agriculture should be informed immediately.
Part of what will be addressed by a task force recently created by Gov.
Felix Camacho are migratory birds, because Guam is within the "flyway" of
migratory birds from southeast Asia, said Dr. Mike Cruz, chairman of the
Guam Legislature's health committee.
Cruz recently returned from a national conference of the Army National
Guard to address readiness for possible outbreak of bird flu in the United
States.
Reports of an Indonesian family of 6 who died of bird flu recently has
heightened attention to bird flu, not just on Guam, but also across the globe.
The deaths heighten concern because it causes suspicion that the virus may
have mutated to being transferable between humans, Cruz said.
The World Health Organization reported May 23 on its Web site,
<http://www.who.int>, that 6 members of a family in North Sumatra have died
after having been infected with the H5N1 virus.
"All confirmed cases in the cluster can be directly linked to close and
prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness. Although
human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, the search for a possible
alternative source of exposure is continuing," according to the WHO.
Part of the task force's job will be to help improve the Guam Memorial
Hospital's state of readiness, said Cruz, who is running for lieutenant
governor.
The Guam Medical Society, Public Health and Guam's Homeland Security are a
part of the task force.
During the conference, Cruz said he found out that Guam is the No. 2 stop
for migratory birds traveling from southeast Asia. Alaska is No.
1. "There's $29 million for tracking migratory birds as part of a national
program, but Guam does not have a share of that money," Cruz said.
But if human-to-human transfer of bird flu is confirmed, the bigger concern
will shift from migratory birds to safeguarding Guam's borders from
travelers who may be infected, he said. Cruz is holding meetings in recent
days with other task-force members.
Sen. Eddie Calvo, in a letter to Cruz, wrote that he hopes GMH's leadership
will work closely with Cruz "to discuss how best they can prepare the
island's only hospital for a possible avian influenza pandemic."
If the virus mutates into a form that is highly infectious for humans and
spreads easily from person to person, such a change could mark the start of
a global outbreak, or a pandemic, according to the WHO.
Calvo's letter yesterday states there's a law that creates the Public
Health Emergency Planning Commission that would prepare Guam for such a
pandemic and for all other public health emergencies.

[The entire world is sensitized to the movement of a multitude of bird
species and diseases they may or may not carry. In all probability these
same migratory birds have had about the same death rate in previous years,
but without the attention being paid to it. - Mod.TG]
