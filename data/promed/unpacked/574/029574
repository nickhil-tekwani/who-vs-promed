Detecting phytoplasmas associated with frogskin disease in cassava
(_Manihot esculenta_ Crantz) in Colombia
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frogskin (FSD) is an important cassava disease that affects roots.
The causal agent remains unknown, even though FSD is reported with
increasing frequency in Colombia, Brazil, and Venezuela. Yield losses
close to 90 percent have been reported in commercial fields in
Colombia.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to detect and
confirm that phytoplasmas were associated with FSD, and to
characterize and subsequently classify the phytoplasmas. The 16S rDNA
gene was amplified. Root, stem, leaf, and flower samples were taken
from symptomatic plants, and 1.2 kilobase fragments obtained.

Sequence analysis of the cloned fragments revealed that the
phytoplasmas found were similar to the Chinaberry yellows phytoplasma
(16SrXIII Mexican periwinkle virescence group) and the Cirsium white
leaf phytoplasma (16SrIII X-disease group), both with a sequence
homology of 100 and 99 percent, respectively.

The presence of phytoplasmas was confirmed by staining methods and by
grafting. This is the 1st report of phytoplasmas associated with FSD
in cassava.

[Cassava is an important tropical root crop providing a major food
source for both humans and animals. Frogskin disease (FSD) is
considered a serious emerging disease of this crop in Latin America
with an increasing range in Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and
Brazil. It significantly reduces root quality and yield. The disease
spreads rapidly and a whitefly vector is suspected. FSD is also
spread by plant material used for vegetative propagation.

Most cassava genotypes do not show symptoms on the stems or leaves,
but the roots are stunted and do not fill with starch. The lower stem
may become enlarged. The root periderm and corky layer enlarge and
form raised, lip-shaped longitudinal fissures. The root surface peels
off easily. Depending on the severity of the disease, the depth and
number of lesions increase until the root becomes deformed. When the
root symptoms are mild, the fissures often form a constricted ring
around the root. Host cultivars with varying levels of resistance to
FSD have been found.

Phytoplasmas are a unique taxonomic group of small, unculturable,
intracellular plant-parasitic bacteria within the group of the
Mollicutes. 16S ribosomal RNA sequences were adopted as a framework
for their formal taxonomic classification. There are still
uncertainties in phytoplasma taxonomy reflected in the genus name
_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma.

This is the 1st report of phytoplasmas being associated with FSD. A
possible association of one or several viral pathogens, perhaps new
members of the family of _Reoviridae_, with FSD has also been
reported. Further research is required to determine the involvement
of both groups of pathogens and whether FSD may be a disease syndrome
due to co-infection by several biotic agents.
