A mosquito carrying a deadly virus has arrived in Britain. The insect, _Culex modestus_, bears [can transmit] the West Nile [WN] virus, which causes flu-like symptoms and [can cause] inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

It has been found breeding in the marshes of north Kent and south Essex over the past 2 years, the 1st sighting of the insect in the UK since the 1940s.

The mosquito is suspected of causing [WN] virus epidemics in southern Europe, but last night [8 Feb 2012], experts stressed no one has ever been infected after being bitten here.

In the previous 2 UK [WN virus infection] cases, in 2006 and 2007, both the cases had returned from trips to Canada.

West Nile virus is normally passed on to humans via [mosquitoes that feed on] infected birds and is fatal in around 3 per cent of cases.

Nick Golding of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology said: "It seems likely _Culex modestus_ has arrived fairly recently. A handful were collected on the South Coast in the 40s, but they didn't appear to be an established population. Until now, it hadn't been seen since."

Experts are now trying to establish how widespread the mosquitoes are.

[WN virus has been isolated from _Culex modestus_ in nature; this mosquito feeds on birds and has been shown to be an efficient vector of the virus in the laboratory. Although WN virus has not been isolated in the United Kingdom, nor have human cases occurred there, given the movement of the virus via birds, it would not be surprising if the virus eventually became established in Britain. Serological evidence of WN virus or a closely related flavivirus infection in sentinel chickens and wild birds in England has been reported previously (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20060920.269). The establishment of _Cx. modestus_ adds another potential risk factor for virus transmission there. It will be interesting to learn the extent of _Cx. modestus_ distribution in the United Kingdom and changes in its geographic distribution over time.
