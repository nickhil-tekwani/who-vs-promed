A contaminated batch of heroin has claimed another life in Glasgow, health
experts believe. A woman died in hospital early on Thursday, more than a
month after the last reported case linked to the killer outbreak. The case
brings the number of deaths in Scotland attributed to the contaminated
drugs to 22 - all except 4 of them in Glasgow.

But Greater Glasgow Health Board's drug expert Dr Laurence Gruer believes
the outbreak is almost at its end. He revealed on Thursday that 2 more
cases had come to light in Glasgow, taking the number of reported cases to
57 in Scotland. The woman who died showed identical symptoms to those
addicts struck by the infection, which has been linked to heroin
contaminated by the _Clostridium novyi_ microbe. A second woman is
currently said to be in a "stable" condition in hospital.

Dr Gruer said: "It is disappointing to learn that these 2 new cases have
occurred. However, in at least one the heroin used had apparently been
prepared at least 6 weeks ago. It is likely that virtually all of the
contaminated heroin has now been used up. There have been no new cases
reported from the rest of Scotland or from England or Ireland for several
weeks."

More than 30 cases have been reported among drug users in Dublin and
northern England, leading to at least 17 deaths. In June, the health board
reported that the bacterium _Clostridium novyi_ had been isolated from
three Scottish cases. Following work in laboratories in Atlanta and
Cardiff, it has now been isolated from a total of 11 Scottish cases. It is
now thought likely that the toxin produced by the bacteria was responsible
for many, if not all, of the deaths. Other types of [clostridia have also
been isolated from some of the patients.

The contaminated batch of heroin first came to light in Glasgow at the
beginning of May after the death of 6 addicts in the Govanhill area of
Glasgow. The illness has only affected drug users who inject heroin
directly into muscle as opposed to a blood vein.

The deaths in Scotland are still subject to an ongoing criminal
investigation and it is likely there will also be a fatal accident inquiry
in due course.
