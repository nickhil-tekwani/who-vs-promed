SHEEP POX IN GREECE Follow-up reports
See also: 17 July 1998
Text of a fax received on 17 August 1998 from Dr V. Stylas, Director of
Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Athens:
Follow-up report No. 1
End of previous report period: 15 July 1998 (see Disease Information, 11
[28], 100, dated 17 July 1998).
End of this report period: 24 July 1998.
On 21 July 1998, a secondary outbreak of sheep pox (No. 2/98) was reported
also in the village of Inoi, prefecture of Evros.
Total number of animals in the new outbreak:
species ovine caprine
susceptible 92 24
cases 25* 0**
deaths ... 0
destroyed 92* 24*
slaughtered 0 0
* by 21 July 1998;
** all goats were free from clinical signs and seronegative.
>From 21 to 23 July 1998, a team of senior veterinary officers from
Headquarters in Athens, comprising the Head of the Animal Health
Directorate and the Head of the Infectious Diseases Section visited Evros
to assess the situation on the spot, to coordinate and advise on the
appropriate disease control measures and to boost epidemiological
enquiries. Follow-up actions taken in the village of Inoi, as described
below, were stipulated largely as a result of this visit.
Diagnosis: suspicion in outbreak No. 2 was raised on 19 July 1998 on the
basis of inconclusive and mild clinical signs (redness of the skin on the
inner hind legs) which, however, developed dramatically within 48 hours, so
that by 21 July the disease was fully expressed, with fever, inappetence,
skin eruptions and subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory confirmation was
subsequently obtained.
Diagnostic tests used: agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and virus
neutralisation (VN).
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: with regard to on-going
epidemiological investigations in outbreak No. 1/98, a detailed documentary
and physical check, as well as an interview with the owner, failed to
establish the exact origin and mode of infection.
Transmission of infection across the borders by fomites and/or insects was
ruled out due to the distance from the borders (> 5 km), the prevailing
winds and the local topography.
Documentary checks, both in the infected holding and the alleged holdings
of origin, failed to account for all the animals present in the holding and
raised suspicions as to the true origin of the animals. These suspicions
are strengthened by the owner's unprofessional conduct, his poor relations
with the local veterinary and agronomic authorities and his previous and
recent record of frequent business visits of uncertain purpose across the
borders.
B. Mode of spread: outbreak No. 2/98 is easily explained by close
contiguity (< 30 m) with outbreak No. 1/98 and direct contact with the
latter in common grazing areas and watering points, up to the date of
depopulation of outbreak No. 1/98. Otherwise, there were no recent
movements of animals into or out of the infected flock, as determined from
its well kept and updated records and registers.
C. Other epidemiological details: there were three sheep flocks, comprising
400 animals in total, contiguous to the infected farms (situated within a
200-m radius). These flocks were under clinical surveillance since outbreak
No. 1/98 was reported, with negative results. Furthermore, preliminary
random sampling on 14 July 1998 produced negative serological results in
all three flocks.
Control measures during reporting period:
- All susceptible animals in outbreak No. 2/98 were slaughtered and
destroyed by burial on the spot on 21 July 1998.
- In view of their close proximity to the outbreaks, the animals of the
three in-contact flocks were preventively slaughtered on 24 July 1998; at
the same time, new blood samples were collected.
- Routine control measures were applied as provided for in European
Commission Directive No. 92/119/EEC, and described in the emergency report,
with the addition of collection of blood samples for epidemiological
evaluation from all stamped-out flocks.
Follow-up report No. 2
End of previous report period: 24 July 1998 (see above).
End of this report period: 11 August 1998.
1. There have been no further reports of suspected or confirmed cases of
sheep pox anywhere in Evros.
2. Results of serological tests in the in-contact flocks are not yet
available.
3. Disease control and safeguard measures are still in place.
