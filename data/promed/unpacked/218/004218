According to information on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs News Office announced on 5 Jun 2020 that an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) occurred in Lijiang of Yongsheng County in Yunnan Province.

On 5 Jun 2020, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs received a report from the China Animal Disease Control Center that, per confirmation by the Yunnan Province China Animal Disease Control Center, an outbreak of ASF occurred on a farm in Yongsheng County. When the outbreak occurred, there were 102 hogs on the farm. By the time of confirmed diagnosis, 81 hogs had become ill and 81 hogs died.

[The above new ASF outbreak in Yunnan, which is yet to be notified to the OIE, becomes the 7th outbreak in this province since a recurring, new event started there on 17 Feb 2019. The most recent, 6th outbreak, previous to the current one, started 21 Oct 2019. OIE's summary of this Yunnan event, as of 27 Oct 2019 (date of report submission), was the following:

Total outbreaks = 6 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 1924 / 346 / 196 / 1727 / 0
(See, with map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000032233_20191028_131553.pdf).

The 1st report on ASF in China was submitted to the OIE on 3 Aug 2018. According to the official summary as of 3 Jun 2020, a total of 182 ASF outbreaks have been reported in China and 1 193 000 domestic pigs were destroyed in 32 of 34 administrative divisions of the country since its start in August 2018. It is estimated that the actual number is at least 2 million culled animals.

China's customs authorities have recently banned imports of pigs, wild boars and related products from India to prevent the spread of ASF. This regulation took effect on 27 May 2020, within China's attempts to restore pig production after the deadly disease ravaged its herd. Recent details on the accumulated losses were presented in 20200429.7281181 and 20200528.7391804.

ASF is not zoonotic; no vaccine against the disease is available. Notably, on 18 May 2020, scientists from The Pirbright Institute (UK) published a paper (Ref 1) describing the development of a vectored vaccine. All pigs that were immunised with the vaccine were protected from severe disease after challenging with an otherwise fatal strain of ASFV, although some clinical signs of disease developed. These data provide the basis for the further development of a subunit vaccine against this devastating panzootic disease.
