[1] Apple scab, undiagnosed fungi - Czech Republic

Fruit volumes down in Czech Republic
------------------------------------
Due to the recent adverse weather conditions earlier in 2010 the fruit
harvest will most likely be below the average of the last few years.
The cold, wet weather just as the fruit trees were blossoming caused
the problems and also led to wide spread fungus diseases. The [yield]
estimate for 2010 is 10 percent lower than in 2009 according to the
Czech Fruit Growers Association.

There is expected to be 60 percent less apricots. The apple harvest is
expected to show a 6 percent drop and there will be less quality fruit
due to widespread scab diseases. Peach volumes will be down around 30
percent and Czech peach orchards are not being renewed because they
cannot [compete with] the Italian and Greek ones. The harvests of
cherries, plums, and pears will be down 6-37 percent on 2009 but the
areas of these crops are increasing.

Orchards cover 17 713 hectares [approx. 43 800 acres] in the Czech
Republic and fruit harvested is worth more than Kc 1 billion [approx.
USD 48.8 million] annually.

Wet weather fuels disease pressure
----------------------------------
Explosion of rare diseases is causing damage across the state's
orchards. Oregon State University's Jay Pscheidt is seeing plant
diseases this spring [2010] that he's never seen in 22 years. In most
cases growers are intensifying treatment programs, but because of
difficulty getting into fields or because of resistance, they are
suffering losses.

In a spring that broke rainfall records, common diseases such as brown
rots, scabs, anthracnose, blossom blights and leaf spots are
flourishing on a variety of fruit crops. Rare diseases also are
showing up. "It's not necessarily the volume of rain as the length of
the wet period (causing the eruptions)," Pscheidt said. "Rusts are
going crazy. The Pacific Coast pear rust has been particularly nasty."

Blueberries are seeing a lot of problem with botrytis. In cherries,
brown rot blossom blight has erupted. Where he didn't spray, Pscheidt
said the blight is causing 50 to 80 percent losses in his cherry
plots. "I have not seen it this bad in the 22 years I've been here,"
he said. Leaf curls and other foliar diseases that can affect next
year's [2011] crops also have erupted. "The foliar diseases, because
of the wet weather, have gone bonkers," Pscheidt said.

And then there are the rare diseases, such as apple rusts. "It's the
1st time I've seen those rustations on apples," Pscheidt said. The
Pacific Coast pear rust, which causes malformation in pears, is common
in the Willamette Valley, but typically isn't economically
significant. This year [2010] it is, Pscheidt said.

[3] Cytospora canker, cherry - USA: (Montana)
Date: Thu 17 Jun 2010

Cytospora canker is widespread in Montana
-----------------------------------------
Cytospora canker has been found on cherry trees around Missoula and is
widespread on aspen, willow, cottonwood, and maple throughout Montana.
What is unusual is not only how widespread this disease is but also
how lethal it appears to be. Early freezes in the fall [2009] and late
freezes in spring [2010] may have played a role by stressing trees and
killing tissue which was subsequently invaded by the pathogen. This
fungus is most active in the spring and fall at cool temperatures.
Cytospora canker has a wide host range including most tree fruits,
various poplar species, hardwoods, as well as spruce.

[Apple scab is caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ and is
considered the most economically important disease of the crop
worldwide with reported losses of more than 70 percent. Other fungi in
the same genus are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit
crops (for example, _V. pirina_ on pear). Symptoms may include dark
leaf spots, premature leaf fall, and cracked, malformed fruits. The
fungi overwinter in leaves on the ground and are spread with infected
plant material, by mechanical means, splashing rain and air currents.
Disease management requires up to 12 fungicide sprays a year.
Resistant crop varieties are available, but few of them are currently
suitable for commercial production.

In the Czech Republic, peach orchards were reported to be affected by
_Peach latent mosaic viroid_ (PLMVd) and _Hop stunt viroid_
(ProMED-mail post 20031125.2921), which may contribute to the low
yield and lack of tree vigour reported in item 1 (see ProMED-mail post
20080724.2249 for more information on PLMVd).

Apple and pear rusts are caused by _Gymnosporangium_ species (Pacific
Coast pear rust is due to _Gymnosporangium libocedri_). Anthracnose of
apple is caused by _Neofabraea malicorticis_. Brown rot, blossom
blight, and twig dieback on stone fruit can be caused by _Monilinia
fructicola_ and _M. laxa_. Fungal leaf curl of stone fruit is caused
by _Taphrina communis_, and a number of other foliar diseases of pome
and stone fruit can be caused by different fungi.

Cytospora canker is caused by various fungi previously classified as
species of _Cytospora_, some of which have now been reassigned to
different genera (for example, _Valsa_). They have a wide host range
causing significant economic losses on most tree fruits. Symptoms
include wilting of branches, bark cankers, amber-coulored gum exudate,
and branch dieback, which may lead to the death of the tree. Spread
occurs from cankers by rain and wind. Infection occurs via bark wounds
(sunburn, old bacterial cankers, boring insects, pruning cuts, or
other damage). The fungi cannot infect healthy, undamaged bark and the
disease is favoured by environmental stress on the trees. There is no
known chemical control, but disease management may include
phytosanitation to prevent infection and/or spread (such as
disinfection of tools, removal of infected plant material) and
cultural measures to avoid tree stress and optimise orchard vigour.
