Potato growers of Rangpur are worried as the vegetable is facing serious setback due to severe attack of late blight disease. Potato cultivators of the region alleged that they gave their best efforts to get expected yield. But potato fields at different areas have been affected [and] the disease is gradually turning acute across the region. [It] occurred mainly due to severe cold and foggy weather.

Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) Rangpur said officials have been given instructions which medicine to use and how to apply them appropriately to combat the adverse situation.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks and seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are vital.

Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen. Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide with new strains emerging frequently.

In Bangladesh and the region, PLB outbreaks have been an annual occurrence (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archive) which suggests that preventative measures are not used effectively.
