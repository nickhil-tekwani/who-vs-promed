Harare is in "the outbreak mode" for typhoid with 40 confirmed and 600 suspected cases, it has been learnt. For weeks, the water-borne disease has been wreaking havoc in some densely populated suburbs like Budiriro, which is now the epicentre.

Council spokesperson Michael Chideme confirmed the outbreak yesterday [15 Mar 2016]. "We are now in the outbreak mode and have intensified our health promotion activities in the communities," he said.

Typhoid, like cholera, can be transmitted through water and fresh foods, especially fruits, fish and meat, and pre-cooked food sold in the open.

[Enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop, but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
