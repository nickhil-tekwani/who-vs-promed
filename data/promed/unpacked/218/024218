A new tick vector with potential to spread fatal cattle diseases is rapidly spreading in the region, scientists in Kenya have warned. The invasive blue tick, which causes fevers and carries pathogens that can be transmitted to people, was until recently rare in Africa but was translocated to the continent from Asia by cattle exported via Madagascar. It has now proliferated in Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Burundi.

"Cattle farmers in the region need to be aware of this new tick vector, the invasive blue tick or _Rhipicephalus microplus_," Kenyan parasitologist Esther Kanduma told the EastAfrican. She said the tick species carries the _Babesia bovis_, _Babesia bigemina_, and _Anaplasma marginale_ pathogens, which cause tick fevers through destruction of red blood cells. They are also transmissible to humans. "Infections associated with _B. bovis_ have the capacity for 70 to 80 per cent death rates, high economic losses, and high morbidity leading to reduced production of milk and meat, traction and decreased incomes for poor smallholder farmers," said Dr Kanduma, who works at the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Nairobi.

Fatal bovine babesiosis, caused by _B.bovis_, is the most important tickborne disease in terms of economic impact, globally. Over the last 15 years, the blue tick has been spreading across the continent. It has been recorded in more than 20 African countries, and the pathogen _B. bovis_ has already been reported in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria. "The situation has changed dramatically following rapid increases of the tick in Tanzania replacing the indigenous _Rhipicephalus decoloratus_ and 2 introductions into different countries in West Africa through the importation of infested cattle from Brazil," Dr Kanduma said.

While new records of the invasive _R. microplus_ tick are being reported all the time, the full extent of spread remains unknown and unassessed. "The bigger problem is that most African countries have limited capacity for differentiation of _R. microplus_ from the endemic _R. decoloratus_ and _R. annulatus_," Dr Kanduma noted. She also remarked that countries lack capacity, expertise, and suitable analysis for _B. bovis_ detection, diagnosis, and surveillance. Diagnosis of tickborne diseases is through observation of clinical signs, sometimes combined with microscopy, methods that are not specific or sensitive, especially in immune carrier animals and those with mixed infections.

Scientists say prevalence of the invasive tick in Africa is likely to evolve rapidly given the wide range of animal hosts, pastoralism, and uncontrolled trans-border animal trade. The scientists also point to climate change as having direct effects on the biological development and adaptation of the species and the pathogens it transmits as they prefer warm and humid conditions. Africa's wildlife is also a reservoir of ticks and tickborne pathogens, and the unrestrained mingling of wildlife and livestock is an added factor in the spread.

A team from the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, the University of Nairobi, and Washington State University is designing ways to map the tick through remote sensing and geographic information systems, the scientists propose in a scientific paper entitled "Role of climate and other factors in determining the dynamics of tick and tick-transmitted pathogen populations and distribution in western, central, and eastern Africa" [ref below].

"No risk assessment, surveillance systems, or control strategies for the invasive ticks and fatal babesiosis have been developed for the affected African countries," Dr Kanduma added. The rapid dispersion of the tick is driven by largely uncontrolled transboundary cattle trade in a region with mostly porous international boundaries where quarantine measures do not exist or are not enforceable. As climate change accelerates, this trade will intensify and disseminate the tick deep into new areas that are ecologically suitable. It has been suggested that African governments could help by providing specialist livestock extension services offering technical and informational support to farmers and pastoralists.

The team has designed strategic approaches for controlling the tick in African countries, which include use of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) to map where invasive ticks and _B. bovis_ occur, linking the distribution to anthropogenic factors contributing to the spread and eco-climatic factors. They recommend use of tick-distribution modelling tools and maps to guide region-specific tick management and control plans, as well as to predict disease outbreak hotspots for more proactive control of disease.

This report underscores the risk of not only moving animals with their economically serious diseases, such as anaplasmosis, but also the tick vector that transmits them. Uncontrolled trans-border movement of livestock requires a broad international approach for surveillance of the tick, which is now underway. Tick control is difficult, especially when small, individually owned herds are common, as is the case in East Africa. One hopes that regionally developed control efforts are developed and implemented. - Mod.TY
