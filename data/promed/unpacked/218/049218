A case of foodborne botulism occurred in the Republic of Ireland in Sep
2006. Since the beginning of 2003, there have been a further 4 cases of
foodborne botulism in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland
(1). 3 of these 5 incidents involved Polish nationals, and were associated
with the consumption of home-prepared meat products originating from Poland.
In 2003, a male Polish national living in England developed botulism and
subsequently died, having eaten a home prepared meat product ("bigosh")
brought from Poland. Botulinum neurotoxin serotype B (BoNTB) was detected
in serum samples collected prior to death. The 2nd incident occurred in a
male Polish national living in England in 2005 who developed botulism
within 24 hours of consuming home-preserved pork originally prepared in
Poland. _Clostridium botulinum_ type B and BoNTB were recovered from the
patients' feces and from the jar of home-preserved pork. The patient was
treated with antitoxin and made a complete recovery. The preserved pork had
been home slaughtered, bottled, stored at room temperature for several
months in Poland prior to bringing to England for consumption.
The most recent incident affected a Polish national living in the Republic
of Ireland who developed symptoms of botulism after consuming home prepared
pork which again originated in Poland. _C. botulinum_ type A/B was isolated
from the patient feces and from a sample of home preserved pork. The
patient received antitoxin and is making steady progress.
Of the remaining 2 cases of foodborne botulism reported in the UK, one was
associated with UK commercially prepared hummus, and the final case with
recent travel to Georgia. Readers should be aware of the increase in
incidence of food botulism associated with the consumption of home-prepared
meat products from eastern European countries, which have much higher rates
of foodborne botulism than either the UK or the Republic of Ireland (2,3).
The main vehicles for botulism transmission are meat dishes, and in
particular home-preserved pork in bottling jars. Clinicians should be aware
of the possible increased risk of botulism among migrant workers from
eastern Europe.
