Just to rule out certain conditions, has there been any testing of
blood for vitamin K deficiency that might be induced by widespread
intoxication with an anticoagulant rodenticide? Is there a common
source of food or water? The clinical description appears very similar
to anticoagulant toxicosis in dogs, which often have marked pulmonary
hemorrhage and edema as well. However, lesions of viral pneumonia would
tend to lessen the anticoagulant possibility. This comment is offered
without knowledge of the epizootiology or other clinical, pathological
and chronological details.

Another possibility is Warfarin poisoning. Perhaps someone fed D-Con
rodent bait to the dogs.

It might be just a crazy long shot, but were these greyhounds tested
for the effects of anticoagulant rodenticides (they were Greyhounds,
after all. . . . )? Did clinical pathology findings from the
affected dogs before they died include PT/APTT, bleeding time or
platelet numbers? There was no mention of it in the ProMED-mail
post.

[We thank our contributors. I had actually pondered some of the same
questions. At this point it is too early to rule out a malicious
poisoning, The veterinarians in Florida are not forthcoming with
information as yet. We look forward to their comments - Mod. TG
