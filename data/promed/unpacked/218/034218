Further to your RFI, it would be good to know if the Sri Lankan
authorities had ruled out rinderpest.

I don't think they are on the list of infection-free countries yet.

[Dr Taylor is gratefully acknowledged for this reminder; rinderpest
deserves to be included among the infectious diseases to be ruled out
in this mass-mortality event in dairy cattle.

Indeed, Sri Lanka is not yet included in the List of Rinderpest-free
Members, as updated in June 2009 and available on the OIE website at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/Status/Rinderpest/en_RP_free.htm>.
The current list includes most of the world's countries.

According to Sri Lanka's report to the OIE on its animal disease
situation, no outbreak of rinderpest has been recorded there since
March 1994, when the last outbreak was eradicated; "general
surveillance" has been applied since. In order to obtain the status
of "rinderpest-free member", several prescribed activities and
detailed information, including a serological surveillance, are
required. For details, go to "OIE official procedures and policy for
Members wishing to apply for recognition of animal disease status" at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/Status/en_procedures.htm>. - Mod.AS]
