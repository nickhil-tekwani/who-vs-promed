The rat-lung worm [Angiostrongylus spp.] has been found in Tenerife
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Institute of Tropical Diseases of the Canary Islands have
discovered a parasite in the island of Tenerife that may affect the
population through the ingestion of lettuce.

In the program, this Monday [27 Sep 2010], Television Canaria "30
minutes," the institute's director, Basilio Valladares, said that this
parasite has been found in Tenerife and lives in the lungs of 40
percent of the rats tested.

The parasite is transferred from animals to slugs and snails through
their eggs. Although the possibility of acquiring it is remote, this
parasite (of still unknown origin) has come to the island of Tenerife
with freight [imported food?].

It is advisable to wash food thoroughly before eating, and talking to
your doctor if feeling unwell.

A study to identify this parasite, which affects the brain, is being
done in all of the islands [Canary Islands]. Its presence in La Palma,
La Gomera and El Hierro, has (so far) been ruled out.

[This is the 1st report of _Angiostrongylus_ from Tenerife, and we
still do not have the complete species identification.
_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is the species that most often cause
human infection in the form of eosinophilic meningitis. It is
speculated in the text that the parasite has been introduced to
Tenerife by imports, but what kind of imports is not clear.

ProMED will be happy to post further information especially on the
species diagnosis of the presumed _Angiostrongylus_.
