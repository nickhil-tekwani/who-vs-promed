At least 724 000 people in Equateur Province of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) are at risk after an outbreak of hepatitis E, which has killed
13 people and infected 341 others since July 2006, an official of the
United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) said.
Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food
supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks, according to WHO. A WHO
epidemiologist, Dr Jean Robert Likofata, said on Tuesday [17 Oct 2006] in
the capital, Kinshasa, that 4 health zones around the town of Gemena in
Equateur were threatened by the disease, which has an incubation period of
between 3 and 8 weeks. He said the whole province was threatened by this
epidemic because Gemena was an "epicentre", as it is a market town,
facilitating contact with almost the whole population in the area.
Moreover, Likofata said cases of hepatitis E had been recorded up to 65 km
southwest in the health zone of Bwamanda; 105 km west in the Tandaba zone
and at least 44 km northwest in the health zones of Bogose and Nubea. "This
disease is transmitted through contaminated water, especially when hygiene
is not good when it comes to the washing of hands," Likofata said. "And at
this market, which dominates Gemena town, you have businessmen coming from
all around the province."
Likofata led a medical team to Gemena when the first cases were reported in
July 2006, to inspect samples that were later sent to a laboratory in
Kinshasa. Initially, Likofata said, the outbreak was suspected to be yellow
fever until the laboratory results confirmed it was hepatitis E. He said
those affected initially exhibit flu-like symptoms, with high fever, nausea
and loss of appetite, which could last a week. The next phase is yellowing
eyes, pale faeces and dark urine consistent with liver disease. There is no
effective treatment aside from bed-rest and fluid replacement, so
prevention is key.
Besides sharing information about the disease's symptoms with staff in the
main health centres in Equateur, the medical team also conducted awareness
campaigns to inform the public about the importance of hygiene in the
prevention of hepatitis E.

[Hepatitis E virus, has caused large epidemics of enterically transmitted
self-limiting acute viral hepatitis throughout the Indian subcontinent,
southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and Mexico.
Seroprevalence surveys indicate that the virus is prevalent elsewhere
suggesting the existence of strains of differing virulence.
Hepatitis E is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality and poses a
major health problem in endemic regions. Hepatitis E epidemics are
waterborne outbreaks. During these outbreaks, overall attack rates range
from 1 to 15 percent, being higher among adults (3 to 30 percent) than
among children (0.2 to 10 percent). The outbreaks are characterized by a
particularly high attack rate and mortality among pregnant women. In
non-endemic regions, hepatitis E accounts for less than 1 percent of
reported cases of acute viral hepatitis.
The clinical disease in humans is typical of viral hepatitis. The liver
appears to be the only target organ of infection, and its extrahepatic
manifestations have been rare. The incubation period ranges from 15 to 50
days. The preicteric phase lasts for 1-10 (average 3-4) days, and
gastrointestinal symptoms, such as epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting,
are frequently reported. The icteric phase begins abruptly, with the
appearance of jaundice, dark urine and clay-coloured stools. In
uncomplicated cases these symptoms last 12-15 days, and complete recovery
usually takes place within 1 month. About half the patients develop fever
and 2/3 complain of arthralgia.
Clinical studies have shown that elevation of serum alanine
aminotransferase levels occur as a single peak preceding or coinciding with
the onset of jaundice, which is similar to most other forms of viral
hepatitis. In disease-endemic regions, this infection constitutes an
important cause of fulminant hepatic damage. Pregnant women, particularly
those in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, are more frequently affected during
hepatitis E outbreaks and have a worse outcome. Mortality rates among
pregnant women, especially those infected in the 3rd trimester, range
between 5 and 25 percent. Frequency of abortions, stillbirths and neonatal
deaths is also increased among hepatitis E virus-infected pregnant women.
Control of hepatitis E outbreaks consists predominantly of measures to
interrupt water-borne transmission of disease and appropriate education of
the population at risk.
