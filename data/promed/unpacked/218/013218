Food and Drug Administration investigating new _Escherichia coli_ outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------
Federal officials are investigating a new outbreak of enteroinvasive _E. coli_ O143:H26 infections but they have not yet identified a source of the pathogen. The outbreak has sickened at least 16 people, but the FDA has not said which states are involved. Also, the agency has not yet begun a traceback investigation. Consequently, the FDA has not begun on-site inspections of any producers, processors or suppliers. No sampling or testing has been initiated. As of [Mon 7 Feb 2022], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not posted any information on the outbreak, which is not unusual when a source has not been identified.

The table below [see URL in Moderator Comments - Mod.LL] shows ongoing outbreak investigations being managed by FDA's CORE Response Teams. The investigations are in a variety of stages. Some outbreaks have limited information with active investigations ongoing, others may be near completion. The table has been abbreviated to show only active investigations. The FDA will issue public health advisories for outbreak investigations that result in "specific, actionable steps for consumers -- such as throwing out or avoiding specific foods -- to take to protect themselves", according to the outbreak table page. Not all recalls and alerts result in an outbreak of foodborne illness. Not all outbreaks result in recalls.

Outbreak investigations that do not result in specific, actionable steps for consumers may or may not conclusively identify a source or reveal any contributing factors, according to CORE's outbreak table page. If a source(s) and/or contributing factors are identified that could inform future prevention, FDA commits to providing a summary of those findings, according to CORE officials.

[So far, no vehicle of transmission has been identified according to the outbreak update posted by the FDA (https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigations-foodborne-illness-outbreaks). ProMED awaits further information about this outbreak.

A number of _E. coli_ strains have acquired virulence factors to become pathogens that could be called enteropaths, diarrheagenic _E. coli_. These strains differ relating their virulence factors, and clinical manifestations are referred to as
- enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
- enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
- enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
- enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
- enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC)
- diffusely adherent _E. coli_ (DAEC)

In the past, most clinical laboratories were unable to specifically identify any of these except for EHEC. Newer technologies using multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) have become available and are spreading from reference to more standard clinical laboratories to test for a cluster of organisms, including
- Enteric adenovirus
- Astrovirus
- Norovirus
- Rotavirus A
- Sapovirus
- cryptosporidium
- _Cyclospora cayetanensis_
- _Entamoeba histolytica_
- _Giardia lamblia_
- _Campylobacter (jejuni, coli and upsaliensis_)
- _Clostridium difficile_ (toxin A/B)
- _Plesiomonas shigelloides_
- salmonella
- shigella
- _Yersinia enterocolitica_
- _Vibrio (parahaemolyticus_, _vulnificus_, and _cholerae_)
- enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
- enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
- enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
- enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
- enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC)

EIEC is a human enteric pathogen that causes dysentery and is transmitted through contaminated food or water and person-to-person contact (1). Infections occur most commonly in developing countries. (1,2) The 1971 outbreak in the United States was associated with imported cheese. (3) More recently, contaminated vegetables were implicated in outbreaks in Italy in 2012 and the United Kingdom in 2014. (4,5) A 2018 outbreak investigation did not reveal the specific vehicle through which EIEC was transmitted.
