A Mpumalanga woman is making a speedy recovery in hospital after becoming
the first person to contract cholera within South Africa's borders during
the current southern African outbreak. The mother of five, who comes from
Phiva village, was admitted to Shongwe hospital on Friday with profuse
watery diarrhoea.
Dr David Durrheim, a consultant in communicable disease control with the
Mpumalanga health department, said yesterday (Tuesday) that the woman had
not travelled outside the village and they suspected she had contracted
cholera from contaminated water from the Lomati River. "She has recovered
well and is ready for discharge," said Durrheim, adding that two of her
children also had diarrhoea, but tests revealed no evidence of cholera
infection. He said her children, as well as other villagers, are being
monitored carefully. A local clinic had remained open over the weekend with
stool specimens continuously being sent through for testing. A field
hospital was on stand-by, but Durrheim described the present situation as
stable. Water Affairs were also ensuring clean water from a nearby water
project.
Durrheim said cholera occurs in areas of poor hygiene where domestic water
is contained with human faeces. Food which is contaminated by infected
food handlers or shellfish play a secondary role. The most profound
symptom is diarrhoea which leads to a huge loss of fluid and the person
dehydrates rapidly. "The most important thing is to rehydrate the person,"
Durrheim said, warning that cholera is easily spread in areas of poor
sanitation. The women is the sixth person in the region to be stricken with
the life-threatening disease since January. The other five victims in the
province contracted the disease in Mozambique, where about 15,000 people
were infected and more than 300 people have died since an outbreak began
last August. Farmers in the area were being urged to provide adequate
ablutions for casual labour during the current harvesting season.
