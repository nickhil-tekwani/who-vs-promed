Health officials say they are uncertain why the number of cases of valley fever [coccidioidomycosis] -- an illness caused by a fungus found in the soil and dirt -- appears to be increasing across California this year [edited]. From [1 Jan to 31 Oct 2017], a total of 5121 provisional cases of valley fever were reported to local health departments in California, according to provisional data released by the California Department of Public Health [CDPH], on [14 Nov 2017].

This reflects an increase of 34 per cent, or of 1294 provisional cases, from the 3827 reported during the same period in 2016. These numbers include both suspected and confirmed cases of valley fever.

The number of cases of valley fever varies from year to year and the disease is commonest in the summer and late fall; however, state officials are uncertain why cases in 2017 are higher. "With an increase in reported valley fever cases, it is important that people living, working, and travelling in California are aware of its symptoms, especially in the southern San Joaquin Valley and the Central Coast, where it is most common," said CDPH director and state public health officer Dr Karen Smith in a statement.

Provisional data from the California Department of Health also indicated that the number of reported cases were also on the rise in Los Angeles County and in Kern County. In Los Angeles County, 681 cases were reported in 2017 compared with 621 during the same period in 2016 and 504 in 2015. And in Kern County, 1855 cases were reported in 2017 compared with 1306 during the same period in 2016 and 529 during the same period in 2015.

Caused by the spore of fungus that grows in the soil in part of the south western United States, valley fever can infect individuals who breathe in spores present in dust that gets into the air when it is windy or when soil is disturbed. Also known as coccidioidomycosis, valley fever can display symptoms similar to other illnesses like influenza. "In these areas, anyone who develops flu-like symptoms, such as cough, fever, or difficulty breathing, lasting 2 weeks or more, should ask their health care provider about valley fever," Smith said. Severe complications of the illness include pneumonia or infection of the brain, joints, bone, skin, or other organs.

To reduce the risk of catching valley fever, the CDPH recommends staying inside with the windows closed in areas where valley fever is common, wearing a properly fitted mask when outdoors, and refraining from disturbing the soil whenever possible.

[Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as "valley fever" is a mammalian fungal disease caused by _Coccidioides immitis_ or _C. posadasii_. _C. immitis_ is a dimorphic saprophytic fungus that grows as a mycelium in the soil and produces a spherule form in the host organism.

Coccidioidomycosis is endemic in certain parts of Arizona, California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and northern Mexico. Infections usually occur due to inhalation of the spores after soil disruption. The disease is not contagious and in some cases the infection may recur or become chronic. - Mod.EP
