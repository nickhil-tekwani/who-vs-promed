An outbreak of influenza, commonly known as the winter flu, has killed 18 people across the country in just one week, Greek public health authorities revealed on [Fri 25 Jan 2019].

New data from the Greek Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) also shows that more than 100 are currently hospitalized, some of them in critical condition.

Out of the 18 victims, 14 were men and 4 were women, with ages ranging from 25 to 90 years old.

According to KEELPNO, younger people are now more prone to come down with a case of influenza. During the last week, the number of people aged between 0-14 years old who visited a doctor showing symptoms of the flu rose dramatically.

Out of the total of 117 serious cases of the flu recorded so far this winter [2018-19], only 20 percent of the victims had been vaccinated.

Influenza kills tens of people across the country every year, mainly people with additional health conditions.

For this reason, health authorities warn people to be cautious and get a vaccination if they belong to sensitive groups, such as the elderly or workers in the health sector.

Czech Republic is now facing a large-scale influenza epidemic as the number of patients this week increased by 18.5 percent over that of last week, the country's health ministry said [Fri 1 Feb 2019].

Statistics from the ministry show that this week [week of 28 Jan 2019], the total illness of acute respiratory infections, including influenza, stood at 1715 patients per 100 000 inhabitants.

"The latest data from the State Institute of Health confirm that a large-scale influenza epidemic is occurring throughout the Czech Republic. The type A influenza virus is primarily circulating," said Eva Gottvald, the country's Chief Hygiene Officer.

The rise was recorded in all age groups -- the highest in pre-school children, and in all regions of the country, Gottvald said.

People are recommended to avoid crowded places and observe basic hygiene rules, such as washing hands after using public transport.

The National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and the infectious diseases epidemiology department of the State Health Institute in cooperation with regional hygienic stations will continue to monitor the development of morbidity, said the health ministry.

The health ministry said on [Fri 1 Feb 2019], that 4 deaths linked with type A influenza have been recorded in Cyprus as incidents remain high after rising in the 3rd week of December [2018].

In a statement, the ministry said 25 serious flu incidents were recorded in the past 2 months, 10 of which had to be treated in intensive care units, with 4 people eventually succumbing.

Eighteen of the patients had predisposing risk factors including diabetes, asthma and chronic respiratory or blood ailments. The ages varied between 20 months and 91-years-old.

Of the 4 patients who died, 3 had been suffering with chronic ailments, which were exacerbated by the flu. In the 4th case the flu worsened the patient's already serious clinical condition. "They did not die of flu. The flu exacerbated their ailments," Head of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Unit of the health ministry, Maria Koliou, told state broadcaster CyBC.

Among patients who admitted to hospital due to the flu is a 2.5-year-old girl who is in serious condition at the ICU in Makarios children's hospital. "Her situation is serious, not critical, but it seems to have caused serious complication to the central nervous system mainly to the brain of the child," Avraam Elia, head of the Makarios hospital's paediatric clinic told CyBC.

Elia said that the hospital had exceeded full capacity during the past weeks, but this week things were slightly better as it is, on average, at 90 per cent of capacity. "This is normal during the winter months. I cannot say this was an epidemic," he said.

He added that flu was "slightly more aggressive this year [2018-19] than usual" and that it can cause serious complications not only to vulnerable groups but also to the wider population. "But these cases are isolated."

On Wednesday night [30 Jan 2019], the children's playroom at Limassol hospital's paediatric clinic was turned into a ward as there was no other space to place children, as 45 children were admitted. The ward has 30 beds. The hospital said on [Fri 1 Feb 2019] that the playroom was no longer used as a ward since then other rooms at the hospital have been prepared to receive patients if necessary.

The ministry urged the public, especially vulnerable groups, to apply personal hygiene measures like airing living spaces and places of work, using tissues and binning them after each use, washing hands frequently, avoiding contact with ill people and following a healthy diet.

According to the ministry, the best way of protection, especially for vulnerable groups, was the flu vaccine.

Vaccination is recommended for people over 65, children over 6 months, and adults with chronic ailments.

Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced today [1 Feb 2019] 7 more people have died this season [2018-19] due to flu-related complications.

One of the 7 was a 4-year-old girl who suffered both encephalitis and pneumonia after contracting the H1N1 strain of the influenza virus. The girl passed away just 2 days after she began to exhibit symptoms.

CNA interviewed CDC Deputy Director Dr Yi-jun Luo Friday afternoon [1 Feb 2019]. The doctor said the flu epidemic should not be ignored and immediate action ought to be taken at the 1st sign of serious symptoms.

The girl reportedly caught a fever [22 Jan 2019] and began vomiting and exhibiting fatigue the next day, after which she was rushed to hospital. An MRI scan revealed her brain was inflamed and bleeding.

Doctors were unable to save her.

The other 6 who recently passed away were aged between 52 and 93, and all had a history of chronic illness. Of the 7 in total, 6 contracted the H1N1 strain and one contracted the H3N2 flu virus.

The number of new influenza cases among populations in the world's northern hemisphere has increased dramatically over the past few weeks, said Dr Luo.

In Taiwan, 4 children have died this season [2018-19] after contracting the H1N1 virus, he commented. Dr Luo said parents should watch their children closely if they develop a cold and be on the lookout for more serious developments like vomiting, twitching, and loss of consciousness.

Statistics show the morality rate of children who develop encephalitis after contracting influenza is 30 percent. Dr Luo reminded the public that the condition develops rapidly, but vaccines are publicly available for protection.

As of [1 Feb 2019], 57 cases of influenza with serious complications have been detected this season, CNA reports, the majority of which were A types including H1N1, which tends to strike people aged 65 and over the hardest.

A total of 406 cases with serious complications have been recorded since [1 Oct 2018] and 34 people have died, according to CNA.

The risk of contracting flu runs particularly high around the Lunar New Year, and the CDC reminds citizens to take extra care of their health and hygiene, rest frequently, and reduce the risk of contagion as much as possible.

An outbreak of swine flu [influenza A(H1N1)] in Morocco has left 9 people dead in the past week, the kingdom's health minister said [Sat 2 Feb 2019].

The spread of the H1N1 virus was "normal" for the time of the year, said Anas Doukkali, quoted by Morocco's official MAP news agency.

The 1st death in Morocco from the influenza-type virus was reported by local media on [Wed 30 Jan 2019], since when anxious rumours have spread on social media.

"Vigilant efforts continue to detect possible cases in different hospitals across the kingdom," said government spokesman Mustapha Khalfi.

H1N1 is a respiratory disease contracted through contact between humans and pigs and transmitted between people through inhalation.

A major H1N1 outbreak sparked a World Health Organization pandemic alert in June 2009.

It killed around 18 500 people in 214 countries before the alert was lifted in August 2010.

For the 1st time this flu season [2018-19], the North Dakota Department of Health is reporting widespread influenza activity. According to the department, there have been more than 1800 cases of flu reported so far this season.

Many of those people are under 10 years old.

They also say only 44% of North Dakota children ages 6 months to 4 years are vaccinated.

The latest statewide flu report shows cases jumped by over 150 from this week [week of 28 Jan 2019] to last. 472 cases of the flu were reported this week, compared to 304 last week.

But numbers are still quite a bit down from 2018. This time last year 861 people reported having the flu, that's almost double from what the health department is seeing today.

To date, 5 people have died this year [2019] due to flu related symptoms.

The Department of Health urges people to get vaccinated.

Alberta Health Services [AHS] has confirmed the 1st death from lab-confirmed influenza in the South Zone this season [2018-19].

According to the report released on [Thu 31 Jan 2019], the death in the South Zone, which includes Medicine Hat and Lethbridge, brings the total number of deceased across Alberta to 28 as of [26 Jan 2019].

AHS did not provide any additional information on the death such as the person's age or location, citing privacy reasons.

"Generally speaking, when it comes to influenza, the extremes of life are the most vulnerable to influenza, so our very young and our very old, or if you have chronic conditions," said Dr Lizette Elumir, medical officer of health with the South Zone, over the phone from Lethbridge. "That's what we generally see."

The Calgary Zone and the Central Zone have both reported 9 deaths this season [2018-19], while Edmonton has reported 7 and the North Zone has reported 2.

A total of 1151 people have been hospitalized as a result of influenza this season. Of those, 54 people were located in the South Zone.

Elumir says year-to-year comparisons of the influenza season are hard to make, due to different virus strains each year, but this year's season [2018-19] appears to not be hitting Albertans as hard as other years. This year's primary strain is H1N1.

"You see different populations affected," she said. "This year, we're not getting outbreaks in our seniors' facilities, we're seeing more young people hospitalized, it's more of a younger population that are affected, and this year [2018], our numbers are quite a bit lower than they were last year [2019]."

More than 1.2 million flu vaccines have been administered this season. Elumir says preliminary data from this season shows this year's vaccine has been 70 per cent effective, and she is also hoping people are continuing to take precautions to avoid spreading the illness.

"I've always said that our community has a lot of control over how the flu season goes, because it's spread person to person," she said. "When everyone does their part to try and prevent that transmission, by staying home, getting vaccinated, washing your hands, doing all of the things you're supposed to be doing, it really makes the season less overwhelming."

Influenza season typically ends in March, though Elumir notes the province will likely see a spike in the number of cases from the "B" strain of influenza towards the end of the season.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The winter 2018/19 influenza season in Hong Kong has been predominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as at January 2019. We enrolled 2016 children in 3 public hospitals in Hong Kong between [2 Sep 2018 and 11 Jan 2019]. Using the test-negative approach, we estimated high early season effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine against influenza A or B of 90% (95% confidence interval (CI): 80-95% ) and 92% (95% CI: 82-96%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

[In order to prevent influenza infections and severe outcomes, inactivated influenza vaccines (northern hemisphere formulation) are available, almost all of which are quadrivalent, and according to the publication above, "more than 1 million doses have been administered in Hong Kong during the 2018/19 season in the local population of 7.4 million. Priority groups for vaccination include older adults, adults with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, healthcare workers, and children up to the age of 12 years.' The early vaccine effectiveness estimates are quite positive with over 90 percent response in recipients. - Mod.UBA]
