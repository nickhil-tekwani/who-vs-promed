[This is in addition to [data about the HFRS in Russia (Yaroslavl Oblast)
received from Nezavisimaya Gazeta's reporter, 10 Feb 2000.
As I cleared from my medical collegues from Moscow, total illnesses with
HFRS was 19, including 17 children and 2 adults. No deaths were noted.
Disease was caused by Puumala [hantavirus.

[I suppose this brings to a close our reports on this topic. We do not
know how the diagnosis was made and on what basis. We have no data
regarding the remarkable clustering of 19 cases within a single school. We
do not know the rate of prevalence of infection of the rodent vector. We
do not know the rodent vector (genus and species) of the virus causing this
cluster of infections.
This disease might be better called Nephropathia Epidemica (caused by
Puumala virus) than hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (caused by
Hantaan and other hantaviruses). String, unfortunately and
unsatisfactorily, cut. - Mod.CHC
