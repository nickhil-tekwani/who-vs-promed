France Says Animal That Provoked Mad Cow Fears Was Not Infected 17 Feb 2000
France's Agriculture Ministry said Thursday a cow which arrived at a
slaughterhouse last week showing signs of mad cow disease (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) was actually not infected with the
brain-wasting ailment.
Health officials initially said the milk cow showed all the signs of the
illness, sparking an investigation into why it went unnoticed until
arriving for possible human consumption at a slaughterhouse in western
France on Feb. 8.
Tests on the animal's carcass showed it was not infected with BSE although
it was unhealthy, the ministry said. The milk cow and its herd were
slaughtered last week as a precautionary measure, and police had opened an
inquiry.
France has said it will soon begin testing cattle destined for human
consumption to determine how widespread the disease has become.
Authorities say new cases of the disease will break out in France until
2001, five years after stringent prevention measures were taken against the
disease, which has an average incubation period of 5 years.
Six cases of BSE have been found in France since the start of the year.
France has sparked a quarrel within the European Union by keeping in place
its ban on beef from Britain, where the disease first started an
international scare in 1996.
The EU ruled in August that British beef was again safe for import, but
France has maintained its ban.

[This is still disturbing news. Even though the cow evidently did not have
BSE, it was still an _unhealthy cow_ (by their own admittance), that made
it to the slaughter house, without the proper documentation. One animal
with obvious signs and defective papers gets through the system, one can
safely assume this is not a unique event. So, this only proves that the
potential for BSE infected cow to make it into the food chain. Fortunately
this time it was seen and it turned out to not be BSE. The others? Since
the entire herd was slaughtered, is there a funding buy-out since this has
turned out not to BSE?. With accidents like this, it is unlikely France
will meet its goal. - Mod.TG
