Rabid Beaver Killed In Harford County
-------------------------------------------
A beaver that attacked and bit several people last weekend [13-14 Aug 2005]
in Rocks State Park has tested positive for rabies. Health officials say
the attack happened in the Deer Creek area of the park. The beaver was
caught and euthanized.
Right now, the Harford County Health Department is warning the public that
other beavers in the park may be rabid. There is also the possibility that
other animals in the park are affected as well. Anyone visiting the park
should use extreme caution when walking or playing around Deer Creek.
In all, 3 people were bitten by the rabid beaver. All are getting vaccines
to minimize their risk of developing rabies.
Anyone bitten or scratched by a beaver or other animal should immediately
visit the emergency room and contact the Harford County Health Department.

[Beavers are not animals that we often think of as biting and attacking
people. Clearly, a beaver attacking people would be rather unusual, but
rabies is known to affect almost any animal.
The article indicates the people who were bitten are getting vaccines;
presumably, this is post exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.TG]
