Climate change and deforestation may increase botfly infection in wild birds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Argentine scientists studied the context that determines variability in the abundance of a parasitic larva that affects bird chicks. The findings, published in the scientific journal PLoS ONE, alert that the joint action of forest fragmentation and climate change (2 of the main drivers of the global environmental change) may result in considerable increases in this parasite's populations.

In temperate and tropical areas of the Americas, bird chicks are the target of parasitic flies known as _Philornis_. Argentine scientists studied the circumstances that drive the abundance of these parasites. After considering a myriad of variables acting at different levels, just 3 factors proved to truly govern this parasite's populations. Slight changes in precipitation, brood crowding, and vegetation structure resulted in large increases in the number of parasites per chick. In the region, 2 human-driven phenomena directly influence those factors: climate change and deforestation. The scenario is good for parasites, and bad for birds.

In the chicks, _Philornis_ botflies cause subcutaneous myiasis, which is a type of parasitic disease caused by fly larvae (botflies) that burrow under the skin of animals and feed on their tissues and fluids. There are many fly species that cause myiasis, affecting wild and domestic animals, and even humans, as is the case with the human botfly (_Dermatobia hominis_).

About a decade ago, researchers from the Disease Ecology Laboratory of Instituto de Ciencias Veterinarias del Litoral, Argentina (ICIVET, UNL-CONICET [National Council of Scientific and Technical Research by its initials in Spanish] and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), undertook studies on the epidemiology of myiasis in wild birds. The ecology of this kind of parasitism has been very little studied. Myiasis represent a singular type of infection, as -- unlike most infectious and parasitic diseases -- the parasite actively seeks the animal it will feed on, and in some cases does so over very long distances. This necessarily implies a distinct epidemiological pattern", said the veterinarian Dario Manzoli, who is currently writing his doctoral thesis on the subject.

Dr Pablo Beldomenico, leader of the project and director of the Disease Ecology Laboratory of ICIVET, UNL-CONICET, believes that flies of the genus _Philornis_ are an ideal model to study this kind of parasitic diseases. "When we began to investigate _Philornis torquans_ in the region, we realized that we were faced with a formidable system to study the ecology of myiasis. These flies only parasitize chicks of wild birds. They (the chicks) remain in their nests for the whole period in which they are susceptible to the parasite. At the same time, the larvae do not migrate once they penetrate in the chick's body. They develop underneath the point where they entered the skin, and they grow so much that are very easily spotted. All this allows us to obtain detailed information from every single chick present in a patch of forest, from the day they hatch until they fledge."

The study
---------
The investigation consisted of 4 parallel studies that focused on different levels of the biological hierarchy, from the chick (individual) up to the whole bird community, while also exploring different temporal scales (weeks, months or years). The information was gathered by taking repeated observations from over 4000 chicks at 2 riparian forests located in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. The project was principally funded by Morris Animal Foundation, but also received important contributions from WCS and CONICET.

Several variables were associated with increases in the abundance of botflies at each hierarchical level, but only a few truly governed the population dynamics of this parasite. The most important factors were the precipitation, the density of broods, and the vegetation structure. Although to a lesser extent, the air temperature also had a significant influence. The results showed that one month after a heavy rainfall the amount of larvae per chick increased considerably. Similarly, rainy years were years of heavy botfly burdens. At the same time, increases in the number of chicks per hectare were followed by greater burdens of larvae per chick. The vegetation surrounding the nests also had a very marked effect, especially the height of the forest. The parasite burdens were much higher in forests of lower height. Forests that go through major disturbance such as fire, insect infestation, or timber harvest, are generally not so tall.

Worrying scenario
-----------------
"If we analyze these results together with those of previous studies, the prospects are ideal for parasites and terrible for birds", said Dr Beldomenico. "Climate change projections for the region anticipate greater rainfall and higher temperatures. At the same time, birds are running out of forest habitat to nest in, and as a result, their broods are crowded together. This scenario favors parasite proliferation and birds suffering the cost."

The research also revealed many other interesting phenomena previously unknown for this parasite, as for example, that _Philornis torquans_ prefers great kiskadees above all other bird species, but when this bird is not abundant it can adapt to other species that it will choose depending on their availability. Altogether, these results constitute a valuable contribution to our knowledge of the ecology of myiasis and induce novel hypotheses to be tested by new studies. It also issues a piece of warning, "As we continue to alter the climate, cut down, and disturb native forests, and so on, we will see the impacts of those actions affecting the health of wildlife. Eventually, we will see them affecting our own species," said Manzoli.
