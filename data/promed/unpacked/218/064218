Guyra [New South Wales] has been identified as a hotspot for Q fever, with as much as 22 percent of the population showing exposure to the disease. The statistic was revealed on last week's [week of 6 Jul 2015] episode of the ABC program Landline [http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2015/s4271952.htm]. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has promised to keep a "watching brief" on the incidence of Q fever -- an infectious disease passed from animals to humans -- as dry conditions provide an ideal environment for the airborne organism to spread.

Q fever can be passed on from almost any animal, but is mostly spread by goats, sheep, and cattle. The early symptoms resemble the flu and include high temperature, sweating, and body aches and pains. If caught early, it can be treated with antibiotics. But it has become increasingly clear that 20 to 25 per cent of cases do not fully recover, with sufferers going on to develop long-term chronic fatigue.

Approximately 2 per cent of people who contract the disease end up with a life-threatening failure of their heart valves, and a small percentage die from the disease.

Q fever -- the Q standing for Query -- is an international disease, identified in almost every country except New Zealand, but Australia is the only place that has an effective vaccine. Classed as a notifiable disease, just under 500 Australian cases are registered each year, almost half of them in Queensland.

The Q-vax vaccine was introduced to abattoir workers in the early 1990s and resulted in a halving of the number of Q fever cases nationally. A federally funded vaccination campaign targeting sheep, cattle, and dairy farmers was rolled out from 2001-2005, again with a dramatic drop in notifications.

With case numbers edging up slightly in the past 2 years, and a lack of awareness of the disease even in rural areas where it is most prevalent, there have been calls for another subsidised vaccination campaign. But Ms Ley said she would not agree to another vaccination campaign "at this stage".

Guyra, a town with a population of almost 2000 people in 2011, the seat of Guyra Shire, with a population of 4397 people in 2011, is located at an elevation of 1330 m (4364 ft) above sea level on the Northern Tablelands in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The New England region is about 60 km (37 mi) inland from the Pacific Coast. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 10 per cent of the population of Guyra Shire.

_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen causes Q fever. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats, which serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Q fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.

Guyra was home to a large regional abattoir that employed up to 350 staff until it closed in 1995; the abattoir building now houses an angora rabbit breeding establishment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The principal industries include wool, lambs, and beef cattle, which may explain why Guyra is a "hot-spot" for Q fever.

In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in "at-risk" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism; workers at pig abattoirs do not require Q fever vaccination (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15).

If the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15). Q fever vaccine is not routinely recommended for children aged less than 15 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women because safety of the vaccine in these situations has not been established. Revaccination is not indicated due to the possibility of severe hypersensitivity reactions. - Mod.ML]
