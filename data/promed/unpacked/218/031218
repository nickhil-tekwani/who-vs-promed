New norovirus strain responsible for wave of gastrointestinal infections
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal scientists have discovered that a new
strain of norovirus is responsible for the wave
of intense gastrointestinal infections that have
overwhelmed hospitals, nursing homes, and college
dormitories across New England and the nation
this winter. The finding provides an important
clue to the severity and breadth of this season's
outbreak, which has alarmed disease specialists
because so many adults and children have become
so sick. Knowing that few people had previously
been exposed to the strain, researchers assume
virtually everyone is vulnerable to the germ,
which can prove especially dangerous to the frail and elderly.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) expects to officially report its findings
on the new form of the virus in coming weeks.
Genetic fingerprinting shows that the virus
infecting patients is distinct and aggressive:
When the CDC tested stool specimens from October
through December [2006], 60 percent of those
patients were positive for the new form of
norovirus. "When we get these emergent strains of
a virus, it's very hard to know where or why they
sprang up -- they seem to come up like daffodils
in spring," said Dr. Marc-Alain Widdowson, a top
norovirus researcher at the CDC in Atlanta.
Disease trackers 1st detected evidence in January
2006 that a novel type of norovirus might be
circulating, when passengers aboard the Minerva
II cruise ship fell ill with a particularly
virulent gastrointestinal bug. By last fall,
researchers' sophisticated genetic testing on
stool samples had begun to better distinguish the
new strain from previously identified versions.
The federal researchers have christened the
strain GII.4 Minerva. Identifying the new strain
could prove useful as researchers investigate
drugs to treat the viral infection and,
potentially, vaccines to prevent contagion, scientists said.
"There isn't any doubt that the public
health-communicable disease community has been
abuzz about norovirus over the past 6 months,"
said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease
specialist at Vanderbilt University. "In some
jurisdictions, there have been so many outbreaks
they can barely tote them up, let alone
investigate them. And it's a much more
substantial infection this year, so knowing its
identity is important for several reasons." The
Northeast and California have been particularly hard-hit, Widdowson said.
Norovirus outbreaks are nothing new aboard cruise
ships or in schools. In fact, the virus acquired
its name from Norwalk, Ohio, where a virulent
virus infected an elementary school in 1968. But
outbreaks in US hospitals and nursing homes had
been uncommon � until this year. In
Massachusetts, patients and staff have fallen ill
at the VA Boston Healthcare System, McLean
Hospital, and, most recently, Hebrew
Rehabilitation Center in Roslindale, where 225
residents and 119 staff members became sick over the last 2 weeks.
The size of the outbreaks and their severity
suggested that an especially nasty bug had
arrived. In the past, norovirus infections
routinely passed after a day and fever was rare.
This year, specialists said, some patients were
sick for 3 or 4 days and developed fevers. "We
have received more reports involving fever and
longer duration of symptoms," said Jan Vinje, a
CDC virus specialist and one of the discoverers
of the new strain. "I have not had norovirus, but
I cannot imagine how you can survive 4 days of vomiting."
The discovery of the new strain, though, only
partially answers the question of why norovirus
has proved so threatening this winter. "When you
get a new strain sweeping through, there are
questions about why is this such a successful
strain," said Emory University infectious disease
specialist Christine Moe, whose research group
spends much of its time studying norovirus. "And
it could be due to a number of reasons." There
could be something about the emergent strain, for
example, that makes it hardier, allowing it to
survive longer on elevator buttons, telephone
receivers, or salad bar counters. The strain may
also be more resistant to cleaning agents. It may
also survive longer in its victims, meaning that
even after patients recover, the virus would be
present in their stools and they could infect
others through poor personal hygiene.
Specialists also hypothesize that the new strain
may have the capacity to attach itself at more
points to a human cell, making it more dangerous
to more people. Determining the reasons for the
virulence of the current strain is pivotal, but
not easy. Although scientists identified the 1st
strain of norovirus more than 3 decades ago, they
have not succeeded in routinely growing it in
laboratories. That makes the virus more difficult
to study and, by extension, makes development of
antiviral drugs and vaccines more daunting. "If
we had a system that could grow the virus, we
would be able to ask a lot of other questions
that we might be able to get answers to," said
Dr. Robert Atmar, a virus specialist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Dr. Anita Barry, Boston's director of
communicable disease control, said that it is
important to recognize that a new strain of
norovirus is making the rounds. "We know with
norovirus that when you get one strain, it
doesn't necessarily offer protection against
another strain," Barry said. "'You can get this
illness repeatedly, and that's why prevention is
really the way that people need to go to prevent
this. "So, please, make sure you wash your hands," she said.

[Noroviruses are highly infectious and the major
cause of sudden-onset gastroenteritis in adults,
with pandemic spread of the virus being reported
from 1995 onwards. Noroviruses are named after
the original isolate �Norwalk virus,� which
caused an outbreak of gastroenteritis in a school
in Norwalk, Ohio, in 1968. Currently, there are
at least 7 norovirus genogroups (GI, GII, GIII,
GIV, GV, GVI and GVII), which in turn are
divided into more than 31 genetic clusters.
The 1st novel variants of genotype GII.4 appeared
during the 2005/2006 season [in Europe], and
became the predominant strain in summer 2006. For
variant 2006a, the 1st entry in the database is
from an outbreak or case in England in 2005.
Subsequently the 1st 2006b variant was reported
from Spain in December 2005 after an outbreak in
a residential institution. In the spring of 2006,
this variant was found to be circulating widely,
causing at least 45 outbreaks of norovirus
illness in Europe and on cruise ships. The
emergence of variants 2006a and 2006b was
followed sequentially by the appearance of new
variants within genogroup GII.4 which coincided
with high levels of outbreak reporting worldwide.
It is likely that the variant currently causing
more severe outbreaks of disease in North America
is a novel variant. Precise information on the
identity of this new variant and it relationship
to existing genogroup II4 variants is awaited. - Mod.CP]
