several days ago in Mansoa, approximately 65 km to the east of
Bissau, were reported Weds. in the capital by Guinea-Bissau medical
sources without specifying the number of cases reported.
The health authorities have refused to comment on this "as yet we do
not have all the information on this occurrence".
The person responsible for planning in the Ministry of Public Health,
Roberto Cacheu, declared that as of now there are no reasons for
alarm.
In 2002, an epidemic of cholera lead to dozens of death in Bissau and

[Guinea-Bissau is situated on the west coast of Africa and is
bordered to the north by Senegal, the east and southeast by Guinea
and west southwest by the Atlantic Ocean. Given the history of
yellow fever activity in Senegal and Guinea earlier this year,
possible yellow fever activity in Guinea-Bissau might be an
explanation of this outbreak of "hemorrhagic fever". Clearly more
information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. -
