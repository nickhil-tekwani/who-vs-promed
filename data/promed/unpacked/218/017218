Detection of prions in mouse muscle tissue
------------------------------------------
Researchers studying mice have made a discovery that is certain to upset
anyone who loves the rump end of beef but worries about mad cow disease. In
mice, at least, the aberrant proteins that cause the condition seem to
accumulate in muscle tissue, especially the hindquarters. Until now, the
harmful proteins had been seen only in brain or nervous system tissue. The
researchers stress that the finding has been seen only in mice and may not
apply to animals that people eat. But, they say, it is alarming enough to
warrant urgent testing of obviously infected livestock to see if their meat
harbors the aberrant proteins, called prions. Prions cause spongiform
encephalopathies, lethal neurological conditions such as mad cow disease in
cattle, chronic wasting disease in elk and deer, and scrapie in sheep. As
far as anyone knows, only the cattle disease has infected people, who are
believed to have contracted it by eating meat from diseased animals.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is now killing all deer
and elk herds that have been exposed to chronic wasting disease, said Dr
Linda Detwiler, a veterinarian who leads the mad cow disease working group
at the department. The USDA will look into the new finding and do
cooperative studies with scientific laboratories around the world, she
said. As of 4 Mar 2002, 116 people, mostly from Britain, had died or were
dying from the human prion disease, called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (vCJD).
Until now, scientists have believed that harmful prions are found
exclusively in brain, spinal cord, and lymph tissues of infected animals
and that meat becomes contaminated with them in the rendering and
slaughtering process. To prevent prion diseases from spreading, many
governments ban nervous tissue from entering human and certain animal food
supplies. "The message from this work is that we should not take anything
for granted," says Dr Giuseppe Legname, an adjunct assistant professor of
neurology, who helped carry out the study at the University of California
at San Francisco (UCSF). It should be possible, he says, to test 50
infected animals from various kinds and breeds of livestock to determine
quickly if deadly prions are found in any of their muscle meats.
Cattle continue to suffer mad cow disease in Britain, where the epidemic
began in the early 1980s, although the number of newly diagnosed cases in
animals is falling each year. Meanwhile, the disease is increasing on
mainland Europe, where many cattle ate infected meat and bone meal exported
from Britain in the 1990s. An [unrelated epidemic of chronic wasting
disease in deer and elk is haunting game farms and hunting grounds in the
United States and Canada.
The mouse experiment, being reported today in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, USA [see below, was begun more than 5 years
ago in the UCSF laboratory of Dr Stanley Prusiner, who was the first person
to describe prion diseases. Prions are normal proteins found on the surface
of cells throughout the body. Their function is not known. Infectious
prions are produced when normal prions, for unknown reasons, assume a
flattened shape that prevents them from being broken down by the body.
Instead, the abnormal prions accumulate into toxic clumps that somehow
produce lethal holes in brain tissue. Infectious prions can convert healthy
prions into abnormal ones, relentlessly propagating the disease.
"Prions we knew could be found in tissues outside the central nervous
system, but it was not clear how they got there," says Dr Patrick J Bosque,
an assistant professor of neurology at the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center. It was widely believed that prions were not found in
skeletal muscle. People looked in the early years of the mad cow epidemic,
but the tests available then were extremely time consuming and not very
sensitive. Moreover, researchers may have looked at the wrong muscles, says
Bosque. To find out if prions could replicate in muscle tissue
independently, the scientists created mice that "expressed" or made normal
prions in muscle but nowhere else in the body. Whatever prions do, Dr
Legname says, other proteins must be able to compensate in other tissues
since the animals appear healthy. Scientists also know that normal prions
must be present for the disease to take hold, which in this transgenic
mouse could happen only in muscle.
When the mice were injected with abnormal mouse prions, the infection
spread inside muscle, Dr Legname says, but not just any muscle. Infectious
prions seemed to favor the mouse's hind leg and were found there in very
high levels, but the reason is not known. But transgenic mice are not
normal creatures, and the ones used in this experiment were especially
sensitive to prions. They were injected with, rather than fed, the
disease-causing agent. So it is too soon to say whether the findings will
be widely applicable. Dr Legname says it would be prudent to test livestock
known to carry prion diseases. He says the tests used in the laboratory
mice could be adapted for cattle, deer and other animals. Tissue will have
to be injected into other animals to see if the infection crosses between
species, a process that may take years.

This paper has great theoretical interest, but its immediate relevance to
the consumption of meat is problematic in the continuing absence of
knowledge of the precise route of transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (abbreviated vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail) from infected
cattle to the human population.
The authors of the paper summarise their findings as follows: "Considerable
evidence argues that consumption of beef products from cattle infected with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prions causes new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In an effort to prevent new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, certain "specified offals," including neural and
lymphatic tissues, thought to contain high titers of prions have been
excluded from foods destined for human consumption [Phillips NA, Bridgeman
J, Ferguson-Smith M. The BSE inquiry. London: Stationery Office, 2000: vol.
6, pp. 413-51. Here we report that mouse skeletal muscle can propagate
prions and accumulate substantial titers of these pathogens. We found both
high prion titers and the disease-causing isoform of the prion protein
(PrPSc) in the skeletal muscle of wild-type mice inoculated with either the
Me7 or Rocky Mountain Laboratory strain of murine prions. Particular
muscles accumulated distinct levels of PrPSc, with the highest levels
observed in muscle from the hind limb. To determine whether prions are
produced or merely accumulate intramuscularly, we established transgenic
mice expressing either mouse or Syrian hamster PrP exclusively in muscle.
Inoculating these mice intramuscularly with prions resulted in the
formation of high titers of nascent prions in muscle. In contrast,
inoculating mice in which PrP expression was targeted to hepatocytes
resulted in low prion titers. Our data demonstrate that factors in addition
to the amount of PrP expressed determine the tropism of prions for certain
tissues. That some muscles are intrinsically capable of accumulating
substantial titers of prions is of particular concern. Because significant
dietary exposure to prions might occur through the consumption of meat,
even if it is largely free of neural and lymphatic tissue, a comprehensive
effort to map the distribution of prions in the muscle of infected
livestock is needed. Furthermore, muscle may provide a readily biopsied
tissue from which to diagnose prion disease in asymptomatic animals and
even humans." - Mod.CP
