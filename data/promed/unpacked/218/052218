The Hebrew Home at Riverdale has implemented more stringent water restrictions and testing after 5 residents contracted Legionnaires' disease. All 5 have recovered, according to Hebrew Home officials, and none required hospitalization.

"I've been here 32 years, and this is the 1st time we ever dealt with something like this," said David Pomeranz, chief operating officer of RiverSpring Health, the Hebrew Home's parent organization.

Doctors at the Hebrew Home discovered the 5 were infected with the _Legionella_ bacteria, which causes Legionnaires' disease, last month [October 2017], according to state health department officials. They were immediately placed on a 10-day antibiotic regimen, while water used in the Palisade Avenue facility's cooling towers were treated with additional chemicals designed to destroy the bacteria.

Despite the small outbreak, the Hebrew Home has closely followed state guidelines intended to prevent Legionnaires', Pomeranz said, but even that system isn't perfect.

Legionnaires' disease was 1st identified in 1976 when a number of people who attended an American Legion convention in Philadelphia suddenly developed pneumonia. Nearly 30 of them died. The history surrounding Legionnaires' is well known, which might explain why many fear even the mention of the disease. Yet, only a small fraction of people get sick from exposure to _Legionella_, health department officials said, which typically afflicts those who are older, or have weakened immune systems. "Our bodies are created with many, many natural defenses," said Dr. Zachary Palace, the Hebrew Home's medical director. "Our medical staff is very, very in-tune with this, and we have a high level of surveillance, especially with those who have upper respiratory issues."

Some residents who live near Hebrew Home, however, are upset that neither the assisted living facility nor the state health department let neighbors know there had been an outbreak. "As you know, Legionnaires' disease is an airborne disease most commonly associated with cooling towers," said [MZ], who lives just down the road at Sigma Place, in an email. Some of "the Hebrew Home cooling towers are at sidewalk level, almost abutting its easterly property line." Skyview-on-the-Hudson is just a few hundred feet away, [MZ] added, with other single-family homes nearby too. "It begs the question if (there is) both (a) civic and moral responsibility to proactively notify the Riverdale community."

But Legionnaires' typically can't be passed person-to-person, health officials said, and infection-causing exposure normally requires an indoor, enclosed environment. The bacteria are common, and many people may have been exposed to it in the past without even knowing it, or ever developing any health issues because of it. Yet, Pomeranz knows hearing about the disease can create fear -- especially after an outbreak in Manhattan over the summer claimed the life of one person, and sickened a handful of others.

"We have taken a very aggressive approach to not only write to all the families and all our residents, but to make ourselves available to help answer questions," Pomeranz said. "We don't want people to not want to come and visit their grandmother. That would be the worst thing that could happen."

Yet, the Hebrew Home -- and anyone using the city water supply locally -- will still have to remain vigilant to prevent another outbreak from happening. "The city treats water at every stage, but it still has to travel through old pipes that have been there a hundred years," Palace said. "The filaments of the pipes are breaking off and causing the bacteria to form in the water. Most people are healthy enough to where it won't affect them, but it's not unique to us, and it's in the water system."

[_Legionella_ species are found in natural and man-made aqueous environments and soil. Several of these _Legionella_ species are intra-cellular parasites of free-living amoebae.

Humans acquire these organisms after exposure to natural or man-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors wafted on air currents downwind from their source. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passers-by on Broad Street in front of the hotel, but who had never entered the Philadelphia hotel where the 1976 legionnaires' disease outbreak occurred (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

The above news report fails to give certain details concerning this outbreak. Were all 5 cases infected by the same species of _Legionella_, and if so, did their genotypes match? Matching genotypes would establish a common source outbreak. Also did the species of _Legionella_ and genotype isolated from the suspected source (the facility's cooling towers) match that of the clinical isolates? Transmission pathways can be identified on the basis of matching genotypes for the clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources in this regard.

Riverdale, with a population of 47 850 residents, is an upper middle class residential neighborhood, with parks, apartment buildings and single family houses, in the northwest portion of the Bronx, a borough in New York City (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdale,_Bronx). The neighborhood is bordered on the west by the Hudson River, on the north by the city of Yonkers in Westchester County, and on the south by the Harlem River. - Mod.ML
