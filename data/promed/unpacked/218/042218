IÂ´m Director of CENETROP (Centro Nacional de Enfermedades Tropicales) in
Santa Cruz, Bolivia.
We are having an outbreak of sylvatic yellow fever, our lab reported 28
positive samples of 86, and we have information of 10 deaths. All the cases
come from 2 rural areas. These areas are known as endemic for sylvatic
yellow fever.
We have _Aedes aegypti_ in the city but all the cases that have come to the
city hospital arrived at the end of the disease and the hospital personnel
are vaccinated against YF and the patients are protected with bednets. The
estimated rate of immunization against yellow fever is about 40% in the
city. Santa Cruz has 1 million inhabitants. Last week the health authority
has conducted a massive vaccination in the city.
