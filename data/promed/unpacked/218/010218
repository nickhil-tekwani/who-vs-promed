4th case of hantavirus [infection] in Cochabamba [Department]
-----------------------------------------------------------
A resident of Villa Tunar died this past Saturday [26 Jan 2008],
from irreversible damage to his body caused by the fatal hantavirus
disease, according to a reliable source in the Bolivian-Japanese
Gastroenterology Institute.

However, the director of the Departmental [state equivalent] Health
Services (SEDES), Rolando Iriarte, did not confirm hantavirus
[infection] as the cause of death, but acknowledged that is a
suspected [hantavirus] case because the symptoms are very similar [to
those caused by] this fatal disease.

Iriarte said that if this suspected case turns out to be positive for
hantavirus [infection] it would confirm the 3rd death of people dying
of fatal hantavirus infection; an additional patient is in the
process of recuperation. The SEDES Director explained that a
commission was sent to the Cochabamba tropics [Chapare] to strengthen
an anti-hantavirus public education campaign.

"70 professionals are carrying out household fumigation in the
Chapare," said Iriarte and "hospital buses," with 6 physicians
aboard, are carrying out health activities in Puerto Villarroel.

In 2005, 3 people died with symptoms of hantavirus [infection] and in
2006 there were [deaths of] 2 agricultural workers.

The long-tailed rat [probably _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_.[ -
Mod.TY] transmits the disease [virus] through its excretions in areas
away from populated areas. The persons who provide habitat for the
long-tailed rat can become infected through food contaminated with
excrement of these rodents and also through the air. This is why the
Villa Tunari municipality is sponsoring public education concerning
habits for [good] hygiene to protect their food stores [from contamination].

[Mod. CP provided excellent comments in ProMED archive number
20060220.0553 as follows: Hantaviruses in South America are
maintained in sigmodontine rodents. Several hantaviruses have been
associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western
Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central
Argentina; rodent host unknown), Lechiguanas (in central Argentina in
_O. flavescens_), Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O.
longicaudatus_), and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_)
virus. Other hantaviruses are present in various South American
countries and in Panama.

The Rio Mamore hantavirus found in the rodent _Oligoryzomys microtis_
occurs in Bolivia's lowland tropics, but has not been associated with
human disease.

Although this article does not specify the hantavirus involved,
because the long-tailed rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) is
mentioned as the probably reservoir host, it may be Bermejo virus.

The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/hpsslideset/hpsslides1-12.htm>)
