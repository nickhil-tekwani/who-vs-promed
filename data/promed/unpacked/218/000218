A family cluster of H7N9 [avian influenza] cases has been reported in Zhejiang where both parents and their daughter contracted the disease, bringing Mainland China's total number of the confirmed cases this month [January 2014] to 110, according to the Xinhua News Agency. An official with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Legal Evening News on Tuesday [27 Jan 2014] that the parents, who live in Xiaoshan, had worked as vegetable dealers in a wet market before falling sick, and that the daughter had also briefly helped at the market. Yet it was still unclear if human-to-human transmission among the family members in Xiaoshan was to blame, or whether all of them had been exposed to live poultry, the report said, adding that the health authorities are still investigating.

On Tuesday [28 Jan 2014], Jiangsu province reported one new case of H7N9, while 3 new cases were reported in Guangdong and 4 in Zhejiang. Among the total 110 confirmed cases this year [2014], 20 people have died.

The National Health and Family Planning Commission admitted earlier this week that it could not rule out the possibility of "limited" human-to-human infections of H7N9, but there was no evidence of sustained transmission yet. Meanwhile, police have tightened the crackdown on rumour-mongering of the disease, according to Xinhua.

Police in Shenyang, capital city of Liaoning province, detained one man on Monday [27 Jan 2014] for spreading the rumour on social media that the virus is contained in pickled chicken feet, a popular snack. Authorities in Shanxi's [province] Taiyuan and Qizhou also arrested 3 persons for making up infectious cases in both cities.

A Chinese man has died of H7N9 [avian influenza] and 2 other members of his family were infected with the deadly virus, raising concerns about the prospect of human-to-human transmission of the disease. Chinese health authorities said a family of 3 was infected with H7N9 bird flu in east China's Zhejiang, the province worst-affected by the current spike in cases. A 49-year-old man in Hangzhou city was on [20 Jan 2014] confirmed to have been infected with the virus. His wife and daughter, who accompanied him to the hospital, were later also confirmed infected. The man has died while his daughter is in a serious condition and his wife is stable, local officials said.

Experts have reached no firm conclusion on how the virus spread between the family members. They all may have had contact with poultry, or the father may have transmitted the flu to his wife and daughter, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Even if the case is confirmed as person-to-person transmission, there is no need to panic, said Li Lanjuan, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a specialist in H7N9 prevention. "So far there have not been any cases in which one person transmits the flu to another, and the latter transmits the virus to a 3rd person," said Li. In this year's [2014] epidemic, transmission has been limited to a 2nd person, who does not transmit the virus to a 3rd. H7N9 is not likely to be spread in schools, workplaces, or at gatherings, said Chen Zhiping, deputy head of the provincial disease control and prevention centre. China has already sounded a nation-wide alert like last year [2013], when the virus first struck, leaving 45 dead.

Yesterday [29 Jan 2014], 3 new human H7N9 cases were reported in Zhejiang, bringing the number of infections in the province this year [2014] to 56. All 3 are in a critical condition. In neighbouring Fujian province, a 2-year-old child tested positive for bird flu, according to the provincial health commission. The patient is now recovering. South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also reported one new case yesterday.

[The cluster of 3 cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection involving the father, mother, and daughter of the family, and no others, suggests transmission of the virus between members of the same family. However the available data do not confirm direct transmission of the H7N9 virus from person to person. The observations so far do not exclude the possibility that the 3 family members were directly infected from a common source (infected birds or environment), since all 3 worked, or had contact, with the same poultry in a wet market. Genotyping of patient isolates and local poultry might clarify the origin of the infectious agent(s). Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
