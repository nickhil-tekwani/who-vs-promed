We report the 1st outbreak of carbapenem-resistant NDM-1-producing _Acinetobacter baumannii_ in Europe, in a French intensive-care unit in January to May 2013. The index patient was transferred from Algeria, leading to the infection/colonisation of 5 additional patients. Concurrently, another imported case from Algeria was identified. The 7 isolates were genetically indistinguishable, belonging to ST85. The blaNDM-1 carbapenemase gene was part of the chromosomally located composite transposon Tn125. This report underscores the growing concern about the spread of NDM-1-producing _A. baumannii_ in Europe.

Background
----------
The emergence and spread of New-Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing Gram-negative isolates constitutes a new wave of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria [1]; 1st identified from Enterobacteriaceae, the blaNDM gene has since been identified in non-fermenting bacterial species such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Acinetobacter baumannii_ [2,3]. Considering its ability to be the source of nosocomial outbreaks, carbapenem-resistant _A. baumannii_ (AB) represents a threat for critically ill hospitalised patients [4]. We report here the 1st outbreak of NDM-1-producing AB in Europe, which occurred in a French surgical intensive-care unit in January to May 2013.

Outbreak description
--------------------
The index case (Patient 1) was a female patient in her early 80s suffering from end-stage cirrhosis. She originated from Algeria but lived mostly in France. During a stay in Algeria in December 2012, she was admitted into a private hospital in the city of Tizi Ouzou following renal failure, which required dialysis. After one month in hospital, she was repatriated to France due to liver decompensation. On 18 Jan 2013, she was admitted to a 15-bed surgical intensive-care unit of a tertiary care university hospital in a Paris suburb. In accordance with local and national policy, she was screened on admission for carriage of MDR bacteria. Rectal screening revealed MDR-_A. baumannii_ (MDR-AB) (Isolate 1) that was susceptible only to amikacin, netilmicin and colistin (Table). The same day, she was intubated for respiratory failure. Protected distal bronchial brushing yielded a culture of MDR-AB with the same antibiotic resistance profile. A combination of intravenous tigecycline and amikacin was given. On 24 Jan 2013, she developed multivisceral failure and died 4 days later. During the following days, 3 additional patients with MDR-AB infection and/or colonisation were identified in the same unit. A cirrhotic male patient in his mid-60s (Patient 2) -- who had been hospitalised since 3 Jan 2013 and confirmed free of MDR bacteria on admission -- developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia on 26 Jan 2013. Culture of a distal protected specimen yielded MDR-AB (Isolate 2). This patient was successfully treated by a combination of tigecycline and amikacin and was extubated 2 days later. Patient 3 was a male liver-transplant patient in his mid-60s who was not colonised on admission but developed a dialysis catheter-related bloodstream infection due to a MDR-AB on 28 Jan 2013 (Isolate 3). Imipenem and amikacin combination was prescribed but the patient died of haemorrhagic shock before antibacterial susceptibility results could be obtained. Patient 4 was a dual renal- and liver-transplant female patient in her late 40s from whom an abdominal drain yielded an MDR-AB culture on 2 Feb 2013 (Isolate 4). This patient recovered without receiving any antibiotic therapy and was discharged from the hospital on 11 Feb 2013.

Then 2 weeks after the admission of the index case, a woman in her early 80s (Patient 5) suffered from a cerebrovascular accident and was repatriated from the same Algerian county that Patient 1 was repatriated from (but from a different healthcare facility) to the emergency unit of our hospital. A screening test performed on admission identified MDR-AB (Isolate 5).

Later, 2 months after this 1st cluster of 5 patients with MDR-AB, 2 additional patients free of MDR bacteria on admission to the surgical intensive-care unit described acquired a MDR-AB during their stay in this unit. A woman in her late 50s (Patient 6) was admitted to the surgical intensive-care unit on 6 Apr 2013 and placed in the room where the index case had stayed. This patient was found positive for MDR-AB on 15 Apr 2013 in specimens from a catheter and the respiratory tract (Isolate 6). She was treated with intravenous tigecycline and aerosolised colistin. She underwent successful liver transplantation on 22 Apr 2013 and recovered well. The last patient (Patient 7) was a man in his late 50s admitted to the surgical intensive-care unit on 3 Apr 2013 for a liver transplant and from whom a rectal swab yielded MDR-AB a month later (Isolate 7). The patients' duration of hospital stay, time of infection and/or colonisation and location in the hospital are reported in Figure 1.

Laboratory analysis
-------------------
Identification of the 7 MDR-AB strains at the species level was confirmed by 16S RNA sequencing (data not shown). Their antimicrobial susceptibilities were tested by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination (Etest, bioMerieux, France) (Table) and interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines [5]. All isolates exhibited a high level of resistance to penicillins, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Those isolates remained susceptible only to netilmicin, colistin and amikacin. The production of a class B carbapenemase was suspected by the positive results of the imipenem/imipenem plus EDTA [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] test using MIC double strips (Etest, bioMerieux, France) (Table 1) and confirmed by UV spectrophotometry [6]. Carbapenemase genes were screened by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] as described and the blaNDM-1 gene was amplified in the 7 isolates [7]. Genotypic comparison by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using restriction enzyme SmaI revealed an indistinguishable profile (data not shown). Diversilab (bioMerieux, France) analysis and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) typing confirmed that these isolates were clonally related and belonged to the same sequence type, ST85 (Figure 2) [8]. The genetic environment of blaNDM-1 was investigated as previously described [8] and showed that it was located in the composite transposon Tn125 made of 2 copies of insertion sequence (IS) ISAba125.

Discussion
----------
Carbapenem-resistant _A. baumannii_ are a source of deep concern due to their multidrug resistance pattern and the ability of this bacterial species to persist in the environment [4,9,10]. Intensive-care units are particularly susceptible to outbreaks associated with MDR-AB: it is sometimes difficult for them to adhere strictly to infection control measures when patients require a high and persistent care-load. The same hospital faced a hospital-wide outbreak of MDR-AB colonisations and infections due to the importation of an index case from Tahiti 4 years ago [11]. Despite this experience and the implementation in 2010 at the national and local level of strict measures on hospital admission to detect, screen and place under contact-isolation precautions repatriated patients, another outbreak linked to the admission of a patient previously hospitalised abroad again occurred [12].

Since 2010, NDM-producing MDR-AB has been identified in various parts of the world, in particular in North Africa and the Middle East [8,13-17]. A series of imported cases have been identified recently in Europe, such as in the Czech Republic, Germany, Slovenia, Switzerland and Belgium [8,13,14,17]. In France, the emergence of an NDM-1-producing MDR-AB strain originating from North Africa was recently highlighted [15,17]. We describe here the 1st outbreak associated with the importation of this NDM-1-producing _A. baumannii_ clone ST85 in Europe. This report underlines the need for dedicated measures for patients previously treated in a hospital located in a 'high risk' geographical area. Such measures (e.g., screening for colonisation/infection with MDR organisms and isolation nursing) should be maintained until the screening for colonisation/infection (e.g., using rectal, throat and wound swabs) has shown that these patients are free of MDR organisms. Because of intermittent carriage or lack of sensitivity of the current culture-based screening methods, repeated specimen collection and molecular-based methods of detection may help to control such outbreaks.

Taking in account the relationship between North African countries and many European countries, it is possible that the spread of NDM-1 carbapenemase may occur rapidly, mostly through _A. baumannii_ rather than Enterobacteriaceae, since _A. baumannii_ may become much more difficult to eradicate.

[_Acinetobacter baumannii_ (AB), a Gram-negative coccobacillus, has emerged as a significant multidrug-resistant (MDR) nosocomial pathogen. Infection due to multidrug-resistant acinetobacter strains, especially _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (MDR-AB), in critically ill, hospitalized patients and the frequency of clonal nosocomial outbreaks due to these microorganisms has increased worldwide in the past several decades (see Urban C, et al: Considerations in control and treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_. Clin Infect Dis. 2003; 36(10): 1268-74. Available at: http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/374847). MDR-AB have also been reported recently to cause infections after natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes) (see Joly-Guillou ML. Clinical impact and pathogenicity of Acinetobacter. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2005 Nov;11(11):868-73. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216100), and in soldiers severely injured in the war in Iraq.

During nosocomial outbreaks, MDR-AB have been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment and can survive on environmental surfaces for long periods of time, including curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. MDR-AB has been reported to spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from patients who are either infected or colonized with MDR-AB. In addition, airborne spread of MDR-AB has recently been described in a burn unit (Gao J, Zhao X, Bao Y, et al. Antibiotic resistance and OXA-type carbapenemases-encoding genes in airborne Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from burn wards. Burns. 2013 Jul 22. pii: S0305-4179(13)00185-X. doi: 10.1016/j.burns.2013.06.003. [Epub ahead of print] Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886986?dopt=Abstract).

Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems. Carbapenem-resistant isolates are increasingly isolated, as carbapenems have been used widely in clinical practice. Mechanisms of carbapenem resistance include: production of carbapenemases (enzymes that destroy the carbapenems), loss of outer membrane porins, alteration of target, and efflux pumps (see Dijkshoorn L, et al: An increasing threat in hospitals: multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2007; 5(12): 939-51. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18007677).

There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases); NDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases). KPCs are the most common carbapenemases in the US, but have also been reported worldwide.

In 2008, a novel carbapenemase, the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-1 was 1st detected in a _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolated in Sweden from an Indian patient hospitalized previously in New Delhi, India. Variants of the NDM-1 carbapenemase, such as NDM-2, NDM-4, and NDM-5, have subsequently been described. NDM gene is carried by a highly transmissible plasmid that is thought to account for its rapid, widespread dissemination to other Enterobacteriaceae and to other unrelated bacterial species such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and AB.

Attempts to reduce the frequency of nosocomial infections due to MDR-AB have involved surveillance, restriction of antibiotic use and enhanced infection control interventions (see Urban C, et al (2003): reference above). - Mod.ML
