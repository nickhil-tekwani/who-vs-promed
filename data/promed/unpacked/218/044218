Virginia has its 3rd confirmed case of eastern equine encephalitis in 2015.

The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services says the 19-week-old Racking filly from Chesapeake had not been vaccinated. The horse was euthanized 24 Sep 2015 due to the severity of the illness.

The other cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) so far in 2015 also involved horses from Chesapeake.

The disease has a mortality rate of 80 percent. Eastern equine encephalitis typically is transmitted by mosquitoes. The state veterinarian encourages horse owners to work with their veterinarians to arrange a vaccination schedule.

Virginia had 1 reported case of encephalitis in a horse in 2014.

[I would emphasize the importance of horses being vaccinated. Veterinarians should also emphasize the availability for an EEE vaccine for horses. It is very effective and is frequently combined with West Nile virus.

The immunity to EEE wanes after approximately 4 months, so the vaccine should be repeated at 4-6 month intervals. - Mod.TG
