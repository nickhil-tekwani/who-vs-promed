Smut disease destroys sorghum in Nakapiripirit
----------------------------------------------
Farmers in Nakapiripirit District [Northern Region] are facing a
challenge of fighting sorghum smuts which are affecting farming in
most parts of the district. The disease is caused by parasitic fungi
and forms black powdery masses of spores.

One of the affected farmers said smuts affected their harvest last
year [2010]. The district agricultural officer confirmed the presence
of the smut disease and blamed it on poor crop rotation. He said
farmers have often ignored advice to practice crop rotation. He said
his office will devise possible ways to ensure that the disease's
spread is arrested.

Welthungerhilfe, an agricultural NGO in the district, advised farmers
to stick to only planting treated sorghum seeds or not to plant
sorghum in the same garden every year.

[Smuts are a group of fungi causing symptoms of spore-filled galls
(sometimes resembling distorted leaf-like structures) on leaves or
seed heads of a number of cereal hosts. They are spread by wind, rain,
and with infected plant material.

A number of smut diseases occur on sorghum (_Sorghum bicolor_),
reducing both the grain yield and forage value, which are caused by
different fungi: covered kernel smut (caused by _Sporisorium sorghi_),
loose kernel smut (caused by _Sporisorium cruentum_), head smut
(caused by _Sphacelotheca reiliana_), and long smut (caused by
_Tolyposporium ehrenbergii_ and some other _Tolyposporium_ species).

The kernel smuts may be controlled by fungicide seed treatments; head
smut and long smut may be controlled by growing resistant varieties.
All 4 smuts are present in Africa, but their patterns of incidence,
severity, and distribution vary in different regions. The smuts are
economically important and continue to be a major biotic constraint in
the effort to sustain high sorghum production levels. One or several
of these fungi may be responsible for the problems reported above from
Uganda.
