_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ detected on ornamental _Solanaceae_ in Italy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Italy, a limited survey on the occurrence of _Potato spindle tuber
viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_, PSTVd -- EPPO A2 List) in ornamental
_Solanaceae_ was conducted at the beginning of 2007. A total of 23
symptomless _Solanum jasminoides_ plants were collected at random
from 4 nurseries in Central and Southern Italy. Molecular tests were
performed (RT-PCR [reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction],
dot-blot [molecular] hybridization, [nucleotide] sequencing) and
revealed the presence of PSTVd in 17 samples of _S. jasminoides_. The
study was extended to 2 plants of _S. rantonnetii_ growing in one of
the nurseries surveyed and one plant tested positive. This was the
1st record of a natural infection of PSTVd in _S. rantonnetii_.

As these preliminary studies stressed the need for simple, fast, and
economic diagnostic methods, a tissue-printing hybridization method
was developed. To validate it, 94 samples of _S. jasminoides_ and 106
samples of _S. rantonnetii_ were collected from 3 glasshouses in
Apulia. The incidence of PSTVd was 100 percent in _S. jasminoides_
and 26.4 percent in _S. rantonnetii_ (all plants were symptomless).
Identical results were obtained when the same samples were tested by
dot-blot hybridization and RT-PCR. The identity of the pathogen was
also confirmed by sequencing PCR-products obtained from 5 samples.
Although, further studies have to be done, in particular on the
specificity of the method, tissue-printing hybridization could be a
useful tool for the routine detection of PSTVd in ornamental _Solanaceae_.

Although limited to a small number of plants and localities, these
preliminary studies have revealed a very high percentage of infected
plants, which underlines the need for large-scale surveys in Italy
and other European countries on the occurrence of PSTVd in ornamental
plants, and the need to produce propagation material free of PSTVd.

Incursion of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ on ornamental _Solanaceae_
in Austria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Austrian Plant Protection Service recently informed the EPPO
Secretariat of the 1st detection of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_
(_Pospiviroid_, PSTVd -- EPPO A2 List) in Austria. During an official
monitoring survey, PSTVd was detected in Tyrol on _Solanum
jasminoides_ and _Brugmansia_ spp. (_Solanaceae_), at 2 companies
producing plants for final consumers. Eradication measures were
imposed (all plants of these species were destroyed and the premises
disinfected). Sales of _Brugmansia_ spp., _Solanum jasminoides_ and
_Solanum rantonnetii_ by the 2 enterprises concerned were suspended.
No other occurrence of PSTVd was found. Investigations showed that
the infested plants originated from Italy. The Italian Plant
Protection Service was informed.

New host plant records for pospiviroids
---------------------------------------
Following the recent findings of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_
(_Pospiviroid_, PSTVd -- EPPO A2 List) in ornamental _Solanaceae_ in
Europe (such as, _Solanum jasminoides_ and _Brugmansia_), surveys
have been initiated in the Netherlands in 2006 to better understand
the host status of ornamental plants. Many plant samples have been
collected and tested (RT-PCR, sequencing). Although none of the
ornamental host plants showed any symptoms, several samples tested
positive for the presence of pospiviroids. In all cases, eradication
measures have been applied (destruction of infested lots). The
following viroids were identified:
- _Citrus exocortis viroid_ (CEVd) in _Verbena_ sp. (_Verbenaceae_).
It is noted that CEVd had also been recently reported on _Verbena_ in
India and the USA.
- _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd -- EPPO A2 List) in
_Brugmansia suaveolens_, _Streptosolen jamesonii_, and _Solanum
jasminoides_ (all _Solanaceae_).
- _Tomato apical stunt viroid_ (TASVd -- EPPO Alert List) in
_Cestrum_ sp. (_Solanaceae_).

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus
_Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen affecting a number of
solanaceous plants including several crop species. It causes the
diseases 'spindle tuber' in potato and 'bunchy top' in tomato. Yield
losses can be up to 65 percent in potato and up to 50 percent in
tomato. In potato, shoots are spindly and may show distortions and
proliferations, plants are stunted, and tubers are small, elongated,
cylindrical, spindle or dumb-bell-shaped, with prominent eyes evenly
distributed over the tuber. Sprouting is slower than in healthy
tubers. Symptoms in tomatoes include stunting, leaf chlorosis and
distortion, and shortening of internodes. All varieties of tomato and
potato appear to be susceptible, with no natural resistance to PSTVd
available in either host. However, mild pathogen strains may cause
latent infections in some host cultivars.

PSTVd is seed transmitted in potato at a rate of up to 100 percent,
depending on the cultivar, and in tomato at a rate of around 10
percent. Spread occurs also via infected plants or plant parts
(including seed tubers or propagative cuttings), pollen, mechanical
means, or plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato
leafroll virus_ PSTVd can also be transmitted by an aphid vector
(_Myzus persicae_). PSTVd (like viroids in general) is exceptionally
stable due to its molecular structure and can survive in sap or leaf
litter for considerable times.

PSTVd has been found in many countries around the world, including
parts of North and South America, Asia, and Oceania. The pathogen is
not endemic to Western Europe, but in recent years outbreaks have
been reported in France, UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. In
addition, the disease is established in Eastern Europe, including for
example Poland and Russia. EPPO has therefore listed PSTVd as a
quarantine pathogen.

_Citrus exocortis viroid_ (CEVd; genus _Pospiviroid_) causes
bark-shelling, stunting, tree decline, and reduced yields in citrus
hosts. Different strains can affect other crops including grapevine,
tomato, and some vegetable species. The viroids are transmitted by
grafting and mechanical means and, at least in citrus, may show
synergistic effects in co-infections with other viroids. Disease
management relies mainly on using viroid-free rootstock and grafting
material in citrus and grapevine cultivation.

_Tomato apical stunt viroid_ (TASVd; genus _Pospiviroid_) has been
included on the EPPO alert list. Until now, very few data were
available on its host range other than tomato. Symptoms in tomato are
stunting, leaf distortion, reduced fruit size, and discolouration. Up
to 100 percent incidence with heavy yield losses has been reported.
The viroid is transmitted by plant material, mechanical means, seed,
and bumblebees.

The presence of these viroids in a number of symptomless reservoir
hosts reported above may pose a threat to crops in the region. It
highlights the importance of systematic surveys and quarantine
measures for these pathogens, even if there are no obvious problems
with crops in the respective areas.
