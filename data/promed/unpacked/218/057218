Rabies incidence in the Donetsk oblast
--------------------------------------
The number of rabies foci in the Donetsk oblast has increased 2-fold
this year [2010]. There were only 24 identified animal rabies foci in
the oblast last year [2009], whereas this year their number has
increased to 67. Additionally epidemiologists are concerned because
about 83 percent of cases involved pets or farm animals.

This year there was also a human fatality from rabies after an
interval of 2 years. A stray dog attacked a man in his yard and bit
him. The man did not seek medical help and 10 weeks later he
developed hydrophobia and died on the 5th day of the illness.
