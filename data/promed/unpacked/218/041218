As many as 29 cows died after eating green fodder containing castor plant residues at Dod village in Tharad taluka [sub district] of Banaskantha [district of Gujarat ] late on Sunday night [14 May 2017]. Over 200 cows were affected at the cattle shed run by a private trust some 15 km [9.3 mi] from Tharad town. Of the cows that suffered food poisoning 18 died on the spot while 11 others succumbed during treatment at the animal hospital, said district animal husbandry officer SB Upadhyay on [Mon 15 May 2017].

The poisonous effect of the castor leaves mixed in the fodder came to light when the animals began falling one by one on ground in the cattle shed, he added. "As we received information, 3 teams of veterinarians from Tharad, a team from Jalaram Gaushala Bhabhar and a team from Banas Dairy were rushed to the village to start treatment early," said Upadhyay.

According to Upadhyay, it being a crop harvesting season, some leaves and stems of the castor plants were found lying outside the field and may have got mixed with fodder causing [the animals'] death. "Primary investigation suggest that the cows ate castor plant which caused food poisoning as we found castor leaves near the field where the fodder is kept," he added. RG Chaudhary, police sub-inspector at Tharad said that so far, no police complaint has been lodged by the cow shed authorities.

Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5-10 percent ricin. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's or animal's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need, hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

While castor bean is a toxic plant, it typically does not cause cattle to drop dead in the manner this article describes. The unknown issue is how many castor beans were in this mixture and was this some sort of chopped up forage to where the beans could have been cracked or broken? After reviewing several book chapters, reports on experimental attempts at intoxication in cattle, I am convinced castor bean plant, without the bean or with minimal beans is not the cause of these animals' demise. However, what was sprayed on these plants? Herbicides often make a toxic plant more toxic or a non toxic plant toxic.

Some of the articles contain the following information:
- Heifers given a mixture of castor bean leaves, stems and partially ripened beans at a rate of 10 gm/kg caused a transient diarrhea which ended the next day. 10 grams per kilogram of body weight is pretty high and it did not produce death.
- Another article that states 5 percent non-detoxified meal is acceptable, but 10 percent non-detoxified meal affects growth and production.
- Regarding the goats, one book stated a lethal dose for castor beans in goats is 5.5 gm/kg.
- A research article states that 15 percent castor bean in a goat ration is acceptable. So it seems goats can tolerate quite a lot of castor bean.

There were numerous other articles with essentially the same conclusions. So we are back to the question of what else was in the ration or what were these plants treated with? Or perhaps this is a case of the plant in question being not truly _Ricinus communis_ but another plant having the local name of castor bean plant. For example _Jatropha gossypifoila_ L. (Euphorbiaceae), popularly known worldwide as "bellyache bush" or "black physicnut." The castor bean is closely related to this plant.

Hopefully a necropsy was performed to learn if castor bean really was the cause or if there was some other agent producing the death of these animals. - Mod.TG
