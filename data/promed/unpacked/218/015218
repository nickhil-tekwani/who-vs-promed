On 5 Jan 2007, 2 soldiers from a military base in Warsaw, Poland, presented
with symptoms indicating fulminant sepsis. The most striking sign was a
quickly spreading petechial rash, covering the whole body within just a few
hours. The soldiers were admitted to intensive care units in 2 different
hospitals. _Neisseria meningitidis_ was isolated from blood and
cerebrospinal fluid in the case of one patient and from blood only in the
case of the other, and sent to the National Reference Centre for Bacterial
Meningitis (NRCBM) for further characterization.
Both patients died of severe meningococcal septicemia, 13 and 16 days after
admission, respectively. A further 46 people from the same military base
were admitted to hospital for observation with symptoms such as fever,
headache, and/or malaise. All of them received antibiotic treatment. Two
days after admission, blood samples were taken for bacteriological analysis
and forwarded to the NRCBM for additional diagnostics.
Altogether, 15 cases (including the 2 soldiers who died of septicemia) were
laboratory-confirmed for invasive meningococcal disease.
Laboratory investigations
In the NRCBM, the isolates responsible for the 2 cases of severe septicemia
were identified as _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C indistinguishable in all
molecular methods applied. Both were of sequence type ST-11, belonging to
hypervirulent and hyperepidemic clonal complex ST-11/ET-37 (1). The
sequence type of the isolates was determined by multilocus sequence typing
(MLST). Known hypervirulent and hyperepidemic clones of meningococci
isolated in Poland were included in the study for comparison.
Blood samples collected from the 46 other patients from the military base
were examined by serological and molecular methods. Serum samples were
examined for the presence of group C, W135 meningococcal antigen by latex
commercial test and for the presence of meningococcal DNA by PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) (2). Blood or serum samples from 11 patients
were positive both in the PCR and latex test, a sample from one patient was
positive only in the PCR, and another one in latex test only. In addition,
3 blood samples could be typed directly by culture-independent MLST. In
these 3 samples, the meningococcal DNA specific for ST-11-ET-37 clone was
found.
Control measures
Apart from the 46 patients who were admitted to hospital and received
antibiotic treatment, special precautions were put in place within the
entire military unit.
Chemoprophylaxis with a single dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) was given to
close contacts of affected soldiers (the whole subunit). The entire
personnel of the military base, including the patients admitted to
hospital, were vaccinated with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine, groups
A, C. At present there is a shortage of conjugated vaccine against group C
meningococci in Poland, so the polysaccharide vaccine was the only option
available.
Discussion
This outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease is the largest so far
described in Poland, with an attack rate of 3.78 per cent (15
laboratory-confirmed cases per 397 people in the military base, including
civilian personnel).
The case fatality rate in this outbreak was 13.3 per cent (2 deaths per 15
laboratory-confirmed cases). As a result of the rapid implementation of
antibacterial treatment, the remaining 13 patients with
laboratory-confirmed meningococcemia did not develop severe sepsis. All of
them recovered fully and were discharged from the hospital.
The outbreak described here is the 2nd one among military recruits within a
year. The 1st took place in Skwierzyna, in March 2006, and was caused by
the same meningococcal strain of serogroup C, ST-11/ET-37 (3). In addition,
there were 2 sporadic cases of invasive meningococcal disease in military
bases in Wroclaw (Nov 2006) and Gliwice (Dec 2006). The former was
meningococcal meningitis with a good outcome, and the strain responsible
for the disease was not related to any of the hypervirulent clones present
in Poland. The latter was a meningococcal septicemia with fatal outcome,
caused by group C, ST-11/ET-37 meningococcus.
In view of the emerging epidemiological situation of invasive meningococcal
disease (IMD) in the Polish army, the introduction of mass vaccination of
military recruits against _N. meningitidis_ group C with the use of
conjugated vaccine is now being considered.
Present epidemiological situation in Poland
Since 2002, an increase in the number of IMD cases caused by serogroup C
meningococci has been observed in Poland. Before 2002, group C was
responsible for 11 per cent of laboratory-confirmed cases. In 2002, more
than 30 per cent of cases confirmed in the NRCBM were caused by this group
(4). This rising trend has continued and in 2006, IMD cases caused by group
C reached 46 per cent of all laboratory-confirmed cases (Table -- see
original URL - Mod. LL]).
The changes in the epidemiological situation of meningococcal infections in
Poland described here have resulted in a more comprehensive epidemiological
surveillance in the country. Since information about meningococcal
septicemia in military bases received much attention in the media, the
sanitary-epidemiological stations have received more notifications of
suspected cases of IMD from throughout the country, and the NRCBM has
obtained more material for PCR diagnostics.
Although according to the official data the IMD incidence in Poland (0.54
per 100 000 in 2004) is about half that of the EU average (1.13 per 100 000
in the years 2003-2004) (6), the current situation indicates that this
problem deserves more attention, and there is need for better surveillance
and diagnostics of IMD.

Health workers have launched a mass meningitis vaccination campaign in
southern Sudan, where 174 people have died from the disease [meningitis] in
2007, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said.
"All the payams (districts) that have crossed the epidemic threshold are
either being vaccinated today [1 Mar 2007], or we will be starting there
next week," said William Pera, a WHO coordinator for epidemic readiness and
intervention. The government of southern Sudan and WHO have reported a
total of 2243 cases of suspected meningitis there since the beginning of
2007, he said.
An international coordination group backed by WHO has so far delivered 300
000 of a promised 850 000 doses of vaccine in southern Sudan, said WHO
official, Abdullahi Ahmed.
Sudan, which accounts for more than half of the meningitis cases worldwide
each year, has little or no infrastructure and is particularly at risk for
outbreaks of disease.

Since December 2006, a meningitis outbreak has been ravaging Uganda's north
western districts of the West Nile Region. On 19 Feb 2007, the Uganda Red
Cross Society (URCS) reported a total of 2728 cases, with 100 deaths in
Arua/Maracha-Terego, Adjumani, Yumbe, Koboko, Nebbi, and Moyo districts.
147 cases were also reported in the northeastern districts of Kotido,
Moroto, and Nakapiripirit in the Karamoja area.
The 2 strains of meningitis detected include serogroup A and serogroup X.
While serogroup A can be controlled through immunization (and is
predominant in the West Nile), the Karamoja area is dominated by serogroup
X that cannot be controlled through immunization. There are also
unconfirmed reports of similar outbreaks in the neighboring Southern Sudan
and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to WHO. Reports
from WHO indicate that Uganda falls within the traditional African
'Meningitis Belt', which includes the 21 most vulnerable African countries.
The Red Cross Action Teams (RCATs) in Adjuman and Arua branches are
carrying out intensive awareness campaigns and social mobilization using
the African Red Cross Health Initiative (ARCHI) 2010 toolkit for community
volunteers. The teams continue to disseminate the Ministry of Health's
(MoH) case management guidelines to the community. The URCS branches are
also monitoring the situation and volunteers have been mobilized for the
immunization campaigns.
Vaccination has started in Arua district, spearheaded by MSF (Medecins Sans
Frontieres) France. So far, a total of 14 sub-counties have been covered.
However, having realized that the pace is too slow to contain the epidemic,
a change in strategy has been agreed upon by all partners. At the time of
reporting, a team including WHO, URCS, MSF, and UNICEF (United Nations
Children's Fund) was planning to travel to the affected districts in West
Nile Region in the week starting 26 Feb 2007 for micro-planning.
Mass vaccination campaigns in the 5 districts started on 24 Feb 2007,
planned to last for one week.

[The following information is from Dr Pierre Nicolas' comments in
ProMED-mail posting Meningococcal disease update 2007 (04) 20070129.0379:
"Serogroup X meningococcus is well known and has been isolated since 1970
in Africa. It was responsible for sporadic cases and small epidemics in the
90s (83 cases in Niger in 1997). In 2006 in Niger, 4185 meningitis cases
were reported between Jan and Jun 2006. _N. meningitidis_ group X
represented 51 per cent of 1139 laboratory-confirmed meningococcal
meningitis, but in southwestern Niger, it represented 90 per cent. Among
the 18 serogroup X isolates characterized in Marseille, 16 had the same
phenotype (X:NT:P1.5, nontypeable and subtype P1.5) and 2 were NT:NST
(non-typeable, non-subtypeable), 16 belonged to the same sequence-type
(ST)-181 as the serogroup X isolates circulating in Niamey in the 1990s and
2 to the ST-5789 (one locus difference from ST-181)."
As a reminder, the serogroups (capsular types) of meningococci can be
further characterized by serotypes and subtypes based on class 2/3 and
class 1 outer membrane proteins (OMPs). These OMPs are porin proteins,
water-filled channels that play important roles as molecular sieves in the
outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria.
