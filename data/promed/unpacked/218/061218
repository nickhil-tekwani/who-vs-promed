New Jersey-based meat processor, Topps Meat Company LLC, is
voluntarily recalling 331 582 pounds (150 metric tons) of frozen
ground beef products that may be contaminated with the potentially
deadly _E. coli_ [O157:H7] bacterium, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) said on Tue 25 Sep 2007. A product sample tested
positive for _E. coli_ during an investigation into a cluster of
illnesses in the northeast region of the USA, the USDA said in a statement.
The ground beef products recalled were shipped to food service
institutions in the New York city area and to retailers across the
USA, the USDA said. The labels on the products subject to recall
bear the establishment number "Est. 9748" inside the USDA mark of
inspection. All of the products involved have 2008 sell-by dates of
22 Jun, 12 Jul or 23 Jul 2008.

More ground beef may be tainted with _E. coli_ bacteria. New York
agriculture officials have issued an alert, warning consumers not to
eat certain Topps Brand ground beef. The NY Department of Agriculture
and Markets says the suspect ground beef has already been made into
hamburger patties in 2 sizes. One package contains 20
quarter-pounders and has a sell-by date of 22 Jun 2008. The other
package contains 12 quarter-pounders with a sell-by date of 23 Jul
2008. The product is identified as Topps 100 percent Ground Beef Hamburgers.
The agency says consumers who have purchased the recalled beef should
return it to the place of purchase for a refund. There has been no
report of how the beef became contaminated. The problem was
reportedly discovered after a number of people in Albany and
Rensselaer counties in New York got sick. At least 3 people have been
hospitalized because of the bad beef, according to officials.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also investigating, since
the strain of _E. coli_ matches the one causing outbreaks in other
states. The FDA is trying to identify the source.

A cluster of _E. coli_ cases has prompted a nationwide recall of
frozen beef patties distributed by New Jersey-based Topps Meat Co. At
least 6 people in New York State became ill and 3 were hospitalized.
The state Health Department said all 6 are recovering, the Associated
Press reported.
The recall includes: certain 10 lb. boxes of Butcher's Best 100
percent All Beef Patties; certain 10 lb. boxes of Kohler Foods
burgers; certain 10 lb. boxes of Sand Castle Fine Meat; certain 2 lb.
boxes of Topps 100 percent Pure Ground Beef Hamburgers; and certain 3
lb. boxes of Topps 100 percent Pure Ground Beef Hamburgers.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding whether other cases of _E.
coli_ O157:H7 disease in areas outside of New York State can be
linked to the NY cluster, as the frozen beef was distributed to
"retailers across the USA." It cannot be overemphasized that
appropriate kitchen hygiene to avoid contamination of foods with
uncooked ground beef, and adequate cooking of the ground beef will
help to avoid _E. coli_ O157 disease even if the starting product is
contaminated with the organism. Many of the reports of the recall
mention only Topps Brand products. - Mod.LL]
