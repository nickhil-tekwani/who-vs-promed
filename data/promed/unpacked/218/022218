For the 2nd time since the city started tracking the disease in 1993, a Denver resident has been diagnosed with the [a] hantavirus [infection].

The Denver Department of Public Health and Environment publicly announced the diagnosis on [Tue 6 Mar 2018]. Health officials characterize hantavirus [infection] as a rare but serious respiratory disease carried by infected deer mice.

No evidence of rodents was found when the health department inspected the victim's apartment building, and there's also no concern the mouse that carries the hantavirus is nesting in the Denver area.

The hantavirus is not found in common house mice, but it is found in deer mice, which are usually found in rural or suburban areas. These are recognizable by their white ears and undersides.

Humans become infected with the hantavirus when they breathe in the virus while stirring up dust from mouse nests or mouse droppings. This infection usually occurs during the spring or summer, and symptoms appear a couple weeks later. Those potentially fatal symptoms include fever, chills, headaches and severe pain in the legs and back.

It's not quite clear how the person infected with hantavirus got it in the first place, but health officials believe it happened in the city of Denver. That person is "fine and recovering," according to the health department.

According to documents from the health department's investigation, city officials searched the infected person's apartment building for mouse droppings and urine, but to no avail. The property owner did have to place a notice inside the building telling residents that another tenant had been infected. Where this building is was redacted in the documents obtained by 9NEWS.

Here are some tips for avoiding the hantavirus from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment:

- Keep mice and other rodents away from the living areas of your home.
- Spray dust, dirt and rodent droppings, and dead rodents with a mixture of bleach and water (1 and a half cups of household bleach to one gallon of water) or other disinfectant. Allow the mixture to sit wet for at least 10 minutes before cleaning.
- Wear rubber, latex or vinyl gloves and a dust mask when cleaning rodent affected areas. Wash hands with soap and warm water after cleaning areas affected by rodents.
- Never vacuum or sweep areas where there is evidence of rodent infestation. Clean up debris while it is wet.
- Remove wood, junk and brush piles near your home. Keep vegetation around the house well-trimmed.
- Store human food, pet food and bird seed in covered containers.
- Keep garbage in tightly covered cans.
- Repair window screens and ensure weather-stripping is tight under all doors.

[It seems odd that there was no evidence of deer mouse presence in the patient's building when it was inspected. I wonder if they also inspected the patient's automobile for mouse presence. There was an unusual situation in Washington state in 2017 when deer mice nested in an person's automobile air ventilation system that was a was a suspected source resulting in a Sin Nombre virus infection (see Hantavirus - Americas (21): USA (WA) automobile air system susp 20170315.4901561). One also wonders if the patient had traveled outside of the city of Denver in the past 2-3 weeks. The basis on which a hantavirus infection diagnosis was made is not given in the above report. The hantavirus involved in this current Colorado case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the Sin Nombre virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the above URL.

The Denver DPH bulletin on this case can be accessed at http://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/environmental-health/about-us/news-room/2018/Hantavirus.html.
