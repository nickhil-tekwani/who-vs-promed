The cattle disease besnoitiosis confirmed in Switzerland
--------------------------------------------------------
Besnoitiosis has been confirmed in 4 bovines in Switzerland. The infection was detected in 4 bovines from one holding by the university of Zurich, in the framework of a study for early detection of animal diseases.

Between spring and summer 2012, about 400 head of imported cattle were tested.

The positive animals were imported from countries with a known occurrence of besnoitiosis.

[As reported by EFSA in a scientific review published in Feb 2010, _Besnoitia besnoiti_, known to circulate in southern Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America (and not in cattle in North America), was -- "according to recent epidemiological data", confirmed as expanding its geographic spread in cattle herds in "some EU member states". EFSA further concluded -- "therefore bovine besnoitiosis [BB] should be considered an emerging disease in the EU". The paper, available at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/1499.pdf, was reviewed in posting 20100215.0530.

In June 2011, the Federal Swiss Veterinary Office (FVO) published a tri-lingual review on BB, reporting its presence in the West European EU members France, Portugal, and Spain, prescribing guidelines for Swiss border examinations of imported animals (for the German version, see http://tinyurl.com/dxkmap4; French at http://tinyurl.com/ckaxfra).

BB is caused by toxoplasma-like organisms which multiply in endothelial, histiocytic, and other cells, causing changes in the skin, subcutis, blood vessels, mucous membranes, and other tissues in cattle.

Infected cattle often show no clinical signs other than a few cysts in the scleral conjunctiva. Illness begins with fever followed by warm, painful swellings ventrally (anasarca). Swollen lymph nodes, diarrhea, inappetence, photophobia, rhinitis, and orchitis also are seen. Anasarca gives way to sclerodermatitis. The skin becomes hard, thick, and wrinkled and develops cracks that allow secondary bacterial infection and myiasis to develop; movement is painful. There is loss of hair and epidermis. In addition to the skin lesions, there may be focal, disseminated myositis, keratitis, periostitis, endostitis, lymphadenitis, pneumonia, periorchitis, orchitis, epididymitis, arteritis, and perineuritis. Severely affected animals become emaciated.

Diagnosis can also be made by finding crescent-shaped bradyzoites in skin scrapings, biopsy, or conjunctival scrapings.

Although mortality is low, convalescence is slow in severe cases. Severely affected bulls can become permanently sterile. Affected animals remain carriers for life.

Live-attenuated vaccines have been developed; they are produced and are applied on a limited scale in selected animal groups such as imported bulls and breeding cattle in South Africa and Israel. - Mod.AS
