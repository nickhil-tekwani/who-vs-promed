2005 West Nile Virus Activity in the United States (Reported to CDC
as of 29 Nov 2005)*
-----------------------------------------------
*Currently, West Nile virus (WNV) maps are updated weekly to reflect
surveillance reports released by state and local health departments
to CDC's ArboNET system for public distribution.
As of 29 Nov 2005 avian, animal, or mosquito WNV infections have been
reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of
Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia,
Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
Human cases have been reported in: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
Maps detailing county-level human, mosquito, veterinary, avian and
sentinel data are published each week on the collaborative USGS/CDC
West Nile virus web site: <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov/>.

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN

** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional
whether or not state health departments report these cases to CDC
[further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and
West Nile fever are available at the URL above].
"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC - These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan 2005 through
29 Nov 2005 that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local
health departments. ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance
system established by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile
virus and other mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2005
virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 2744 cases, 1146 (42 percent) were reported as West Nile
meningitis or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 1425 (52 percent)
were reported as West Nile fever (milder disease), and 173 (6
percent) were clinically unspecified at this time. Please refer to
state health department web sites for further details regarding state
case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among
reported cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance
reporting bias. Serious cases are more likely to be reported than
mild cases. Also, the surveillance system is not designed to detect
asymptomatic infections. Data from population-based surveys indicate
that, among all people who become infected with West Nile virus
(including people with asymptomatic infections), less than one
percent will develop severe neuroinvasive disease. See: Mostashari F,
Bunning ML, Kitsutani PT, et al. Epidemic West Nile Encephalitis, New
York, 1999: Results of a household-based seroepidemiological survey.

Human:
To date (week 45), 225 WNV clinical cases and 14 asymptomatic
infections have been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada
(PHAC). Of these 225 clinical cases, 50 (22 percent) were reported as
West Nile Neurological Syndrome, 167 (74 percent) were reported as
West Nile Non-Neurological Syndrome, and 8 (4 percent) were
Unclassified/Unspecified. To date, there have been 12 deaths
[Saskatchewan (2), Manitoba (1), Ontario (8) and Quebec (1)] reported
in patients with WNV infection.
Bird:
To date (week 45), a total of 3988 dead birds have been tested since
2 May 2005, of which 447 (11 percent) were positive for WNV. Of the
447 positive birds, 331 (74 percent) were identified as American
Crows and 115 (26 percent) were Blue Jays.
Domestic Animal:
To date (week 45), 21 horses positive for WNV were reported in
Ontario (5), Manitoba (4), Saskatchewan (10) and Alberta (2).
Mosquito:
To date (week 45), 695 mosquito pools positive for WNV were reported
in Alberta (1), Saskatchewan (110), Manitoba (193), Ontario (291) and
Quebec (100).
National West Nile virus surveillance data and maps can be found on

For Canada, this summary is the last weekly report of the 2005 WNV
season. A final report will be produced with complete data supplied
by the provinces and territories in the next few months. No new cases
of West Nile virus have been reported in birds, mosquitoes, or
horses, between wk-43 and wk-45. - Mod.RY]
