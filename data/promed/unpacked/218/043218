New research in Pediatric Dermatology reports several cases of shingles that developed at the original vaccination site in healthy children after they were immunized against chicken pox. Most of these cases were initially misdiagnosed as other skin rashes. While some of these patients underwent tests to help make the diagnosis, all of the children recovered without complications.

Infection with the varicella-zoster virus leads to chickenpox, or primary varicella. The virus then lies dormant and can later reactivate as shingles, or herpes zoster. The varicella-zoster vaccine is made of an attenuated live virus that prevents most people from getting chicken pox but rarely can reactivate and cause shingles.

The cases highlight the importance of recognizing shingles in vaccinated children.

"Shingles in healthy immunized children is rare, but when it occurs it may correlate to the original vaccination site," said senior author Dr. Jennifer Huang, of Boston Children's Hospital. "Recognizing vaccine-associated shingles may prevent unnecessary procedures or testing."

Abstract
--------
In this case series, we report 7 immunized healthy children without underlying immunodeficiency who presented with herpes zoster that correlated with varicella-zoster vaccination site. The morphology of the lesions included erythematous papules, pseudovesicles, and plaques, with associated pain in 2 and pruritus in 3 patients; systemic symptoms ranged from none to low-grade fevers, upper respiratory symptoms, and joint pain. These cases highlight the clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications of herpes zoster in vaccinated children.

[The investigators speculated that the high concentration of virus at the vaccination site may predispose the site to zoster reactivation. They also found that herpes zoster following vaccination occurred at a younger age (median age 2 vs 4 years) and shorter time from inoculation to rash onset than wild-type herpes zoster. Furthermore, the clinical presentation of herpes zoster in children is distinct, and vaccination may further modify disease presentation. The investigators noted small pink to erythematous papules or pseudovesicles, rather than true vesicles, with varying degrees of overlying hemorrhagic crust and peripheral erythema. Fever and pain are rarely prominent features, and postherpetic neuralgia is exceedingly rare in childhood cases.

See publication cited above for references and photographs of rash in these cases.

The Varicella-zoster virus also causes shingles. Chickenpox can be spread from people with shingles to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. This can happen if a person touches or breathes in virus from shingles blisters. In these cases, a person might develop chickenpox, not shingles. Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another.

[2] India (Kerala): alert

The District Health Administration has issued an alert against chicken pox [varicella], with cases being reported regularly from many parts of the district. While no major outbreaks have been reported, the College of Engineering, Trivandrum (CET) was closed for 2 weeks on [Mon 19 Feb 2018], after 19 cases of chicken pox were reported amongst students, mostly hostel mates.

About 13 students had been diagnosed clinically, while the rest had reported with fever and rashes, the beginning stage of the infection. The 1st case had been reported on [29 Jan 2018] and the next case on [14 Feb 2018]. Chicken pox being a highly contagious, air-borne disease, it was natural for the infection to spread in hostels, which are often congested and where students are in close contact with each other.

Patients are contagious up to 5 days before and 5 days after the first rash appears. The incubation period (the time from infection to symptoms) is about 14 to 21 days after contact with the virus. Hence it is likely that there will be more cases, the District Medical Officer, P. Preetha, said.

It was just 2 weeks ago that the Sree Chitra Tirunal College of Engineering at Pappanamcode had been closed for a fortnight following a cluster of chicken pox cases. About 25-30 cases had been reported.

Dr. Preetha said that as summer intensifies it was usual for a number of cases to be reported every year.

In unimmunised populations, most people contract chickenpox by age 15, but all ages can contract it. Unlike before, most of the youngsters today have not been exposed to the virus as children. Chicken pox infection thus shows up more severely in adults and hence preventive vaccination is advised.

Healthy persons who have not been vaccinated or not had the disease before, but who come into contact with an infected person, can lessen the severity of the infection if they get vaccinated within the first 3 to 5 days after the exposure.

[Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. The virus spreads mainly by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters, and possibly through tiny droplets from infected people that get into the air after they breathe or talk.

A total of 2 doses of the vaccine are about 90 percent effective at preventing chickenpox. When you get vaccinated, you protect yourself and others in your community. This is especially important for people who cannot get vaccinated, such as those with weakened immune systems or pregnant women.

Some people who are vaccinated against chickenpox may still get the disease. However, it is usually milder with fewer blisters and little or no fever.
