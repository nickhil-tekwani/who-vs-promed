----------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to offer some comments and relevant information on the columnaris disease case in Georgia.

About 10 years ago I investigated a columnaris disease outbreak in an aquaculture facility for barramundi in Lake Argyle on the Ord River in Kununurra, in northern tropical Western Australia.

The disease had plagued the operator for several years as seasonal change brought on warmer water temperatures each year. Losses were huge, with entire pens of fingerlings wiped out (20-30 survivors remaining from thousands of fingerlings per pen). Adults in adjacent pens were also affected, but much less, so it was primarily a disease of the most susceptible small fingerlings, generally soon after they were introduced to the main facility in the lake from the nursery shed where they were bred.

Lesions were generally in the gills, with multifocal areas of necrosis that featured massive numbers of filamentous bacteria forming mats over the affected areas of gills. There were also a few skin lesions from which the same _Flavobacterium columnare_ bacteria could be isolated, along with numerous other bacteria. Skin lesions were less than that generally required to be fatal in my experience, so my diagnosis for the cause of death was severe necrotizing branchitis.

The most remarkable feature of the disease epidemiology was the speed at which it spread, and the degree of devastation it produced in a very short time. The empirical data were clear that it was spreading by direct transmission from one pen to adjacent pens. When a pen became affected, the entire pen was gone within a week, and nothing we could do would stop that.

Antibiotics in the feed made no difference once a pen became affected. Adjacent pens inevitably became infected if no action was taken. The outbreak could be mitigated by greater separation of fingerling pens, and by longer retention of fingerlings in the nursery facility before introduction to the lake pens during the warmest and most problematic months of the season. There was never any problem during cooler months.

The lake water was pristine and aquaculture was quite small scale, with no possible causation by unreasonable overstocking or too much intensive aquaculture in the area. Pollutants of any sort were entirely ruled out. The empirical data of the whole problem over many years were convincing that environmental temperature was the only trigger for the disease. This was somewhat counter-intuitive because columnaris disease was described in textbooks as a disease primarily of coldwater environments (common name for the disease is actually "coldwater disease"). I did not attempt to establish whether the bacterial species/strain was the same as the traditional coldwater pathogen, but I would expect that if this aspect was investigated it would show some strain variation in the warmwater pathogen from Lake Argyle compared to the traditional coldwater pathogen, and I would expect something similar in the Georgia pathogenic strain.

Warmwater columnaris disease seems to be a new issue in recent years/decades, from what I could then glean from the literature and historical reports, but maybe it had just gone unnoticed compared to the coldwater disease.

Stress factors such as pollutants, high organic matter levels, and low oxygen tension are always likely contributing factors in any fish disease outbreak in my experience, but I would expect investigators would be able to determine in this Georgia case, that the major common denominator in the previous and current outbreaks of columnaris disease was a seasonal increase in the water temperature beyond a critical threshold.

Warmwater naturally has a lower oxygen tension, so that could also be a secondary factor. Formaldehyde is a powerful reductant that consumes oxygen and significantly lowers the tension, so any such pollution would also be a candidate for a contributing factor (I've measured oxygen tension at zero in a pond after the operator was slightly overenthusiastic with the addition of formaldehyde to the pond to treat gill parasites. Everything in the pond died, including the fish, little crustaceans, and even the worms!).

High temperatures were found to enhance the adhesion to the gills of high virulence strains of _F. columnare_ (Decostere A, Haesebroucke F, Turnbull JF, Charlier G: Influence of water quality and temperature on adhesion of high and low virulence _Flavobacterium columnare_ strains to isolate gill arches.
