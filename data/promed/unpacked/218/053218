On 25 Nov [2020], officials at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) confirmed a donkey at a private facility in Orange County with eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). The 4-year-old presented with clinical signs, which included recumbency (down and unable to rise) on 17 Nov [2020]. She had not been vaccinated and was euthanized.

The case is Florida's 22nd confirmed case of EEE in equine in 2020.

Officials at Clemson Livestock Poultry Health (CLPH) have confirmed a vaccinated 8-year-old grade mare in Aiken County with eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). The horse was euthanized.

EEE 101

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:

- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[Although it seems quite late in the year for EEE, the southern states remain unusually warm, and the recent hurricanes and tropical storms have left standing water in many places that are breeding locations for mosquitoes. Any standing water, whether in catch pots of potted plants or old tires, bird baths, or any other standing water, regardless of size, provides breeding locations and opportunities for mosquitoes. Eliminate the standing water.

As this article mentions, vaccinate your animals, even now. The warm weather in the southern regions still have a large EEE potential. If your animal was vaccinated more than 3 months ago, please consider revaccinating, as the immunity to EEE wanes rather rapidly, lasting only about 3-4 months.

Please remember to use horse-approved mosquito repellent on your animal, and appropriate repellant for yourself. - Mod.TG
