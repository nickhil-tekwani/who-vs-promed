In Bagua, 6 children died because of rabies. The disease is
transmitted through the bite of infected vampire bats.

Rabies claimed its 6th victim in San Ramon and Yupicusa native
communities, which are located in Imaza district, Bagua province,
Amazonas region in Peru.

Last Tuesday [15 Feb 2011], it was reported that 25 children from
Yupicusa native community developed symptoms such as fever, muscle
pain, seizures, cough, vomiting, loss of consciousness, and
difficulty speaking, being all these symptoms compatible with a
diagnosis of rabies.

Health authorities presume that there may be additional cases that
have not been reported (yet). Meanwhile, a team including physicians
and biologists was sent to the affected area, and they are
vaccinating every person reporting being bitten by a vampire bat.
Simultaneously, they are sensitizing the population about how to
protect themselves in order to prevent bites from vampire bats.

Dr Orlando Caceres, Head of the Bagua-Amazonas health region,
declares that this rabies outbreak has occurred because of lack of
surveillance for epidemics in the area. No reports were made
regarding children being bitten by vampire bats, which led to lack of
health control for these young people, who were brought to the health
centers when vaccines were not able to control the disease.

There was also lack of training for health care personnel with
respect to diseases endemic for the affected area, and there was lack
of a good relationship with the Aguaruna people [the native
community], so people bitten by bats did not go to health centers seeking care.

Mr Roberto Guevara, local ombudsman for Amazonas, declared that in
health centers located in the areas where native communities live
there is no availability of rabies vaccines. Dr Cesar Velasquez,
Regional Director of the Amazonas health region, justified this,
stating that 75 per cent of the budget assigned to his office is for
paying salaries, and the 25 per cent remaining is for purchasing medicines.

[When reviewing this report originally published in ProMED-ESP
regarding deaths because of rabies transmitted by vampire bats in
native communities in the Amazon Jungle in Peru we find so many
lacks. Lack of surveillance, lack of control, lack of training, lack
of vaccines and so on, which may be summarized as lack of judgment
and decision for tackling this situation, not to say negligence.

Knowing this is a rural area inhabited by native communities, all the
aforementioned lacks led health care authorities and personnel to
face an accomplished fact and an unjustifiable loss of human beings.
This situation had to occur so just then they decided to send
specialized personnel for vaccinating exposed and/or at risk persons.
It is so easy to work in a comfortable office signing papers and
appearing in news releases or notifications every day instead of
facing the real health problems affecting people, be they in the
remote rural areas or in the emergency or hospitalization wards, with
all the lacks already mentioned.- Mod JG]

[This report indicates that this is the 6th death from vampire
bat-transmitted rabies virus in this geographic area of the Peruvian
Amazon. The previous ProMED report of 18 Feb 2011 (archive number
20110219.0550) indicated that there have been 7 deaths, so it is
difficult to know if the current report is the most recent and
accurate one. The previous report also indicated that the indigenous
people remove patients from medical attention and take them to native
traditional folk healers or go directly to these healers, so it is
difficult to obtain reliable statistics in these populations located
in remote areas of difficult access.

Of the 3 species of vampire bats in South America, the most common is
_Desmodus rotundus_, which is most likely responsible for the rabies
virus transmission in these cases. An image can be accessed at
