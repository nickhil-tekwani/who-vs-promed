China on [Sun 26 Jan 2020] ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals as the country struggles to contain a deadly virus believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild animals as food.

Raising, transporting, or selling all wild animal species is forbidden "from the date of the announcement until the national epidemic situation is over," said a joint directive from the country's market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement.

The lethal virus, which has caused 56 confirmed deaths and nearly 2000 total infections in China, and spread to about a dozen countries, is believed to have originated in a market in the central city of Wuhan, where a range of wildlife was reportedly sold.

Conservationists have long accused China of tolerating a shadowy trade in exotic animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicines, including highly endangered species such as the pangolin or tiger.

Health experts say the trade poses a significant and growing public health risk as potentially dangerous animal-borne pathogens that people would normal not be exposed to make the jump to humans.

The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets.

Civets, a cat-like creature, were among dozens of species listed on an exhaustive price list for one of the animal-trading businesses at the Wuhan market.

Other items included various rats, snakes, giant salamanders, and even live wolf pups.

Sunday's announcement said all businesses, markets, food and beverage outlets, and e-commerce platforms are "strictly prohibited from trading in wild animals in any form."

It added that "consumers must fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals, avoid wild game, and eat healthy."

The so-called bushmeat trade, along with broader human encroachment on wild habitats, is bringing humans into ever-closer contact with animal viruses that can spread rapidly in today's connected world, scientists say.

A study by the Global Virome Project, a worldwide effort to increase preparedness for pandemics, estimated that there are nearly 1.7 million undiscovered viruses in the animal kingdom, nearly half of which could be harmful to humans.

Peter Daszak, a virology expert with the project, told AFP its research also indicated that we can expect around 5 new animal-borne pathogens to infect humanity each year.

China has launched previous crackdowns on the wildlife trade, including after SARS, but conservationists say the trade typically resumes over time.

[Wildlife trade as a potential risk for pathogen exposure and translocation has been the focus of a large number of scientific reports and reviews. Legal and illegal movements of wildlife and wildlife products, including bushmeat, are a potential source of zoonotic diseases.

Once a virus acquires the ability to be transmitted from person to person, exposure to natural animal hosts is no longer needed for the pathogen to propagate. A wildlife trade ban at this point may be a late response, but it surely is an important step forward if the ban persists and is enforced.

The epidemics of SARS or the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus outbreak might have never taken place if direct exposure to an infected wildlife host was not as obscene as that which occurs in food markets where bushmeat is sold.

It is important that hazard and risk are differentiated to understand the role of wildlife trade. The huge diversity of pathogens that are part of the parasite community of the wildlife species of a region constitutes a hazard for emerging infectious diseases. But while hazard is the potential to cause harm (that is, infecting and causing disease in a human), the risk is the probability of infection. Wildlife trade operates increasing the risk of exposure to novel pathogens, not only to humans, but also to other species which may amplify the virus or cause it to change into a more pathogenic type. - Mod.PMB
