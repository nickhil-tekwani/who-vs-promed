Nova Scotia: 3 birds now confirmed positive for WNV
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials have confirmed that 3 birds in the province have tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV). A blue jay found in Dartmouth, a crow
in Kingston, and a blue jay in Brookfield, near Truro, have all tested
positive for the virus. Last week the first case of Lyme disease acquired
in Nova Scotia was reported.
As the various hunting seasons for birds approach, hunters are reminded to
protect themselves against exposure to mosquitoes and ticks. Although the
mosquito population is dwindling, there is still activity in the province,
particularly in swamp areas where hunters may venture. Deer ticks, which
may contain the agent responsible for Lyme disease, are also present.
"Although the risk of both Lyme disease and West Nile virus infection are
very low, we recognize that some people, especially hunters this season,
may be more concerned," said Dr Maureen Baikie, associate provincial
medical officer of health. "While there is no evidence that the virus [WNV]
can be contracted by handling birds, hunters should take normal precautions
when handling game. "Waterproof gloves should be worn when handling or
cleaning animals to prevent blood exposure to the hands. As well, hands,
all equipment, and cutting surfaces should be washed with soap and water.
Wild game should always be cooked thoroughly."
The province's surveillance program for WNV continues, and the public can
still help by reporting dead crows, blue jays, and ravens to the Department
of Natural Resources. More information on West Nile virus can be found
