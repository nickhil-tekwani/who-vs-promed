Avian flu shadows Vietnam's Lunar New Year traditions
--------------------------------------------------
As Vietnamese prepare to welcome the Year of the Rooster, the chicken is
uppermost in the minds of many.
The Lunar New Year, or Tet, is a time of extended celebration in Vietnam.
But this year is different. The threat of avian influenza, which has killed
12 Vietnamese and at least one Cambodian since 30 Dec 2004, is dampening
the traditional celebrations, particularly as they involve poultry.
Vietnamese often describe Tet to Americans as the equivalent of celebrating
Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's Day, and one's birthday all at once.
The official holiday starts 9 Feb [2005], but planning begins about 2 weeks
earlier. People spruce up their homes, pay their debts, and start cooking.
Many travel to visit relatives, often carrying live poultry with them.
A whole chicken is a prized part of Tet, restaurateur Mai Pham wrote in
"Pleasures of the Vietnamese Table," which is excerpted online at
<http://www.adoptvietnam.org>. The chicken symbolizes prosperity and
abundance, and is added to ancestor-worship altars.
Yen V. Pham, executive director of Vietnamese Social Services of Minnesota,
said chickens are a fine gift to honor important relatives. Pham recalled
that as a teenager in southern Vietnam that he would tie the feet of a
chicken or duck to make it easier to transport them as a gift for his
uncle. Pham's family would travel 20 miles from Bien Hoa City to the
uncle's home on a 3-wheeled motorized vehicle, the chickens secured in
back. The family crowded into one home for Tet, sleeping on floors or
couches for days of visiting, playing games, and eating. "You stay
together, you have a warm family feeling," he said.
Boiled chicken, roasted chicken, duck, and pork are all staples of Tet
recipes, Pham explained.
But the widespread outbreak of avian flu among poultry, as well as new
rules and tighter surveillance to identify ill birds, may eclipse the
starring role of poultry on the table for Tet.
For example, take the family of [a 21 year old junior] at the University of
Minnesota and vice president of the Vietnamese Student Association. She
speaks twice a month with family members in Vietnam. An aunt in Vietnam
recently told her the family's Tet celebration will be different.
"She said the bird flu is coming back and this New Year they can't have
chicken," [she] said yesterday. "She wanted to make a meal with chicken and
herbs. All my cousins love it. But this year, they're not going to have
it." Her aunt won't serve chicken because of concern that it wouldn't be
safe, she explained.
For the same reason, [her] family avoided eating chicken almost entirely
last summer during their visit, she added. In Vietnam, "People are so poor
they might tell you a chicken is safe just to get some money to put food on
the table," Nguyen said.
One of her family's Tet customs involves boiling a chicken and honoring
their ancestors in a traditional ceremony, [she] said. The chicken
indicates respect and remembrance for ancestors. Often a household member,
usually the oldest, tears off a drumstick, and the family examines it to
help predict their luck in the coming year.
"If the tendon is red, that symbolizes luck, a prosperous and happy
upcoming year," [she] said. "Yet if the tendon is brown, it is a sign and
forecast that the upcoming year will not go as smoothly."
Tet is a time when even families who can't afford to eat meat often will
splurge, [she] explained. It's also a time of heightened concern for
agencies that monitor avian flu.
Because of the recent spate of human deaths from H5N1 flu, the World Health
Organization has called for stronger control measures during Tet to prevent
the spread of avian flu through increased poultry marketing, consumption,
and mass travel. An estimated 200 000 Vietnamese living abroad return to
Vietnam to celebrate Tet, the Associated Press (AP) reported on 28 Jan 2005.
Last year the Vietnamese government banned the sale and transport of
poultry before Tet in an effort to contain avian flu. Officials have not
announced such a ban this year, according to the AP. But as Vietnamese
travel to visit relatives, laden with gifts and food for Tet, many will
pass through checkpoints set up to help contain the disease.
Checkpoints have been set up around all major cities to ensure that birds
have been inspected and come from areas free of avian flu outbreaks, the AP
reported today. The Veterinary Department in the northern province of Son
La has opened at least 38 checkpoints to prevent the movement of
potentially sick chickens, the Voice of Vietnam Web site reported
yesterday. However, the AP said a ban on the movement poultry out of 4
hard-hit provinces had been lifted because 21 days had passed with no new
outbreaks.
Riot police have been posted at poultry checkpoints around Ho Chi Minh City
to keep people from bringing in infected or uncertified poultry. About 300
000 chickens in the city were to be slaughtered, and the remaining 150 000
were to be raised under stricter hygiene rules, the Voice of Vietnam
reported last week.
Poultry consumption is down in big cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
City, according to an online report of 1 Feb 2005 by ABC news. Vietnam has
banned imports of poultry from adjacent countries, so some supermarkets and
restaurants now offer chicken from Australia and Brazil.
This week Ho Chi Minh City ordered the speedy slaughter of the estimated
210 000 ducks being raised in the city and barred farmers from restocking
ducks for the rest of this year, the online newspaper Vietnam News reported
yesterday [2 Feb 2005].
Ducks and pigeons being raised for food will be burned or buried alive,
animal health officials told Reuters news service.
The impact of this avian flu outbreak is likely to last well beyond the
Year of the Rooster.
[The 21 year old student] and her family visited Vietnam last summer,
dividing their time in the Hoc Mon region near Ho Chi Minh City between
relatives who lived in the city and those who lived on farms. She saw
evidence of the government's attempts to quell avian flu.
"We went by a deserted, burned chicken farm. My aunt said they burned it
down when the bird flu hit," [she] said.
Even her grandmother has felt the effects. "She has a small little farm, 10
to 15 chickens she raised for eggs," [the student] said. "They had to kill
her chickens."
[She] wondered aloud how the flu would affect that rural area of Hoc Mon.
"That whole area is farmland. Everybody has chickens," she said.

Hundreds of birds found dead at Boraphet reservoir
---------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of wild birds have died of avian influenza in the central province
of Nakhon Sawan in a little over 2 weeks, according to the Wildlife
Conservation Division.
Director Chawal Thalhikorn said his organisation had been monitoring the
bird flu situation among wild birds closely.
He said between 18 Jan and 3 Feb 2005, almost 500 open-billed storks had
been found dead at the Boraphet reservoir, Thailand's largest freshwater swamp.
Officials had burned the carcasses and sprayed disinfectant to prevent the
spread of disease. In other control efforts, the director said more than
6800 birds from 80 species in 7 provinces had been tested for the deadly
H5N1 strain of the virus. The result of the tests will be disclosed soon.
However, he said testing by other agencies had found the bird flu virus in
11 samples collected from 4 central provinces, including Sukhothai, Uthai
Thani, Lopburi, and Chachoengsao.

Deadly virus found in wild birds once again
---------------------------------------------
The deadly avian flu virus has emerged among wild birds again after
officials reported nearly 500 open-billed storks have died since last month
and test results showed at least some were affected by the H5N1 virus strain.
"The deaths were similar to those of 2004, but this year [2005] the scope
is smaller," said Schwann Tunhikorn, director of the Wildlife Conservation
Bureau.
Open-billed storks are migratory birds that frequently visit Thailand.
Their unusual deaths were first reported early in 2004. The bureau said
yesterday that 496 birds died in Bung Boraphet wildlife refuge in Nakhon
Sawan province, and 73 of them on 3 Feb 2005 alone.
Officials sent fluids obtained from the dead birds for examination at
universities, and the results showed some had contracted bird flu.
Officials had tightened control measures after cases of human deaths from
the disease were reported recently in Vietnam.
"The infected storks probably caught the virus from ducks while they fed
elsewhere before flying back to their nests in the centre of the wildlife
refuge," said Mr Schwann.
Wildlife officials have enforced strict measures to prevent the disease
from spreading further by burning and disinfecting areas where sick storks
have been found. But they have refrained from launching a mass cull, an
issue that raised a heated debate early in 2004.
Some concerned parties demanded a cull, arguing the storks brought the
disease with them to Thailand. But wildlife officials have argued the
birds' country of origin, Bangladesh, has reported no bird flu cases. The
officials said the storks probably caught the virus during their stay in
Thailand. Officials also found doves in Chachoengsao, Sukhothai and Uthai
Thani provinces had died of bird flu. In Lop Buri, a Zebra dove was also
found dead from the virus.
Nirandorn Aungtragoolsuk, director of the Bureau of Disease Control and
Veterinary Services, said tests confirmed chickens in Suphan Buri had bird flu.
