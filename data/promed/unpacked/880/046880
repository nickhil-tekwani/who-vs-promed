Another large northern Thailand botulism outbreak occurred again on 30 Jun
2006, affecting 83 from 192 people at risk who were exposed to raw deer
meat and gut, after [the deer carcass was preserved on] ice before
dissection and distribution.
Of these, 3 developed respiratory failure, 3 developed impending
respiratory failures, and 83 developed fatigue and diarrhea after ingestion
of raw dear meat and gut on 26-28 Jun 2006. One patient was referred to
hospital for respiratory failure. Physical examination of 3 patients in the
ICU of Chiang Kum General Hospital revealed ocular, respiratory and
proximal peripheral muscle weakness. The electrophysiologic findings
supported diagnosis of pre-synaptic neuromuscular dysfunction and
respiratory weakness; botulism is the most likely diagnosis.
After treatment with botulinum antitoxin (mixed-type botulinum antitoxin --
donated from Japan during Nan Hospital's botulism outbreak in Mar 2006), 3
patients in ICU showed improvement in overall clinical outcome. Active
surveillance was carried out by the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand
and CDC-USA to identify the high-risk patients who may develop respiratory
failure. This may be the 2nd outbreak of botulism in northern Thailand, but
fewer severe cases were observed.

The 1st call to report the most recent outbreak of botulism occurred at
4:30 am on Fri, 30 Jun 2006, when Sonja J. Olsen, PhD, Acting Chief of the
International Emerging Infections Program, at the collaboration between the
Thai Ministry of Public Health and the USA Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), located outside Bangkok, spoke to Dr. Chris Braden of the
HHS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Thai Ministry of Health, working with local surveillance teams trained
under an HHS-funded pandemic-influenza-prevention and preparedness program,
reported an outbreak of botulism in people who had eaten raw and poorly
refrigerated deer meat. Initially 10-50 people fell mildly ill, 4 severely
ill and 3 were on ventilators.
Thai health officials had 14 vials of botulism antitoxin remaining from the
50 vials provided by HHS and the WHO in Mar 2006 to combat a different
outbreak of botulism. They now requested 20-30 vials of antitoxin and an
HHS/CDC representative to assist with the epidemiological investigation.
Late that same day, an HHS/CDC staff member with 30 vials of antitoxin
boarded a plane to Thailand, and by Sunday morning the Thai Bureau of
Epidemiology flew the vials of botulism antitoxin to Phayao Province, where
local physicians promptly administered it to the people with botulism.
As of 3 Jul 2006, 9 patients were hospitalized, with 5 in intensive care,
and 3 on mechanical ventilators. No patients had died by that time, and no
new cases were reported.

This history of botulism is from
<http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/pubs/botulism/bot_03.htm>:
Botulism, or sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, was first
seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. The
outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with
consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak,
the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased
prompting a study of the disease by local health officer, Justinius Kerner
(1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the
consumption of sausage. The illness became known as "botulism" after
"botulus" the Latin word for sausage.
Many years later, Van Ermengem (1897) investigated an outbreak of botulism
involving 34 individuals who had consumed raw, salted ham served at a
gathering of amateur musicians in Ellezelles, Belgium. In the investigation
of this outbreak, Van Ermengem established that botulism was an
intoxication, not an infection, and that the toxin was produced by a
spore-forming obligate anaerobic bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_.
A later outbreak in Darmstadt, Germany associated with canned white beans
established that there was a 2nd type of botulism. The new strain was type
A and the Van Ermengem strain was probably type B (Landmann 1904).
In 1922, type C botulism was identified as causing disease in chickens
(Bengston 1922) and cattle (Seddon 1922). Robinson (1929) identified type D
in cattle and type E was identified by Gunnison (1936-1937) as causing
botulism in people after consuming fish. Type F was first described by
Moller and Scheibel (1960) from a Danish outbreak of botulism involving
homemade liver paste. Finally, type G botulism was identified in soil from
cornfields in Argentina by Gimenez and Ciccarelli (1978). The principal
types of botulism involved in human disease are types A, B, and E. - Mod.LL]
