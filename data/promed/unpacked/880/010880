Hong Kong wholesalers say they may import chickens from Malaysia
--------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong wholesalers said Thu 27 May 2004 they may import live chickens
from Malaysia because of restrictions on poultry imports from mainland
China due to fears over bird flu.
Even though the poultry influenza appears to have subsided, Hong Kong has
maintained a limit of about 30 000 chickens a day that are permitted to be
imported from the mainland. Wholesalers say 120 000 are needed and the
shortfall has led to higher prices.
"This isn't just overreacting. This is being harsh," said Tsui Ming-tuen,
head of the Hong Kong Poultry Wholesalers Association.
He said the restrictions are hurting the chicken industry, which lost
millions during an outright ban on chicken imports from the mainland
earlier this year when the bird flu outbreak was killing millions of
poultry across the region.
Tsui said Malaysia has offered to take Hong Kong wholesalers on a tour of
the Southeast Asian country's chicken farms to get them to start importing
live birds.
Malaysia wasn't hit by the bird flu outbreak, which killed 16 people in
Vietnam and 8 in Thailand.
Hong Kong's government said Malaysian chicken farms must meet its health
standards before traders will be permitted to import poultry from there.
China has traditionally been Hong Kong's exclusive source of live chickens.

[On 20 Apr 2004, HK resumed imports of live poultry for slaughter from
mainland China, initially limiting the daily consignments to 6000 live
chickens. The pilot plan included detailed sanitary measures, related to
the disease situation in the flocks/regions of origin and requiring the
segregation of exported birds from other poultry for 5 days prior to their
export. These were combined with laboratory-backed testing regime.
According to the published plan, consignments were to be released to the
market in HK only if they tested H5 avian influenza-free in the screening
test. Gradually increasing the daily quantities on a step-by-step basis was
said to be considered if satisfactory results were obtained during the
first stage of the pilot plan.
The results of performed tests seem to have enabled the (justifiably)
cautious HK authorities to significantly increase the daily consignments to
30 000 chickens. Apparently, this is still a limited quantity which does
not satisfy the market's demands. - Mod.AS].
