An outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), normally referred to as MERS, has been reported in camels in Marsabit County.

Camels in Turbi, Bubisa, Burgabo, Yagara in Forole and Badhahuri have been diagnosed with the viral respiratory illness according to County Livestock and Fisheries Chief Officer Dr. Wario Sori. "Even as the world currently battles with the aftershocks of COVID-19, there is also an outbreak of a disease caused in livestock by a virus of the coronavirus family that has been witnessed in this county," Dr. Sori told the Nation.

He noted that people with exposure to camels are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV, a dangerous respiratory virus. He said the county is collaborating with the Washington State University and CDC [Kenya] to monitor the MERS situation in the county. "We are working with partners to better understand the risks of this virus, including the source, how it spreads, and how to prevent infections," Dr. Sori said.

Preliminary research has recognised the potential for MERS to spread further and cause havoc to more than 80% of the population in the county who rely on livestock as their economic mainstay.

The disease was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Researchers have found MERS in camels from several countries. Studies have shown that direct contact with camels is a risk factor for human infection with the virus.

The CDC further states that MERS, like other coronaviruses, likely spreads from an infected person's respiratory secretions, such as through coughing [see comment below]. Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against MERS.

Other livestock disease outbreaks that have been reported in the county include the contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) -- also known as goat pneumonia -- in Laisamis Sub-county and goat anaemia (anaplasmosis) in Moyale Sub-county.

So far, all cases of MERS across the globe have been linked to travel to, or residence in, countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula.

[The above media report does not include information supporting its introductory statement, identifying "An outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ... in camels in Marsabit County." No information regarding morbidity or human involvement or any other details, clinical or otherwise, indicative of a disease event are included. Until such information becomes available, preferably supported by laboratory investigation, the subject is considered as "undiagnosed."

In addition: Although the statement, attributed to (Kenya's) CDC, according to which "MERS, like other coronaviruses, likely spreads from an infected person's respiratory secretions, such as through coughing" is correct, it should be clear that no cases of "reversed zoonosis" (from human to animal; "anthropozoonosis") have been reported in relation to MERS-CoV. This differs from COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, for which sporadic cases of human-to-animal (cat and wild felids, minks) transmission of disease have been reported.

As stated in the report, so far, all cases of MERS across the globe have been linked to travel to, or residence in, countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. A recent article addressed suspected (subclinical) human infections acquired locally in Kenya (Ref 1). Its (abridged) abstract follows:

"The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV in high-risk groups in Kenya. Sera collected from 93 camel handlers, 58 slaughterhouse workers and 35 camel herders were screened for MERS-CoV antibodies using ELISA and PRNT (plaque reduction neutralization test). We found 4 seropositive slaughterhouse workers by PRNT. Risk factors amongst the slaughterhouse workers included being the slaughterman (the person who cuts the throat of the camel) and drinking camel blood. Further research is required to understand the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in Africa in relation to occupational risk, with a need for additional studies on the transmission of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans, seroprevalence and associated risk factors."
