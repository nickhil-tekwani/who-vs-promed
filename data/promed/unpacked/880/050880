Infant _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Agona infections linked to infant formula
-----------------------------------------------
In January and February 2005, the Centre National de Reference des
Salmonelles (French National Reference Center for Salmonella (NRC-Salm))
noted an increase in isolates of _Salmonella_ serotype Agona. As of 4 Mar
2005, 32 isolates have been reported, which is 4 times more than the median
number of isolates sent to the NRC-Salm during these months in 2000-2004.
We defined a case as an infant with clinical symptoms compatible with a
salmonella infection and an isolate of _Salmonella_ Agona from stools or
blood or urine since 1 Jan 2005. As of 6 Mar 2005, 21 infant cases have
been investigated. The patients were all aged between one and 7 months and
live in 14 different departments throughout France (Figure 1). [To view
figures please see:
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2005/050303.asp>. - Mod. LL]
The cases investigated so far occurred between 28 Dec 2004 and 17 Feb 2005
(Figure 2). The parents of all 21 infants reported feeding their infants
milk made with different types of the Picot brand of infant powdered
formula in the week before onset of symptoms. The parents used 5 different
brands of bottled water to prepare the milk. 2 infants had also consumed
drinks containing fennel. 21 healthy infants, aged between one and 7
months, were identified as controls with the help of the sick infants'
attending physicians and the laboratories, and none of the controls had
consumed any Picot brand milk formula. These preliminary results strongly
suggest that milk formula prepared by this company is the source of this
outbreak.
Investigations are ongoing, particularly microbiological examination of the
products and the production site and further typing of the human isolates.
Based on the preliminary results of the epidemiological investigation, on 4
Mar 2005, the French authorities recalled all instant milk formula produced
under the Picot brand. Consumers have been advised not to drink any Picot
formula and to discard the containers. Preliminary information indicates
that this company exports its milk formula to Asia. Investigations are
being carried out to identify whether other countries have received its
products.
A warning was posted on the European Early Warning and Response System on 4
Mar 2005, and an urgent request for information was sent via Enter-net (the
international surveillance network for human gastrointestinal infections)
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm> on 7 Mar 2005.
Information is available in French on the Institut de Veille Sanitaire's
website [1,2].
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Agona is one of approximately 2000
salmonella serotypes that can cause illness in humans. The NRC-Salm
identified approximately 100 isolates each year between 2000 and 2004. Like
most other salmonella serotypes, this one is found in a variety of animal
reservoirs in France, including poultry, cattle, pigs, and in animal feed
[3]. An outbreak of _Salmonella_ Agona infections in infants occurred in
Germany in 2003 and was attributed to anise-fennel tea and fennel and anise
seed drinks [4]. Other outbreaks have been attributed to dried milk [5], to
a commercial peanut flavored snack [6], and a commercial cereal product [5].

[The 1st reported U.S. outbreak of _S. enterica_ serotype Agona was traced
to animal feed made with infected imported fishmeal in 1972. This serotype,
which rarely causes infections in humans, is capable of infecting the same
foods that other _Salmonella_ serotypes commonly do, such as meat, eggs,
fish and poultry.
_Salmonella_ Agona organisms, maintained in a suitably dry environment, can
remain viable for extended periods. When re-hydrated in the right
conditions, these organisms can grow, multiply and potentially cause infection.
The 1998 12 USA state outbreak of _S. enterica_ serotype Agona was linked
to a toasted oat cereal. Because of this, Malt-O-Meal Inc. recalled up to 3
million pounds of cereal USA-wide. The cereal manufacturer asked grocers to
pull from their shelves the Malt-O-Meal brand of plain Toasty-Os and
Toasted Oats, as well as plain toasted oat cereals sold at 38 supermarket
chains under various brand names.
