_Pseudomonas savastanoi_ pv. _savastanoi_ in Nepal. BSPP New Disease
Reports, vol. 18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
During 2006-2008, a phytobacteriological investigation on olive
plants (_Olea europea_) was carried out in Nepal. In commercial olive
orchards in Makwanpur district [in the central region of Nepal],
knots (0.5-3 cm [0.2-1.2 in] in diameter) resembling those caused by
_Pseudomonas savastanoi_ pv. _savastanoi_ on olive trees, were
observed on twigs and branches of 12-year-old olive plants.

From the knots, bacterial cells were isolated and subjected to
diagnostic tests. In greenhouse studies, 10 potted olive plants, 2
years old, were inoculated during the spring with bacterial
suspension. Characteristic knot symptoms were observed on all
inoculated plants within 6 months. Bacterial cultures with identical
characteristics to the original strain used for inoculations were
reisolated from all olive knots that developed.

Molecular identification was achieved by sequencing the 16S rDNA
region and searching for similar sequences in nucleotide databases
(GenBank, EMBL [European Molecular Biology Laboratory], and DDBJ [DNA
Databank of Japan]). The sequences shared between 99.86 percent
(1404/1406 basepairs) and 100 percent identity with the analogous
sequences of _P. savastanoi_ pv. _savastanoi_ available in the
databases.

This is the 1st record of olive knot disease on olive trees in Nepal.

[Olive knot is a potentially serious disease caused by the bacterium
_Pseudomonas savastanoi_. Symptoms include rough galls of variable
size on any organ of the plant. These grow rapidly and are most
common on young branches but will also form around wounds on the main
trunk and on damaged leaves. The disease reduces yield by girdling
branches and causing dieback, and young trees may be killed if trunks
are girdled [completely encircled by the knots. - Mod.JW].

The bacteria enter the host through wounds, live in the galls and
ooze out in wet weather. Infection occurs at low temperatures, but
time from infection to galling can vary from a week to several months
depending on environmental conditions. The disease is spread with
infected plant and other material, by water, and mechanical means.
All commercial olive cultivars are susceptible. Disease management
mostly includes pathogen exclusion, reducing inoculum levels by
removal of galls, and preventative copper treatment of any wounds.
