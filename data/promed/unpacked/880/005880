Another Thought on Norwalk-like Virus Decontamination
-----------------------------------------------------
[This useful additional comment requires me to reinstate this thread which
I had cut prematurely. - Mod.CP]

There is a real gap in knowledge of which disinfectants (apart from very
high concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution) can be used to
decontaminate the environment in protracted "person-to-person" outbreaks of
Norwalk-like viruses so often a problem in cruise ships.

A recent paper (2001) in the Journal of Food Protection (Gulati et al: 4
(9) 1430-4) uses feline calicivirus as a model for Norwalk-like viruses.
The evidence presented suggests that phenolic compounds at concentrations
of twice the manufacturer's recommendations (which are 1:256 dilution of
4.25 percent o-benzyl p-chlorophenol and 4.75% o-phenylphenol) might be the
most effective disinfectant against Norwalk-like viruses. This compares
with sodium hypochlorite, which even at concentrations of 800 ppm was not
particularly effective.

I don't, however, know the effects of phenolics on soft furnishings.
