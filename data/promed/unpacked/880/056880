Avian influenza situation in Egypt -- WHO update 52
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Egypt has announced a new confirmed case of
human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.

The case is a 30-year-old female from Amria District, Alexandria
Governorate. She developed symptoms on 26 Apr 2011 and was
hospitalized on 3 May 2011. She was in a critical condition under
artificial ventilation and died on 9 May 2011. She had received
oseltamivir treatment at the time of hospitalization.

Investigations into the source of infection indicate that the patient
had exposure to sick poultry suspected to have avian influenza.

The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratory, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza
Surveillance Network. Of the 144 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 48
have been fatal.
