On 27 Jun 2005 a 67-year-old woman, an inhabitant of the Kyzyl-ata
settlement in the Kasylgurtsky district of South Kazakhstan, was
hospitalized in the Central district hospital with the diagnosis,
"the infected wound of an index finger of the right hand," according
to the Ministry of Extreme Situations of the republic based upon the
information received on 30 Jun 2005 from Department of the State
Sanitary Epidemiological Supervision of Kazygurtsky District.

On 28 Jun 2005 the preliminary diagnosis of "Anthrax, cutaneous form"
was established. 14 persons who had contact with the sick woman have
been traced, and all of them are under medical supervision.
Laboratory investigation and anti-epidemic actions are being carried
out.

[It would seem that the previous actions taken to prevent a
recurrence of these events in southern Kazakhstan were not 100

afflicted with this disease. - Mod.MHJ]
