UNDIAGNOSED DEATH, PENGUINS - NEW ZEALAND

Yellow-eyed penguins (YEP) are dying in droves on Stewart Island, and
scientists are at a loss to explain why.

About 70 percent of the penguin chicks have died over the past 6 years.

Researchers for the Yellow-Eyed Penguin Trust (YEPT) along with Otago
and Massey university scientists and the Department of Conservation
cannot find a cause.

"We don't know if the penguins are starving and then succumbing to
disease or if they're diseased and then starving," said trust
spokeswoman Sue Murray.

Researchers have already found dead chicks from this year's [2007]
generation hatched over the past weeks.

Massey University's associate professor Maurice Alley of the NZ
Wildlife Health Centre said blood samples showed cases of diphtheria
or leucocytozoon, a malaria-like parasite spread by sandflies that
causes anemia and weakness. Diptheria causes lesions in the mouth,
which prevent the chicks from eating.

"It was very bad last year [2006]; all the nests at the top part of
the island were affected. There are no vaccines at the moment, but
we're trying to get to the bottom of it," Alley said.

DoC (Department of Conservation) figures show differing survival
rates for penguins in different areas of the island.

"There's a new theory that oyster dredging in Foveaux Strait may be
impacting on foraging grounds for some penguin colonies, but then
there are other colonies that don't seem affected. We really don't
know what the implications are at this stage," DoC southern islands
area manager Andy Roberts said.

"There's a huge collaborative effort going on to try and work out
what is killing these chicks, with avian vets working alongside the
trust and DoC."

[In 2004, there was a _Corynebacterium_ that caused the YEP to
succumb to various ailments and illnesses. I am sure if the YEPT is
involved, they have requested testing for the various corynebacteria.
