[1] Virus transmission
[A] No transmission through food or packaging
Date: Thu 25 Feb 2021
Source: Food Business News [edited]
https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/18033-us-affirms-no-transmission-of-covid-19-through-food-or-packaging


A joint statement issued 18 Feb 2021 by the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention underscored "there is no credible evidence of food or food packaging associated with or as a likely source of viral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19.

"Our confidence in the safety of the US food supply remains steadfast," the agencies said. "Consumers should be reassured that we continue to believe, based on our understanding of currently available reliable scientific information, and supported by overwhelming international scientific consensus, that the foods they eat and food packaging they touch are highly unlikely to spread SARS-CoV-2."

The statement attributed to then Acting Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Shea and Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, MD, was timely in view of continued assertions made by Chinese health officials and state media suggesting traces of the virus on imported frozen food or frozen food packaging may have been the source of the June [2020] outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing and even of China's initial outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019. China has been pushing back against indications the global pandemic originated in China.

Chinese officials have stepped up inspections of imported frozen food in the past several months, which has led to some shipments being rejected on claims traces of COVID-19 were found on packaging. China's trading partners, including the European Union, Canada, Brazil and the United States, said China has produced no evidence to justify its rejection of certain frozen food shipments or to the effect traces of the virus found on frozen food or packaging could lead to infection of humans.

The statement also came shortly after comments by Peter Ben Embarek, PhD, who led the World Health Organization team of scientists that recently was in Wuhan to investigate the origins of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China. Dr. Ben Embarek during a 9 Feb 2021 press conference, just before the team departed China, affirmed the most likely source of the virus was animals, perhaps farmed non-domesticated animals, as has been widely suspected, but the idea that the virus may somehow be transmitted to humans who come into contact with frozen foods or frozen food packaging that exhibit traces of the virus may be "worth exploring."

At the same time, Dr. Ben Embarek in an interview with Science magazine on his return to Geneva indicated even if it were possible for an individual to be infected with COVID-19 from traces of the virus on frozen food or packaging, this would have played no role in the outbreak in Wuhan. "China has reported over the past months a few instances where they have isolated the virus and positive samples on imported frozen products," Dr. Ben Embarek said. "But that was happening in 2020, at a time when the virus was widely circulating in the world, when there were multiple outbreaks in food factories around the world.

"It is probably an extremely rare event. We can see that from only a few dozen positive findings in China, out of 1.4 million samples taken so far. It's potentially possible, so it's worth exploring. But we have to separate the situation in 2020 with imported goods in China, and the situation in 2019, where that was not a possible route of introduction. There were no widespread outbreaks of COVID-19 in food factories around the world."

In their 18 Feb 2021 statement, Mr. Shea and Dr. Woodcock said COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is spread from person to person through the air, unlike foodborne or gastrointestinal viruses, such as norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food.

"While there are relatively few reports of the virus being detected on food and packaging, most studies focus primarily on the detection of the virus' genetic fingerprint rather than evidence of transmission of virus resulting in human infection," they added. "Given that the number of virus particles that could be theoretically picked up by touching a surface would be very small and the amount needed for infection via oral inhalation would be very high, the chances of infection by touching the surface of food packaging or eating food is considered to be extremely low."

Mr. Shea and Dr. Woodcock pointed to the 3 Sep 2020 opinion issued by the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods that affirmed, "Despite the billions of meals and food packages handled since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, to date there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19."

Mr. Shea and Dr. Woodcock continued, "In addition, considering the more than 100 million cases of COVID-19, we have not seen epidemiological evidence of food or food packaging as the source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans. Furthermore, transmission has not been attributed to food products or packaging through national and international surveillance systems. Food business operations continue to produce a steady supply of safe food following current Good Manufacturing Practices and preventive controls, focusing on good hygiene practices and keeping workers safe.

"Based on the scientific information that continues to be made available over the course of the pandemic, the USDA and FDA continue to be confident in the safety of the food available to American consumers and exported to international customers," Mr. Shea and Dr. Woodcock said.

[B] Transmission from frozen wildlife
Date: Fri 26 Feb 2021
Source: Nature [abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00495-0


Momentum is growing for the suggestion that the coronavirus can spread from infected frozen wildlife. A World Health Organization (WHO) fact-finding mission in China did not rule out the idea that this mode of transmission contributed to early outbreaks of COVID-19 -- although investigators say it's unlikely to have started the pandemic.

At a press conference earlier this month [February 2021], the WHO team concluded that the virus probably came from bats and was passed to people through a live intermediate animal. But the team also said it was important to investigate whether frozen meat from wild animals bred on Chinese farms might have been contaminated with the virus and have led to one of the earliest reported outbreaks, at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China.

"We all thought the cold-chain stuff was a reasonable hypothesis" that needed to be considered, says team member Dominic Dwyer, a virologist at New South Wales Health Pathology in Sydney, Australia. But more work needs to be done to establish how frozen wildlife might have become contaminated, he says. A report from the WHO team is expected to lay out data on the hypothesis next week.

But the WHO team's call to investigate infected frozen meat has become confused with suggestions from China that the virus can spread on frozen surfaces. For months, media outlets in the country have pushed the idea that the virus might have arrived in Wuhan on frozen wildlife imported from abroad. Subsequent local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have also been linked to imported frozen food, and scientists in China have also published a growing body of evidence that transmission on frozen meat is theoretically possible.

Many scientists outside China, however, argue that this "cold chain" theory is a red herring in the overall search for the pandemic's origin, and is an attempt to deflect criticism. They say it is rare for SARS-CoV-2 to be passed from one person to another through contaminated surfaces.

Some studies suggest that surface transmission on frozen surfaces is feasible. A preprint (1 [see source URL for complete references]) posted on bioRxiv by researchers in Singapore in August [2020], which has not been peer reviewed, found that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious on the surface of frozen or refrigerated meat for more than 3 weeks.

Two months later, researchers in China linked (2) a June [2020] outbreak in Beijing to the city's Xinfadi Market. The 1st cases came after 56 days with no community transmission in the city and were connected with a distinct strain of SARS-CoV-2. Outbreak investigators found viral particles from the same strain on cold-stored salmon at a market stall.

The WHO investigation team took these findings into account. "We spent a lot of time going through the evidence from the Beijing Xinfadi Market outbreak. It's a really good piece of work. They really went into detail to try to find the connections to a source," says team member Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit global-health organization in New York City.

In a 3rd study (3), published last November [2020], another group of scientists in China reported isolating infectious virus from the packaging of frozen cod that was thought to have been the source of infection in dock workers in Qingdao, in the eastern province of Shandong, in September [2020]. "We have no reason to assume that it might not happen," says Erwin Duizer, a virologist at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven.

In November [2020], in the wake of these and other outbreaks in China, authorities introduced mandatory disinfection of imported frozen goods to prevent surface transmission.

If frozen or thawed carcasses were infected with the virus, handling the animals could have posed an infection risk, says Andrew Breed, a veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. This could be especially true of intermediate host animals, which are prone to shedding large volumes of virus, because their immune systems aren't adapted to fend off the infection. Frozen bushmeat has been linked to outbreaks of viruses such as Ebola in Africa, so it wouldn't be the 1st time, notes Duizer. But Breed adds that little is known about the condition of food during transport to the market. "Freezing and thawing will definitely really reduce viability for certain types of viruses, including coronaviruses," he says.

[Food packaging may become contaminated during handling in facilities where infection rates are high and the virus is actively being transmitted, but this virus must be a sufficiently high titer to infect individuals. If packaging becomes contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, virus will survive well if frozen at ultracold temperatures, but freezing and thawing will damage the virus and make it less transmissible. While RNA will still be detectable, infectious virus will not. - Mod.LK]

[2] Reinfection: nursing home residents
Date: Fri 26 Feb 2021 08:00 EST
Source: CNBC [edited]
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/cdc-study-finds-nursing-home-residents-were-reinfected-with-worse-case-of-covid.html


A new CDC study found that some elderly people who apparently recovered from the coronavirus later came down with a 2nd even worse case -- indicating that asymptomatic or mild cases may not provide a lot of protection against becoming reinfected with COVID-19. The study, published Thursday [25 Feb 2021] in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, studied 2 separate outbreaks that occurred 3 months apart at a skilled nursing facility in Kentucky. Between mid-July [2020] and mid-August [2020], 20 residents and 5 healthcare personnel tested positive for the virus, according to the study.

The 2nd outbreak, between late October [2020] and the beginning of December [2020], was worse -- 85 residents and 43 healthcare personnel tested positive for the virus. Among the residents who tested positive during the 1st outbreak and were still living in the facility, 5 of them tested positive a 2nd time more than 90 days after their 1st positive test. Though COVID-19 reinfections do happen, they are generally rare.

Through frequent surveillance after the 1st outbreak, all 5 residents had at least 4 negative tests between outbreaks, suggesting they were potentially reinfected with the virus later on, the study found. Reinfection means that a person who had COVID-19 recovered and then got it again, according to the CDC.

"The exposure history, including the timing of roommates' infections and the new onset of symptoms during the 2nd outbreak, [suggests] that the 2nd positive RT-PCR results represented new infections after the patients apparently cleared the 1st infection," wrote Alyson Cavanaugh, one of the researchers who led the study.

While only 2 of the 5 residents experienced slight symptoms during the 1st outbreak, all 5 potentially reinfected residents showed signs of illness the 2nd time. The 2 residents who reported symptoms during the 1st outbreak "experienced more severe symptoms during the 2nd infectious episode," according to the study. One resident was hospitalized and subsequently died.

According to the study's researchers, this was "noteworthy" because it suggests the possibility that people who show mild to no symptoms during their 1st infections "do not produce a sufficiently robust immune response to prevent reinfection." The results "suggest the possibility that disease can be more severe during a 2nd infection."

"The findings of this study highlight the importance of maintaining public health mitigation and protection strategies that reduce transmission risk, even among persons with a history of COVID-19 infection," Cavanaugh wrote.

The study noted some limitations. Because specimens were not stored, researchers couldn't conduct genomic sequencing, a laboratory technique that breaks down the virus's genetic code, to confirm reinfection, researchers said. Also, "no additional test results exist to support the initial test result as a true positive" during the 1st outbreak, they said.

It's thought that the risk of reinfection for the general population is still low, but nursing home residents may be particularly at risk given their congregate living and high number of exposures, according to the study. "Skilled nursing facilities should use strategies to reduce the risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission among all residents, including among those who have previously had a COVID-19 diagnosis," Cavanaugh wrote.

The lack of confirmation of initial diagnosis and inability to sequence virus from infections to determine whether the 2nd infections are truly new infections limit the conclusions of the study. But what the study does confirm is that even after having been infected, one still must follow protective measures -- masks, social distancing, hand washing. This may be particularly true in nursing homes where residents likely do not mount robust immune response to infection, making them more vulnerable to reinfection. - Mod.LK]

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in a controlled setting. Israel initiated a national vaccination campaign in December 2020, prioritizing persons aged more than 60 years and other high-risk populations.

What is added by this report?
By February 2021, 2-dose vaccination coverage was 84% among persons aged 70 years or older and 10% among those aged less than 50 years. The ratio of COVID-19 patients aged 70 years or older requiring mechanical ventilation to those aged less than 50 years declined 67% from October-December 2020 to February 2021.

What are the implications for public health practice?
These findings provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe cases of COVID-19 at the national level in Israel.

The availability of COVID-19 vaccines represents an opportunity to mitigate the effects of the global pandemic. Achieving high vaccination coverage through intensive vaccination campaigns has the potential to substantially reduce COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing mild and severe COVID-19 in a controlled setting. However, clinical trials are not designed to assess the population impact of vaccination in a real-world setting (1,2 [see source URL for complete references]). Israel initiated a national vaccination campaign using the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in December 2020, prioritizing persons aged over 60 years, healthcare workers, and persons with underlying medical conditions. By February 2021, 2-dose vaccination coverage among persons aged 70 years or older was 84%. To assess the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the occurrence of severe disease, an ecological study was conducted. Requiring mechanical ventilation was used as a proxy for severe COVID-19. The number of COVID-19 patients aged 70 years or older (who had the highest 2-dose vaccination coverage, 84.3%) requiring mechanical ventilation was compared with that of patients aged less than 50 years, who had the lowest 2-dose vaccination coverage (9.9%). Since implementation of the 2nd dose of the vaccination campaign, the ratio of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation aged 70 years or older to those aged under 50 years has declined 67%, from 5.8:1 during October-December 2020 to 1.9:1 in February 2021. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe cases of COVID-19 at the national level in Israel. Receipt of COVID-19 vaccines by eligible persons can help limit spread of disease and potentially reduce the occurrence of severe disease.

The 1st case of COVID-19 in Israel, a country with a population of approximately 9 million, was reported in February 2020. As of 9 Feb 2021, approximately 700 000 cases and 5200 deaths had been reported (3). Nonpharmaceutical interventions have included 3 national stay-at-home orders [see source URL for dates], multiple rounds of school closures, restrictions on commercial activity and travel, and a mask mandate, among others. The most recent stay-at-home order was implemented on 8 Jan 2021, amid a nationwide surge in cases (4). On 20 Dec 2020, Israel initiated a national vaccination program against COVID-19, using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and prioritizing persons aged 60 years or older, healthcare workers, and persons with chronic conditions that increase risk for infection or severe disease (5).

By 9 Feb 2021, a total of 3 606 858 persons had received the 1st vaccine dose, and among those, 2 223 176 (62%) had received the 2nd dose. Two-dose COVID-19 vaccination coverage among persons aged 70 years or older, 60-69 years, 50-59 years, and less than 50 years was 84.3%, 69.0%, 50.2%, and 9.9%, respectively (Figure 1 [see source URL]).

During 2 Oct 2020-9 Feb 2021, the median daily numbers of COVID-19 patients aged less than 50 years and 70 years or older who required mechanical ventilation were 15 (range = 6-63) and 84 (range = 45-127), respectively. During 8 Oct 2020-30 Dec 2020, the mean ratio of ventilated patients aged 70 years or older to those aged under 50 years was 5.8:1 (99% confidence interval = 5.5-6.1; range = 4.2-8.5). During the last week of January 2021, although the average daily number of ventilated patients aged 70 years or older had begun to decline, the average daily number of ventilated patients aged less than 50 years was still increasing (Figure 2 [see source URL]). By 9 Feb 2021, the 7-day rolling average number of ventilated patients aged 70 years or older was 109, and among those aged less than 50 years was 57.7 (ratio = 1.9:1), representing a 67% decrease in the ratio compared with that during 8 Oct 2021-30 Dec 2020.

Discussion
These findings suggest a possible impact of the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Israel on reducing severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The Israeli national vaccination campaign (5), which was initiated on 20 Dec 2020, in the midst of a nationwide surge of COVID-19 cases, was followed by a strict national stay-at-home order starting on 8 Jan 2021 (4). Vaccine rollout was rapid, and because older age-groups were prioritized for vaccination (5), it was feasible to compare the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation between the oldest and youngest age-groups, whose COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates differed the most. The percentage of COVID-19 patients aged 70 years or older requiring mechanical ventilation in Israel fluctuated during October-December 2020 but has considerably and consistently decreased after implementation of the vaccination campaign prioritizing older adults. The decline in the ratio of persons aged 70 years or older to those aged less than 50 years requiring mechanical ventilation began around the time of commencement of administration of the 2nd vaccine dose (30 Jan 2021). This might reflect the effects of the 1st dose, an observation that is consistent with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine phase 3 results, which demonstrated partial efficacy after the 1st dose (1).

Considering the vaccination rate and the expected vaccine efficacy, this study provides preliminary evidence at the population level for the reduction in risk for severe COVID-19, as manifested by need for mechanical ventilation, after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. These data are consistent with preliminary reports showing a reduction in COVID-19 cases and severe cases in the vaccinated population and a reduction in viral load in vaccinated persons compared with that in unvaccinated persons [see source URL for weblinks to these reports]. Taken together, these results suggest reduced rates of severe COVID-19 following vaccination.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, this was an ecological analysis that relied on preliminary and aggregated data and might be subject to delays in reporting of COVID-19 cases. Second, the longitudinal and observational nature of this study limited the ability to account for different concomitant effects, including development and spread of novel variants, the general increase in COVID-19 cases and national stay-at-home orders. However, by analyzing the percentage of cases by age-group (accounting for vaccination rates), these results are unlikely to be influenced by the overall incidence in the population. Finally, there were possible differences in adherence to mitigation measures between the age-groups. To address this limitation, the analysis period was extended to include an earlier period with a stay-at-home order (September-October 2020).

Many countries are currently conducting national COVID-19 vaccine campaigns. The findings from this study provide preliminary but important evidence of the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing severe cases of COVID-19 at the national level in Israel. Receipt of COVID-19 vaccines by eligible persons can help limit spread of disease and potentially reduce the occurrence of severe disease.

[Definitely promising data. The concerns that exist deal with the unknowns associated with the variants that are in circulation and possible immune escape related to the mutations. A race exists between the push to vaccinate the entire population vs the introduction of variants in widespread circulation. Israel recognizes there is a significant number of individuals in the country who refuse vaccinations. According to media reports, one approach being considered is banning unvaccinated individuals from public locations (malls, restaurants -- see prior ProMED post COVID-19 update (72): Africa reporting, UK lockdown impact, Israel vaccine, WHO 20210219.8200334, in addition to the following recent media reports: https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-vaccinated-rig/insight-left-out-israeli-vaccine-refuseniks-fear-exclusion-as-economy-reopens-idINL8N2KT6FF and https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-plans-to-punish-businesses-that-serve-unvaccinated-customers-report/). - Mod.MPP]

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Italy (20 488), India (16 056), Mexico (15 974), Czech Republic (14 612), Poland (11 536), and Russia (11 086). A total of 49 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 49 countries are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region. Noteworthy is that the state of Georgia in the USA has become the 6th state to have reported more than 1 million cases.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 8.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 7.2% increase in daily reported cases and a 0.73% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases totaled almost 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 113.97 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.53 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Importantly, the declining 7-day averages of cases and deaths continue to shift so the 7-day average of daily newly confirmed cases is showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the 3rd wave is gaining strength again -- unconfirmed but possibly due to the impact of the variants in circulation. - Mod.MPP]
