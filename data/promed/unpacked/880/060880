The Sao Paulo State Secretariat of Health, through its Sanitary Surveillance Center, issued recalls of lot 1E0712 of Estrela brand mortadella [an Italian cured sausage] and of lot 300437 of Quero brand pickled green corn. The measure was published in the Thu 23 Aug 2012 edition of the State Official Gazette. With the recalls, the lots may not be marketed in the State of Sao Paulo in Brazil.

The Sanitary Surveillance Center made its determination after the notification of 4 suspected cases of botulism in Santa Fe do Sul, in the region of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo State.

The last record of the disease in the State of Sao Paulo was in 2009. Since 1997, when botulism became a notifiable disease, Sao Paulo has recorded 22 cases, including 5 deaths.

The precautionary recalls will remain in effect until results of the tests on samples of both products sent to the Adolfo Lutz Institute are received.
