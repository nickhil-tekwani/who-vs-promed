[The official MERS count (by country) from the ECDC as of the end of 2015 shows Oman ranked as 6th in the number of reported cases, although imported cases are not always attributed to the (likely) country of origin. A table showing the number of cases and number of deaths is included in posting #10,851, Avian Flu Diary, Michael Coston [editor]. Saudi Arabia reports by far the greatest number of cases, followed by United Arab Emirates. (http://afludiary.blogspot.com/).

Oman, officially the Sultanate of Oman, is an Arab country in the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Holding a strategically important position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, the nation is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest, and shares marine borders with Iran and Pakistan. The coast is formed by the Arabian Sea on the southeast and the Gulf of Oman on the northeast. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman

Between 29 Nov [2015] and 17 Dec 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 2 deaths.

Details of the cases
--------
1- A 48-year-old male from Najran city developed symptoms on 10 Dec [2015] and on 15 Dec [2015] was admitted to hospital. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 16 Dec [2015], and on 18 Dec [2015] passed away. [He] had comorbidities and a history of frequent contact with camels and consumption of their raw milk.

2- A 41-year-old, non-national female from Buridah city developed symptoms on 13 Dec [2015] and on 14 Dec [2015] was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 15 Dec [2015]. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative-pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient has a history of contact with a MERS-CoV case (see case no. 4 below). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

3- A 21-year-old female from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 25 Nov [2015] and on 30 Nov [2015] was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbid conditions, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 1 Dec [2015]. Currently, she is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.

4- A 35-year-old female in Buridah city developed symptoms on 22 Nov [2015] and, on 27 Nov [2015], was admitted to hospital. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 28 Dec [2015] and passed away on 5 Dec [2015]. She had comorbidities.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1625 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 586 related deaths.

WHO advice
-------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, early symptoms are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‚ÄêCoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.
