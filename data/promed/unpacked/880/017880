Based on exclusive information provided to La Radio, an official of
the Health SEREMI [las SecretarÃ­as Regionales Ministeriales de Salud;
Regional Ministerial Secretariat], Jaime Jamett, confirmed the
occurrence of a suspected case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the La
Calera community. Although the health authority declined to give
information about the history of the affected individual, he stated
the clinical samples were sent to the Public Health Institute for
their testing and confirmation, or not, of the disease [virus
infection].

The patient presumably infected [with the virus] is being treated in
the Los Leones de la Calera Clinic.

The SEREMI official Jaime Jamett told La Radio that since 1995 up to
the present, 14 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infection] have been
detected [in this area], which represents a little more than 2 per
cent at the national level, with the most recent one documented last
year [2010] in the Maitenes en Casablanca locale, where a 40 year old
woman died as a result of a critical illness called "hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome," in which 50 per cent of patients end up
losing their lives.

[As is usual, the specific hantavirus involved with suspected or
confirmed cases of hantavirus infection in Chile is not indicated. The
virus most likely to be responsible for the above case is Andes virus,
with the long-tailed pygmy rice rat as its rodent host.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
be seen at <http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg>.
