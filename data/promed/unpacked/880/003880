Local public health officials in France are investigating more than 20 cases of foodborne illness mostly affecting children. The Hauts-de-France public health agency (ARS) reported the suspected outbreak in recent days among pupils in schools in a commune in Northern France.

A total of 21 students enrolled in 3 schools in Saint-Andre-lez-Lille have been identified to date and several children have required hospitalization. Officials did not say what agent was responsible but local media reported it was _E. coli_, without mentioning the serotype. The Hauts-de-France ARS has yet to respond to a request for clarification. The health agency is coordinating investigations to determine the origin of the outbreak and put in place any necessary public health measures. Information is being shared with parents of pupils of the implicated schools.

Healthcare professionals have also been informed of the incident so they can better prepare to manage suspected patients. Officials have estimated the date of contamination around [2 or 3 Sep 2021], taking into account the incubation period of 1 to 8 days and dates of symptom onset. They also found all sick children ate in canteens at the schools. The municipal catering service that provides food to the 3 schools also supplies another school and 3 nurseries but no infections have been reported at those sites.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this post.

It is unclear whether the _E. coli_ here is an enterohemorrhagic strain such as O157:H7 or one of the other enteropathic strains (such as enteroinvasive, enterotoxigenic or enteropathogenic _E. coli_ among others). Currently, available technology can identify these strains. Information from knowledgeable sources in the area will be appreciated.

Saint-Andre-lez-Lille (literally Saint-Andre near Lille) is a commune in the Nord department in northern France. - Mod.LL
