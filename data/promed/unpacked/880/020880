[The following report includes a video and a brief text. - Mod.TY]

Encephalitis in Bihar [state] has killed more than 142 children. Muztaffurpur has born the maximum brunt of this deadly disease, accounting for 117 deaths so far.

According to data released by the [Bihar Health] Department, the total number of affected people due to encephalitis in the state is more than 600.

Victims of this disease mostly come from a downtrodden socioeconomic background.

[The video reports that cases occur in this area annually but case numbers have varied from 4 in 2016 to 355 in 2014, but far fewer than this year (2019). Lychee fruit consumption is again mentioned as an etiological cause of acute encephalitis syndrome. Japanese encephalitis is mentioned also. The video shows the overcrowded conditions in the Muztaffurpur hospital's ICU and criticism of these conditions by parents and local politicians. Clearly, the conditions and staff are overwhelmed with the number of patients that are coming in for treatment.

The current case numbers vary in several current reports. Uttar Pradesh state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath stated that at least 1349 children had died of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in neighbouring Bihar (https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/up-effectively-controlled-spread-of-japanese-encephalitis-acute-encephalitis-syndrome-adityanath-119062200610_1.html). Another report indicates that there have been 145 deaths in Bihar and 127 deaths in Muztaffurpur (https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/bihar-encephalitis-horror-death-toll-touches-145-1554208-2019-06-22). Still another report states that there are 170 deaths in Bihar (https://www.timesnownews.com/videos/mirror-now/society/bihars-healthcare-crisis-intensifies-encephalitis-claims-over-170-lives/34851). Because the number of cases continues to grow quickly, the discrepancy in case numbers may be due to the day and time that those numbers were obtained.

As noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY
