The maternity, neonatal, gynecology and emergency wards at Doctor Max
Peralta Hospital in the colonial capital of Cartago have been temporarily
closed, while officials attempt to isolate deadly "flesh-eating" bacteria
that have so far infected at least nine patients since early July, killing
two of them.
A seven-day-old baby who apparently contracted "necrotizing fasciitis", a
disease caused by [_Streptococcus_ Group A bacteria, in the Max Peralta
Hospital during an inoculation last week, died Saturday at the National
Children's Hospital in San Jose, reported the daily La Nacion [newspaper.
Cartago Mayor Hector Castillo says he has asked President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez to declare a state of national emergency so that all resources
can be put towards isolating the bacteria.
"People here in Cartago are worried, and we're watching closely how this
develops," Castillo told The Tico Times. "The city of Cartago is in a state
of alarm."
Close to 100 surgeries and all visiting hours have been suspended as well.
Patients who need emergency attention are being transferred to hospitals in
San Jose and Turrialba.
Researchers are still trying to determine whether the bacteria are
spreading within the hospital or within the community at large. The
Ministry of Health and the Caja have created a special commission to
investigate.
According to Castillo, the only link found so far is that all victims were
patients in the emergency ward at Max Peralta and are from the Cartago
area. "Flesh-eating" bacteria enter the skin through a scratch, cut or
other opening. They rapidly destroy tissue and the disease can be fatal
within 24 hours. People with lowered immune defenses are most susceptible.
Symptoms include pain in the infected part of the body, reddening and
swelling of the skin, followed by a darkening of the skin, a sign of
gangrene. The disease can be treated with antibiotics if caught early enough.
"As far as I know, we have never had a case like this in Costa Rica," said
well-known local microbiologist Dr. Leonardo Mata of the Institute for
Health Studies at the University of Costa Rica. "These patients all came
into the hospital with minor problems and were released. They came back 24
to 48 hours later with the disease. This is a terribly serious situation."
Hospital officials say they usually see a few cases of the disease per
year, but they come sporadically.

[This apparent cluster of cases of invasive streptococcal disease has been
reported for a period of weeks, but as yet no microbiological
characterization of strains isolated has been available. It is clear that
there is a problem at this facility, but until the strain analyses are
performed it will not be clear whether they are dealing with a common
source outbreak or a breakdown in good medical/nursing practices. - Mod.ES
