First report of tomato yellow leaf curl virus associated with beans,
_Phaseolus vulgaris_, in Cuba
---------------------------------------------
Y Martínez Zubiaur, M Quiñones, D Fonseca, Phytopathology Department,
National Center for Animal and Plant Health, PO Box 10, San Jose de las
Lajas, Habana, Cuba; JL Potter, DP Maxwell, Department of Plant Pathology,
University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706. Plant Dis 2002; 86: 814, published
online as D-2002-0515-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication 5 May 2002.
Beans with yellow mosaic and/or leaf crumple symptoms were collected in 3
fields in the southern area of the province of Havana, Cuba in December
2001 and February 2002.
DNA was extracted from the fresh bean leaves of 25 samples (1). Dot blot
hybridization was performed at high stringency with a specific probe for
tomato yellow leaf curl [begomo]virus (TYLCV). The specific probe was
prepared by alkaline phosphatase labeling of the ... polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) fragment amplified with primer pair, PTYIRv21/PTYIRc287,
containing the intergenic region (IR) of TYLCV, and chemiluminescent
hybridization was completed as described ... (AlkPhos Direct Labeling and
Detection Systems, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc, Piscataway, NJ). 4 of
the samples had positive hybridization signals.
PCR was performed with overlapping primers for TYLCV (2) with the DNA
extract from sample 01-44, which gave a positive hybridization signal with
the TYLCV probe, and a 2.8-kb fragment was obtained. This fragment was
cloned in pGem T-Easy (pBeTY44) and partially sequenced. Greater than 96
[per cent] nt identity was obtained for the 591 nt of the IR and 504 nt of
the N-terminus of the Rep gene with TYLCV (GenBank Accession No. AF260331).
PCR was completed on 11 of the 25 samples with the degenerate primer pair
PAL1v1978/PAR1c715 for DNA-A (3). 8 samples gave fragment sizes of 1.4 kb
and 1 sample gave a fragment of 1.3 kb. The 1.3-kb fragment from sample
number 01-50 was cloned in pGem T-Easy (pBeBG50) and partially sequenced.
Pairwise nucleotide comparisons with Bean golden yellow mosaic virus
(BGYMV, GenBank Accession No. M91604) were 95 [per cent] for 719 nt of the
N-terminus of the Rep gene.
These results are consistent with the association of both TYLCV and BGYMV
in beans and have important implications for future disease management
strategies.

[It is not unexpected that TYLCV would eventually spread to Cuba since the
virus in present in many of the Caribbean islands. No information is given
on the strain of the virus in this report. Disease management depends
heavily on breeding for virus resistance. An imidacloprid-based insecticide
may be useful in disease management. Relevant references:
