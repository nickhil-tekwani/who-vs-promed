The Centre for Health Protection has identified an imported case of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase carbapenemase producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ in a 64 year old man, Hong Kong's 9th case of the antibiotic-resistant infection. The patient, with chronic illness, traveled to Thailand between 8 Apr 2012 and 17 May 2012.

He has developed a fever, chills, rigor, and inflammation of the left leg since 19 Apr 2012 and was diagnosed as having necrotizing fasciitis. He was admitted to a hospital in Thailand on that day.

He was admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital on 18 May 2012 for further treatment on his unhealed wound. He then tested positive for the infection. He is now stable.

[The bacterial genus is not elaborated in the posting but is likely to be _Escherichia coli_ or klebsiella. It is also not at all clear if the NDM-1 containing organism was any more than a superficial contaminant of the necrotizing fasciitis which had been diagnosed a full month before. - Mod.LL
