After 2 UCSB [University of California Santa Barbara] students were diagnosed with meningococcal disease, a bacterial infection that causes the highly contagious illnesses meningitis and meningococcemia, the Santa Barbara Department of Public Health is now putting the local community on high alert.

Meningococcal disease is transmitted through contact with another individual's respiratory and throat secretions, such as through activities like kissing and even just living in close quarters. Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, rash, increased sensitivity to light, confusion, body aches, joint pain, nausea and vomiting, and the disease can even prove life-threatening. Meningitis is an inflammation of protective membranes located on the brain and spinal cord, while meningococcemia is an infection of the blood.

A 1st-year student, who was the first to contract meningococcal disease and meningitis, was taken to the hospital last Tuesday [12 Nov 2013], according to Student Health executive director Mary Ferris. Currently at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, the student is in critical condition due to severe sepsis, or blood poisoning, according to updates from CaringBridge.org, a non-profit organization that offers updates on the condition of hospital patients. According to the site, the student's blood is thin, his circulation is poor, and he may need to be put on dialysis to improve his kidney function.

"I just want to express our extreme sympathy for the family and for students that... have this illness," Ferris said. "We really hope they recover. They're both being well-cared for in the hospital."

According to Ferris, the diagnosis of a 2nd student sparked widespread concern from students and their parents, especially in light of the UCSB student's critical condition and a recent meningitis outbreak at Princeton University [New Jersey].

"[At UCSB] it's not an outbreak...but it is significant just because it is such a bad disease," Ferris said. "It does happen every couple years that we'll get one case, and there's a lot more attention to it because of the national interest about meningitis too."

A 1st year pre-biology major said she is concerned students living in residence halls have a greater chance of contracting the disease. "We live in such close quarters so we are constantly in contact with everyone," she said. "Most people end up just sharing a water bottle or whatever, and so it's really easy to spread." However, a 3rd-year resident assistant for Santa Catalina [UCSB's largest residence hall] said he does not think students living in residence halls are at increased risk for contracting the disease, because other students come in contact with each other just as much [as] freshmen in the dorms do. "I don't really think the residence halls would hurt your chances in any way," he said. "I think that it's as dangerous as just being in school here because the close quarters are equal to that of just being in classes with people."

According to Ferris, the infection is not unique to the residence halls, as locations where the disease usually surface are "common" places with a great density of people. "Whenever people are living in close conditions, there's more chance of a spread of this infection," Ferris said, "So that would be true if you were an army recruit, or [if] you went to a convention where there were a lot of people in the same room for a long time."

Frequent handwashing and overall good hygiene can help to prevent the spread of the disease, as well as abstaining from sharing water bottles, drinking glasses, eating utensils, and cosmetics, according to Ferris. She also said meningitis occurs most frequently amongst young freshmen or college students because the bacterium attacks young, healthy people.

"The fact that you're a young healthy person living in close quarters with everyone else increases your risk," Ferris said, "But you can really decrease that risk by getting that meningitis shot."

Student Health will offer a meningitis vaccine on a walk-in basis on Tuesdays from 9 to 11 a.m. and Fridays from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. The UCEN [University Center] will also offer shots next Tuesday [26 Nov 2013] from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The vaccination is recommended for all students ages 16 and up.

A 3rd case of meningococcal disease -- which causes the highly contagious and deadly illness meningitis -- at UCSB has been identified by Santa Barbara public health officials.

While Student Health officials say the newest case has been identified, confirmation of meningitis in this 3rd case is still "pending". 2 UCSB students were diagnosed with the illness in the past week, with one student in critical condition. Both of these cases have the type B [serogroup] of the disease, which is "not included in the vaccine," according to Student Health's website.

Student Health director Mary Ferris said there has been no quarantine of the disease and no restrictions have been placed on normal campus activity.

"All close contacts of the meningitis cases are being offered treatment, and Public Health has made no recommendation to cancel any activities or scheduled events on campus," Ferris said.

Public Health and UCSB officials will host a press conference to discuss preventative measures being taken to halt spread of disease. The conference will take place at 11 a.m. on Thursday [21 Nov 2013] at the County Administration Building, in the Board of Supervisors Conference Room.

A bacterial meningitis outbreak has sickened 3 students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, health officials said on Thursday [21 Nov 2013].

Over 300 students who had close contact with the ill students were given antibiotics, said Charity Thoman, deputy health officer at the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department.

The latest case involved a female student who was diagnosed with meningococcal disease earlier this week. Last week [week of 12 Nov 2013], 2 male students fell ill. None of the cases have been fatal.

"We've been on high alert," said Mary Ferris, executive director of student health services.

Meningitis can be spread through kissing, coughing, or prolonged contact. Symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting.

Public health and school officials urged people on campus to watch out for signs of meningitis and to practice good hygiene such as covering their mouths when coughing.

While the Santa Barbara cases involved the type B meningococcal bacteria -- the same type that sickened 7 people at Princeton University in New Jersey -- health officials said there's no link between the outbreaks.

Princeton earlier this week decided to make available a meningitis vaccine that hasn't been approved in the US. Doses of the vaccine for the type B meningococcal bacteria will be available next month [December 2013] for students who live in dorms.

Princeton University will offer students, pending federal approval, a meningitis vaccine not currently available in the US, after a 7th case was reported this year [2013] on the Ivy League campus. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is preparing to recommend that all undergraduate students, as well as graduate students living in dormitories, get the vaccine, the Princeton, New Jersey-based college said yesterday [18 Nov 2913] in a statement. Costs would be covered for students who receive the vaccine, it said.

By early May [2013], 3 Princeton University students were diagnosed with meningitis, spread through kissing, sharing drinking glasses, and other forms of close contact.

"[Princeton] University is prepared to accept these recommendations and make arrangements to provide access to this vaccine as soon as possible," Princeton said. All 7 cases -- 6 students and one campus visitor -- developed infections with meningococcus [serogroup] B. Because the strain of the bacteria isn't covered by vaccines available in the US, federal health officials approved importation of the immunization Bexsero, made by Novartis AG. Princeton expects to make the 1st of 2 doses of the vaccine available in early December [2013]. The 2nd dose would come in February [2014], according to the statement. 2 doses are required for maximum protection, the school said.

Not everyone gets sick from the bacteria, which may be carried by as much as 10 per cent of the Princeton population, said Andrin Oswald, head of Novartis vaccines and diagnostics, in a phone interview from Basel, Switzerland. The number of cases is occurring in about 1 out of 1000 students there. That's significantly higher than most other vaccine-preventable diseases, and 100 times the 1 to 2 in 100 000 seen with other forms of meningitis, he said.

The university has been working with CDC and the New Jersey Department of Health since the 1st case was reported in March [2013, after spring break]. The CDC requested and received permission last week [week of 12 Nov 2013] from the Food and Drug Administration to bring in the vaccine, Barbara Reynolds, a CDC spokeswoman, said [16 Nov 2013] in a telephone interview.

The outer coating of the [serogroup B] bacterium is similar to something found naturally in the body, making it harder to attack, Oswald at Novartis said. Bexsero, the 1st vaccine against the strain, is based on a protein found on the surface of about 80 per cent of the circulating B strains, including the one found in Princeton, Oswald said. Meningococcus B accounts for 40 per cent of cases in the US and as much as 80 per cent in Australia and parts of Europe. Bexsero was cleared for sale in Europe in January [2013] and in Australia in August [2013]. The vaccine hasn't been available in the US because drug companies and regulators couldn't agree on how to measure the efficacy of the injection, Oswald said. "In many geographies [serogroup] B has become the dominant strain because we could vaccinate against the other types of meningitis," Oswald said.

To obtain the immunization for Princeton, CDC asked the FDA to grant the vaccine investigational new drug status, typically used to begin a clinical trial, Oswald said. CDC would need to oversee the use of the immunization since the company doesn't have an actual study under way, he said.

By early May [2013], 3 [Princeton] students had been diagnosed. The most recent patient developed symptoms 8 months later on 8 Nov 2013.

Novartis, Sanofi, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc all make shots available in Europe and the US that protect against 4 of the 5 major [serogroups] of the disease, not including the B [serogroup]. Pfizer Inc, the New York-based drugmaker, has a vaccine for meningitis B that has begun the final stage of development.

[The 1st 3 news reports above describe another outbreak of meningococcal meningitis serogroup B that is occurring at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus. Please see the recent ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (03): (NJ) college, sg. B, new vaccine 20131117.

UCSB is a public research university that is part of the University of California system located 8 miles (13 km) from Santa Barbara and 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Los Angeles, with almost 19 000 undergraduates (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara#Housing). There are 8 residence halls, 5 located on the east side of the main campus, 2 on the west side of the main campus, and 1 located near the entrance to the west campus. There is in addition private housing, as well as housing in sorority and fraternity houses. Where the 3 ill UCSB students lived or socialized is not stated in the news reports above.

An outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per 100 000 population, which is about 10 times greater than the normal occurrence (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

Chemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts whose risk for acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Effective antibiotic regimens for adults include: rifampin 600 mg orally twice daily for 2 days; ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally as a single dose; and ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular injection.

Close contacts of patients are household members, day care center contacts, and persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to people who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _Neisseria meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

In addition, the new reports above say that University of California Santa Barbara students are being encouraged to be vaccinated against this disease, but does not say which type of meningococcal vaccine is being offered. A quadrivalent serogroup A, C, Y, and W-135 conjugate meningococcal vaccine is not effective against _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B, only the Bexsero serogroup B meningococcal vaccine would be expected to be effective in the face of a serogroup B outbreak. Princeton University, which is also experiencing a serogroup B outbreak, is expected to use the Bexsero vaccine that is not currently available in the US. Whether the UCSB and Princeton University outbreaks are related to each other could be resolved if the genotypes of the strains of _N. meningitidis_ from the 2 outbreaks were compared.
