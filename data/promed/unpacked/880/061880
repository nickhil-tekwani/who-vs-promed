A total of 7 people are infected with a disease thought to be anthrax in a village in Chaung U Township, Sagaing Region, according to health officials.

Dr San Nu Htike from a public hospital in Thonepanhla Village said several cows died of the disease on 4 Sep [2016], and 7 people who handled the deceased cows are believed to be infected with the disease. "One seriously infected patient was transferred to Monywa General Hospital. No casualties have been reported. Some of those suffering from the disease are under intensive care in village. The disease is suspected to be anthrax. It has yet to be identified," said the doctor.

"Only those who handled the deceased cows got sick. Not everyone who ate the meat got sick," said A.Y., one of the people infected by the disease. "The infected cows were not vaccinated," said the village administrator.

In another similar incident, 8 people from 2 villages in Monywa District were infected with anthrax after eating the meat of a deceased cow on 27 Aug [2016]. They were hospitalised at Monywa General Hospital, and one of them died later.
