Citrus pest in Louisiana and Tijuana, Mexico - USDA
---------------------------------------------------
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed on Friday [27 Jun
2008] that the feared citrus greening disease has been found in the
US state of Louisiana, while the dangerous plant-feeding pest that
spreads the disease has been found in Mexico near the California
border.

An official at USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) said citrus greening had been reported in Louisiana this
month [June 2008]. The Asian citrus psyllid, the pest that spreads
citrus greening, also had been found in Tijuana [Baja California,
Mexico] near the California border, but not in California, she said.

The Asian citrus psyllid was [unintentionally] introduced to the USA
from Asia. Greening causes fruit from infected trees to become
unmarketable. Psyllids, which are sometimes called jumping plantlice,
also feed on plants like pears, potatoes, and tomatoes, according to
the University of California-Davis.

[Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, is caused in the Americas
by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_
Liberibacter asiaticus, which occurs throughout much of Asia and in
parts of the Americas. Its vector is the Asian citrus psyllid
(_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often spread by grafting and
possibly seed transmission. HLB is one of the most damaging diseases
of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. For more information on
HLB see links and previous posts listed below.

Asian citrus psyllids were discovered in Florida in 1998 and _Ca. L.
asiaticus_ was found there in 2005. In September 2001, the Asian
citrus psyllid was found in Texas, and only recently, on 6 Jun 2008,
it was reported in Louisiana (see link below). The presence of the
pathogen-specific vector in Mexico poses a severely increased risk of
introduction of the disease to that country.
