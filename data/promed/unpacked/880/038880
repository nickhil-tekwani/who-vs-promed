RABIES, CANINE - SWISS-FRENCH BORDER: OIE, CORRECTION

[The following is a correction to Mod.PC's remarks concerning the
number of cases of canine rabies in Switzerland in the ProMED-mail post
"Rabies, canine - Swiss-French border: OIE"]

According to the guiding principles for post-vaccination surveillance
of wildlife rabies in Europe defined by WHO/OIE, Switzerland has
officially been free of terrestrial rabies since early 1999. The
last indigenous case -- linked to fox rabies -- was diagnosed in a
dog in December 1996. In 1997 we diagnosed rabies in a dog imported
from Morocco.

Since then, no rabies cases have been diagnosed in Switzerland, apart
from a case in a bat (European Bat Rabies), which was detected in
September 2002. This was only the third rabies case diagnosed in a
bat in Switzerland since the emergence of bat rabies in Europe in the
1980s.

The number of rabies cases in dogs did not jump to 14 in 2001 as
suggested by the moderator.

The most likely origin of [the current] case is illegal import from a region
with canine rabies, as suggested in the previous post. Characterization of
the rabies virus strain is in progress.

[ProMED regrets the error, but the number for 2001 was copied from the RABNET
database at <http://globalatlas.who.int/GlobalAtlas/DataQuery/viewData.asp>
which gives the following figures:

Source
Infectious Diseases -> Rabies -> 3. Animal rabies -> a. Total number of dog
cases -> Dogs rabies positive
(Periodicity: Year, Applied Time Period: from 1991 to 2001)
1. Switzerland Total n/a 1991 0
2. Switzerland Total n/a 1992 0
3. Switzerland Total n/a 1993 1
4. Switzerland Total n/a 1994 2
5. Switzerland Total n/a 1996 1
6. Switzerland Total n/a 1997 1
7. Switzerland Total n/a 1998 0
8. Switzerland Total n/a 1999 0
9. Switzerland Total n/a 2000 0
10. Switzerland Total n/a 2001 14
Note that data for 1995 is missing. We expect this database will soon be
corrected. - Mod.JW]

Detailed and comprehensive information on the occurrence of a large
number of diseases [in Switzerland, including rabies] can be gathered from
the Swiss animal disease monitoring system. The internet address of the

[The database referenced by Dr Schwermer shows 2 canine cases in 1997 -- as
opposed to only one reported by Dr Zanoni & shown in RABNET -- one bat case
in 2002, and nothing in between. Perhaps that database will be corrected
also - Mod.JW]
