Emergency report: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Mauritania
---------------------------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 10 March 2003 from Dr Mokhtar Fall,
deputy director, Department of Animal Production and Agriculture, Ministry
of Rural Development and Environment, Nouakchott: report date: 10 March 2003.
One outbreak in Nouakchott, first infection estimated to have occurred on 6
Feb 2003. Animal health incident first detected 18 Feb 2003. Laboratory
diagnosed.
To date the epidemic mostly affects human beings (30 people have been
diagnosed with the disease, 6 of whom have died, and 235 people are
considered at risk). With respect to animals, the whole animal population
of Nouakchott is under suspicion, but only one animal case has been
confirmed (presence of IgG in serum from one goat).
Diagnosis made at the Pasteur Institute, Dakar, Senegal, using serology
(Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, IgG, IgM); reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); virus isolation.
Epidemiology:
Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown.
Mode of spread: ticks. Most of the 30 persons affected were infected
following contact with sick people (secretions, etc.).
Other epidemiological details: contact with domestic animals was suspected
as the source of infection for the first human victim. Samples (whole
blood, ticks) from the animals reared on the victim's plot were submitted
for testing. Results showed evidence of IgG in one goat. Other samples
(whole blood, ticks) have been taken from the wilaya of Brakna (250-300 km
to the southwest of Nouakchott) -- the area from which the animals were
introduced onto the plot before the Aid-El-Kebir feast (mutton festival)
are thought to have come -- as well as from Nouakchott's abattoir and
cattle market.
Control measures:
Public health measures: disinfection, confinement, etc.
Animal health measures:
- supervision of slaughter;
- control of ticks;
- protection of populations at high risk of exposure (farmers, abattoir
workers, etc.);
- epidemiological surveillance.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever, the
agent of which belongs to the Nairovirus group. It is a zoonotic disease
but does not appear on either the OIE List A or B groups of diseases. CCHF
is severe but uncommon in humans with a 30 per cent case fatality rate. In
animals, CCHF is a more common but milder disease unless tick exposure
occurs late in life. Agricultural, slaughterhouse and livestock workers are
at increased risk of the disease. Reservoirs include rodents, hares, birds
and domestic animals. Domestic animal hosts, commonly ruminants, suffer
only a transient viremia. Birds are resistant but Ostriches can show a high
prevalence of infection. Most infections in humans are due to exposure to
ticks of the _Hyalomma spp._ but the disease can be transmitted by contact
with infected animal blood or tissues. The reservior for CCHF is widely
distributed ranging from Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
