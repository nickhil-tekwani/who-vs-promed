Introduction into Japan of pathogenic Yersinia through imported pork, beef
and fowl
Yersinia was isolated from imported raw meat and fowl products by HeLa
cell treatment and conventional KOH-treatment, to obtain information on
the origin of pathogenic Yersinia in Japan.
Forty-one strains of _Yersinia enterocolitica_ and one strain of _Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis_, serotype 4b were isolated from 38 (3.0%) of 1278 samples
of pork, two (0.3%) of 612 samples of beef and two (0.3%) of 615 samples of
chicken.
_Y. enterocolitica_ isolates belonged to B:4/O:3 (biotype/serotype, 15
strains), B:3/O:3 (two strains) and B:3 variant/O:3 (17 strains) and
B:3/O:5.27 (seven strains).
The B:4/O:3 which is globally prevalent among humans and animals was isolated
from pork samples from Denmark and the US and from beef samples from
Australia, B:3/O:3 from pork samples from Canada, the B:3 variant/O:3 from
pork samples from Taiwan and from chicken samples from Thailand,
B:3/O:5.27 from pork samples from the US and Taiwan and _Y.
pseudotuberculosis_, serotype 4b from pork samples from Canada.
These findings suggest that pathogenic _Y. enterocolitica_ strains can be
introduced into Japan by the import of pork from pig producing countries.
The HeLa cell treatment was found to be superior to the conventional method.
