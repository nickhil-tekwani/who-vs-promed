Two patients have tested positive for fascioliasis at Shere-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Soura, doctors said on Tuesday [12 Dec 2017].

The 1st case, a young male patient, is from Sunderwani Pakherpora area of Budgam and was referred to the gastroenterology unit of SKIMS as a liver cancer patient. The patient was treated endoscopically (ERCP) by removing hundreds of live liver flukes from the bile duct.

Fascioliasis is a parasitic worm infection caused by 2 species of parasitic flatworms, _Fasciola hepatica_ and _Fasciola gigantica_, which affect the liver.

The 2nd patient is a 20-year-old girl from Handwara who was admitted to the hospital in March last year [2016] in the department of surgery, with multiple abscesses in the liver. Fascioliasis disease affected the girl after a lot of cattle died in their village and 2 in their home in the past.

The doctors administered [triclabendazole] (a medication used to treat liver flukes) from a veterinary department to treat them. "Fascioliasis is very rampant among cattle and sheep. Humans get accidentally infected by ingestion of contaminated water and water grown vegetables," said the doctor.

With the ingestion of contaminated food items, the larval stage of the parasite penetrates the duodenal wall and then reaches the liver by passing through the peritoneal cavity.

"Fascioliasis has 2 phases. The liver phase occurs when the parasite passes through the liver; during this phase, the patient can have abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, and nausea. The liver tissue reacts to this larval stage of the parasite by an intense inflammatory reaction, which can look like multiple liver abscesses on ultrasound/CT-Scan/MRI," said Dr Yattoo.

The 2nd phase is the bile duct phase. In this phase, the parasite can remain silent for years.

He said that the government should provide education to the people and appeal to them not to ingest contaminated water, mainly from marshy land. "We advise the public to avoid eating raw vegetables grown in the water, like nadru (lotus stick), pumbash (lotus) and chestnuts. There might be other vegetables also that are not yet known," he said.

The disease did not exist here previously. This is the 1st time this disease has been discovered. Triclobedazole is effective for treating it, and hospitalization may be required. The disease is a plant-borne trematode zoonosis and is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD).

[Infection with _Fasciola hepatica_, fasciolisis, is a zoonotic infection with reservoirs in ruminants such as cattle and sheep, which excrete the eggs. It is widely distributed and probably found in all countries except the arctic.

The eggs hatch in fresh water into ciliated miracidia, which penetrate certain species of snails. When developed in the snails, large numbers of cercaria are released, which encyst as metacercariae on the leaves of freshwater plants. Thus, the risk factor of infection is consumption of freshwater plants, for instance watercress, and the patients described here must be assumed to have been infected by the ingestion of some kind of fresh water plants.
