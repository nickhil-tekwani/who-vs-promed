Experts search for source of _E. coli_ outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
A 72 year old woman who has recovered from her illness is being counted as
the 12th confirmed case of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 phage type (PT) 32
infection tracing an unexplained pattern across Southern Ontario. The
London woman was the second person in the Middlesex-London area found to
have been infected recently. The others live in Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto,
York Region, Simcoe County, and Windsor. None has died.
Health officials said there is little to suggest [that the infections were
caused by contaminated tap water, the source of an outbreak that killed at
least 7 people and affected about 2300 others at Walkerton, Ontario, last
year. The Walkerton outbreak was caused by _E. coli_ O157:H7 PT14.
Other possible sources of infection are contaminated food and drink,
including hamburger, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and unpasteurized milk or
apple cider. The limited number of cases and their wide geographic spread
make such sources seem more likely in the latest outbreak, officials said.
"While 12 cases is cause for concern and investigation, if it were a
waterborne outbreak you would expect to see many more cases," said Graham
Pollett, Middlesex-London medical officer of health.
There are more than 80 types of _E. coli_ O157:H7. Type 32 is no more or
less dangerous than type 14, but the fact that specific types can be
identified helps in the search for the source. Dan Strasbourg,
media-relations coordinator for the provincial Health Ministry, said [that
Ontario usually records about 400 cases of all types of O157:H7 infection a
year, of which only 12 or 13 typically are type 32. "Just given the fact
that we've seen 12 cases in the last few weeks indicates to us that there's
definite reason to investigate," he said.
