'94 outbreak in Surat wasn't plague!
------------------------------------------------
The Surat plague controversy has been revived by a former official of the
World Health
Organisation (WHO) who says the disease that killed 47 people in the city of
Surat in October 1994, and caused economic losses worth $ 600 million to the
panicked
nation, was not plague.
Satnam Singh, a former programme director in the WHO Regional Office in New
Delhi, said the same disease which occurred in 1994 continues to occur
sporadically even now in Surat following periodical flooding of the Tapti
river, one piece of evidence disproving the plague theory.
But the strongest evidence came from the prestigious American Public Health
Association which has withdrawn the reference to Surat plague from its
latest report, he says. The association, in the 16th edition of its "Manual
on Control of Communicable Diseases'' had mentioned that "an outbreak of
primary pneunonic plague occurred in the city of Surat'' in 1994. But
reference to the outbreak was
deleted in the 17th edition, according to Singh, who, after having worked
with WHO for 21 years, is now the director of the Regional Institute of
Public Health in Chandigarh.
Singh also refers to a paper published in the US Journal of Public Health
Policy in 1997 which concludes that the Surat disease was not plague. This
paper was authored by leading Indian scientists N S Deodhar, a former
director of All-India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health in Calcutta, V
J Yemule, director of the Haffikine Institute in Mumbai and Kalyan Banerjee,
a former director of the National Institute of Virology in Pune.
Vulimiri Ramalingaswami, chairman of the Indian committee that investigated
the disease, however, says this paper is not factually correct and that a
rejoinder is being sent to that journal for publication.
According to Singh, there were two more scientific reports disclaiming the
plague theory. One of them, by an expert committee appointed by the Gujarat
government in 1995 under N R Mehta, retired professor of community medicine
in Surat Medical College, found the "majority of evidence does not support
the initial suspected diagnosis of pneumonic plague''. Singh, who believes
the Surat disease was misdiagnosed as plague, points out that the All-India
18th conference of the Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists
declared in Pune on November 12, 1994, that "there is not even a single
convincing evidence of plague either in Surat or Beed''.
The WHO international team report concluded that "no evidence was found to
suggest transmission of _Y. pestis_ (the plague germ) in any major urban
population other than
in the city of Surat''.

[India officially reported confirmed cases of plague from Surat & other
cities to WHO in 1994, & these official reports were published by the CDC in
their Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR) & posted on ProMED-mail --
see refs. above. However, a subsequent WHO investigation, & IndiaÂ´s own
investigation chaired by Dr Ramalingaswami, found no evidence that the
plague bacillus had been isolated from human cases anywhere in India, only
from rats in the city of Surat.
Therefore the quote attributed to Dr Satnam Singh is not quite correct --
some of the sporadic human cases still occurring in Surat could well be
plague, since it cannot have been exterminated from the rat population. It
is disappointing that, 5 years after that scare, India apparently still does
not have the capability to diagnose plague in the laboratory - Mod.JW
