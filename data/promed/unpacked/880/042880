The WHO has announced that a 6-month cholera epidemic in Angola has claimed
2167 lives from the 52 700 cases registered and has now reached all of the
country's 18 provinces. In its latest update on the outbreak, the WHO said
Fri, 18 Aug 2006, 3 cholera deaths had occurred in the past 24 hours from
41 new cases recorded.
The highest death toll since cholera first erupted Feb 2006 in the Luanda
slums has been in the coastal province of Benguela with 523 fatalities,
followed by Luanda (305), Kwanza Sul (259), Lunda Norte (245) and Malange
(235).
This year's outbreak of the water-borne disease in Angola has been
acknowledged by international relief organizations to be the country's
worst since independence over 3 decades ago.

A cholera outbreak has killed at least 143 people in Guinea so far in 2006
but the death rate has slowed since Jun 2006, a UN report showed on Sun, 20
Aug 2006. An outbreak in 2005 killed more than 800 people across several
countries in the region, and has continued in southern Guinea.
"The epidemic which has hit the country since Apr 2005 remains of concern.
From Jan to Jul 2006, the Public Health Ministry has notified 1623 cases
of whom 143 died," the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs said in a report.
The death toll was a significant increase on the 60 reported dead by late
Apr 2006, although the mortality rate has slowed, dropping to 5 deaths out
of 134 [3.7 percent - Mod.LL] cases in Jul 2006 from 9 dead out of 412
[2.2 percent - Mod.LL] in Jun 2006, it said.
The outbreak has hit the southern town of Gueckedou worst.

A cholera outbreak in Yumbe district has claimed 3 and left 11 admitted in
the district main hospital.
The District Health Inspector, Mr Collins Angunda, on Wed, 16 Aug 2006,
said the epidemic was rampant in Apo, Kuru and Drajini sub-counties.
Angunda was speaking during an emergency meeting at the office of the chief
administrative officer.
He said 2 of the victims; a man and a 9-year-old girl were from Apo
subcounty while another woman died in Kuru subcounty. Angunda said 3 of
the patients were in a stable condition while the other 8 were doing badly.
Angunda said the district taskforce was investigating the outbreak of the
epidemic to find ways of combating it. He said their key case was a woman
who was suspected to have runaway from Oli Health Center in Arua, where she
had been earlier admitted on suspicion that she had contracted the disease.
The woman reportedly sneaked from the hospital and died at her home in
Jabala village.
