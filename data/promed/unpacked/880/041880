The emerging diseases community must learn to think more of leptospirosis.
If we recall most "mysterious hemorrhagic diseases" of recent, ended up
being leptospirosis. This is an extremely common and severe disease, with
almost protean manifestations. GIDEON calls attention to a large number of
possible diagnoses, including American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease), but
seems incapable [of including leptospirosis. Chagas' disease has yet to
present
itself as an acute hemorrhagic disease; febrile yes, but not hemorrhagic.
When cases like these in Panama occur, it is wise to remember a not too
distant outbreak in Nicaragua.
Time will tell.

[Luiz's comments are very much on target re: the importance of considering
leptospirosis high up on the differential diagnosis for hemorrhagic disease
outbreaks especially in the Americas (see prior ProMed-mail postings listed
above). The blame of exclusion of leptospirosis was this moderator's
omission as it was among the list of 69 possible diagnoses given by GIDEON.
Similarly the blame of inclusion of Chagas' disease without questioning
its appearance on the GIDEON list was also this moderator's error.
Further support for this error is the comment sent by Steve Berger of GIDEON
"if you add Exposure - Case cluster (there were 2 cases) and assume that
'hemorrhagic" refers to skin-hemorrhagic, only a few diagnoses pop up -
with leptospirosis a strong number 1."
Hence one of this moderator's New Year's resolutions is to spend more time
'playing' with GIDEON before jumping to conclusions and presenting them as
GIDEON-errors! Mea culpa. - Mod.MPP
