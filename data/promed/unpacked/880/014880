PSEUDO COW POX: RFI
===================
[Normally we are very reluctant to post requests such as this from folk with
access to modern library facilities. However, on checking our library
computer I found that for the period 1973 to the present there were only
three entries and the latest was in 1985. Please contact Britta Nylin
directly. MHJ]
