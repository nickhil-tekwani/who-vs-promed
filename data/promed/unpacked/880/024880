The East Singhbhum district health office has issued a Japanese encephalitis and swine flu alert in the city and its outskirts after confirmation of one Japanese encephalitis (JE) case and 2 of swine flu.

The health official said that, as per protocol of the health department, they have issued a health alert and sent letters to all 30 private and government hospitals in the city and its outskirts to monitor patients with encephalitis symptoms and inform for sample collection within 24 hours in the event of any fresh case.

Japanese encephalitis is caused by flavivirus, carried by the _Culex _mosquito, and affects the membranes around the brain. Most Japanese encephalitis virus infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately one in 200 infections is characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and death.

"The _Culex_ thrives in stagnant [fresh water], and people must not allow the same at home or outside. Puddles and clogged drains must be reported for quick action. We will be searching for accumulation of water in abandoned containers and air coolers and destroying the abandoned containers. Simultaneously, spraying of anti-larvicides would also be held at the identified localities from tomorrow," said the official.

JE, which infects animals and humans, is on the rise in the city. In the last 48 hours, several cases of JE have come to light, forcing the health officials here to remain vigilant and pursue its cleaning drive [?] and war-footing in the worst malaria-affected areas.

According to the reports, 3 JE cases have come to light, but health officials are not ready to confirm as yet. "We are waiting for the records to reach civil surgeon's office," said an official when asked about the casualty toll.

[The Japanese encephalitis (JE) case count in the above report is somewhat confusing. There is one confirmed case and "several" [3?] JE cases in the last 48 hours. It is not clear if these several cases are confirmed or just suspected.

Jharkhand state is located in northeastern India and is part of a broad geographic area where JE virus is endemic and in which cases occur annually during the virus transmission season. JE cases have already been reported this year (2022) in the neighboring state of Bihar. Vector mosquito control is difficult, expensive, and often ineffective. There is no mention of plans to carry out a JE-vaccination effort to avoid cases. - Mod.TY
