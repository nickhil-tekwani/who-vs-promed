In northern Zambia, brown streak and termite attacks have hit more than 20 000 hectares [about 49 400 acres] of cassava crops. The plantings are grossly affected by the brown streak and the termites cause tubers to rot. The Zambia Agriculture Research Institute confirms that more than 6 districts in the country have been affected. Brown streak was reported to have affected only some farmers earlier on.

[Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD; also called root rot) can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_ (UCBSV; both genus _Ipomovirus_). Coinfections of both viruses in the same plant also exist (ProMED post 20190214.6315604), but possible synergism or other interactions in the host still need to be clarified. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis; stem necrosis; and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Crop losses of 20 to 80%, depending on crop variety, have been reported.

The viruses are transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ (a serious crop pest in its own right) and are spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, as well as vector control. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements. Identification of alternative hosts from unrelated plant families for CBSV and UCBSV (ProMED post 20181223.6221346 and see link below) indicate that reservoir hosts may have an impact on the epidemiology of CBSD.

CBSD is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa where cassava is a major food crop. Recent outbreaks appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED post 20130508.1698543). CBSD poses a particular risk to new crop varieties developed with resistance to cassava mosaic disease (CMD; begomovirus species, spread like CBS; see previous ProMED posts in the archives). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD-resistant cultivars (ProMED posts 20100525.1735, 20120706.1191742). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED posts 20110829.2643, 20090709.2463).

In Zambia, a major outbreak of CBSD was reported in 2018 (ProMED post 20180920.6042364), but it is not clear if that was the first occurrence in the country. A CBSD alert was issued in the country recently [ProMED post 20220725.8704650]. Different species of the termites mentioned above can damage cassava stems and roots and would also be likely to spread any soil borne diseases in the fields, such as fungal root rots. However, since CBS already causes root rot symptoms, it is not clear whether the root rot reported above really does represent a different pathogen issue.
