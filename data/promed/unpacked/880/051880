The mission of the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and
Plantain (INIBAP) in Montpellier, France is to increase the productivity
and stability of banana and plantain grown on small holdings for domestic
consumption and for local export markets.
INIBAP has four specific objectives:
1. to organize and coordinate a global research effort on banana and
plantain, aimed at the development, evaluation and dissemination of
improved cultivars and at the conservation and use of _Musa_ diversity;
2. to promote and strengthen regional efforts to address regional-specific
problems and to assist national programmes within the regions to contribute
towards, and benefit from, the global research effort;
3. to strengthen the ability of national agricultural research systems to
conduct research on bananas and plantains; and
4. to coordinate, facilitate and support the production, collection and
exchange of information and documentation related to banana and plantain.
INIBAP publishes MUSARAMA: The International Bibliographic Abstracts
Journal on Banana and Plantain [The disease section of MUSARAMA often
contains abstracts on the emergence of banana and plantain diseases - Mod
PKA]. INIBAP also publishes INFOMUSA: The International Magazine on Banana
and Plantain. French- language and Spanish-language editions of both
MUSARAMA and INFOMUSA are available. Subscriptions to both publications
are free. Address requests to:
