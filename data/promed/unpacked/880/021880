9 cases among New Rochelle hospital patients
--------------------------------------------
At least 9 people who were patients at Sound Shore Medical Center have
contracted Legionnaires' disease in the past month [Jun 2005], possibly from
contaminated water in a hospital cooling tower, the Westchester County Health
Department said Thu, 14 Jul 2005.
About half a dozen more patients with pneumonia are being checked for
the ailment, said department spokeswoman Mary Landrigan. No deaths
have been reported. 5 of the 9 cases have been discharged from Sound
Shore or other hospitals and have recovered or are recovering at
home, the department said. 4 patients remain hospitalized, all in
stable condition.
An initial test of water samples from an outdoor cooling tower at
Sound Shore indicated the presence of the legionella bacteria that
cause Legionnaires' disease, the department said. Follow-up testing
is underway to confirm the finding and the unit is being disinfected,
said Health Commissioner Joshua Lipsman.
Landrigan said of the 9 people, some were inpatients and some were
outpatients at Sound Shore before contracting the disease, a form of
pneumonia that is spread through the air but not person-to-person.
Most people exposed to the bacteria never get sick, but the elderly
and people with weak immune systems are more susceptible. The disease
is treatable with antibiotics. The victims' ages range from 34 to 83.
None were hospital staff, Landrigan said.
Lipsman said additional cases may be found "since the incubation
period for legionella can be up to a few weeks after exposure."
"Anyone who develops fever and respiratory symptoms should contact
his or her medical provider to be evaluated," Lipsman said.
