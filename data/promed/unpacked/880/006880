UNEXPLAINED DEATHS, CANINES - USA (MULTISTATE) (02)

Maybe I've just been out of private practice too long, and my texts and
references are too old, but what "flu" virus do dogs get?
It seemed odd to me that there was no commentary from a ProMED moderator
concerning the rather inflammatory and seemingly inaccurate news reports of
the greyhound deaths in the 14 May 2005 posting.
For example, this statement:
"Dr. Lisa Zerbel, a veterinarian in Massachusetts who is treating some of
the sick dogs, said she thinks the illnesses are caused by a new strain of
the influenza virus that is more virulent than the common one known as
"kennel cough." But other experts say it is too soon to pinpoint the cause."
Kennel cough is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella bronchiseptica_. I
don't know of any "common influenza virus" that causes respiratory disease
in dogs.
I couldn't find any references to this "outbreak" quoted in the 3rd article
in the listing:
"As vets battle the epidemic, state officials are now scrambling to nail
down exactly what is killing the dogs, and to prove whether it is linked to
the flu-like killer that has affected an estimated 10 000 dogs nationwide.
These include a few hundred domestic dogs as well."
Again, I was surprised that there was no input from any of the moderators.
What flu-like killer? What 10 000 dogs?
I checked my old Merck Vet Manual and my old Ettinger Vet Internal
Medicine. I couldn't find any reference to an influenza virus causing
disease in dogs. There's paramyxovirus, adenovirus, herpes virus and
parainfluenza. The referenced archived ProMED articles referred to possible
equine influenza virus that may have jumped species in May 2004, but there
was no follow-up report sent to ProMED, and the University of Florida
website has no follow-up info past last year [2004].
I tried to find info on this on the CDC website, since they were quoted,
but wasn't successful.
I went to the National Greyhound Association website and found this news
report: <http://www.networksplus.net/nga/ads/2005/may/17nga.htm>.

[Dr. Donoghue has correctly stated that I should have commented. It is easy
to forget that the reader may not be as aware as the moderator, and after
sorting through 21 articles and veterinary comments trying to find the
truth, a comment was in order and totally slipped my mind. Thank you Dr.
Donoghue for the opportunity to offer some clarifications.
There is research out of Florida that links the respiratory illness in
greyhounds to equine influenza. I think that it is because of the
association with equine influenza, and the likelihood of this virus in
dogs, that it has been called a flu virus.
Dr. Cyndi Crawford, from the University of Florida, has investigated the
Florida events and perhaps others. She has indicated that one of her
concerns are viruses that can cross the species barrier. Dr. Crawford has
previously stated that the flu virus is probably the same one currently
being seen in the Florida horse population and is similar to the strain
that was diagnosed in Wisconsin horses last year [2004]. Dr. Crawford has
not provided follow-up or reports to us, either.
It may be, as well, that these dogs may have an opportunistic virus as a
secondary invader to "kennel cough," from whence has derived the colloquial
name, "flu."
As to references regarding the 10 000 dogs that have died, I have no
references. Almost every state that has greyhound racing has reported a
high level of deaths at tracks. Whether the alleged 10 000 have died in a
calendar year, or in some fiscal year, I am uncertain. Most reporting on
this issue is raising levels of awareness and causing concern but has not
reached federal levels of reporting. I could not verify the 10 000 per se,
but tracks, veterinary clinics and many local VMA's are estimating quite
high. And perhaps, on a cumulative basis across the nation, it may be close
to that figure.
Your referenced site is perhaps an attempt to calm fears within the
Greyhound racing industry. Also, it is an informational piece regarding
"Kennel cough," and there is no date on the piece, so I have no idea
whether this was written with regard to the current outbreak or before or
after Dr. Crawford's news release.
Undoubtedly, there are more questions than answers regarding the
respiratory disease affecting Greyhounds. I am not sure this commentary
answers all the questions, and, may only create more. Perhaps if Dr. Cyndi
Crawford or Dr. Brad Fenwick would respond to us, we may be able to provide
additional, and more thorough, information. - Mod.TG]
