Six million people live at risk of contracting Chagas disease in
Venezuela. The insect that spreads the Chagas disease, the chipo
(_Rhodnius prolixus_) is the main mode of transmission, said Ana
Carvajal, of the Network of Scientific Societies in Venezuela.

Experts believe that 101 488 sq km [approx. 39 200 sq mi] of the
Venezuelan territory, including 198 municipalities, are a common
habitat for chipo. Although the insect can be found in the Capital
District and 22 Venezuelan states, the states with most diagnosed
cases are Trujillo, Lara, Portuguesa, and Barinas, due to their
geographical location at foot of hills, near coffee plantations, and
houses made of mud and straw that facilitate the survival of the vector.

However, in less than 2.5 years, the metropolitan area of Caracas has
been affected by 3 massive outbreaks. A fruit juice was the
contamination factor both in the municipality of Chacao and in the
town of Chichiriviche de la Costa.

The latest outbreak was recorded in La Pedrera, Antimano, southwest
Caracas. The causes behind the simultaneous onset of Chagas disease
in 15 people, mostly children and almost all still hospitalized, have
not been determined.

[Chagas is highly endemic in Venezuela and the 6 million estimated at
risk of infection in this posting amount to nearly 25 percent of the
population. The traditional risk factor for infection with
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ (Chagas) is poor housing. In recent years since
the outbreak in Santa Catarina in Brazil in 2005, foodborne
transmission has been increasingly recognized as an important route
of transmission. The largest outbreak of foodborne Chagas was
reported from Caracas in 2007. More details on the current outbreak
in La Pedrera, Antimano, southwest Caracas would be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
