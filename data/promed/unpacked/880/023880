Outbreak update - cholera in Yemen, 7 Dec 2018
-------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen has reported 12 289 suspected cases and 10 associated deaths during epidemiological week 45 [5-11 Nov 2018]. Of these, 13% are severe cases. The cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases from 1 Jan 2018 to 11 Nov 2018 is 280 198, with 372 associated deaths (CFR 0.13%). Children under 5 represent 32% of the total suspected cases, while 22 out of 23 governorates and 306 out of 333 districts in Yemen have been affected. To date, out of 9398 stool samples collected during 2018, 2899 cases have been confirmed as cholera positive by culture at central public health laboratories. This reporting period, 39 stool samples from Amanat Al Asimah, Taizz, and Sanaa tested positive.

From week 42 to week 44, the trend of weekly reported suspected cholera cases is decreasing by 14% at country level. However, there are 5 governorates (Al Mahwit, Ibb, Hajjah, Al Jawf, and Aden) reporting an increase in suspected cholera cases. This week, the governorates reporting the highest number of suspected cases are Sana'a (1835), Amran (1799), Ibb (1697), Dhamar (1737), and Amanat Al Asimah (1539).

WHO is assisting the Ministry along with Health and WASH cluster partners to contain the outbreak through technical and logistical support. These efforts include strengthening disease surveillance, supporting operations in diarrhoeal treatment centres and oral rehydration corners, training the health workforce on case management, deploying rapid response teams, and improving the availability of safe water and sanitation.

Cholera is endemic in Yemen. The country has experienced a surge in cholera cases since April 2017 due to ongoing conflict; destroyed infrastructure for health, water, and sanitation; and malnutrition, which has made the population more vulnerable to various epidemic-prone diseases, including cholera.

[As of 7 Nov 2018, 1 236 028 cases were reported, and with over 10 000 weekly cases over recent weeks, about 1 310 000 cases have occurred. The total number, not given in this report, was estimated by adding the first 2018 number to those for 2018.

In the 1st half of 2018, the rate of reported cases of cholera had slowed to less than 1000 per month (about 30 per day), but a dramatic upswing has once again occurred, with about 21 000 cases reported in the 1st 2 weeks of September 2018 (about 1500 per day), more than 13 000 in the 1st week of October 2018 (about 1900 cases/day), and about 14 500 in the 3rd week of October (about 2100 cases/day). This report documents about 12 300 cases in the 1st week of November 2018.

The low case fatality rate might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera.

A list of cases and deaths from May 2017 through the current report in this horrific epidemic fed by war and famine is shown below:
