Measles outbreak in West Cork
-----------------------------
The HSE [Health Service Executive] South are urging parents to ensure their children are protected against measles following an outbreak of the disease in West Cork. The outbreak is predominantly affecting teenagers who are not vaccinated. In the last four weeks 25 measles cases have been reported. This compares to no cases for the first three months of 2012. The majority of notified cases have been in the 12-18 years age group with the oldest case reported being 18 years of age. No deaths have occurred and none of the teenagers were vaccinated.

"Measles can be a serious and potentially fatal illness and children who have not been vaccinated are particularly at risk of measles during this time, said Dr Fiona Ryan, Specialist in Public Health Medicine, HSE South. "This outbreak is affecting children who are not vaccinated. Siblings of children with measles, if not vaccinated, are also recommended to stay out of school or child care during the incubation period (usually around 14 days, but may be up to 21 days), to ensure that they do not transmit infection to other children who may be too young for vaccination or be at increased risk due to other conditions."

Measles is a highly infectious disease, one in 20 will get pneumonia, one in 1000 will get encephalitis and 1-2 in 1000 will die from the disease. To be protected you either need to have received the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine or to have had the disease. There is no other way to prevent measles infection. Two doses of MMR [vaccine] are recommended; the first at 12 months of age, which is given by a GP, and the 2nd at 4-5 years of age, which is usually given in schools by the HSE School's Immunisation Team. Parents should check their child's immunisation records and determine if they have received 2 doses of MMR [vaccine]. If no records are available then the child should be brought to the GP for vaccination. All children/teenagers who have not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine can receive the vaccine from their GP free of charge. MMR [vaccine] given to a child within 72 hours of exposure to measles may prevent measles.

Fear measles outbreak may spread to younger children
----------------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed measles cases in the West Cork outbreak has risen to 31, with fears that younger children are now at risk. Public health experts said they expect the figure to rise over the coming days. Dr Fiona Ryan, a specialist in public health medicine in the HSE South, said concerns are mounting that the infectious disease, which in this outbreak is mainly affecting unvaccinated teenagers under 18, could spread to younger children.

Since the outbreak was confirmed on Monday with 25 cases, 2 new cases have been confirmed in primary school children. "We have historically had a problem in the West Cork area with a large number of parents declining vaccinations," Dr Ryan said. "You then end up with a large number of children who are not immune and if measles is introduced into such a community, it allows the spread."

According to figures from the last quarter of 2011, the national uptake for the MMR vaccine in children aged 24 months was 92% -- a figure that rises to 93% in the HSE South region. But in the West Cork area, the uptake at 24 months was just 86%. For the same time period, Kerry reported an MMR uptake of 92% for children at 24 months. Any area or community with low MMR coverage is at particular risk of measles outbreaks within that community. The last very large national measles outbreak occurred in 2000, when over 1600 cases were reported and there were 3 measles-associated deaths. The last large outbreak in West Cork occurred in 2009/10, when 68 cases were reported. In 2011, a total of 6 cases were reported in HSE South, with no cases reported in West Cork.

But Dr Ryan said that, since this outbreak was confirmed, there has been anecdotal evidence from GPs in West Cork that parents are now bringing their unvaccinated children to doctors’ surgeries to get the MMR vaccine. "We are liaising with public health nurses and GPs in West Cork," said Dr Ryan. "And we are taking calls from parents seeking information, and contacting the parents of the cases notified to us offering them advice on what they need to do. We are trying to do everything we can to control this outbreak. But the vaccine is there and it’s free. We would urge people to avail [themselves] of it." Most of the cases reported in this latest outbreak were among students who are attending Schull Community College. The HSE advised parents to withdraw unvaccinated children from the school -- especially those children in exam classes.

The highly contagious disease can lead to serious complications: pneumonia, otitis (a middle ear infection), diarrhoea, and neurological problems. In 2011, more than 30 000 people contracted measles in Europe.

European Football Championship in Ukraine enhances risk of measles outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The occasion of the 14th European Football Championship in Ukraine [and Poland], from 8 June and 1 July 2012, may be followed by a major outbreak of measles virus infection in he country. According to Andrei Volyanskaya, President of the Mechnikov Institute of Microbiology and Immunology of the Ukrainian Academy of Medicine, up to one million children in Ukraine, who have yet to be vaccinated, may become victims of the disease. The Director of the Laboratory of Immunobiology stated that for example the [current] measles outbreak among children in Lviv has almost run its course and is now likely to pass to the cities of Kiev, Kharkov and Donetsk. At present outbreaks of measles are occurring in Great Britain and in the view of experts English football fans are likely to carry the infection to the Ukraine and initiate outbreaks of the disease. According to immunologists Ukraine will be at risk of outbreaks of measles at intervals of 5-6 years while 95% of the population remains unvaccinated.

[Measles vaccination was discontinued in 2008 on account of problems with the vaccine [imported from India -- see ProMED archive 20110322.0898] and has yet to be resumed. Thus a large segment of the national population remains susceptible to measles virus infection.

Previous warnings have concentrated on the risk of unvaccinated visiting football supporters contracting measles virus infection in Ukraine, and have ignored the greater hazard on an influx of foreigners for the local population.

Measles outbreak kills 12 children in Pakistan
----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles in part of Pakistan's lawless tribal northwest has killed 12 children in 3 weeks and is spreading due to a shortage of medicines, doctors said Monday [14 May 2012]. Doctor Mohammad Ali Shah, chief of the main hospital in Miranshah, the biggest town in North Waziristan, told Agence France Presse that military operations, power cuts and curfews meant there was a shortage of medicines [vaccine].

The restive and impoverished district bordering Afghanistan is Pakistan's most notorious Taliban and Al-Qaida stronghold, and hit frequently by U.S. drone strikes targeting Islamist militants. "For the past 3 weeks we are daily receiving 5-10 children suffering from measles," Shah said, adding that he would normally see only one or 2 deaths from the disease in a year. "We do not have proper storage for measles [vaccine] because of long power outages and curfews, and most of our stock expires due to these reasons." He urged the government to send mobile vaccination teams to the area and warned of a possible typhoid outbreak if action was not taken promptly. "Inoculation teams have not visited the area for a long time and that is the reason for the spread of such diseases," he said.

Measles is highly contagious and spread by a virus that is easily prevented by proper immunization but can be fatal. It caused nearly 140 000 deaths worldwide in 2010, according to the World Health Organization -- 95 percent in low income countries with poor health infrastructure. Another doctor, Mohammad Sadiq, said 12 children and a man had died from measles, and that there were up to 70 confirmed cases in hospital. Local government officials were not available to comment.

Measles outbreak linked to conflict
-----------------------------------
The recent outbreak of measles which claimed the lives of at least 12 children and one adult in Pakistan's North Waziristan's tribal agency is directly linked to conflict between militants and the army, according to local experts. ”Long curfews, road blockades and also the power cuts that take place mean the vaccines we receive expire," said Muhammad Ali Shah, who heads the main hospital in Miramshah, the headquarters of the agency. "The measles vaccine needs to be stored at a proper temperature.”

North Waziristan, a poor area bordering Afghanistan, is a stronghold of the Taliban and affiliated militants. It is largely inaccessible, which makes it difficult for vaccination teams to move and for other humanitarian organizations to operate safely. “We are basically on our own here,” Shah added, noting that it was unclear how many people were affected by the virus in remote mountainous areas.

According to official figures, healthcare facilities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas -- made up of 7 agencies of which North Waziristan is one -- are poor, with only one doctor for every 6993 people. For the rest of the country the figure is 1225 people per doctor, scattered among the 33 hospitals in the territory. “Vaccination campaigns in our areas are frequently interrupted. The militancy here has affected us all, and this measles epidemic we hear of is the latest manifestation of this,” A 55-year-old villager said. "In my village of Hurmaz there are several sick children. We don’t know what they are suffering from -- though one has high fever and mottled skin,” he added, saying bad roads and a lack of transport had made it "very hard to take the children to a medical facility."

Experts say the situation raises questions about overall health policy. "Outbreaks of disease can be prevented only if, rather than a focus on polio alone, we concentrate on vaccinating against all preventable diseases," Anita Zaidi, Professor of Paediatrics at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi, told IRIN. "This is also the only way to combat polio." Azmat Siddique, a doctor based at a clinic near Miramshah, said: "We need more help to tackle the problem." He said help was “unlikely to come”, given the situation in the agency. Jamil Wazir, an office assistant at a clinic in Peshawar, underscored the irony of the situation. “My sister’s 2-year-old son died from complications after contracting measles," he told IRIN. "Here, as part of my job at this clinic, I purchase dozens of measles vaccines to administer to children, so they are kept safe from such disease." According to the World Health Organization (WHO) more than 95 percent of measles deaths occur in low-income countries with weak health infrastructure.
