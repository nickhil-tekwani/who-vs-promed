A fox attacked 3 people on [Tue 13 Feb 2018] at Saguaro National Park. One of those people is missing and officials want that person to immediately seek medical care for rabies. The incident was originally reported as a fox attacking a bicyclist along the Cactus Forest Loop in the Rincon Mountain District.

Park spokesman Chief Ranger Ray O'Neil says that since it's rare for foxes to attack people, they are concerned that it might have been rabid. "It appears the fox may have approached multiple visitors prior to the incident being reported to park officials," O'Neil says.

"If any visitor has come into direct contact with this fox, or any animal acting strangely, they should seek immediate medical care, without delay." Officials says that while 2 people have been treated, they are still looking for the 3rd.

The person is urged to call Arizona Game and Fish Department at 623-236-7201 or the National Park at 800-637-9152.

Park officials say that they are concerned because there have been multiple cases of rabies reported in the area over the past few months.

[In the Americas, rabies is maintained by bats and wild carnivores. The variant of terrestrial rabies present in Arizona is maintained by the gray fox (see https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html). Foxes are the main rabies reservoirs in Arizona and Texas. - Mod.PMB
