The latest national cereal disease survey by Agrii found that changes in the pathogenicity of yellow rust over the past [2016/17] season mean 64 per cent of mainstream winter wheat varieties now have lower resistance than their current Recommended List (RL) ratings - providing an early warning ahead of 2017/18 planting.

Agrii's Jim Carswell said: "A number of varieties are holding their ratings well, however, many have become noticeably more susceptible. A progressive fall-off in resistance is only to be expected with varieties that have been widely grown for a number of years. More worryingly, though, we've recorded 7 of the 11 new varieties on the RL, as well as several Candidates, with yellow rust resistance scores at least a point lower than their official ratings. It's especially important to go into the season knowing exactly the level of risk the varieties we're growing present."

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrid) and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172). Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

In the UK, emerging new strains have been reported repeatedly over recent years (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20160711.4337095, 20160219.4033809, 20140122.2224928) and populations of stripe rust are changing, as is being observed in the whole of Europe.
