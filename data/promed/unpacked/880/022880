[My synopsis of the detailed message from Peter Whelan. - Mod. CHC
Larvae of two exotic species of mosquitoes were detected by Quarantine
officers in water on a cargo of mining equipment from Kupang, West Timor.
There were indications that some adult mosquitoes emerged. Because they
could establish a breeding population and spread to the rest of Darwin and
the Northern territory and might introduce a new disease risk that would
impact seriously on health and tourism in the NT, efforts have been made to
eradicate these pests.
The vessel arrived 1 Dec 1999 and the larvae and pupae were found 27 Jan
2000, giving time for the spread of adult mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were
_Aedes albopictus_ (the Asian tiger mosquito), exotic to Australia, and
_Aedes aegypti (the dengue mosquito), found in north Queensland but absent
from the NT. Both are vectors of dengue fever as well as other diseases in
various parts of the world. Not only was there risk establishment in the
area but of spread. The NT is one of the few areas in the tropical world
free of dengue mosquitoes and hence free of the risks of dengue outbreaks.
The Medical Entomology Branch (MEB) of Territory Health Services have
cooperated with Quarantine officers in the Department of Primary Industry
and Fisheries in organising procedures to eradicate this importation and
have organised ongoing vigilance to verify the eradication. A pest control
company has been engaged by MEB to spray a residual insecticide into all
artificial containers in the shipping yard and adjacent premises commencing
28 January.
Misting for adult mosquitoes was carried out by the contractor inside all
suspected premises and adjacent premises 28-29 Jan 2000. MEB technical
officers fogged the general area on the evening of 28 Jan 2000, using ultra
low volume bioresmethrin insecticide applied by a heavy-duty
trailer-mounted fogging machine. All premises in the vicinity have agreed
to the insecticide applications.
Quarantine has imposed controls over goods leaving the shipyard and
adjacent premises until further notice, in order to ensure that nothing
leaves the premises, which might entail a risk of moving any stage of the
exotic mosquitoes. Quarantine officers and MEB are currently verifying that
all containers in the precinct have been sprayed.
Quarantine and MEB officers will maintain intensified egg trap surveillance
and larval inspections of artificial containers in all premises in the
precinct over the next two months until it is certain that no establishment
of the exotic mosquito species has occurred.
