In a new study published in Nature Microbiology on [Tue 7 Apr 2020], researchers from the Wuhan Center for Disease Control & Prevention and the University of Illinois reported that a re-analysis of throat swabs from patients in Wuhan with influenza-like-illness (ILI) found that some of the patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting community transmission of the virus in Wuhan in early January 2020.

The causative pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China, is the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.6% sequence identity and the same cell receptor with the SARS coronavirus that caused the 2003 epidemic, the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 not only includes SARS-like viral pneumonia, but also causes milder illnesses, the researchers noted. Some people also present with asymptomatic infection -- an analysis by the China CDC indicated that 80.9% of confirmed COVID-19 cases were characterized as the mild or moderate types, without breathing difficulty or hypoxia, they added.

The 1st cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan in December 2019. The rapid increase in reported cases suggested that community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was established in Wuhan and nearby regions no later than the end of January 2020, but because the use of rapid molecular diagnostic assays was not widespread before [23 Jan 2020], it was difficult to monitor the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the community, the researchers said.

In order to better understand how the disease spread in Wuhan, they retrospectively investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 among local patients with ILI, which were defined as outpatients with a sudden onset of a fever of more than 38 degC and a cough or sore throat. They re-analyzed 640 throat swabs collected from ILI patients between [6 Oct 2019 and 21 Jan 2020], performing a quantitative PCR assay to detect the presence of the ORF1ab and N genes of SARS-CoV-2. This time period coincided with the winter peak of influenza and other respiratory illnesses.

They noted that the number of ILI cases in all age groups had increased dramatically, starting in early December [2019] and reaching a peak by the New Year. In particular, cases in the 5- to 14-year-old group increased more than 24-fold during this period. Further, ILI data for the 2019-2020 winter was significantly higher in comparison to previous years, suggesting a need to distinguish between influenza-infected and suspected COVID-19 patients.

In their re-analysis of the throat swabs, the researchers found that 9 of the 640 were, in fact, infected with SARS-CoV-2. The onset date of the earliest case was [4 Jan 2020], one week after the outbreak was reported by hospitals.

"Although the weekly sample size was small, it seems that COVID-19 was gradually expanding among the ILI cases during January [2020]," the authors wrote. "In the last week of observation, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases had exceeded that of influenza virus among the group of patients older than 30 years. This finding is consistent with the recent epidemiological estimations about the early transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2."

Interestingly, they added, the 9 patients came from 6 different districts of the Wuhan metropolitan and surrounding areas, providing additional evidence for community transmission in this region.

[2] Antibody tests roll out in UK expected in May 2020

Antibody tests to determine whether someone has had COVID-19 will not be available until at least May [2020], the government's national testing coordinator has said. John Newton, Public Health England's director of health improvement, said that none of the tests tried so far had been accurate enough.

The government has set itself a target to carry out 100 000 COVID-19 tests a day by the end of April [2020], through a "5 pillar" policy including a big increase in capacity for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests that detect the presence of the virus, alongside rolling out antibody testing. But Newton, appointed last week to oversee this increase, told MPs on the House of Commons science and technology select committee on [8 Apr 2020] that he did not expect antibody tests to be factored into this target. "We do not expect to be doing antibody tests by the end of April [2020]," he said. "We're not relying on antibody tests to make up that [100 000] target. A number of companies were offering us these quick antibody tests, and we were hoping that they'd be fit for purpose, but when they got to test, they all worked but were just not good enough to rely on."

"The judgment was made [that] it's worth taking the time to develop a better antibody test before rolling it out, and that is what the current plan is." Newton told the committee that the tests trialled so far had lacked sufficient sensitivity to identify people who had been infected. "We set a clear target for tests to achieve, and none of them frankly were close," he said. "That doesn't mean to say they don't have any value, but we think it is possible to improve on that."

Last month [March 2020] England's health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that the government had purchased 3.5 million antibody tests, promising to make them available to frontline NHS staff "very soon" so that people could find out whether they had been infected.

Kathy Hall, director of the COVID-19 testing strategy at the Department of Health and Social Care, told the committee that, in light of the trials of the tests, the government would now be "working with companies to cancel the orders and get the money back where possible." She added that "no country has a valid antibody test in use" at present.

But Newton said he was optimistic that a reliable test could emerge soon in the UK, noting comments yesterday from AstraZeneca's CEO, Pascal Soriot, that an antibody test developed by the company would be ready in May [2020]. Newton said, "There is an active partnership with industry and academics to improve on the underlying molecules that make up the test. We are reasonably optimistic that we can produce a test that does meet the standard in the time when it's needed at very high volumes. But, because it is innovation, we can't be absolutely certain of that."

[3] Sample pooling as a strategy to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2
Date: 6 Apr 2020
Source: JAMA [edited]

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed the global importance of robust diagnostic testing to differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from other routine respiratory infections and guide appropriate clinical management. Given the limited testing capacity available in the United States early in the pandemic, individuals with a clinical syndrome consistent with COVID-19, but without travel or exposure history, were not tested. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether there may have been community circulation of SARS-CoV-2 prior to the identification of individuals with positive results through standard public health surveillance. Sample pooling, a strategy used for community monitoring of other infectious diseases such as trachoma, has not, to our knowledge, been deployed for the early comprehensive screening of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.

Methods
-------
The Stanford Health Care Clinical Virology Laboratory serves adult and pediatric tertiary care hospitals and affiliated primary care and specialty clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. We performed a retrospective study that evaluated all nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage samples collected between [1 Jan and 26 Feb 2020], from inpatients and outpatients who had negative results by routine respiratory virus testing (respiratory pathogen or respiratory viral panels [GenMark Diagnostics] or Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV [Cepheid]) and had not been tested for SARS-CoV-2. After [26 Feb 2020], clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 on individual samples was begun, as recommended by institutional policy. A total of 9 or 10 individual samples were pooled, and screening was performed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction targeting the envelope (E) gene. Positive pools were deconvoluted and individual samples tested for both E and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene for confirmation. This study was approved by the Stanford institutional review board. Given the deidentified nature of testing, individual patient consent was not required, as determined by the institutional review board, for this study.

Results
-------
A total of 292 pools were screened, corresponding with 2740 nasopharyngeal samples and 148 bronchoalveolar lavage samples (Figure 1). The confirmed positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 was 0.07% (2/2888) (Figure 2). The positive results were from nasopharyngeal samples collected on [21 Feb 2020], and on [23 Feb 2020]. The 2 positive samples showed detection of E and RdRp. Sanger sequencing revealed 100% identity with the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. Only 1 pool showed a positive E signal that was not reproducible with testing of the individual samples of that pool.

Discussion
----------
Results from this screening strategy support that the burden of disease in the San Francisco Bay Area early in the pandemic was low; less than 1% of all symptomatic individuals with negative routine testing had SARS-CoV-2 infection. The timing of the positive pools overlapped with the first 3 individuals with positive results reported from Santa Clara County, tested using criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thus, public health counts of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated a reasonable estimate of overall disease burden among symptomatic individuals in this area. Nevertheless, the individuals identified with positive results via this screening strategy would not have met the existing testing criteria.

A pooled screening strategy was pursued to increase testing throughput, limit use of reagents, and increase overall testing efficiency at an expected slight loss of sensitivity. With only 1 false-positive reading, the strategy was specific. Due to the challenges of restricted access to diagnostic tests and kit supplies across the United States, early testing has largely been limited to symptomatic individuals fulfilling testing criteria. Although this approach facilitates rational use of resources, it may miss individuals in whom COVID-19 risk has not been identified. This study is limited in that it was performed in a single laboratory in a restricted geographical area; additional data are thus required to validate this approach on a larger scale. Furthermore, this screening strategy does not obviate the need for individual diagnostic testing, particularly as community transmission intensifies.

Strategies such as pooled screening may facilitate detection of early community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and enable timely implementation of appropriate infection control measures to reduce spread.

[4] Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at 2 family gatherings -- Chicago, Illinois, February-March 2020
Date: 8 Apr 2020

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e1.htm?s_cid=mm6915e1_w


Citation: Ghinai I, Woods S, Ritger KA, et al. Community Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at Two Family Gatherings - Chicago, Illinois, February-March 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 8 April 2020. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e1

During [1 Jan to 20 Mar 2020], specimens that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at hospital, commercial, or public health laboratories were reported to CDPH; each triggered an epidemiologic investigation. Contact tracing interviews were conducted with patients with confirmed COVID-19 using a structured questionnaire designed to identify the date of symptom onset and any person with whom the patient had close contact since that date. The type of contact and setting in which the contact occurred were recorded. Close contacts of patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19 were interviewed and enrolled in active symptom monitoring using Research Electronic Data Capture software (REDCap, version 8.8.0, Vanderbilt University, 2020). Patients were classified as having confirmed COVID-19 if SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen. Patients were classified as having probable COVID-19 if they developed new symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath within 14 days of contact with a patient with confirmed or probable COVID-19 but did not undergo laboratory testing (consistent with CDC recommendations,* the Illinois Department of Public Health prioritizes testing for hospitalized patients and other high-risk groups).

In February 2020, a funeral was held for a decedent with a non-COVID-19, nonrespiratory cause of death. A close friend of the bereaved family (patient A1.1) attended the funeral; patients in this investigation were referred to by their family cluster letter (A or B), then by the assumed transmission generation (1-4), and finally, in sequence order within each generation (1-7) (Figure 1). Patient A1.1 had recently traveled out of state and was experiencing mild respiratory symptoms; he was only tested later as part of the epidemiologic investigation and received a diagnosis of confirmed COVID-19. The evening before the funeral (investigation day 1), patient A1.1 shared a takeout meal, eaten from common serving dishes, with 2 family members of the decedent (patients B2.1 and B2.2) at their home. At the meal, which lasted approximately 3 hours, and the funeral, which lasted about 2 hours and involved a shared "potluck-style" meal, patient A1.1 also reported embracing family members of the decedent, including patients B2.1, B2.2, B2.3, and B3.1, to express condolences.

Patients B2.1 and B2.2 subsequently developed confirmed COVID-19 with onset of symptoms 2 and 4 days, respectively, after the funeral; patient B2.3 developed probable COVID-19 with symptom onset 6 days after the funeral (investigation day 8). Patient B2.1 was hospitalized on investigation day 11, required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for acute repiratory failure, and died on investigation day 28. Patients B2.2 and B2.3 were managed as outpatients, and both recovered.

During investigation days 11-14, another family member who had close physical contact with patient A1.1 at the funeral (patient B3.1) visited patient B2.1 on the acute medical inpatient ward, embraced patient B2.1, and provided limited personal care, while wearing no personal protective equipment (PPE). Patient B3.1 developed signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, including a fever and cough on investigation day 17, 3 days after last visiting B2.1. Patient B3.1 had also attended the funeral 15 days before symptom onset but described more extensive exposure while visiting patient B2.1 in the hospital.

Three days after the funeral, on investigation day 5, patient A1.1, who was still experiencing mild respiratory symptoms, attended a birthday party attended by 9 other family members, hosted in the home of patient A2.1. Close contact between patient A1.1 and all other attendees occurred; patient A1.1 embraced others and shared food at the 3-hour party. A total of 7 party attendees subsequently developed COVID-19 3-7 days after the event (Figure 2), including 3 with confirmed cases (patients A2.1, A2.2, and A2.3) and 4 with probable cases (patients A2.4, A2.5, A2.6, and A2.7). Two patients with confirmed COVID-19 (A2.1 and A2.2) were hospitalized; both required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and both died. One patient with a confirmed case (A2.3) experienced mild symptoms of cough and subjective low-grade fever, as did the 4 others who received diagnoses of probable COVID-19. Two attendees did not develop symptoms within 14 days of the birthday party.

Two persons who provided personal care for patient A2.1 without using PPE, including one family member (patient A3.1) and a home care professional (patient C3.1), both developed probable COVID-19 . It is likely that patient A3.1 subsequently transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to a household contact (patient A4.1), who did not attend the birthday party, but developed a new onset cough 3 days following unprotected, close contact with patient A3.1 while patient A3.1 was symptomatic.

Three symptomatic birthday party attendees with probable COVID-19 (patients A2.5, A2.6, and A2.7) attended church 6 days after developing their first symptoms (investigation day 17). Another church attendee (patient D3.1, a health care professional) developed confirmed COVID-19 following close contact with patients A2.5, A2.6, and A2.7, including direct conversations, sitting within one row for 90 minutes, and passing the offering plate.

The patients described in this report ranged in age from 5 to 86 years. The 3 patients who died (patients A2.1, B2.1 and A2.2) were aged more than 60 years, and all had at least one underlying cardiovascular or respiratory medical condition.

Discussion
----------
This cluster comprised 16 cases of COVID-19 (7 confirmed and 9 probable), with transmission mostly occurring between non-household contacts at family gatherings. The median interval from last contact with a patient with confirmed or probable COVID-19 to first symptom onset was 4 days. Within 3 weeks after mild respiratory symptoms were noted in the index patient, 15 other persons were likely infected with SARS-CoV-2, including 3 who died. Patient A1.1, the index patient, was apparently able to transmit infection to 10 other persons, despite having no household contacts and experiencing only mild symptoms for which medical care was not sought (patient A1.1 was only tested later as part of this epidemiologic investigation). Super-spreading events have played a significant role in transmission of other recently emerged coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV although their relevance to SARS-CoV-2 spread is debated.

These data illustrate the importance of social distancing for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, even within families. In this cluster, extended family gatherings (a birthday party, funeral, and church attendance), all of which occurred before major social distancing policies were implemented, might have facilitated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 beyond household contacts into the broader community. These findings support CDC recommendations to avoid gatherings and reinforce the executive order from the governor of Illinois prohibiting all public and private gatherings of any number of persons occurring outside a single household.

In this cluster, 2 family gatherings outside the household likely facilitated the spread of SARS-CoV-2; one index patient who attended both events likely triggered a chain of transmission that included 15 other confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and ultimately resulted in 3 deaths. Media reports suggest the chain of transmission described in Chicago is not unique within the United States. Together with evidence emerging from around the world , these data shed light on transmission beyond household contacts, including the potential for super-spreading events. More comprehensive information is needed to better understand the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings and households to better inform initiation and termination of public health policies related to social distancing or stay-at-home orders. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of adhering to current social distancing recommendations, including guidance to avoid any gatherings with persons from multiple households and following state or local stay-at-home orders.

Citation: Grein, J., Ohmagari, N., Shin, D. et al. Compassionate use of Remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19. NEJM, 2020, DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2007016

Abstract
--------
Background
Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from [25 Jan through 7 Mar 2020], and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day.

Results
Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation.

Conclusions
In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy.

[6] COVID-19 in South Korea -- Challenges of subclinical manifestations
Date: 6 Apr 2020

Citation: Song JY, Yun JG, Noh JY, Cheong HJ and Kim WK. Covid-19 in South Korea -- Challenges of Subclinical Manifestations. NEJM 2020. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2001801

The first confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in South Korea was imported from China on [20 Jan 2020]. By [10 Feb 2020], there were 28 cases of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) in South Korea (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The characteristics of these patients and the patient numbers are provided in Table S1. The median age of the patients was 41 years (range, 21 to 73), and 15 of the 28 patients (54%) were men. The mean interval (+/-SD) from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4.3 +/- 4.1 days.

A total of 11 cases of COVID-19 were acquired locally and involved delayed diagnosis. Delays in detection of infected patients may be related to subclinical symptoms and diverse initial manifestations that make it difficult for clinicians to diagnose COVID-19. A total of 8 of 20 patients who reported specified symptoms (40%) initially presented with fever, and respiratory symptoms were nonspecific. Some patients reported severe sore throat, whereas others had only a mild cough.

Most of the early local infections were transmitted from patients who were being actively monitored because of recent travel (Patients 3, 5, and 6). Patient 3, who had subclinical symptoms, transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to Patient 6, who in turn transmitted it to Patients 10, 11, and 21. During his stay in Japan, Patient 12 had been exposed to a person with confirmed COVID-19. However, he was not screened in the quarantine area at Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, South Korea, because South Korean officials had not been informed about the contact. Patient 12 appears to have subsequently infected Patient 14.

Control strategies for outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have focused on tracing contacts of symptomatic patients with epidemiologic links. However, during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, nosocomial transmission persisted despite active quarantine measures. Early data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to be transmitted than MERS-CoV infection because of a higher estimated reproductive number (2.2 vs. 0.9) and a shorter estimated serial interval distribution (7.5 days vs. 12.6 days).

Among the 28 infected patients reported here, COVID-19 was diagnosed by surveillance testing in South Korea in 3 who were asymptomatic. Although asymptomatic transmission has been suggested, it is uncertain when patients with COVID-19 are infectious during the incubation period or whether they are infectious primarily when they have symptoms. Better assessments of viral shedding are needed to properly inform our understanding of transmission dynamics and infection-control practices. Early detection of COVID-19 is difficult because of its apparent subclinical nature in some persons.

[7] Coagulopathy and antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with COVID-19
Date: 8 Apr 2020

Citation: Yan Zhang Y, Xiao M, Zhang S, et al. Coagulopathy and Antiphospholipid Antibodies in Patients with Covid-19. NEJM 2020. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2007575

We describe a patient with COVID-19 and clinically significant coagulopathy, antiphospholipid antibodies, and multiple infarcts. He was one of 3 patients with these findings in an intensive care unit designated for patients with COVID-19. This unit, which was managed by a multidisciplinary team from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, was set up on an emergency basis to accept the most critically ill patients during the outbreak of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed in all the patients by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay or serologic testing.

A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and stroke presented with fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, and headache. COVID-19 was diagnosed in the patient on [25 Jan 2020], on the basis of RT-PCR testing that detected SARS-CoV-2. The initial treatment was supportive; however, the illness subsequently progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure warranting the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation.

On examination, the patient had evidence of ischemia in the lower limbs bilaterally as well as in digits 2 and 3 of the left hand. Computed tomographic imaging of the brain showed bilateral cerebral infarcts in multiple vascular territories. Pertinent laboratory results on admission of the patient (Patient 1) to the intensive care unit are summarized in Table 1. They included leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, an elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and elevated levels of fibrinogen and d-dimer. Subsequent serologic testing showed the presence of anticardiolipin IgA antibodies as well as anti-β2-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies.

Two other patients with similar findings were seen at the specialized intensive care unit for patients with COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital. Serologic tests in these patients were positive for anticardiolipin IgA antibodies as well as anti-beta2-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies. Further clinical details are summarized in Table 1. Lupus anticoagulant was not detected in any of the patients, although testing was performed while the patients were acutely ill.

Antiphospholipid antibodies abnormally target phospholipid proteins, and the presence of these antibodies is central to the diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome. However, these antibodies can also arise transiently in patients with critical illness and various infections. The presence of these antibodies may rarely lead to thrombotic events that are difficult to differentiate from other causes of multifocal thrombosis in critically patients, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathy.

[8] Ensuring and sustaining a pandemic workforce
Date: 8 Apr 2020
Source: NEJM [abridged, edited]
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006376?query=featured_coronavirus


Citation: Fraher E.P., Pittman P., Frogner B.K., et al. NEJM 2020. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp2006376

Current efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic aim to slow viral spread and increase testing, protect health care workers from infection, and obtain ventilators and other equipment to prepare for a surge of critically ill patients. But additional actions are needed to rapidly increase health workforce capacity and to replenish it when personnel are quarantined or need time off to rest or care for sick family members. It seems clear that health care delivery organizations, educators, and government leaders will all have to be willing to cut through bureaucratic barriers and adapt regulations to rapidly expand the U.S. health care workforce and sustain it for the duration of the pandemic.

As hospitals and nursing homes gear up for expected increases in critically ill patients, they should examine all opportunities to expand their workforce capacity. Where the threat of post-pandemic legal consequences hampers action to expand capacity, such barriers could be removed by governors enacting emergency orders that modify or temporarily rescind medical malpractice policies that inhibit health professionals' ability to expand their scope of practice as required. Most organizations, however, will find that outdated internal policies such as workflows, task-delegation protocols, or union agreements are the main culprits in restricting the shifting of tasks and responsibilities among personnel. These restrictions can be changed to allow health workers to fully use their knowledge and skills. How changes are accomplished will vary among organizations, but it's essential to involve staff in identifying barriers and implementing strategies to overcome them: no one has all the answers, and engaging frontline workers can be empowering and can facilitate difficult decision making.

Public and private payers play a critical role in increasing the workforce's capacity to meet patients' needs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken unprecedented steps through the 1135 waiver program and expanded telehealth coverage to increase the flexibility of Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program payments, expanding the types of services that can be covered, broadening the number and types of providers eligible for payments, and allowing services to be provided in a wider range of settings, including patients' homes. Governors can propose additional flexibility in their Medicaid programs by requesting waivers. Some private insurers have unilaterally expanded their coverage, and these efforts should be encouraged. Efforts need to focus not only on increasing workforce capacity, but also on sustaining it over the course of the pandemic. CMS has also issued guidance allowing hospitals to provide benefits to support staff, such as multiple daily meals, laundry service for personal clothing, or child care services.

While government and private efforts focus on obtaining and producing ventilators, hospitals will require personnel who can operate these machines. Hospital associations can develop strategies to deploy respiratory therapists to the hospitals most in need and to develop programs to quickly train workers who can operate this technology competently; respiratory-therapy education programs can accelerate the preparation of therapists.

To assist hospitals in meeting this challenge, education programs can develop classes to train students in the skills most immediately needed. Accreditation bodies can allow students to count work hours toward graduation requirements. State licensure organizations can issue emergency or temporary licenses to 4th-year medical students, and to nurse practitioner, physician assistant, registered nurse, and other health profession students who are near the end of their programs. Students' health care organizations can waive the background checks that most require as a condition of employment. Inflexibility and lack of creativity could stall efforts to expand the current workforce and jeopardize longer-term workforce stability at a time when health workers are critically needed.

It's also important for community health leaders to plan for the needs of millions of people in the United States who require treatment for mental health disorders. Health care providers, patients in isolation, and people affected by shelter-in-place orders are likely to experience considerable psychological distress. Not to be forgotten are people suffering from inadequate housing, food insecurity, isolation, and low income, who are vulnerable to being left behind as social and economic reactions to the pandemic intensify. Social workers are pivotal in helping vulnerable people by providing mental and behavioral interventions and helping people access food, housing, and social services. Health care organizations and health departments can also partner with community health workers, peer-support workers, occupational and physical therapists, and home health workers to identify and attend to social needs, including helping patients with COVID-19 adhere to their medical treatment.

How well the country handles the COVID-19 crisis depends largely on how effectively our health workforce is used. Much can be done to ensure that the workforce is prepared to defeat the pandemic. Some actions discussed here are temporary, whereas others -- such as expanding scopes of practice, cross-state licensure, and allowing greater use of telehealth services -- probably make sense in general but are especially critical now. Now is the time for pragmatic steps to expand and sustain the health workforce. Once the pandemic has subsided, workforce changes should be evaluated and the results used to inform wiser use of the workforce and improved responses to future pandemics.

[9] Regulators split on antimalarials for COVID-19
Date: 11 Apr 2020
Source: The Lancet [edited]
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30817-5/fulltext


US and French authorities have authorised the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but the EU regulator and WHO say the science doesn't support the decision.

With no "adequate, approved and available" alternative, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is allowing the use of the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 ). The FDA's emergency use authorisation (EUA) issued last week gives physicians the option to prescribe the drugs, which President Donald Trump has recommended. However, both drugs are unproven and untested for COVID-19, and have rare but potentially deadly side-effects. The decision bypassed the usual drug approval process including double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, stoking a worldwide debate about whether the drugs are appropriate for treating the disease.

"I think it was resorted to more out of a sense of desperation", said Joseph Masci, an infectious disease specialist and director of global health at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, a borough of New York City, which is at the centre of the epidemic in the USA. "It is just an indication of how sudden and massive this outbreak has been." In early March 2020, US health authorities reported about 100 cases of COVID-19 and 10 deaths. Almost a month later, there are more than 363 000 cases and 10 847 people have died as of [7 Apr 2020], according to state and federal government data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project.

Elmhurst, with 545 beds, is one of 11 hospitals in a network of public hospitals known as the Health and Hospitals Corporation. Masci said hydroxychloroquine, which is more widely used for other diseases and is less toxic than chloroquine, has been administered to some patients with COVID-19 throughout the system, including several hundred at Elmhurst. The course of treatment runs 5 days and, so far, the results have been mixed, he said.

Under the EUA, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can be used only in a hospital setting to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents who weigh at least 50 kg and are not able to participate in a clinical trial. The drugs must also be obtained from the national stockpile to protect the supply for other patients who have relied on the drugs for years to control autoimmune diseases including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. But 3 days after the EUA, a surge in demand forced the agency to declare a shortage of both drugs.

So far, France is one of a few countries that also permit the drugs to be used for patients with COVID-19. Opposition has come from the European Medicines Agency, the EU's pharmaceutical regulator, which reiterated earlier this week that studies have not yet documented that the drugs can effectively treat COVID-19.

WHO concurs, citing "insufficient data to assess the efficacy of either of these medicines in treating patients with COVID-19, or in preventing them from contracting the coronavirus".

Although the efficacy of the drugs as a COVID-19 treatment might be uncertain, their side-effects are not. "What I know for sure as a cardiologist is that these powerful medications have important side-effects including rarely sudden cardiac death", said Michael Ackerman, a genetic cardiologist and director of Mayo Clinic's Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic. He said that at least 1% of patients will be at increased risk for a hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine QT reaction capable of triggering drug-induced sudden cardiac death (especially if used in combination with azithromycin). Although such reactions are rare, if millions of people receive the drugs, thousands of lives could be at risk from medications that were supposed to help them to recover from the virus, he said. Ackerman believes such dire consequences can be avoided easily if physicians carefully evaluate vulnerable patients.

In New York City, Masci said the patients with COVID-19 at Elmhurst Hospital have not experienced adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine. The hospital is preparing for many new patients and has set up beds in tents in the parking lot. "We are seeing a very rapid rise in patients with [COVID-19], a condition that never existed before and has its own issues in terms of treatment, prevention, and transmission", he said. "It has been a very, very challenging problem and we don't think it has hit the peak yet."

[10] 'Organ-on-a-chip' model to find out how COVID-19 invades our bodies
Date: 9 Apr 2020
Source: Healthcare-in-Europe [edited]
https://healthcare-in-europe.com/en/news/organ-on-a-chip-model-to-find-out-how-COVID-19-invades-our-bodies.html#


In order for a COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral drugs to be developed, scientists 1st need to understand why this virus spreads so easily and quickly, and why it invades our bodies with seemingly little resistance from our immune system.

To understand how COVID-19 enters the body and does its damage, a team of top researchers from universities, hospitals and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) at the Centre for Research and Application in Fluidic Technologies, or CRAFT (a collaborative centre between the University of Toronto and the NRC), are adapting an approach developed by U of T's Milica Radisic, Axel Guenther and Edmond Young to create miniscule models of the nose, mouth, eyes and lungs.

The focus will be on understanding why this virus is so effective at breaking through the body's natural defenders against viral and bacterial invaders, otherwise known as epithelial barriers. These barriers -- created by epithelial cells that pack themselves tightly together -- are present throughout our bodies. "Normally, these epithelial barriers do a good job of helping us fight infections," says Radisic, who is a professor in the department of chemical engineering and applied chemistry in the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. But this virus has found a way to invade the barriers. That's our focus: Why is this?"

In recent years, Radisic's research has allowed her to make important progress in developing models of the heart on computer chips. The hearts -- made from human cells -- capture the key functions of an actual heart. That research, in turn, has been extremely effective in regenerating heart cells. Radisic has also used this organ-on-a-chip model to study how nanoparticles from air pollution damage our organs.

Now, by creating mini-models of other human organs, the researchers can take a detailed view of just how COVID-19 is working. "This method allows us to study the problem without having to touch a human and potentially harm someone," says Radisic, who is also Canada Research Chair in Functional Cardiovascular Tissue Engineering. "That's the beauty of it. We can do our research early in the viral infection. You can't do that with a human, because once you know you have COVID-19, you've been infected for 2 weeks. With organ-on-a-chip, we can study what happens within 24 hours of COVID-19 entering the body."

A big part of the challenge with COVID-19 is that it's new, and no one is immune. "There isn't anyone who has developed the T and B cells that are part of what we call adaptive immunity, the cells you build up as you are exposed to diseases. We are all born with innate immunity. This works early when we are invaded with a virus. It finds things that don't belong in your body and tries to clean it up." Radisic says having a lung-on-a-chip will enable the team to study the innate early response of the immune system to COVID-19. ...

The group will also experiment with the "Powerblade," a technology the NRC in Montreal is using to test the blood of astronauts while on space missions. It will be repurposed by the research team to examine its potential for testing people with COVID-19 when they arrive at a hospital. "Once we figure out which molecules are biomarkers for a severe case of COVID-19, the Powerblade will be able to read that at point-of-care," Radisic says. "The health-care providers will then know how your innate immunity is reacting and if the virus will be severe or not. The problem with COVID-19 is that it works fast. You look good one minute, and then, suddenly, you can be in real trouble. So getting earlier markers is important."

[11] COVID-19 vaccine candidate could cover global demand
Date: 9 Apr 2020
Source: Health-in-Europe [edited]
https://healthcare-in-europe.com/en/news/COVID-19-vaccine-candidate-could-cover-global-demand.html


Any new coronavirus vaccine that works well and is safe will still have the daunting challenge of needing to be produced to scale in a very short amount of time. It will also have to be safely delivered into the hands of the most remote populations.

The more complex and untested the vaccine approach, the more difficult it will be to both scale its production and deliver it around the world.

"Our vaccine candidate, Coravax, is made from part of the current coronavirus and that is combined with another proven vaccine that serves as a carrier of sorts," says Matthias Schnell, PhD, Director of the Jefferson Vaccine Center. "The benefit is that the carrier vaccine has already been rigorously tested and shown to be safe and effective. There are manufacturing plants around the world already running and with the technological know-how to produce large quantities of that vaccine. We can leverage that efficiency and safety record."

"This pandemic is likely to reach every corner of our planet," says Mark Tykocinski, MD, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs of Thomas Jefferson University, and Dean of its Sidney Kimmel Medical College. "That is an unprecedented scale. We need a vaccine that's not only safe and effective, but also one that can be made to scale and in a way that can get to potentially all the world's population. Coravax has that potential."

Coravax is a vaccine made from a portion of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Rather than use the entire virus, Dr. Schnell and colleagues use only part of it, the spike protein, a component that is most likely to generate a protective immune response. Many vaccines today are prepared by using another vaccine as a carrier for the virus of interest. In the case of the Coravax vaccine, that carrier is a killed rabies vaccine that has the spike portion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as an added component, essentially one vaccine "piggybacked" onto another. When vaccinated, a person would develop antibodies against both rabies and the coronavirus spike protein.

The benefit of using rabies as a carrier vaccine is speed, says Dr. Schnell. "There are already at least 20 manufacturing facilities around the world churning out some 100 million doses a year of the rabies vaccine. They have the means and know-how to produce this vaccine already. We're adding one small component."

It's also relatively low-cost production, which is important for a vaccine that may need to be available to billions.

"Novelty is not your friend when you need vaccine in real time," says Dr. Tykocinski. "We have to develop a vaccine with the best promise of making it all the way to large-scale production. The stakes are just too high to bet on something that might fail in the late stages of development, or that can't be made in quantity."

In addition, some vaccines require -80 C [-112 F] freezer storage, limiting their use in remote areas. By contrast, the rabies vaccine can be produced in a shelf-stable, dehydrated form that is easy to reconstitute anywhere. "We've already begun safety testing of the Coravax vaccine in animals. And we know that the rabies vaccine has an excellent safety profile," says Dr. Schnell. "That vaccine is safe in children, pregnant women, across diverse populations, and often generates life-long protection."

In another encouraging sign, Dr. Schnell's group previously demonstrated safety with a rabies vaccine for other coronaviruses that are highly similar to SARS-CoV-2. The group's vaccines for the coronaviruses that caused the 2003 SARS and the 2012 MERS epidemics was proven safe and effective in animal models of those diseases. Jefferson is already in discussions with a large vaccine manufacturer about a potential partnership. The next steps are to complete animal tests and move into phase I clinical trials for safety in people.

By building upon on an existing safe and effective vaccine, one with already well-established and currently active manufacturing hubs, one which could be made to store on the shelf until it's reconstituted with water, researchers at the Jefferson Vaccine Center at Thomas Jefferson University have a COVID-19 vaccine candidate that could cover a global need.

[12] Promising trial drug blocks early stages of COVID-19
Date: 6 Apr 2020
Source: Healthcare-in-Europe [edited]
https://healthcare-in-europe.com/en/news/promising-trial-drug-blocks-early-stages-of-COVID-19.html#


An international team led by University of British Columbia (UBC) researcher Dr. Josef Penninger has found a trial drug that effectively blocks the cellular door SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect its hosts. The findings, published in Cell, hold promise as a treatment capable of stopping early infection of the novel coronavirus that, as of 2 Apr 2020, has affected more than 981 000 people and claimed the lives of 50 000 people worldwide. The study provides new insights into key aspects of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and its interactions on a cellular level, as well as how the virus can infect blood vessels and kidneys. "We are hopeful our results have implications for the development of a novel drug for the treatment of this unprecedented pandemic," says Penninger, professor in UBC's faculty of medicine, director of the Life Sciences Institute and the Canada 150 Research Chair in Functional Genetics at UBC.

"This work stems from an amazing collaboration among academic researchers and companies, including Dr. Ryan Conder's gastrointestinal group at STEMCELL Technologies in Vancouver, Nuria Montserrat in Spain, Drs. Haibo Zhang and Art Slutsky from Toronto, and especially Ali Mirazimi's infectious biology team in Sweden, who have been working tirelessly day and night for weeks to better understand the pathology of this disease and to provide breakthrough therapeutic options."

ACE2 -- a protein on the surface of the cell membrane -- is now at centre-stage in this outbreak as the key receptor for the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. In earlier work, Penninger and colleagues at the University of Toronto and the Institute of Molecular Biology in Vienna 1st identified ACE2, and found that in living organisms, ACE2 is the key receptor for SARS, the viral respiratory illness recognized as a global threat in 2003. His laboratory also went on to link the protein to both cardiovascular disease and lung failure.

While the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread around the globe, the absence of a clinically proven antiviral therapy or a treatment specifically targeting the critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on a molecular level has meant an empty arsenal for healthcare providers struggling to treat severe cases of COVID-19. "Our new study provides very much needed direct evidence that a drug -- called APN01 (human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 - hrsACE2) -- soon to be tested in clinical trials by the European biotech company Apeiron Biologics, is useful as an antiviral therapy for COVID-19," says Dr. Art Slutsky, a scientist at the Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science of St. Michael's Hospital and professor at the University of Toronto, who is a collaborator on the study.

In cell cultures analyzed in the current study, hrsACE2 inhibited the coronavirus load by a factor of 1000-5000. In engineered replicas of human blood vessel and kidneys -- organoids grown from human stem cells -- the researchers demonstrated that the virus can directly infect and duplicate itself in these tissues. This provides important information on the development of the disease and the fact that severe cases of COVID-19 present with multi-organ failure and evidence of cardiovascular damage. Clinical grade hrsACE2 also reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these engineered human tissues. "Using organoids allows us to test in a very agile way treatments that are already being used for other diseases, or that are close to being validated. In these moments in which time is short, human organoids save the time that we would spend to test a new drug in the human setting," says Nuria Montserrat, ICREA professor at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia in Spain.

"The virus causing COVID-19 is a close sibling to the 1st SARS virus," adds Penninger. "Our previous work has helped to rapidly identify ACE2 as the entry gate for SARS-CoV-2, which explains a lot about the disease. Now we know that a soluble form of ACE2 that catches the virus away, could be indeed a very rational therapy that specifically targets the gate the virus must take to infect us. There is hope for this horrible pandemic."

[ACE2 was 1st discovered as a homologue of ACE1 in 2000, which converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1‐7. ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein, which is mainly anchored at the apical surface of the cell. Its catalytic domain is located at the extracellular side of the cell, which can be cleaved and released into blood by ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain‐containing protein 17).The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2), which is purified from the supernatant of ACE2 transfected cells, can generate angiotensin 1‐7 from angiotensin II and shows the ability to prevent angiotensin II-induced myocardial hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis.
ACE2/angiotensin 1‐7 axis is another arm of RAS, which generally shows the opposite effect to the ACE1/angiotensin II axis.12 While angiotensin II can induce strong vasoconstriction, proinflammatory effects, and profibrotic effects, angiotensin 1‐7 exhibits antiproliferative, antiapoptotic, and mild vasodilating abilities and presents various cardiovascular protective effects, including anti-heart failure, antithrombosis, anti-myocardial hypertrophy, antifibrosis, antiarrhythmia, anti‐atherogensis, and attenuating vascular dysfunction related to metabolic syndrome.

According to available clinical data, approximately15% to 30% of the COVID‐19 patients are with hypertension and approximately 2.5 to 15 percent are with coronary heart disease.3, 4, 5 Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in the treatment of these cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, several studies have shown that ACEIs/ARBs exhibit ability to upregulate ACE2 expression in addition to their main pharmacological effect to inhibit angiotensin‐converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) or block angiotensin II type 1 receptor.6, 7, 8 Considering that ACE2 expression might correlate with the susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2, intake of ACEIs/ARBs might predispose patients to the infection of SARS‐CoV‐2. Therefore, some cardiologists suggested that patients should discontinue ACEIs/ARBs to avoid the potential increased risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.However, there is evidence demonstrating that the activation of the renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) and the downregulation of ACE2 expression are involved in the pathological process of lung injury after SARS‐CoV infection.

Guo et al conclude that "The evidence at present shows that ACEIs/ARBs could increase the expression and activity of ACE2 in heart, performing a protective role in the cardiovascular system. However, the impact of ACEIs/ARBs on ACE2 in other organs, especially whether they could influence the expression level and activity of ACE2 in lungs, remains unknown. If ACEIs/ARBs do have the ability to upregulate the expression and activity of ACE2 in lungs, they may play a dual role in COVID‐19. On the one hand, the higher level of ACE2 might increase the susceptibility of cells to SARS‐CoV‐2. On the other hand, the activation of ACE2 might ameliorate the acute lung injury induced by SARS‐CoV‐2;" [https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.120.016219]. - Mod.UBA]
