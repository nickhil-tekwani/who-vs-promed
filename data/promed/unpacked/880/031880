Frozen raspberries imported from China made hundreds of people sick in Quebec [Canada] last summer [2017] and probably resulted in multiple deaths, according to a recent public health report.

The infected fruits led to a wave of recalls in August 2017 by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency because they had been used by a variety of food processors such as brewers, pastry chefs and ice cream makers and had been cooked in hospital cafeterias and residences for seniors.

The raspberries were contaminated by a norovirus, a type of highly contagious virus that often causes long and severe gastroenteritis. At least 724 Quebecers fell ill, a number that may represent just "the tip of the iceberg."

According to Dr. Yves Jalbert, director of public health protection at the Quebec health ministry, it is clear that there were deaths over this period. No specific number has been given. Public health officials in Quebec do not track the progress of each infected patient.

[Noroviruses are a genetically diverse group of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, non-enveloped viruses belonging to the Caliciviridae family. The genotypes commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis are genogroup I (GI), which includes Norwalk virus; and II (GII). After infection, immunity to the same genotype protects against reinfection for between 4 and 9 years. This immunity does not fully protect against infection with the other diverse genotypes of the virus.

Norovirus is usually spread by the fecal-oral route. This may be by contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact. It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through the air. Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation.

Norovirus results in about 685 million cases of disease and 200 000 deaths globally a year. It is common both in the developed and developing world. Those under the age of 5 are most often affected, and, in this group, it results in about 50 000 deaths in the developing world. Disease more commonly occurs in winter months. It often occurs in outbreaks, especially among those living in close quarters.
