Direccion General de Recursos Agricolas y Ganaderos, Ministerio de Medio
Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino, Madrid, Spain

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 9 Oct 2009
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 11 Oct 2009
Date submitted to OIE: 13 Oct 2009
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype H7
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Guadalajara, [Castile-La Mancha]
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Oct 2009
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species: birds
Susceptible: 308 640
Cases: 30 000
Deaths: 30 000
Destroyed: 278 640
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: a layer hen farm including 4 production houses (2
clinically affected) and a breeding house.

Outbreak statistics
Species: birds
Apparent morbidity rate: 9.72 per cent
Apparent mortality rate: 9.72 per cent
Apparent case fatality rate: 100 per cent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 100 per cent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: the measures established by the directive
2005/94/EC in case of suspicion and confirmation of an outbreak of highly
pathogenic avian influenza have been implemented: farm standstill, a 3 km
[2 mi] protection zone and a 10 km [6 mi] surveillance zone, clinical
inspections on farms in the area, etc. Also, all birds in the affected farm
have been culled on site and carcasses and other farm equipment that could
transmit the virus have been destroyed.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected
animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

laboratory)

Test: nucleotide sequencing
Test date: 11 Oct 2009
Result: positive
Species: birds
Test: real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR)

H7 avian Influenzas can be of the low pathogenic or high pathogenic
variety. Low pathogenic strains can become more pathogenic and with 30 000
birds dying out the 30 000 cases this virus appears to be highly pathogenic
for poultry.

However, such case fatality statistics does not mean that there is a
similar threat to humans. In fact, many times massive number of birds die
and people are barely touched. We have many instances such as the
Netherlands in 2003, where a highly pathogenic poultry virus prompted the
culling of 31 million birds. Despite the substantial numbers of people
involved in the clean up, only one person died. Many times human infection
with H7 avian influenzas just cause a transient conjunctivitis. However,
with influenza virus infections we should always be aware of change and
similarly, we should always learn as much as possible concerning the
current state of viral change across all species. Hence we are happy to
have this report.

For some interesting thoughts on this subject, Mod.AS has suggested that
readers look at Debora MacKenzie's 2008 very nice blogpost of 4 Jun 2008
from the New Scientist blog series. See "UK gets the safe kind of bird flu
- maybe;" at
