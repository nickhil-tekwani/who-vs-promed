A social worker who runs a charity that brings street dogs from Sri
Lanka into the UK was one of 3 people bitten by a puppy infected with
rabies. She was "nipped" on the chin, wrist and face by the dog,
which died 2 days later in quarantine. The puppy was one of 13 dogs
brought by the charity to Chingford Quarantine Kennels in north-east
London.

The 3 people who were bitten are all "well", according to the Health
Protection Agency. A spokesman for the agency said: "We understand
that 3 individuals who were bitten by the animal in the quarantine
centre have received prompt protective treatment with appropriate
vaccination and are well."

Because the dog died in quarantine, any public health risk was
contained, the agency said.

Animals being checked
---------------------
The dogs had been held at the centre since 17 Apr 2008; 5 of them were
placed in isolation after showing signs of illness, 4 of them have
since been put down, and tests are being carried out to determine if
they had rabies.

Mrs Kim Cooling, from the London-based Animal SOS Sri Lanka charity,
said the dog that died had been vaccinated before leaving Sri Lanka.
She had been with the dog at the quarantine kennels on Wednesday [23
Apr 2008] when she was bitten. "She just snapped at me and she was
snapping at the other pups. She was not her usual sweet self," she
said. Mrs Cooling and 2 kennel workers who were bitten by the puppy
have received hospital treatment.

Other animals that may have come into contact with the puppy were
being checked, according to the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs (Defra). But it stressed that further infections were
"highly unlikely" and the UK remained "free of rabies" because the
case had occurred in quarantine.

'System working'
---------------
Acting Chief Veterinary Officer Alick Simmons said: "While initial
tests show that this puppy has tested positive for rabies, this shows
that the system is working and the case has been picked up while the
animal is in quarantine.
We are now tracing animals that have [been] moved from the kennels to
ensure that all animals that have come into contact with the puppy are
monitored."

Jeremy Robinson is the general manager of the Goddard Veterinary
Group, which includes Chingford Quarantine Kennels. He said there had
been immediate concerns about the health of the 5 8-week-old puppies
and these had been placed in an isolated area away from other dogs and
cats. "I am confident that no other animals can have been infected,"
he said.

Effective treatment
-------------------
Rabies is a viral disease which affects the central nervous system.
Once symptoms appear it is almost always fatal, but patients can be
treated with antibodies and a vaccination to fight the virus after
being bitten.

Rabies was eliminated from the animal population in the UK in the
early 20th century, but it continues to infect a variety of animals in
other parts of the world. 20 cases of rabies have been reported in
England and Wales since 1946, which were all imported. A licensed bat
handler died in Scotland from a rare form of rabies caught from a bat
in 2002.

[It is important to note that this occurred in a quarantine facility,
and shows the value of the UK?s 6-month quarantine period requirement
for imported dogs and cats. Presumably the 3 people who were bitten
had all been pre-vaccinated against rabies because of the hazards of
the job, and their hospital treatment included booster vaccinations. -
