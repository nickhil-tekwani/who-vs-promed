Osamu Corporation of Gardena, California, is recalling up to 1800
cases, lot number7013, of frozen ground tuna because the FDA found
decomposition in several samples of the product and also found
elevated histamine levels in samples taken from a retail location.
Osamu Corporation is recalling the product in an abundance of caution
since decomposed product may promote formation of histamine. Histamine
consumed in food can cause reactions that exhibit symptoms of tingling
or burning sensation in the mouth, facial swelling, rash, hives and
itchy skin, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. However, individuals may
experience symptoms differently. Persons developing these symptoms
should seek medical attention.

The frozen ground tuna was shipped to 3 distributors from 18 Aug 2011
to 8 Sep 2011. The distributors have removed the product from the
marketplace and are destroying any remaining product.

The 3 distributors are AFC Corporation, Red Shell Foods, and Pacific
Fresh Fish Company. 2 of these distributors have sushi franchises
located in grocery stores. Stores and locations to which this product
was shipped are listed at the bottom of this announcement. One,
Pacific Fresh Fish Company of Los Angeles, is a cash and carry
establishment.

Consumers concerned about whether the sushi they purchased may contain
the ground tuna should check with the store where they purchased the
sushi. That store will be able to determine if it used the recalled
product to prepare the sushi. At this time Osamu does not believe that
the recalled product or sushi made with the recalled product is
available for purchase by consumers.

3 illnesses due to elevated histamine levels have been reported to
date, all involving sushi purchased at a single location. The cause of
the elevated histamine levels found in the ground tuna at that
location is presently unknown.

Red Shell Foods has sushi franchises in grocery markets in the state
of California in the following cities: Calabasas, Century City, Dana
Point, Encino, Hollywood, Irvine, Los Angeles, Marina del Rey, Newport
Beach, North Hollywood, Northridge, Pacific Palisades, Pasadena, Santa
Barbara, Sherman Oaks, Silverlake, Tarzana, West Hollywood, and
Westlake Village.

AFC has sushi franchises at counters in grocery stores in nearly every
state.

[Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of
accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced
and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize naturally
occurring histidine in fish. This most often occurs when fish is held
at ambient or high temperatures (such as 70 to 90 deg F / 21.1 to 32.2
deg C) for several hours, but can occur at more moderate temperatures
(over 45 deg F or over 7.2 deg C). Rapid chilling of fish immediately
after catch is the most effective measure to prevent scombroid fish
poisoning. Fish from the family _Scombridae_ (such as tuna and
mackerel) contain high levels of free histidine in muscle tissue and
are the commonest sources of scombroid fish poisoning, but other fish
(such as mahi mahi, amberjack, bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also
have been implicated.

The symptoms of scombroid are identical to those of an allergic
reaction since the mediator of both are the same, histamine; but in
scombroid's case, the histamine is externally produced and not
secreted by the affected person's mast cells. The symptoms generally
begin 15-60 minutes after ingestion and usually resolves within
several hours. - Mod.LL]
