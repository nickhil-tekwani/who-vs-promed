Citation: Qaseem A, Yost J, Etxeandia-Ikobaltzeta I, Humphrey LL. Update alert 2: Should clinicians use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin for the prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19? Ann Intern Med. Epub 30 Jul 2020. https://doi.org/10.7326/L20-1007

This letter serves to retire the American College of Physicians' (ACP) rapid, living practice points on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin for the prophylaxis or treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2) from the living status. This decision was made in light of recent information on the topic. Three large in-progress randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with strong study designs ceased enrollment for the hydroxychloroquine-only vs control comparison early due to lack of efficacy in preliminary analyses (3-5). In addition, the 2 literature updates produced no evidence to alter these conclusions. The US Food and Drug Administration also recently revoked its emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 due to potential significant harms and lack of benefits (6). The ACP's Scientific Medical Policy Committee (SMPC) has determined that the emergence of new evidence is unlikely to change the existing practice points; therefore, regularly scheduled updates are no longer warranted. The SMPC will continue to review the planned ongoing surveillance through November 2020 (7). The updated evidence review (8) identified 1 new RCT (9), 5 new cohort studies (10-14), and published reports of studies previously available as preprints, which resulted in changes in rating of the risk of bias (15,16). A 6th newly published large cohort study was identified but not considered further because it was retracted due to concerns about the veracity of the data (17,18). The newly available evidence has high risk of bias and showed conflicting direction and magnitude of results, leading to unchanged conclusions from the initial review with insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness or safety of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Furthermore, 3 RCTs were stopped early (3-5) and no data were available to assess from those RCTs.

Practice points
- Do not use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin as prophylaxis against COVID-19.
- Do not use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin as a treatment of patients with COVID-19.
- Clinicians may choose to treat hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin in the context of a clinical trial, using shared and informed decision-making with patients (and their families).

[2] Post-COVID-19 sequelae

[AA's] neuroscience lab reopened last month [June 2020] without her. Life for the 38-year-old is a pale shadow of what it was before [17 Mar 2020], the day she first experienced symptoms of the novel coronavirus. At University College London (UCL), [her] students probe how the brain organizes memories to support learning, but at home, she struggles to think clearly and battles joint and muscle pain. Her early symptoms were textbook for COVID-19: a fever and cough, followed by shortness of breath, chest pain, and extreme fatigue. [Her] symptoms waxed and waned without ever going away. She's had just 3 weeks since March [2020] when her body temperature was normal.

"Everybody talks about a binary situation, you either get it mild and recover quickly, or you get really sick and wind up in the ICU," [she said], who falls into neither category. Thousands echo her story in online COVID-19 support groups. Outpatient clinics for survivors are springing up, and some are already overburdened.

The list of lingering maladies from COVID-19 is longer and more varied than most doctors could have imagined. Ongoing problems include fatigue, a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, achy joints, foggy thinking, a persistent loss of sense of smell, and damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. The likelihood of a patient developing persistent symptoms is hard to pin down because different studies track different outcomes and follow survivors for different lengths of time. One group in Italy found that 87% of a patient cohort hospitalized for acute COVID-19 was still struggling 2 months later. Data from the COVID Symptom Study, which uses an app into which millions of people in the USA, United Kingdom, and Sweden have tapped their symptoms, suggest 10% to 15% of people -- including some "mild" cases -- don't quickly recover. But with the crisis just months old, no one knows how far into the future symptoms will endure, and whether COVID-19 will prompt the onset of chronic diseases.

Researchers are now facing a familiar COVID-19 narrative: trying to make sense of a mystifying illness. Distinct features of the virus, including its propensity to cause widespread inflammation and blood clotting, could play a role in the assortment of concerns now surfacing. "We're seeing a really complex group of ongoing symptoms," says Rachael Evans, a pulmonologist at the University of Leicester. Survivor studies are starting to probe them. This month [July 2020], researchers across the United Kingdom, including Evans, launched a study that will follow 10 000 survivors for 1 year to start, and up to 25 years. Ultimately, researchers hope not just to understand the disease's long shadow, but also to predict who's at highest risk of lingering symptoms and learn whether treatments in the acute phase of illness can head them off.

For Gotz Martin Richter, a radiologist at the Klinikum Stuttgart in Germany, what's especially striking is that just as the illness' acute symptoms vary unpredictably, so, too, do those that linger. Richter thinks of 2 patients he has treated: a middle-aged man who experienced mild pneumonia from COVID-19 and an elderly woman already suffering from chronic leukemia and arterial disease who almost died from the virus and had to be resuscitated. Three months later, the man with the mild case "falls asleep all day long and cannot work," Richter says. The woman has minimal lung damage and feels fine.

Early in the pandemic, doctors learned that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can disrupt a breathtaking array of tissues in the body. Like a key fitting neatly into a lock, SARS-CoV-2 uses a spike protein on its surface to latch onto cells' ACE2 receptors. The lungs, heart, gut, kidneys, blood vessels, and nervous system, among other tissues, carry ACE2 on their cells' surfaces -- and thus are vulnerable to COVID-19. The virus can also induce a dramatic inflammatory reaction, including in the brain. Often, "The danger comes when the body responds out of proportion to the infection," says Adrija Hajra, a physician at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. She continues to care for those who were infected in the spring and are still recovering.

Despite the novelty of SARS-CoV-2, its long-term effects have precedents: Infections with other pathogens are associated with lasting impacts ranging from heart problems to chronic fatigue. "Medicine has been used to dealing with this problem" of acute viral illness followed by ongoing symptoms, says Michael Zandi, a neurologist at UCL. Even common illnesses such as pneumonia can mean a months-long recovery. "I see a lot of people who had [the brain inflammation] encephalitis 3, 4 years ago, and still can't think, or are tired," Zandi says. Infections with certain bacteria and Zika virus, among others, are linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, in which the immune system attacks nerve tissue, causing tingling, weakness, and paralysis. (Some cases of Guillain-Barre after COVID-19 have been reported, but "it's not definite [there's] a spike," says Rachel Brown, a UCL neurologist who works with Zandi.)

Based on experience with other viruses, doctors can "extrapolate and anticipate" potential long-term effects of COVID-19, says Jeffrey Goldberger, chief of cardiology at the University of Miami. Like SARS-CoV-2, some other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr, can damage heart tissue, for example. In those infections, the organ sometimes heals completely. Sometimes, scarring is mild. "Or," Goldberger says, "it could be severe and lead to heart failure."

Michael Marks, an infectious disease specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who's helping lead the UK survivor study, says he's not too surprised at emerging aftereffects. "What we're experiencing is an epidemic of severe illness," he says. "So, therefore, there is an epidemic" of chronic illness that follows it.

But outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 also appear distinct in ways both hopeful and dispiriting. Early this year [2020], many doctors feared the virus would induce extensive, permanent lung damage in many survivors because 2 other coronaviruses, the viruses that cause the 1st severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, can devastate the lungs. One study of healthcare workers with SARS in 2003 found that those with lung lesions 1 year after infection still had them after 15 years. "We expected to see a lot of long-term damage from COVID-19: scarring, decreased lung function, decreased exercise capacity," says Ali Gholamrezanezhad, a radiologist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California who in mid-January [2020] began to review lung scans from COVID-19 patients in Asia. Hundreds of scans later, he has concluded that COVID-19 ravages the lungs less consistently and aggressively than SARS did, when about 20% of patients sustained lasting lung damage. "COVID-19 is in general a milder disease," he says.

At the same time, the sheer breadth of complications linked to COVID-19 is mind-boggling. In late April 2020, [AA] collaborated with Body Politic, a group of COVID-19 survivors, to survey more than 600 who still had symptoms after 2 weeks. She logged 62 different symptoms and is now readying the findings for publication and developing a 2nd survey to capture longer term ailments. "Even though it's one virus, it can cause all different kinds of diseases in people," says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who is studying lingering effects on the immune system.

By now it's clear that many people with COVID-19 severe enough to put them in a hospital face a long recovery. The virus ravages the heart, for example, in multiple ways. Direct invasion of heart cells can damage or destroy them. Massive inflammation can affect cardiac function. The virus can blunt the function of ACE2 receptors, which normally help protect heart cells and degrade angiotensin II, a hormone that increases blood pressure. Stress on the body from fighting the virus can prompt release of adrenaline and epinephrine, which can also "have a deleterious effect on the heart," says Raul Mitrani, a cardiac electrophysiologist at the University of Miami who collaborates with Goldberger.

Mitrani and Goldberger, who co-authored a June [2020] paper in Heart Rhythm urging follow-up of patients who might have heart damage, worry in particular about the blood enzyme troponin, which is elevated in 20% to 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and signifies cardiac damage. But other patients are affected without apparent risk factors: A paper this week [end of July 2020] in JAMA Cardiology found that 78 of 100 people diagnosed with COVID-19 had cardiac abnormalities when their heart was imaged on average 10 weeks later, most often inflammation in heart muscle. Many of the participants in that study were previously healthy, and some even caught the virus while on ski trips, according to the authors.

Severe lung scarring appears less common than feared -- Gholamrezanezhad knows of only one recovered patient who still needs oxygen at rest. Scarring seems most likely to accompany underlying lung disease, hypertension, obesity, and other conditions.

Then there's the nervous system, a worrying target. Severe complications seem relatively rare but aren't limited to those whom the virus renders critically ill. Brown, Zandi, and colleagues described 43 people with neurologic complications this month [July 2020] in the journal Brain.

Separately, doctors are starting to see a class of patients who, like [AA], struggle to think clearly -- another outcome physicians have come upon in the past. After some severe viral infections, there are "those people who still don't feel quite right afterward, but have normal brain scans," Brown says. Some neurologists and patients describe the phenomenon as "brain fog." It's largely a mystery, though one theory suggests it's similar to a "postviral fatigue related to inflammation in the body," Brown says.

The most bedeviling and common lingering symptom seems to be fatigue, but researchers caution against calling it chronic fatigue syndrome. Iwasaki is especially struck by the number of young, healthy, active people -- people like [AA] -- who fall into the long-hauler category. As she and others struggle to find ways to help them, she wonders what might head off their symptoms. One possibility, she says, is monoclonal antibodies, which are now being tested as a treatment for acute infection and might also forestall lasting immune problems.

Hers is one of several survivor studies now underway. While Goldberger's hometown of Miami faces a surge of acutely ill patients, he is looking ahead, applying for funding to image the heart and map its electrical activity in COVID-19 patients after they leave the hospital. Gholamrezanezhad is recruiting 100 patients after hospital discharge to follow for up to 2 years for lung assessments. Across the Atlantic Ocean, Richter has recruited 300 volunteers in Germany for long-term follow-up, including lung scans. In the United Kingdom, patients will soon be able to sign up for that country's survivor study, with many giving blood samples and being examined by specialists. The researchers will probe patients' DNA and examine other characteristics such as age and health history to learn what might protect them from, or make them susceptible to, a range of COVID-19-induced health problems. Knowing who's at risk of, say, kidney failure or cardiac arrhythmia could mean more targeted follow-up. The UK researchers are also keen to see whether patients who received certain treatments in the acute phase of illness, such as steroids or blood thinners, are less prone to later complications.

The COVID Symptom Study welcomes anyone infected, and with 10% to 15% of people who use the app reporting ongoing symptoms, it has already yielded a welter of data, says Andrew Chan, an epidemiologist and physician at Harvard Medical School. As he and his colleagues parse the data, they are identifying distinct "types" of acute illness, based on clusters of symptoms. Chan wonders whether certain early symptoms correlate with specific ones that linger.

One of the few systematic, long-term studies of COVID-19 patients with mild acute symptoms is underway in San Francisco, where researchers are recruiting 300 adults from local doctors and hospitals, for 2 years of follow-up. "We don't have a broad idea of what's happening" after the initial illness, says Steven Deeks, an HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who is leading the study. More than 100 people ranging in age from 18 to 80 years have signed up so far. Cardiologists, neurologists, pulmonologists, and others are assessing the volunteers, and blood, saliva, and other biological specimens are being banked and analyzed.

The message many researchers want to impart: Don't underestimate the force of this virus. "Even if the story comes out a little scary, we need a bit of that right now," Iwasaki says, because the world needs to know how high the stakes are. "Once the disease is established, it's really hard to go backward."

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 31 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- In his regular media briefing, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros highlighted the high rates of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, drawing attention to a recently published WHO policy brief. Dr. Tedros also reminded us that COVID-19 is not only a disease that affects the elderly and that "young people must take the same precautions to protect themselves and protect others as everyone else. They can be leaders -- they should be leaders and drivers of change."

- During this pandemic, even the strongest health systems in the world have been overwhelmed and unable to adequately provide essential health services and care for conditions not associated with COVID-19. In an address to the Virtual Symposium on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and HIV on SDG 3.3, WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge emphasized the need to "be on the alert to expand capacity to deal with a resurgence of COVID-19 and, at the same time, to maintain essential health services."

- WHO has published interim guidance on the provision of safe water, sanitation and waste management and hygienic conditions, which is essential for preventing disease and for protecting human health during all infectious disease outbreaks, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Today's Subject in Focus highlights new guidance on public health considerations while resuming international travel.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 58.8% of the global newly reported cases and 67.0% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 9.1 million cases. Brazil reported 40.2% of cases (69 074), the USA 38.0% (65 406), Colombia 5.0% (8670), Mexico 3.3% (5752), Peru 3.3% (5678), Argentina 3.3% (5641), and Chile 1.1% (1961).

- The European region reported 8.6% of the global newly reported cases and 6.4% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 21.7% (5482) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 11.0% (2789), Israel 7.8% (1965), Kazakhstan 5.6% (1414), Romania 5.4% (1356), France 4.7% (1193), Ukraine 4.3% (1090), Turkey 3.8% (967), Germany 3.6% (902), Uzbekistan 2.7% (686), the UK 3.4% (846), Kyrgyzstan 2.6% (662) and Poland 2.4% (615). While the proportion of cases represented by Russia is continuing to drop, the absolute numbers of cases is relatively stable in keeping with the increase in activity in Eastern European countries. Spain and France are having renewed increased transmission, and Eastern Europe remains active.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.3% of the global newly reported cases and 6.7% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 23.5% (2963), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 20.8% (2621), Saudi Arabia 12.9% (1629), Morocco 8.3% (1046), Pakistan 7.2% (903), Kuwait 5.0% (626), Oman 4.7% (590), Bahrain 3.5% (444), Egypt 3.2% (401), and Palestinian Authority 3.0% (380). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020 (on 1 Jul 2020, Pakistan reported 4133 newly confirmed cases), while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq, Oman and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 5.5% of the global newly reported cases and 5.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 68.9% (11 046) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by [Ghana 0% (0); no updated case report], Ethiopia 5.0% (805), Kenya 4.9% (788), Algeria 3.8% (602), Nigeria 3.0% (481), and Madagascar 2.7% (431). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000, 20 of the 31 days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.3% of the global newly reported cases and 0.57% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 59.1% (3888) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 20.1% (1323), Australia 11.0% (721), Singapore 4.2% (278), China 4.2% (276), Viet Nam 0.76% (50), and South Korea 0.55% (36). Japan is definitely experiencing an increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 20.5% of the global newly reported cases and 13.4% of global deaths. India reported 91.6% (55 078) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.5% (2695) and Indonesia 3.2% (1904). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (30 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with a daily case count today [31 Jul 2020] approaching 60 000.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported (70 904) cases followed by India (57 704) and Brazil (52 509). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (51.1%). There were 6476 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Russia, and the Philippines -- all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3980 to 70 904. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, Spain, Bangladesh, Iran, Chile, Indonesia, Equatorial Guinea, Dominican Republic, Bolivia, and Saudi Arabia, and their range of reported new cases is 1686 to 3346. This is the 1st appearance of Equatorial Guinea on the "hot spot" lists -- with today's report of newly confirmed cases in Equatorial Guinea representing a 57.0% increase in total reported cases in the past 24 hours. The Worldometer growth curve for Equatorial Guinea shows an inconsistent case reporting trend with significant increases followed by periods of no reported cases (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/equatorial-guinea/).

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 3.7%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 7.0%. The key question arises as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or is this a reporting artifact? Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances.

Impression: Essentially unchanged. The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
