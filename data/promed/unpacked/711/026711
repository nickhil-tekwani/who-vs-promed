Moderate to high levels of southern rust in south east and east central
Kansas corn fields sounded an alarm for a Kansas State University plant
pathologist. "Yield impacts should be minimal there, since many fields are
within a few weeks of harvest. In the rest of the state, however, some of
the corn still has a lot of growing to do. So, scouting for this disease
could be important," said Doug Jardine, crop disease specialist with
K-State Research and Extension.
Applying a fungicide to infected corn that's already denting doesn't
typically pay in terms of increased yields, Jardine said. It might pay for
corn in the soft dough stage if the crop's yield potential is 'exceedingly
high'. "But in fields where the disease is attacking corn that hasn't
reached those stages, a fungicide application would definitely be worth
considering," he said.
The spores of the southern rust-causing fungus are wind-blown. New
infections can occur every 7 days, Jardine warned. And, when the humidity
is high and temperatures are warm, southern rust can cause so many plant
lesions that it results in leaf blighting.
Early southern rust lesions on leaves are small and circular to oval in
shape, often with a prominent light green to yellow halo. In contrast,
common rust lesions are usually larger and longer. "An even more noticeable
difference is that southern rust lesions develop almost exclusively on the
upper leaf surfaces. Common rust lesions develop on both upper and lower
leaf surfaces," Jardine said. "Besides, southern rust lesions can also
develop on stalk, husk, and leaf sheath tissues."
As rust lesions mature, the disease-causing fungus erupts through the leaf
surface, and spore pustules emerge. With southern rust, the pustules are
light orange to cinnamon-red and can be numerous, even clustered. In common
rust, they're a darker brick red to red-brown and fewer in number. As the
season progresses, both rusts may darken as they produce black teliospores
("resting" spores) in a ring around the lesions.

[2] Ear rots, maize - USA (Minnesota)

Not only have the hot and dry conditions and hail affected corn yields in
Minnesota this year [2007], but these conditions have also favored
development of ear rots. Reports of ear rots have been coming in from
several different areas, and the quality of grain that comes off these
affected fields may be reduced. Aspergillus and fusarium ear rots may be of
particular importance due to the hot and dry conditions in much of
Minnesota this year [2007].
Aspergillus ear rot is caused by the fungus _Aspergillus flavus_. This
disease can become common under high temperatures and low soil moisture.
Patches of green to yellow spores form on or between kernels. The fungus
can become dark green to brown as it ages. It is most common at tips of
ears and often only affects a few kernels or small areas of the ear.
_Aspergillus_ species can also cause storage rot. This fungus can invade
kernels with moisture levels as low as 15 per cent, especially if kernels
have been damaged or have come from rotted ears.
Aspergillus can produce aflatoxin, a mycotoxin that is toxic to animals and
humans. The presence of the ear rot does not mean the corn definitely has
high levels of aflatoxin. The grain must be tested to determine how much
aflatoxin is present. Screening tests are available for aflatoxin.
Fusarium ear rot is caused by the fungi _Fusarium verticillioides_ and _F.
proliferatum_. This disease is commonest when the weather is hot and dry at
flowering. Infected kernels have whitish-pink to salmon-colored fungal
growth that is often seen at the ear tip, but infected groups of kernels or
individual kernels may be scattered on the ear. Infected kernels can have a
"starburst" symptom, which appears as white lines radiating out from a
point on the kernel without the clear presence of fungal growth. Kernels
can also be infected at the embryo end and symptoms may not be visible.
Symptoms may vary according to the genotype of the corn hybrid,
environment, or disease severity. Infection is favored by damage to the ears.
Fusarium can produce a mycotoxin called fumonisin, which can be harmful to
animals and humans. Fumonisin production is reported to be favored by
drought conditions. The FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] has
recommended different maximum levels for total fumonisins for animal and
human consumption. Grain must be tested to determine the levels of
fumonisin that may be present.

[_Puccinia polysora_ causes southern rust in maize. The fungus occurs in
most tropical and subtropical regions. The disease can cause significant
losses of over 50 per cent. _P. polysora_ needs living host tissue for
survival and spores are wind dispersed. The disease is favoured by warm,
humid conditions. Resistant or tolerant ('slow rusting') varieties are
being developed. Common rust of maize is caused by the related species
_Puccinia sorghi_.
Several species of aspergillus can infect maize in the field. _A. flavus_
is mainly a saprophyte degrading dead tissue of any origin, and it is
therefore important in nutrient recycling. However, it can also be
pathogenic on some plant species causing, for example, one of the fungal
ear rots of maize. Spores can be dispersed in soil, by air or carried by
insects. The fungus has also great significance as a post-harvest pathogen
of many crops since aflatoxin may cause severe poisoning in animals and humans.
Several _Fusarium_ species may be responsible for another type of fungal
ear rot. _Gibberella fujikuroi_ (previously _Fusarium verticillioides_) is
of concern because it produces the toxin fumonisin. It is probably the
commonest pathogen of maize ears throughout the world. _F. proliferatum_
also produces mycotoxins.
Fusarium ear rots caused by _Gibberella fujikuroi_ (_F. verticillioides_),
_F. proliferatum_, or _F. subglutinans_, and _Aspergillus_ ear rot caused
by _A. flavus_, are often associated with insect damage to ears or kernels
which provides easy entrance points for the fungi. For example, ears
infested by earworms are usually infected with _Gibberella fujikuroi_.
