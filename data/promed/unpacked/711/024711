Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a goat in France
-----------------------------------------------------
The occurrence of the 1st case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in
a goat in France was confirmed on 28 Jan 2005 by a panel of scientific
experts from specialised laboratories in the European Union including the
OIE Reference Laboratory for BSE, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency at
Weybridge in the United Kingdom.
The French Veterinary Authorities had informed the OIE in Nov 2004 that the
animal, which was 2.5 years old at the time of its slaughter in 2002,
formed part of a flock of 600 goats including 300 adults. The entire herd
had been culled and all the adult goats were tested for scrapie at that
time, with negative results. All the carcasses, including that of the
affected goat, were destroyed. The scrapie isolate from the infected goat
was subjected to further diagnostic testing by inoculation in transgenic
mice, which is the reference test to distinguish BSE from scrapie. The
necessity to wait for several months to obtain such diagnosis explains the
long delay in confirming the case.
Through its network of Reference Laboratories and experts, the OIE
maintains a close watch on all events related to BSE and is well aware of
the importance of reaching a full understanding of this case.
It has therefore called a meeting of internationally renowned BSE experts
at the OIE Headquarters, Paris, France on 17-18 Mar 2005. During this
meeting, the experts will discuss the possible existence of BSE phenotypes,
including the BSE situation in goats. The potential impact of BSE in goats
on public health will also be discussed, although it is noted that any
possible risk to consumers is currently to be considered as negligible in
view of the extremely low prevalence of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies in goats, and the public health measures already in place
in the EU. The experts will also discuss whether the OIE needs to modify
its international standards on BSE and scrapie to address this new
situation. The outcomes of this meeting will be discussed by all OIE Member
Countries at the annual OIE General Session in May 2005.
The OIE works in close collaboration with the European Union (EU) regarding
BSE. The surveillance standards on BSE proposed by the OIE to its 167
Member Countries take on board the expertise provided by the EU.

[The prevalence of (clinical) cases of scrapie is indeed believed to be
much lower in goats than in sheep. However, though the results of the
testing recently (1st semester of 2004) performed in EU member states,
especially in healthy animals, demonstrate a significantly different
prevalence in sheep and goats, this difference is not overwhelming: Sheep
-- 173 572 animals tested, 833 positive, 428 pending. Goats -- 17 294
tested, 47 positive, 52 pending.
The following additional information, derived from EU's MEMO/05/29
published on 28 Jan 2005, provides interesting background:
"Until now more than 140 000 goats have been tested in the EU with 134
TSE-positive results. Of those 134 TSE-positive animals, 30 animals were
submitted for a 2nd stage of testing (discriminatory molecular testing),
designed to differentiate between scrapie and BSE. 6 of these cases were
shown to have a suspect type of TSE which could be BSE and were submitted
for a 3rd stage of testing (the mouse bioassay). 2 of these have been
proven negative and another 3 are in the final stages, expected to be
negative. One case has now been confirmed positive".
When available, the final results of the 3 pending cases will be
appreciated; they should be compared with the accumulated data of similar
mice-inoculation tests carried out in sampled TSE-positive sheep material.
