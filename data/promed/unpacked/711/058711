The RIVM [Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the
Environment] expert consultation on Q-fever advises the Ministry of
Agriculture to remove [in fact, kill] all pregnant goats from farms
infected with Q fever.

This advice is included in the opinion paper, submitted by RIVM to
the Ministry. The measure is meant to be applied on holdings where
bulk milk tests have repeatedly been found positive for Q fever.

The expert consultation related to this as a one-off measure to
prevent infection spread during the due kidding season, when
apparently normal or aborted offspring may spread the pathogen. "It
is possible that uninfected pregnant goats will be removed as well,"
writes the RIVM. The organization indicates that there may be a
distinction made between vaccinated and unvaccinated holdings. "In
unvaccinated holdings, this strategy is the only way to eliminate or
substantially reduce the secretion of the pathogen in 2010," said the
RIVM. "On vaccinated holdings, this strategy can be used as an
additional reducing measure, because these holdings have already
reduced the secretion by the vaccination."

It has also been recommended to continue the vaccination strategy as
well as to temporarily ban increase in the size of goat holdings or
adding new ones.

The expert consultation involved both veterinary as well as public
health experts. The ministries of agriculture and health are expected
to decide during this week about the approach towards Q fever
control. The experts' advice addresses 8 possible strategies.

[According to data from RIVM, as of 25 Nov 2009, 2293 clinical cases
of Q fever and 6 fatalities have been recorded during 2009 (as of 25
Nov 2009). The numbers for previous years were: 2007 -- 168, 2008 --
1000. A histogram presenting weekly figures for the period 1 Jan 2007
- 25 Nov 2009, and a map showing the affected regions, are available
at <http://www.rivm.nl/cib/themas/Q-koorts/index.jsp>.

This Q fever outbreak, soon to enter its 4th year, has become the
world's largest on record. Satisfactory explanation for the highly
unusual event, characterized by mass infections in humans in spite of
the rather low-keyed clinical disease in animals, and the underlined
role of goats, is still anticipated. The destruction of pregnant
animals as a preventive measure to protect humans is unusual as well.
Debates in the Dutch Parliament, reportedly scheduled for next week,
reflect the growing concern on this issue.
