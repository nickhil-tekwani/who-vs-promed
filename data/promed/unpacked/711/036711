[Viet Nam sent its last follow-up report (No. 19) to OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health) on 23 Apr 2008 (see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6994>).

Contrary to the previous statement of 12 Mar 2008 on the epizootic
being resolved, according to follow-up report 19, "The event is
continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted."

According to the media reports, in May 2008 there were 3 infected
areas, namely in the northern Son La province, southern Vinh Long
province, and southern Can Tho city (see ProMED-mail 20080511.1605).
It seems the disease continues its simmering; a clarification, in a
new follow-up report, may be in place. - Mod.AS]
