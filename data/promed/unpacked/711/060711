Indonesia has detected a sharp rise in bird flu cases in July [2016] since the country's last report of an unexpected climb earlier this year, bringing the total number of the cases so far in 2016 to 188.

"The number of bird flu cases has risen in 7 consecutive months since January 2016, with the highest number of cases recorded in April 2016, which is quite alarming. It subsequently fell from May to June 2016, only to rise again this month [July 2016]," Agriculture Ministry official Muhammad Azhar said on Friday [29 Jul 2016].

He made the comments when explaining the results of the government's monitoring of bird flu trends in 2016 to the audience at a poultry health and production seminar in Jakarta.

Azhar said as many as 92 014 poultry had died as a result of the bird flu virus in the last 7 months. Most of them were ducks and layer poultry, which made up almost 60 percent of the total number. The remainder were quails, free-range village chickens and broilers, he added.

Data show that the 3 provinces with the highest number of [outbreaks] are West Java with 65 in total, Lampung with 28 and South Sulawesi with 23 [outbreaks].

Azhar said the highest number of poultry deaths nationwide was recorded in March 2016 with 48 066 deaths, followed by 15 581 in February 2016.

The following months saw vast improvements, with the number of poultry deaths declining to 9860 in April and to 558 in June 2016. However, the rates rose by more than tenfold in July 2016, with 6550 cases recorded, Azhar said.

Azhar noted that the rainy season, which occurred throughout the 1st few months of the year, might have contributed to the deaths of the birds, which might have been vulnerable given poor farm conditions and sanitation.

He further said that monitoring by the ministry's officials had revealed that many farms failed to implement biosecurity measures, a framework in quality maintenance of farm and poultry products developed in collaboration with the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) more than a decade ago, after the virus was 1st detected in Indonesia.

The numbers of dead birds reported by the ministry are not excessive in relative terms and compared to other countries. This may be indicative of the rather small size of the affected holdings, which are, most probably, not commercial farms.

Since the start of the HPAI H5N1 event in 2003, and as of 28 Jul 2016, human cases have been reported from 16 countries with 854 cases, of which 450 reportedly died. The countries most affected are Egypt (354 cases, 117 deaths), Indonesia (199, 167), Viet Nam (127, 64), Cambodia (56, 37), and mainland China (53, 31). Its incidence in poultry, and subsequently in humans, demonstrates a seasonal pattern. The countries which have reported human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) during the past 6 months are Egypt and mainland China.

Detailed quantitative information on HPAI H5N1 in poultry by state and month was last reported by Indonesia for the year 2014 (see at http://tinyurl.com/hyxly65, scroll down). According to the report, Indonesia applies vaccination of poultry against the disease. - Mod.AS
