For the 1st time since the COVID-19 pandemic began in earnest in March 2020 in the United States, nearly all of the deaths recorded in recent weeks were preventable, occurring in unvaccinated Americans.

According to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from May [2021], only about 150 of the more than 18 000 COVID-19 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people, or less than 1%. This translates to 5 deaths per day attributed to fully vaccinated Americans experiencing breakthrough infections, and roughly 300 deaths per day in the unvaccinated (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187).

Vaccination has also reduced US hospitalizations significantly: Fully vaccinated people made up less than 1200 of more than 853 000 COVID-19 hospitalizations in May [2021].

The United States reported 12 830 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [24 Jun 2021], and 341 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). In total, the nation has confirmed 33 593 763 cases, including 603 238 deaths.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 379 248 700 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States, and 320 687 205 have been administered, with 151 252 034 Americans fully vaccinated (65.7% of adults have at least one dose; https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations).

About 95% of vaccinated Americans have used a 2-dose mRNA vaccine, either one from Pfizer or Moderna. The vaccination is considered complete 2 weeks after the 2nd dose of vaccine is administered, but more than 1 in 10 people who have received one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine have missed their 2nd dose, according to CDC data shared with CNN (https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/25/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html).

Experts have warned that only one dose of mRNA vaccine offers limited protection against new variants, including the Delta variant (B1617.2).

Southern states [continue] to lag behind Northern and Midwestern states in terms of vaccination rates. Six of the bottom 8 states with the lowest vaccination rates in the country are in the South, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee.

Louisiana, which has vaccinated just 34% of its population, has become the latest state to use a lottery prize to entice people to get a COVID-19 vaccine, the New York Times reports (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/25/us/louisiana-covid-vaccination-lottery.html). The state will offer a total of USD 2.3 million in cash prizes and scholarships over a month.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impaired the mental health of public health workers, according to a study today in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (Bryant-Genevier et al. http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7026e1).

A total of 26 174 state, tribal, local, and territorial public health workers were surveyed on mental health in the past 2 weeks, and 53% reported symptoms of at least one mental health condition. Of the 53%, 32% reported symptoms of depression, 30.3% anxiety (30.3%), 36.8% post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 8.4% suicidal ideation. Public health workers younger than 30 were most likely to report mental health symptoms.

"Most (92.6%) respondents reported working directly on COVID-19 response activities; the majority (59.2%) worked 41 or more hours in a typical week since March 2020," the authors wrote.

"The prevalences of all 4 mental health outcomes and the severity of symptoms of depression or PTSD increased as the percentage of work time spent directly on COVID-19 response activities and number of work hours in a typical week increased."

[2] Life expectancy shortened
Date: Fri 25 Jun 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/covid-cuts-us-life-expectancy-minorities-hit-hardest


The COVID-19 pandemic's effect on US life expectancy has disproportionately hit minorities, according to new studies in BMJ and JAMA Network Open, with the former finding that overall US life expectancy -- which dropped almost 2 years from 2018 to 2020 -- hasn't been this low since 1943, during World War II.

"I've been studying the US health disadvantage for many years right now," says Laudan Aron, MA, co-author of the BMJ study and senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington, DC. "But it's always still a little shocking and distressing to see the numbers and just to see how exceptional and different we really are from so many other societies, which really kind of points to the fact that what we're witnessing is really a set of choices about how we have organized our society and how we are using human resources and supporting people."

The BMJ study included a look at life expectancy from 2010 to 2020 within the United States as well as the widening gap between US life expectancy and 16 high-income peer countries, including the United Kingdom, Israel, France, Denmark, Switzerland, and South Korea. Overall, US life expectancy increased 0.08 years from 2010 to 2018 but then decreased 1.87 years from 2018 to 2020 (78.74 to 76.87 years).

Men showed greater losses than women (-2.16 years vs -1.50 years), and Black and Hispanic people showed as much as 2.9 times the loss of White people (-3.25 and -3.88 years, respectively, vs -1.36 years). These decreases reverted Black men's life expectancy to their 1998 levels -- 67.73 years -- and erased the longevity advantage Hispanic men had (2.88 years longer than White men in 2018 to 0.20 years shorter in 2020).

While many peer countries did not have 2019 data available, the researchers note that, at least for the United States, most of the change was likely from the pandemic, as life expectancy increased by only 0.1 year from 2018 to 2019. Notable countries that were excluded for lack of information were Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, and Japan.

"The overall picture is not going to be different [if those countries were included]," Aron says. "There might be small changes in the numbers in terms of the differences of the United States and the average, but the United States has kind of been on the pretty unique, exceptional path in terms of its mortality and morbidity vis a vis these other advanced democracies, at least since 1980, and that was certainly true for 2020 as well."

Compared with other high-income countries, the United States widened the already existing life expectancy gap from 1.88 years lower in 2010, to 3.05 years in 2018, and now to 4.69 years lower in 2020. While 10 countries also saw decreases from 2018 to 2020, they were less than the United States, ranging from 0.12 in Sweden to 1.09 in Spain. The remaining 6 countries increased their life expectancy despite the pandemic.

The researchers stratified data by race only for the US population. Even so, they note that Black men and women saw decreases in life expectancy from 2018 to 2020 that were 12.3 and 20.3 times greater than peer countries' average decreases for men and women of any race. The corresponding comparison was even larger for the US Hispanic population, which saw 15.9 and 22.5 times greater decreases for their men and women, respectively. And, while US White people saw the least decrease (-1.36 years), it was still greater than what was seen in peer countries (-0.22 years).

"The large number of COVID-19 deaths in the US reflects not only the country's policy choices and mishandling of the pandemic but also deeply rooted factors that have put the country at a health disadvantage for decades," the researchers write. "Foremost among these root causes is systemic racism; extensive research has shown that systems of power in the US structure opportunity and assign value in ways that unfairly disadvantage Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Indigenous populations, and unfairly advantage White people."

Aron says, "It's not an academic, not a theoretical discussion, because other countries are supporting their populations and investing in the health and wellbeing of other people, often at a fraction of the cost."

In the JAMA Network Open research letter, the authors looked at how COVID-19 affected US life expectancy at birth from 1 Feb-3 Oct 2020 and compared their projected results for the rest of 2020 with the actual results.

With a medium-level COVID mortality simulation, they estimated that the total US population saw a 1.13-year decrease in life in 2020, with 0.68 years lost for White people, 2.10 years for Black people, and 3.05 years for Latino people.

The 2020 figures showed that White people lost 0.94 years (0.26 years over prediction), Black people lost 1.90 years (0.20 under), and Latinos lost 3.03 years (0.02 under). While the change in life expectancy for Black people was smaller than the authors thought, they attribute it to COVID surges in Midwestern and Mountain states.

As for Latino people, the authors say the pandemic made them more vulnerable because of factors such as multigenerational housing, frontline jobs, and lower healthcare insurance enrollment. Prior to COVID-19, they lived 7 years longer than Black people and 3 years longer than White people, smoked less, and had fewer comorbidities.

"Life expectancy is a metric of population-level mortality in a given year, and it is sensitive to deaths at younger ages," said lead author Theresa Andrasfay, PhD, of the University of Southern California (USC), in a USC press release yesterday [24 Jun 2021]. "Though COVID-19 disproportionately killed older Americans, substantial numbers of younger Black and Latino Americans had their lives taken by COVID-19, which contributed to greater life expectancy reductions for these populations" (https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uosc-uao062421.php).

The data included 380 868 COVID-19 deaths in 2020, with race/ethnicity available for more than 99% of them, including 230 016 White people, 60 405 Black people, and 69 066 Latino people. Incoming data for 2021 continue to show a loss in US life expectancy as well as racial disparities, the researchers write.

While the authors of the BMJ study and a related commentary by Magali Barbieri, PhD, with the Department of Demography at the University of California, Berkeley, caution that all life expectancy studies provide only a snapshot, they say they can show who was most affected. Aron adds that it's not all about recovering longevity; it's also about realizing what the emotional and economic consequences are to those who are left behind (https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1530).

"The COVID-19 pandemic has thus operated as a magnifier of already existing vulnerabilities within the US population," Barbieri concludes in her commentary. "Understanding the reasons for the disproportionate toll of the disease on the US population and developing appropriate interventions and policies provides an opportunity to correct the structural factors that have historically hampered US progress in life expectancy and that have driven large social and racial and ethnic inequities in the risks of death."

"'We have not seen a decrease like this since World War II. It's a horrific decrease in life expectancy,' said Steven Woolf of the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and an author of the study released on Wednesday [23 Jun 2021]. (The study is based on data from the National Center for Health Statistics and includes simulated estimates for 2020.)

"Beyond the more than 600 000 deaths in the USA directly from the coronavirus, other factors play into the decreased longevity, including 'disruptions in health care, disruptions in chronic disease management, and behavioral health crisis, where people struggling with addiction disorders or depression might not have gotten the help that they needed,' Woolf said.

"The lack of access to care and other pandemic-related disruptions hit some Americans much harder than others. And it's been well documented that the death rate for Black Americans was twice as high compared with white Americans" (https://www.npr.org/2021/06/23/1009611699/the-pandemic-led-to-the-biggest-drop-in-u-s-life-expectancy-since-ww-ii-study-fi).

[3] Africa: 3rd wave

Africa is battling a devastating resurgence -- the continent's 3rd major wave -- of the coronavirus, one that is predicted to be the worst yet. According to the WHO, cases have risen for 5 straight weeks since the beginning of May [2021], with a 21% increase this month over last. At the current rate, the agency estimates that the ongoing surge will surpass cases seen in the previous one in the next 2 weeks.

The spread of new variants has exacerbated the situation: The Delta variant, which is poised to become the most common one in many countries, has been reported in 14 African countries. Overall, African countries have recorded more than 5 million cases collectively, and nearly 140 000 deaths. At the same time, fewer than 1% of the continent's 1.3 billion people have been vaccinated.

["A deadly 3rd wave of COVID-19 is gathering force across many African countries powered by weak observance of public health measures, increased social activity, and the spread of variants, the WHO reports -- as well as shortages of oxygen and vaccines, and the indifference of wealthier countries."

"As of 20 Jun 2021 -- 48 days into the new wave -- Africa has logged approximately 474 000 new cases."

"'The numbers don't look good' for Uganda, reports NPR Goats and Soda's Jason Beaubien. Daily reported infections have increased 10-fold, hospitals are overflowing, and demand for medical oxygen vastly outstrips the country's production capacity.

"The Response: The WHO is deploying more experts to Uganda and other hard-hit countries, including Zambia, and supporting regional laboratories monitoring variants of concern. But a vaccine crunch persists.

"'Vaccine shortages are already prolonging the pain of COVID-19 in Africa. Let's not add injury to injustice,' said Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa, at a virtual press conference yesterday [24 Jun 2021], noting that while wealthy countries with high vaccine coverage revel in loosened restrictions, just over 1% of Africa's population has been fully vaccinated.

"Globally, out of approximately 2.7 billion doses, just under 1.5% have been administered across Africa" (from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Global Health Now https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2021-06/vaccine-oxygen-shortages-prolonging-pain-covid-19-africa). - Mod.LK]
