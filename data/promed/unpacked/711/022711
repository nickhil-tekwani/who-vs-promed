Local Health authorities in northern Alberta and in parts of Saskatchewan have determined an outbreak of whooping cough is present in the areas.

Jonathon Dyck with Northern Health says they are seeing an expected seasonal increase of whooping cough in northern BC [British Columbia], and they recommend residents keep up to date for routine immunizations, as those that are immunized are much less likely to get them [vaccine preventable diseases].

He says immunization is important because 'herd immunity' can help keep those who aren't able to be immunized healthy. He urges anyone who can be immunized to do so.

People who are under the age of 18 can get a whooping cough vaccine for free, and adults can pay a fee for one at a health unit.

Check out ImmunizeBC [http://immunizebc.ca] to get up to date information on diseases, vaccines, and schedules and to find an immunization clinic near you.
