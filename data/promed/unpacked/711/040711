South Africa-Decline in Bee numbers
-----------------------------------
It's unclear how a highly contagious brood disease entered South
Africa, but it could devastate commercial and hobby apiarists, and
farmers depending on bees for pollination. Haylee Robbins reports.
How American Foul Brood (AFB) disease came into South Africa is still
unknown, as imported honey and honeybee products are irradiated, but
with the advent of AFB in sub-Saharan Africa, an area previously free
of the disease, there's good reason to believe non-irradiated honey
or honeybee products have found a way into the country.

On 25 February 2009 the Agricultural Research Council Plant
Protection Research Institute (ARC-PPRI) confirmed the outbreak of
AFB in certain Western Cape honeybee colonies. Mike Allsopp, head of
the Honeybee Research Section of the ARC-PPRI, became aware of the
disease when a local beekeeper experienced problems with unhealthy
colonies.

The disease was 1st thought to be European Foul Brood, which plagued
Western Cape apiaries last year [2008], but as symptoms were atypical
samples were sent to the PPRI's laboratory in Pretoria. These tested
positive for AFB.

Since receiving notification of the outbreak from the Department of
Agriculture (DoA) John Moodie, the South African Bee Industry
Organisation (SABIO) chairperson, said 4 beekeeping operations in the
Western Cape have been confirmed to have AFB in their colonies. But
the extent of the infestation is still unknown as the signs are slow
to appear and surveys still need to be carried out.

The DoA urged all beekeepers to act with extreme caution, keep
colonies and apiaries apart and not to move honeybees from apiary to
apiary, and to treat all beekeeping equipment as contaminated.

Although the 4 contaminated apiaries are cooperating with
authorities, the only way to eradicate the disease is to burn the
entire hive, including the bees, wax, frames and honey, and bury the
ashes. Infected apiaries could face prolonged "standstill" orders of
up to 18 months and will need help and compensation to ensure their
continued viability and cooperation.

Allsopp said commercial beekeepers are likelier to comply with
rigorous elimination of infected hives, but smaller hobbyists may be
reluctant to report outbreaks and the issue could go underground. The
solution will depend largely on the action or inaction of beekeepers
and the DoA which is ultimately responsible for containing the
disease. If all beekeepers adhere to the department's advice until
the disease has been effectively quarantined and destroyed, they
could prevent its spread and a permanent battle with it. The disease
could destroy thousands of hives, cause poor pollination of crops and
orchards, and ruin beekeepers.

As South African bees are classified under "plant health" there is a
need to amend current legislation to allow for containment of the
disease. The DoA has established a management team and initiated an
interim plan which could see infected apiaries issued with an initial
"standstill" period of up to three months.

"The outbreak is being reported to the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) and draft regulations have been forwarded for
ministerial approval, which will soon be promulgated," said DoA
spokesperson Priscilla Tsotso Sehoole.

Know your enemy
---------------
A contaminated brood will have a distinctive smell, which the
ARC-PPRI's Mike Allsopp likened to a combination of "stale beer and
old boots." As the disease is new to South African beekeepers, the
1st sign to look for will be a discoloured, sunken brood,
coffee-coloured larvae and brown or black scales at the bottom of
honey cells. When a diseased larva is pricked with a twig or
matchstick it will come away with a mucous-like, ropy thread.
Diseased cells will have a shotgun or pepperbox pattern. Unchecked,
AFB will affect the entire brood and result in colonies becoming weak
and vulnerable to invasion. Badly affected colonies are likely to
collapse and die. When a colony dies, 'robber' bees from nearby
colonies carry the infected honey and pollen back to their colonies,
extending the outbreak to other areas. For more information visit

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[American foul brood may have found its way to South Africa in
something other than infected honey or bees. The bacterium
_Paenibacillus larvae_ (at one time known as _Bacillus larvae_) is
the causative agent. The disease is transferred and initiated only by
the spore stage of the bacterium. The reason this disease is so
serious is that the spores can remain viable and last indefinitely on
beekeeping equipment. It is extremely contagious and spreads easily
via contaminated equipment, hive tools, and beekeeper's hands. A
beekeeper's best way to manage AFB is to avoid it.

So it is entirely possible that equipment transported into South
Africa may well have had the spores.

There are at least 2 forms of treatment for infected colonies.
Treatment is effective and prevents destruction of the colony.
Tylosin tartrate (Tylosin), oxytetracycline hydrochloride
(Terramycin) are both effective antibiotic treatments. Reliance on
only one compound has prompted the emergence of resistant strains of
American foul brood.

The best method of control is avoidance but infected colonies can be
treated instead of destroyed.
