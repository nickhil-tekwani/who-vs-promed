WEST NILE VIRUS SEROSURVEY - USA (NEW YORK CITY): COMMENT

[ProMED-mail had passed on the information that --- "As many as 1900
Queens residents were unknowingly infected with the West Nile virus last
fall, New York City health officials have concluded in the aftermath of the
outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus that killed 7 people and sickened at
least 62 in the New York area.

Extrapolating from a survey in October across a three-square-mile swath of
northern Queens, the epicenter of last year's outbreak, officials concluded
that 533 to 1903 people, or about 2.6 percent of the area's 46 000
residents, had been infected with the virus, according to survey results
released yesterday."

The numbers reported in the WNV serosurvey bring many questions to mind.
From what I've read, there were no specific tests for WNV used in New York
until recently and that cases of WNV would produce a positive test for
other related forms of encephalitis known to be endemic in the region. This
suggests to me that they could have been missing the diagnosis of WNV in
previous years because they weren't looking for it. In addition, this
report states that "the survey did not examine the rate of infection for
the other boroughs".
If these facts are indeed true then how do they know that WNV had not been
occurring in New York prior to last year and was previously misidentified.
They surely can't conclude that from the data presented in this report
because it appears that all they have done is determine the number of
seropositive individuals in the epicenter of Northern Queens and assumed
they were all infected last year during the outbreak. Am I missing
something or have they given us just the numerator without the denominator,
and failed to determine a background rate of seropositivity for everyone in
the region?

[The way they know that WNV was not occurring in NY and was simply
misidentified is that there has not been anything like WNV found in that
area. Had there been an isolate identified as St. Louis encephalitis virus
(or some other flavivirus) found there, I am certain they would have jumped
all over that and reexamined it. SLE had not been found in NY -- ever.
The problem I have with understanding the data are: (1) the summary I have
seen did not include age-stratified antibody prevalence. The attack rate
in people >55 years of age is an important one. and (2) no mention was made
as to how long the seropositives had lived in the area. I am confident
that CDC will fine tune the data in the coming weeks, if they have not
already done so, and glean all sorts of interesting pieces of information
from them. Ray is correct, however; the conclusions are still incomplete.
I drove through the area yesterday. WNV is certainly a topic of
conversation there. - Mod.CHC
