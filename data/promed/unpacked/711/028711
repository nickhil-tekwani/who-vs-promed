Dutch television was cited as reporting today that up to 350 patients have
been injected with a blood product made with plasma from a British donor
who later died of what this story describes as a disorder linked to mad cow
disease, That product, Amerscan Pulmonate II, is injected into patients
requiring a lung scan and enables doctors using special equipment to get an
image of the lungs.
Although it was announced in Britain last year that some plasma used to
manufacture the product came from a donor who died of Creutzfeld-Jakob
disease, the Dutch cases were not reported until now.
The British manufacturer, Nycomed Amersham PLC, said at the time it had
recalled batches of the product.
The story adds that there is no evidence CJD has been transmitted by blood
products, but Dutch doctors were only later informed of the donor's
background.
Doctors have not informed their patients of the affected blood because they
didn't want to alarm them, according to a news release from the Dutch
television program Ongoing Business. The program is to be broadcast Sunday.
Earlier this year, the Hong Kong government disclosed that more than 100
patients in the city were given Amerscan Pulmonate II that may have been
contaminated with CJD.

Not only Hong Kong and Netherlands have experiences with a (only one?) batch
of the diagnosticum "Amerscan Pulminate II Agent". In Denmark more than 400
patients were examined with this medicament from June-July 1997 up until
November-December 1997. The Danish Parliament decided to inform all
patients. This decision was carried out by the hospitals.
