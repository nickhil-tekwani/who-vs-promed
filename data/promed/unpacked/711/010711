Situation update
----------------
Between 14 and 20 Sep 2018, EU Member States reported 186 human West Nile virus infections: Italy (92), Greece (32), Romania (33), Hungary (12), Croatia (11), Austria (2), Slovenia (2), and Bulgaria (2). This week, no human cases were reported by EU neighbouring countries.

In 6 areas, human cases were reported for the 1st time: Croatia (2), Slovenia (2), Italy (1), and Greece (1). All other human cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons.

This week, 25 deaths were reported by Italy (14), Romania (6), and Greece (5). In the same week, 12 outbreaks among equids were reported by Italy (6), Hungary (5), and Austria (1).

In 2018, as of 20 Sep 2018, EU Member States have reported 1134 human cases: Italy (453), Greece (224), Romania (216), Hungary (167), Croatia (36), France (16), Austria (15), Bulgaria (4), and Slovenia (3). EU neighbouring countries reported 370 human cases: Serbia (286), Israel (81) and Kosovo* (3). To date, 115 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Italy (35), Serbia (29), Romania (25), Greece (24), Hungary (1) and Kosovo* (1).

During the current transmission season [2018], 175 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (98), Hungary (63), Greece (9), France (2), Romania (2), and Austria (1).

In accordance with European Commission Directive 2014/110/EU, prospective blood donors should defer for 28 days after leaving an area with evidence of West Nile virus circulation among humans unless the results of an individual nucleic acid test are negative.

*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 [United Nations Security Council resolution 1244] and the International Court of Justice Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus of high medical and veterinary importance. The main vectors for WNV are mosquito species of the _Culex_ genus that transmit WNV among birds, and occasionally to humans and horses, which are 'dead-end' hosts. The outcome of the interaction between mosquito and WNV is largely dependent on the specific combination of the mosquito species, mosquito origin, WNV lineage and WNV strain (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5717085/).

Insights in vector competence allow for targeted surveillance and control of highly competent mosquito species, which pose a high risk for WNV transmission. Several European countries such as Italy and Greece, have implemented WNV surveillance programmes by monitoring mosquitoes, (sentinel-)birds, (sentinel-)equines, or humans for presence of virus, seroconversion, or disease symptoms.

The feasibility of releasing _Wolbachia_-infected mosquitoes/genetically modified mosquitoes that employ the mosquito's immune system as an arboviral control strategy can potentially be used to further prevent the transmission of arboviruses. - Mod.UBA
