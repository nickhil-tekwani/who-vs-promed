Following a warning issued by Kenya authorities of a possible Rift Valley fever (RVF), animal health company, Afrivet has urged the South African agricultural sector to sound a clarion to deliver vaccination to agriculture livestock.

According to Peter Oberem, Afrivet CEO, 250 sheep died in May [2018] of Rift Valley fever on a farm in Jacobsdal in the Free State [see 20180517.5799859].

"Reported cases so late in the season -- it is already winter in the southern hemisphere -- is worrying. It's not because we can expect a full-blown epidemic right away, but cases now point to a very good chance of a serious outbreak in summer."

"The biggest mistake farmers can make is to be complacent in winter," says Oberem.

Although sheep are more at risk, cattle should also be vaccinated to prevent mosquitoes feeding on them from ingesting and then transmitting the virus. Oberem explains there are 2 types of Rift Valley fever vaccine, namely live and inactivated (or killed). The latter has to be used in animals that are or could be pregnant. Giving them the live vaccine would cause abortions or the birth of deformed lambs. The inactivated vaccine has to be given twice, unlike the live vaccine for which only one application is necessary.

Farmers should be careful when handling the live vaccine so as to not accidentally infect themselves.

"We have to control the disease while we have the opportunity to do so. I am pleased that the state veterinary services have assured me that they are taking the matter seriously and are agreeing that farmers have to be warned to vaccinate now. If not, we will pay the price in livestock deaths and maybe even human casualties," says Oberem.

An outbreak is also likely to hurt the export industry. Countries in the Middle East have already banned South African lamb imports following the previous outbreak. "Rift Valley fever is a One Health concern because human activity in the environment aggravates it. We have to take responsibility by controlling the water bodies where mosquitoes breed and by vaccinating our livestock," concludes Oberem.
