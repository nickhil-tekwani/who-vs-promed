In brief, the news is as follows. To date, the death toll is 77
gharials. There is no definitive cause of death yet. The Forest
Department staff of the Indian states where the gharials have been
found are hard at work on this problem, as is the GCA (Gharial
Conservation Alliance). The IUCN (World Conservation Union) Crocodile
Specialist Group (CSG), including the CSG Veterinary Committee, is
also working on this problem. An international team of veterinarians
and forensic pathologists are heading to India soon to work with
Forest Department staff, the GCA, and local scientists/veterinarians
to investigate the crisis and hopefully find a solution. A meeting on
this crisis was recently held at Jiwaji University in Gwalior, India
with government officials, GCA, and researchers. News from this
meeting will be posted on the GCA website when it becomes available
