While it is certainly true that the housing standards in Texas are
such that the triatomine vectors do not have ample opportunity to get
to humans so they may feed, there are factors which, perhaps, the
moderator is not familiar with.

The 1st is that the triatomine insects in Texas do live in other
places besides mud plaster walls. In pertinent reference, please see:
Beard CB et al. Emer Infect Dis 2003;9: DOI: 10.3201/eid0901.020217
(http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/1/02-0217_article.htm).

In the early 1990's, I had a discussion with a veterinarian with a
mixed practice whose clinic was located near the lower Nueces River,
close to the city of Corpus Christi (Calallan area). He explained that
cases of Chagas disease were not rare in either dogs or goats in the
area.

In addition, there are many structures termed as "fishing camps" along
the Nueces River that are wooden structures that have crevices in
which the triatomine bugs can hide. My family has such a camp near the
entrance of La Garto Creek into what is now Lake Corpus Christi.

We have found triatomine bugs in the sleeping quarters many times
since the 1940's. My grandmother was very aware of the issue of Chagas
disease, and during each visit, we inspected not only the quarters but
the beds as well (checking under the mattresses). I was bitten myself
when I was a child despite the efforts to remove the triatomine
insects from the interior of the building. (This would be in the
1960's.)

Our fishing camp building included snug and secure screens over the
windows and doors; however, the bugs still managed to enter. I have
had the ELISA test done, and there was no indication that I have
Chagas disease.

A 2nd area of potential infection are public camping facilities along
the rivers. For instance, there is a Boy Scout camp located at Choke
Canyon State Park, near Three Rivers, Texas. My brother and his son
participated in an event there in approximately 2005, and my brother
received multiple bites from triatomine insects as he slept in a
sleeping bag at night.

Given the tendency of these bugs to form colonies where easy feeding
is found, my thought is that public camp grounds are probably more of
a risk area (as a whole) than private fishing camps that are not
visited regularly (ELISA testing indicated that my brother had not
contracted Chagas disease).

A 3rd area of concern is along the Rio Grande River. Counties there,
such as Starr, are among the poorest in the entire nation. Housing
there may not even reach the level of the fishing camp owned by my
family. This is the same area addressed in the Emerging Infectious
Disease Dispatch issued by the CDC in 2003.

There are also large regions of "barrios" located in the area of San
Antonio in which the housing is such that triatomine insects may live
in cracks and crevices.

The issue of Chagas disease in Texas has been an area of concern for
my family since we settled in Nueces County in 1907. Although I agree
that in general, housing standards in Texas are such that triatomine
insects do not have easy access to humans on which to feed, there are
certain populations that are at greater risk. The risk groups include
people who camp out or have "Fishing Camp" structures along the rivers
and the poor who live in substandard housing.

[ProMED thanks Susan Rektorik Henley for her informative and
thoughtful comments. It seems that there may well be undiagnosed human
cases, and surveys of samples from blood banks for specific antibodies
would be useful to find out whether this is the case. For the
