In the populated center of Oventeni [Atalaya province, Ucalayi
region], 87 people who consumed meat [infected] with rabies [virus]
were vaccinated by personnel of Health Network no. 03 of Atalaya.

Biologist Jhoni Flores stated that the focus where cattle died of
rabies is the indigenous community of Tiahuanasqui located 4 hours
from Oventeni, [in a] totally wild area reachable only by a foot or
horseback trail.

"We went to Oventeni due to [this] emergency, because of the deaths of
cattle from rabies. 63 Asheninkas [indigenous tribe] people and 24
mestizos who were directly implicated with the processing and
consumption of meat with rabies [virus] were vaccinated with 10 doses
[of rabies vaccine] of 2 ml each in the periumbilical region," the
biologist said.

"The bat [vampire, most likely _Desmodus rotundus_ - Mod.TY] is the
vector that transmits rabies [virus], biting beef cattle, infecting,
and ending the life of the animal -- the same as with humans. The
Health Network went [to the area] to cut off a possible rabies
epidemic.

In the indigenous communities of Tiahuanasqui, Materiato,
Chochoquiari, and Ponchoni 150 dogs were vaccinated against rabies,
with the objective that the bat not bite dogs and these [in turn] not
transmit rabies to humans.

It is recommended that the residents of Oventeni [region] cover their
windows with metal screens and sleep under bed nets to avoid being
attacked by the bats.

[Exposure of these people to rabies virus simply by the consumption of
meat from an infected animal is unlikely. According to the WHO,
"Ingestion of raw meat or other tissues from animals infected with
rabies is not a source of human infection." Touching or feeding
animals, licks on intact skin does not constitute exposure and no
treatment is required
(http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/). Exposure
could have occurred at the time the infected animals were slaughtered,
if the people handing and butchering the carcasses had cuts or
scratches on their hands or contacted mucous membranes or eyes with
unwashed hands and the animal tissues were contaminated with saliva of
the infected animal. It seems very unlikely that all 87 individuals
mentioned in the report were exposed this way.

This report is not clear on several other points. The vaccine used is
not stated. If human diploid cell or purified chick embryo cell
vaccine was used, the potentially exposed individuals should have
received 4 doses of vaccine, 1.0 mL, IM (deltoid area), one each on
days 0, 3, 7, and 14. One wonders if these individuals received
suckling mouse brain vaccine. The numbers of rabies infected cattle
dying or consumed is not clear. How the Health Network would prevent
vampire bats from biting dogs is not stated. Although vampire bats
prefer to feed on cattle and horses, under certain circumstances, they
will feed on dogs and people, so vaccination of dogs in the affected
region is prudent.

There have been several human rabies cases from vampire bat bites in
the Peruvian Amazon this year [2011]. Rabies, transmitted by the bite
of infected bats or dogs, has caused the deaths of at least 20 people
this year in Peru
