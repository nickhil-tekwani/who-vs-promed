Diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in cows was confirmed in 3 districts
in the territory of Primorye. The affected settlements are Krasny Kut in the
Spassky district (the largest), Pavlo-Fedorovka in the Kirovsky district, and
Ignatyevka in the Pozharsky district.
The diagnosis of FMD was not confirmed in Salskoye, Dalnerechensky district,
where 3 cows developed symptoms similar to FMD, a source in the state
veterinary inspection [division] of the agriculture department of the Primorye
territorial administration told Itar-Tass on Tuesday [30 Aug 2005].
Another 43 sick cows were discovered in the past 24 hours. The largest FMD
outbreak occurred in Krasny Kut, where 55 cows from a flock of 140 were
infected. 46 infected cows were detected in the Kirovsky district. 15 cows
fell ill with FMD in the Pozharsky district. It has not yet been decided
whether to kill the infected animals.
An additional 160 000 doses of vaccine against the FMD virus Asia-1 will be
brought to the Primorye territory in the next few days. As many as 150 000
doses have already been supplied to the territory for the vaccination of
cattle, primarily in regions bordering China. More than 15 000 cows have been
vaccinated over the last 24 hours.
Quarantine has been imposed in settlements affected by FMD and where the
disease is suspected. All necessary measures to eliminate the infection foci
are being applied.

[On 30 Jun 2005 the Russian veterinary services sent to the OIE their follow-
up report No 1 on FMD Asia 1. It referred to an outbreak in Busse, in the Amur
region. Though subsequent outbreaks have since been reported by the Russian
media from 2 additional regions of Russia's Far East federal district,
spanning a distance exceeding 1000 miles (1700 km), no further update from the
authorities is available.
Moreover, from the accumulating data on outbreaks caused by FMD virus serotype
Asia 1 in several of China's neighbours (Russia, Mongolia, Myanmar), one may
definitely suspect that the virus has become widespread within China. - Mod.AS]
[Note that 3 cows developed symptoms similar to FMD in Salskoye,
Dalnerechensky district, but they did not have FMD. Vesicular stomatitis
virus causes similar lesions, so that disease may be involved also. - Mod.JW]
