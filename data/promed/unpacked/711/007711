Producers are being urged to attend an anthrax awareness day after another case of the bacterial disease was detected in Dirranbandi [Queensland] last week [13-19 May, 2018]. Minister for Agricultural Industry Development Mark Furner confirmed in a media statement that a single cow had contracted anthrax, but the property owners' proactive approach limited the impact of the incident.

"The affected owners were aware of previous incidents in the St George-Dirranbandi district in the past 2 years and, wisely, had taken precautions," Mr Furner said. "They had prepared a biosecurity plan and were undertaking a preventative vaccination program for anthrax. A local veterinarian assisted the producer to rapidly manage the situation. Biosecurity Queensland officers have been working with the affected property owner to implement ongoing biosecurity measures."

A free community workshop will be held in St George next week [28 May-3 Jun 2018] where speakers from Biosecurity Queensland, Workplace Health and Safety Queensland and Queensland Health will join AgForce Cattle Board President Bim Struss to discuss how to recognise and respond to anthrax as well as personal safety.

Mr Furner said strong, effective biosecurity control methods were crucial to protecting Queensland's AUD 19.95 billion [about USD 15 billion] agriculture industry and environment. "Recent incidents in the St George-Dirranbandi district indicate that anthrax spores may be present in and around the area and livestock grazing locally may be at risk of infection," Mr Furner said. "Raising the awareness of biosecurity risks like anthrax will ensure livestock producers continue to safeguard Queensland's reliable and trusted food supply."

Anthrax is most common in New South Wales and Victoria, but has been found in south west Queensland.

[Dirranbandi is a town and locality in South West Queensland, Australia, located in the Shire of Balonne and close to the border with New South Wales. See http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AS/04/Dirranbandi.html For a description of Dirranbandi, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirranbandi,_Queensland

The farmer and their veterinarian are to be congratulated for being so aware and ready to move quickly to limit this outbreak to the index case, a cow. Dirranbandi is described by Wikipedia as having a population of only 711 in the 2011 census. This has the advantage that everyone knows what is going on and that the other farmers will be vaccinating their stock also. I was raised in a village with only a thousand folk in the whole parish, 2 churches, 4 pubs. There were no secrets. - Mod.MHJ
