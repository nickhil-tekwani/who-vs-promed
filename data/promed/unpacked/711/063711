Owner of stud bulls in Miyazaki accepts their slaughter
-------------------------------------------------------
The owner of 6 stud bulls, subjects of a recent dispute in Miyazaki
Prefecture, agreed Friday [16 Jul 2010] to slaughter them in order to
contain a foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] epidemic in the southwestern
Japanese prefecture, reversing his earlier opposition to the killing.

The owner accepted the precautionary measure at his meeting with
Miyazaki Gov. Hideo Higashikokubaru. His decision puts an end to the
twists and turns since late June [2010] over the fate of the 6
remaining bulls that need to be culled after some 289 000 cows and
pigs had been killed by the end of June.

Miyazaki Pref. failed to report cow's alleged infection with disease
to national gov't
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Miyazaki Prefectural Government failed to report a cow that
showed symptoms of an infectious disease to the national government
last month [Une 2010} as required by law, it has emerged. The
revelation comes following the outbreak of FMD among stud bulls and
other domestic animal in the prefecture.

The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry suspects that the
failure may constitute a violation of the Domestic Animal Infectious
Diseases Control Law, which states that any domestic animal suspected
of being infected with a disease must be reported to the central
government. It is questioning prefectural government officials in charge.

An inspection team dispatched by the prefectural government was
checking about 500 bulls at a livestock farm in Shintomi, Miyazaki
Prefecture, which were to be slaughtered, when a veterinarian found
one of them showing what appeared to be symptoms of an infectious
disease on 25 Jun 2010. He immediately alerted the team leader. The
leader suspended the inspection and consulted the prefectural
government headquarters. After concluding that the symptoms were not
those of FMD, the team did not take photos or blood samples of the
cow. The animal was later slaughtered.

The prefectural government justified its actions during questioning
by the ministry. "What appeared to be a rash had developed on the
bull, and it was reportedly free of symptoms typical of FMD," a
prefectural government official was quoted as telling ministry
officials. The veterinarian was quoted as telling the prefectural
government that he found sores on the bull's tongue.

A senior official of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry
said the prefectural government's inspection team should have taken
photos of the bull.

"Sores aren't necessarily a symptom of FMD. In the area where the
stock farm in question is located, all cows must be slaughtered, so
it didn't raise any problems involving epidemic prevention," the
official said. "However, since a suspicion arose, the team should
have taken photos of the bull."

No domestic animal has been confirmed infected with FMD in Shintomi
since a pig was found to have contracted the disease on 12 Jun 2010.

[According to Japan's reporting to the OIE, the last FMD outbreak
(number 292) was resolved on 5 Jul 2010 by the culling of all 16 cows
on a farm in Miyazaki city 3, Miyazaki, where one animal was found
infected. This last outbreak had, reportedly, started a day earlier.
Since then, no additional FMD cases have been reported from Japan:
follow-up report number 13, submitted on Thu 15 Jul 2010, indicates
that no new cases have been recorded since the previous weekly
follow-up report of 7 Jul 2010. Hopefully, this means that the
epizootic has reached its end.

All Japan's reports, and a map showing all outbreaks since the
initial reporting on 20 Apr 2010 (zoom in), are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9155>.

A similar genotype of the same serotype O virus strain had been
identified earlier in China and South Korea. Details on the
genotyping of recent FMD serotype O strains, which have recently
caused outbreaks in Mongolia and Kazakhstan, are still expected; the
samples were sent for gene sequencing to ARRIAH (Federal Centre for
Animal Health, OIE Regional Reference Laboratory for FMD for Eastern
Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia, Vladimir, Russia). - Mod.AS]
