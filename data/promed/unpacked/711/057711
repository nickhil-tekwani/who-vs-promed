Rabies toll plateaus as public awareness grows
----------------------------------------------
The latest figures show that 42 people have died of rabies or
rabies-related ailments [?] since the outbreak of the viral disease
in Bali in November 2008. Sanglah General Hospital in Denpasar has
treated 67 patients for suspected rabies. A total of 34 have died
from the disease, while the rest were diagnosed with [non-rabies]
encephalitis, which has similar symptoms. The other fatalities from
the outbreak have been recorded at hospitals in Tabanan and elsewhere
across the island.

Sanglah rabies prevention program secretary Dr. I.G.N. Ken
Wirashandhi said the 33 patients diagnosed with mild encephalitis
showed all the classic rabies symptoms, except hydrophobia. "However,
some of these patients had previously been bitten by dogs, so our
concern, and that of the families, was that they may have contracted
rabies," he said. Patients with suspected rabies or encephalitis must
undergo a series of laboratory tests, including on their saliva,
urine and cerebrospinal fluids. Around 70 percent of rabies cases at
Sanglah have been diagnosed through saliva tests.

A total of 8 patients died from the disease before the tests were
completed. "At the time, we faced opposition from the families when
trying to get permission to do the cerebrospinal tests," Wirashandhi
said. "Thus we weren't able to diagnose it in time to treat them."

The majority of those who died from the disease were taken to
hospital in the later stages of the disease, he added. "Patients in
these stages are almost certain to die during treatment, because the
viral infection is so advanced," he said. "They oversalivate and
panic at the sight of water or light."

Wirashandhi stressed it was important for patients and families to
seek medical advice as soon as any of the classic rabies symptoms
were exhibited, such as joint pain, severe headaches, and pains on
the affected bitten area. "They should get anti-rabies vaccines *VAR*
immediately," he said. "The problem is Sanglah has often run out of
VAR supplies in the past, but patients can come back the next day to
get inoculated."

Sanglah contagious diseases ward head Ni Wayan Ayuningsih said the
public was opening up to more proactive prevention and treatment by
doctors, following months of an intensified awareness campaign.
"Previously a patient or their family would insist they didn't have
rabies, because they lacked any understanding of the disease's
symptoms or causes," she said. She added that if detected early on,
the disease could be treated properly [by post-exposure vaccination]
and the patient cured completely.

The 2 latest patients at Sanglah initially tested positive for the
virus. "When they came to us they were in the sensory stage,"
Ayuningsih said. "The doctors gave them VAR to boost their antibody count."

[Since the previous report concerning the rabies situation in the
island of Bali, dated 27 Dec 2009, the number of rabies deaths has
increased from 27 to 42. While recognition of the extent of the
problem and the post-exposure treatment of patients may have improved
there is no indication that the outbreak is being contained.
Information on the accuracy of the saliva test in rabies diagnosis
would be welcomed.
