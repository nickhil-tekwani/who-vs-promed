Clusters of human influenza (H5N1) viruses have southern China source
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In a study designed to track the geographic
source of human H5N1 avian influenza infections,
a research group from China and the United States
has found evidence suggesting southern China as
the origin of multiple clusters of the viruses.
Their findings appeared yesterday in the Journal
of Infectious Diseases [see below].

They used hemagglutinin gene sequences from 215
human influenza (H5N1) viruses to determine the
source and dispersal pattern. They found that the
viruses can be divided among 4 geographic
clusters: southern China, Indonesia, Indo-China,
and middle Asia­north Africa. Analysis of
N-glycosylation sites at positions 100 and 170
found 3 different types of human H5N1 viruses.
Combining the genetic analysis with geographic
information system analysis suggested southern China as a common source.

The group proposed that the virus spread into
Southeast Asia and western and northern China,
and then made a final spread across Eurasia and
into the Middle East and Africa. They also
proposed that the initial spread from Southern
China into India was followed by transmission into Indonesia.

[The above report is based on the paper published
in The Journal of Infectious Diseases
2010;202:000­000, entitled: Evidence Suggests
Southern China as a Common Source of Multiple
Clusters of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian
Influenza Virus, by Bin Wu, and 8 others
(<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/653709>).

The Abstract reads: "Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza is considered an avian disease,
although there is some evidence of limited
human-to-human transmission of the virus. A
global effort is underway to control or eradicate
the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus
in poultry and prevent human exposure, both of
which may also reduce the risk of pandemic emergence.

"Hemagglutinin gene sequences from 215 human H5N1
influenza viruses were used to trace the source
and dispersal pattern of human H5N1 influenza
viruses on a global scale. A mutation network and
phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin gene
show that human H5N1 influenza viruses can be
clearly divided among 4 clusters across
geographic space. On the basis of analysis of the
N-glycosylation sites at positions 100 and 170 in
the hemagglutinin protein, human H5N1 influenza
viruses were also divided into 3 types.

"When we combined these analyses with geographic
information system data analyses, we found that
Southern China is often a common source of
multiple clusters of H5N1 influenza viruses and
that each cluster has different dispersal
patterns and individual evolutionary features. In
summary, the genetic evidence presented here
provides clear evidence for multiple clusters of
human H5N1 influenza viruses that initially originated in Southern China."

The outcome of this analysis is consistent with
previous interpretations that the highly
pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus
originated in southern China and radiated out
from there. These results are unsurprising and in
my view do not allow any predictions about
enhanced potential for human-to-human transmission. - Mod.CP]
