Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [26 Sep 2019]
---------------------------
From [1-31 Aug 2019], the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 6 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) infection and one associated death. The cases were reported from Riyadh (3 cases), Taif (1 case), Quriyat (1 case), and Najran (1 case) regions. One of the cases reported (Case 4) is a household contact identified during the contact tracing investigation of Case 2.

From 2012 until [31 Aug 2019], the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO was 2464, with 850 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (for example, in a healthcare setting or household contacts).

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures, can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[August 2019 was a return to the baseline endemic activity of the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. There were 6 newly confirmed cases, of whom 2 had fatal outcomes. One of the fatalities had a history of diabetes mellitus; the other had no pre-existing co-morbidities. There was one secondary case in a household contact, although this individual also had a history of camel contact. Three of the 6 confirmed cases had a history of camel contact.

Overall, according to the above WHO update, as of 31 Aug 2019, there have been a total of 2464 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported globally, including 850 associated deaths, bringing the reported case fatality ratio to 34.5%. - Mod.MPP]
