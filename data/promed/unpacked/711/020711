Yellow fever in Guinea
-----------------------------
As of 24 Sep 2001, the Ministry of Health has reported 18 suspected
cases, of which 2 have been laboratory confirmed, and 2 deaths in
Conakry.
In addition, 11 suspected cases have been reported in N'zerekore
region.
The supply of reagents for yellow fever diagnostic tests has been
depleted and samples have been sent to the Institut Pasteur in Paris for
testing.
The Ministry has established a National Epidemic Committee, with the
participation of WHO, UNICEF, the French and Canadian
governments, Médecins sans Frontières, the International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Guinean Red Cross.
A treatment centre has been set up in Donka National Hospital,
surveillance has been reinforced and vector control activities are
underway in the affected quarters of Conakry.

[Conakry is the capital of Guinea. This is a potentially very serious
introduction of YF into the city -- after 12 months of reports of cases
elsewhere in the country -- paralleling what is going on in Abidjan,
capital of the Ivory Coast. Health authorities in Sierra Leone --
bordering Guinea -- should be on the lookout for cases also. Travellers
should note from the refs. above that YF is currently widespread in
West Africa. Physicians seeing cases of fever, with or without jaundice,
in patients who have recently visited West Africa should consider YF
in their diagnosis.
Note: Senegal has still not notified WHO of its 3 cases of YF from
earlier this year at a border village with Guinea (see ref. Senegal (02)
above), & Senegal does not appear on WHO's Infected area list dated 6
