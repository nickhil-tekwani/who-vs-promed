[ProMED has received the following information from Professor Ian H. Brown, MIBiol PhD, Director of OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease, Weybridge, UK (see 20200124.691319):
Investigations of the suspicious case in poultry in Northern Ireland excluded involvement with notifiable avian influenza (H5 and H7 subtypes) plus Newcastle disease.]

The authorities are investigating a suspected case of a notifiable bird disease on a poultry farm in County Fermanagh. It was discovered 4 days ago [4 Jan 2020] when a vet became concerned about increased mortality among the broiler birds.

Tests are being run to see if it is bird flu or another disease called Newcastle disease. It will be several days before final results are back. Restrictions have been put in place on the farm as a precautionary measure.

The Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairs can order the culling of birds to prevent disease spreading. Farmers have been urged to step up their biosecurity.

The disease risk increases in winter with the arrival of migratory birds which can carry them. In recent years bird flu has been confirmed in wild birds on several occasions.

Last month [December 2019], the H5 strain of bird flu was detected at a commercial poultry business in Suffolk; 27 000 chickens were culled there [see commentary].

Poultry is an important part of the Northern Ireland agri-food sector. The latest figures show there are about 26 million birds on farms here. The majority of them are bred for meat, but there are a substantial number of laying hens too. Annual turnover from poultry is about GBP 709 million (USD 928 million) and it employs almost 6000 people.

Farmers across Ireland have been warned to step up biosecurity measures as a suspected outbreak of bird flu is being investigated at a poultry farm in Fermanagh. A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in Northern Ireland said that officials are investigating the suspected presence of a "notifiable avian disease" (NAD) in a broiler breeder flock in Fermanagh.

A private veterinary practitioner contacted DAERA on [2 Jan 2020] with concerns over increased bird mortality at the premises. The DAERA spokesperson said a veterinary enquiry at the holding started that evening.

Testing has already started on samples taken from birds to detect the presence of serious bird diseases like avian influenza and Newcastle disease. The results are expected to take several days, and restrictive measures are in place on the farm.

The spokesperson added: "All bird keepers are urged to remain vigilant, and if they suspect any signs of the disease in their flocks, they must report it immediately to DAERA.

"All poultry keepers, including backyard flock keepers and those keeping game birds and pet birds, need to act now and maintain high levels of biosecurity at all times in order to reduce the risk of transmission of avian flu to their flocks."

[Last month's (December 2019) H5 outbreak in Suffolk, mentioned in section [1] above, was caused by a low-pathogenic H5N3 virus strain. The relevant veterinary inquiry, followed by culling and other control measures, was undertaken following reports of a drop in egg production. Reportedly, the cleansing and disinfection activities were completed and effective as of 18 Dec 2019 (see OIE follow-up report no. 2 at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=32776).

The results of the laboratory tests of the current event in Northern Ireland, as well as of the epidemiological investigation, are anticipated.

Two H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtypes have been circulating in Europe in recent years, namely, H5N8 and (a European reassortant strain of the H5N6 HPAI virus) H5N6. Their circulation was observed mainly during the relevant season (December through March), synchronic with decreasing temperatures and wild bird migration movements.

H5N8 HPAI was 1st introduced into Eastern Europe in mid-October 2016; it has been detected in 30 of 43 European countries, particularly in Western and Eastern Europe. In 2019, the reported number of infections decreased drastically, and the disease affected mainly domestic poultry in Bulgaria and the Russian Federation. HPAI H5N8 has recently been reported from Poland.

The last report of the H5N6 HPAI strain occurred in Denmark in January 2019. - Mod.AS
