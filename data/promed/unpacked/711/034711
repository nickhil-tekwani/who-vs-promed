A dead skunk found in West Bloomfield [Oakland County, Michigan] has tested positive for rabies, health authorities announced [Thu 17 Oct 2019].

The finding is the latest in a string of 15 rabies-infected animals verified this year [2019] by Oakland County health officials -- nearly double the 8 that were found by this time in 2018.

"Certainly the number of cases this year [2019] is a concern but also because many of these were found close to each other" in residential areas, said Bill Mullan, spokesman for Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter.

In a warning emailed to the media, county officials urged residents to "stay away from wild animals such as skunks, bats, raccoons, foxes, and stray cats and dogs."

Tests found the rabies virus in 4 bats and 11 skunks in Oakland County. In Southfield alone there were 5 skunks, all in the area between Southfield and Greenfield roads, and north of 10 Mile while just south and east of Lathrup Village.

The latest find was a dead skunk found in the square-mile area bounded by Maple Road on the north, 14 Mile to the south, Farmington Road on the east, and Drake Road to the west.

"Rabies is a fatal disease and there is no known cure, so the best protection is to avoid contact with stray, wild, and dead animals," said Leigh-Anne Stafford, health officer for Oakland County.

Macomb County has turned up just one rabies-infected animal so far in 2019 -- a bat found earlier this year [2019] -- compared with 4 infected bats last year, said Dr Kevin Lokar, medical officer.

"So we're not seeing the increase that Oakland County is seeing," Dr Lokar said [Thu 17 Oct 2019].

Wayne County also had just one case in wildlife verified so far this year, and the county in many years has no cases reported, said Dr Ruta Sharanhgpani, medical director.

Statewide, far more bats are found infected with rabies than skunks. As of July [2019], Michigan public health officials said they had verified nearly 2.5 times as many rabid bats this year as in 2017.

Most of the confirmed infected bats come from the metro Detroit and Lansing areas, but infected bats found this year [2019] "are spread out across the Lower Peninsula," said Michigan Department of Natural Resources wildlife veterinarian Dan O'Brien. The 2 infected skunks came from Oakland County, he told the Free Press in July [2019].

Public health experts can't say yet whether the increased findings of infected animals means a greater prevalence of rabies this year [2019], or whether it's simply the result of Michiganders being more diligent about submitting animals suspected to have rabies.

Humans or their pets can get rabies from the saliva of an infected animal, from bites or scratches. Rabies is not spread through a skunk's spray, experts say. Pets are best protected by keeping them vaccinated and preventing encounters with wildlife and other "unfamiliar animals," Stafford said.

Michigan law requires that dogs and ferrets be vaccinated for rabies; and it's advised for cats. "Vaccination is important for keeping your pet from getting rabies, but it also provides a barrier of protection for you if a wild animal bites your pet," according to a state website.

[In the USA, there exist several wildlife variants of _Lyssavirus_, that circulate in bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.

While bat rabies is found throughout the USA, main terrestrial reservoirs differ depending on the geographical location. Skunk rabies prevails in central US (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html).

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all domestic carnivores (that is, dogs, cats, ferrets) in the area up to date and not to approach wildlife with unusual behavior. - Mod.PMB
