Crops in Kayunga district dry up over disease
---------------------------------------------
A disease yet to be identified has destroyed the crops in Kayunga
district (Central Region) leaving the residents in total fear of
famine. The areas where crops have been hit badly include Busana and
Kangulumira sub-counties.

Residents say that the disease has mostly attacked the maize crop.
They say that the maize plants dry up before developing cobs.

According to the area agricultural officer, Dr Andrew Mugalulu, the
disease could be maize mosaic dwarf. He says that he will report the
issue to the authorities in the agricultural sector to look for a
treatment.

[_Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) affects maize,
sorghum, millets, and several grass species. It belongs to a complex
of closely related potyviruses infecting tropical grasses, which also
includes _Sorghum mosaic virus_ (SrMV), _Johnsongrass mosaic virus_
(JGMV), and _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV).

MDMV symptoms may vary according to hosts and environmental
conditions, but generally include leaf mosaic or streaks, leaf
discolourations, stunting of plants, excessive tillering, and low seed
set. In maize, early infection can lead to root and stalk rots and
plant death. Infection sites in the field are often sporadic and may
be individual plants, clusters, or rows along the edge of the field
(often close to grasses serving as virus reservoirs).

Several strains of MDMV exist denoted as A to F and possibly
additional ones. The virus is spread by several species of aphid
vectors in a non-persistent manner and may also be transmitted by
mechanical means and seed. MDMV survives between seasons in rhizomes
of some host species. Disease management includes use of resistant
crop varieties and control of virus reservoirs.

MDMV is known to cause serious yield losses in maize and sorghum
crops. If its presence in Uganda is confirmed, the fear of locals
reported above regarding food security is justified. However, reliable
diagnosis by molecular methods will be required as a matter of
priority before effective measures can be taken to protect local
crops.
