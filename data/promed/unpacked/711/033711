The St. Louis (Missouri) County Health Department is investigating an
_E. coli_ outbreak, with 14 cases reported this week.

Health officials made that announcement in a news release, but did not
give specific information on which areas of the county the cases were
reported. The health department is investigating the source of the
outbreak, but no source has been identified at this time, according to
the release. More information is expected.

"_E. coli_ is a very serious disease that can be life threatening,"
stated Dr Dolores J Gunn, director of the health department, in the
release. "Parents should be particularly vigilant if their children
have bloody diarrhea."

The release states that health officials are asking local physicians
to watch for symptoms when evaluating any patient with bloody
diarrhea, diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, and cramps. Health
officials warned that if _E. coli_ is suspected, patients should go to
the nearest emergency room for evaluation.

[The mention of bloody diarrhea certainly strongly suggests that the
organism involved in this cluster is of an enterohemorrhagic
pathotype. ProMED-mail awaits additional information regarding the
clinical features and epidemiology of the cases and what vehicle of
transmission is elucidated. - Mod.LL]
