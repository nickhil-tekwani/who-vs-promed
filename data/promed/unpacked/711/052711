New Caledonia: 15 More Dengue Fever Cases Reported
--------------------------------------------------
Authorities in New Caledonia have confirmed another 15 cases of dengue
fever in the French Pacific territory. Local media reports say there have
now been almost 60 new cases of the potentially fatal mosquito-borne
disease since the beginning of 2003. Last month, health authorities
identified the beginning of an epidemic and stepped up a campaign to fight
the disease.
Dengue fever outbreaks have also been reported recently from Vanuatu, Fiji,
and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna [see: Dengue/DHF update 2003
(04) 20030130.0262].

Bolivia (Cochabamba): First Deaths in Dengue Outbreak - DHF or YF?
------------------------------------------------
Yesterday, a man and wife died in Eterazama, Chapare, with symptoms of
either dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or yellow fever (YF). The laboratory
report is pending. A similar case, a male aged 20 years from Eterazama, was
admitted to the Villa Tunari Hospital on 29 Jan 2003 and died on 4 Feb 2003.
His wife, aged 18 years, had died at home on 18 Jan 2003 with the same
symptoms. She had been attended by a private doctor. These were the first
deaths in the dengue epidemic that began in the Cochabamba region on 4 Nov
2002. So far Cochabamba town has had 29 confirmed cases of dengue fever,
including one of DHF, who is recovering.
The zone of Eterazama has so far reported most cases of dengue (80) in the
Cochabamba region. Samples from the fatal cases will be sent to Peru for
confirmation of dengue or yellow fever. Results should be available on Fri
14 Feb 2003.
Suspected and confirmed cases of dengue are increasing at the rate of 17
per day in Chapare, the highest rate in the country. In Santa Cruz the rate
is 15 per day and in Pando 5 per day. In 5 epidemiological weeks, Bolivia
has reported 1300 cases of dengue, including 751 in Cochabamba.

Ecuador: Medical Alert Becomes Health Emergency
-----------------------------------------------
In less than a week, a medical alert became a health emergency due to
detection of 14 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a number equal to
the total of cases registered in 2002.
Decree number 137, signed on Tuesday night [11 Feb 2003] by Vice-President
Alfredo Palacio, was justified both by the [increased] prevalence of
malaria (1500 cases per province in January) and the fact that DHF was
present not only in Guayas, but also in Los Rios and in Manabi.
Francisco Andino, Minister of Health, stated that the government and the
Solidarity Trust would provide 10 million dollars for the implementation of
emergency measures. Ernesto Gutierrez, Under-Secretary of Tropical
Medicine, stated that during the next few days MODERSA [a Ministry of
Health project for the modernization of health services] would provide one
million dollars.
In addition, a 7-million-dollar plan has been submitted to the same entity.
Among other things, the funds will be destined for the purchase of
pesticides, larvicide, 40 vehicles, and 100 microscopes to be distributed
in a targeted manner.
Andino stated that the purchases will be closely supervised and that a
government representative will administer the applications. A community
leader for each 100 families will be trained for the elimination of
mosquito breeding sites. The Ministry hopes to achieve a 70 to 75 percent
commitment by the community during this year, given that the elimination of
these tropical diseases [dengue fever and malaria] requires at least 5 to 7
years. For its part, the Tropical Medicine Secretariat stated that it would
settle for 120 medical brigades, the design of a treatment protocol,
adequate supplies of medicine, and the recruitment of different hospitals
-- from the Ministry, Naval hospitals, the Welfare Action Force, and the
Society for the Protection of Children -- so that the Hospital for
Infectious Diseases is not overwhelmed with cases. 2 cases are yet to be
confirmed, and 80 percent of the population of the coast is susceptible to
dengue fever.

Mexico: Epidemiological Alert in the State of Morelos
---------------------------------------------------
Antonio Campos Rendon, Health Secretary of the state of Morelos, announced
that an epidemiological alert had been issued on Thu 13 Feb 2003 for the
whole state and neighboring areas. The measure was taken after 2 cases of
dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] were confirmed in the municipality of
Jiutepec. One of the patients, a 45-year-old woman, has died.
During a press conference, the official stated that the cooperation of the
federal health department has been requested to address this suspected
outbreak, given that the contagion occurred in an unexpected manner, that
is, during an atypical time of year.
The patient who died had received private medical attention and later was
hospitalized for 15 days in an intensive care unit. The family has
authorized an autopsy to confirm the diagnosis. The second patient remains
hospitalized in the city of Cuernavaca. The epidemiological alert was
distributed to 33 municipalities of Morelos and neighboring states, and in
particular the municipalities of Jiutepec, Yautepec, Ciudad Ayala, and
Zacatepec, where some of the 91 cases of classic dengue fever were reported
in 2002. During 2002 only 3 cases of DHF were reported in Ciudad Ayala, and
it was established that they had been imported from the state of Michoacan.
The health authorities stated that, in accordance with the permanent
campaign for the control of the disease, in place in the municipality of
Jiutepec since May 2002, 440 houses have been inspected, and fumigation to
exterminate the vector has been carried out on 119 occasions.
Since the detection of the 2 cases, approximately 17 persons have been
examined and are currently under observation. Campos Rendon said that it is
expected that this year there may be an increase in the number of cases,
since specialized research indicates that every 5 years or so, time and the
use of pesticides make the vector stronger.
Around September 2002, the Epidemiology Department of the Health
Secretariat in Morelos reported 175 probable cases of dengue fever. Over
the past 5 years, Morelos has seen a reduction in the area of incidence of
the disease. 10 years ago, cases were detected in 22 of the 33
municipalities, whereas last year, cases were detected in only 11
localities, almost all of them in urban and semi rural zones.

Philippines: Increase in Dengue Cases in Zamboanga City
----------------------------------------------------
"Search and destroy," the order said. However, this order was not given to
the police or military. This was the order of city health officer Rodel
Agbulos to his fumigation team in this city because of the alarming
increase of dengue fever in barangays within a 7-km radius. These barangays
are Santa Catalina, Zone IV, Tumaga, Putik, Mercedes, Tugbungan, Tetuan,
Boalan, Canelar, and Sinunuc.
In January there were 20 cases of dengue fever that were registered in his
office, where the majority of the victims were children aged 3 to 4,
Agbulos disclosed. He also said that for the first 5 days of February 2003,
there were already 16 dengue fever cases registered from barangays Upper
Calarian, Baliwasan, Talon-Talon, and Canelar.
Agbulos ordered a search-and-destroy operation because fumigation kills
only the [adult] mosquitoes and not the larvae, which after 28 days would
hatch into another batch of the dengue virus-carrying mosquitoes. "So what
is best to do besides fumigation is to search for and destroy their
breeding places," he said.
