Facing the threat of the virus of "the white spot" and "yellow head", which
kills shrimp - and which has spread from Panama to Ecuador - the Regional
Office of Fisheries of Tumbes has suspended for 180 days (beginning 14
June) the importation of shrimp larvae and breeding stock.
According to specialists, neither disease affects humans consuming
contaminated shrimp.
At present the shrimp farms cover some 2,800 hectares in Tumbes out of the
4,000 has in 1998. The production had decreased by 40% in the last few
weeks. This was due to a loss of personnel.
