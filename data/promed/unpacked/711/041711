[The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] advises consumers not to eat
any Peter Pan peanut butter purchased since May 2006 and not to eat
Great Value peanut butter with a product code beginning with "2111"
purchased since May 2006 because of risk of contamination with
_Salmonella_ Tennessee.
All Peter Pan peanut butter purchased since May 2006 is affected;
only those jars of Great Value peanut butter purchased since May 2006
with a product code beginning with "2111" are affected. Although [the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC)] have not linked Great Value peanut
butter with the specified product code to the cases of _Salmonella_
Tennessee infection, the product is manufactured in the same plant as
Peter Pan peanut butter and, thus, is believed to be at similar risk
of contamination. Great Value peanut butter made by manufacturers
other than ConAgra is not affected.
Number of cases and state locations
------------------------------------
The CDC has identified 290 people from 39 states who have gotten sick
from _Salmonella_ Tennessee, the type associated with this outbreak.
In total, 46 patients are known to have been hospitalized and there
have been no reported deaths.
The 39 states with reported illness are: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois,
Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey,
North Carolina, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.
Advice to consumers
-----------------------
The FDA continues to advise consumers not to eat any Peter Pan peanut
butter purchased since May 2006. FDA also continues to advise
consumers not to eat any Great Value peanut butter purchased since
May 2006 with product code beginning with the numbers "2111" on the
jar lid. All such products should be thrown out. If consumers cannot
find a number on the jar lid or are unsure, the safest thing to do is
to discard the product.
Anyone who has a jar of the affected peanut butter and who has become
ill should also report to state or local health authorities that they
have a jar. Individuals who have eaten the affected peanut butter
within the last week and who do not feel sick most likely will not
get sick. However, persons who begin to have symptoms [including
fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps] should see a health care professional.
FDA actions to date
-------------------------
On 13 Feb 2007, FDA was notified by CDC and state health departments
of data showing an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Tennessee infection in
people who reported having eaten out of certain jars of Peter Pan
peanut butter. Since that time, FDA has been conducting an active
investigation of Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter made by
ConAgra in the same facility.
On 13 Feb 2007, FDA contacted ConAgra officials and on 14 Feb 2007,
ConAgra agreed to initiate a product recall.
On 14 Feb 2007, FDA took the following actions:
- Notified the public of the findings related to the salmonella
outbreak and advised consumers not to eat peanut butter from jars
with a certain product code.
- Notified its counterpart agencies in Canada and Mexico, the WHO
INFOSAN Food Safety reporting program, and the food safety authority
at the European Commission.
- Sent a team of microbiologists and experienced field investigators
to begin its inspection of ConAgra's manufacturing plant in Georgia.
The inspection will include collecting environmental, raw ingredient,
and product samples, and reviewing manufacturing and quality assurance records.
Next steps
-----------
- FDA laboratory personnel will analyze samples collected from the
manufacturing plant.
- FDA will conduct a thorough inspection and assess its own
inspectors' observations of the manufacturing plant for any necessary
follow up actions. If international distribution is documented, FDA
will inform and work with its counterpart agencies in those countries.
- FDA will continue to work closely with CDC and state health
authorities to track any additional cases of _Salmonella_ Tennessee illness.
- FDA will continue to work with ConAgra and inspect records to
determine the distribution of the recalled product both within the
USA and overseas.
- FDA will continue to provide regular updates to the public as this
investigation unfolds.
Recall Status
--------------------------------------------
ConAgra is recalling all Peter Pan peanut butter and all Great Value
peanut butter beginning with product code "2111" that already was
distributed. The company also is destroying all affected products in
its possession. The company has stopped production and is working to
identify the cause of the contamination. ConAgra has advised
consumers to destroy all Peter Pan peanut butter and any Great Value
peanut butter beginning with product code "2111".
