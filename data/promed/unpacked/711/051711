H1N1 detected in 3 pigs at Minnesota State Fair
-----------------------------------------------
Infection could be first among US animals; experts cite a new concern
but say food safe.

Three pigs exhibited at the Minnesota State Fair this summer [2009]
tested positive for the H1N1 virus, a preliminary result Friday [16
Oct 2009] that if confirmed would mark the 1st time the worrisome
virus has been found in US animals.

State officials tried to allay concern, saying the spread was
expected, given the deep inroads the H1N1 virus has made into the
human population. Health officials stressed that human-to-human
transmission is the real battleground in the pandemic.

Still, the results spark a new worry -- that the virus could mutate
into a more deadly form as it moves between species. "There's no
evidence there's a change in the virus, but that is a concern," said
Dr Joni Scheftel, public health veterinarian with the Minnesota
Department of Health.

The H1N1 virus already had been found in swine in Canada, Argentina,
Ireland, and elsewhere, but not in the United States. [Until now, if
this is confirmed, which seems likely. - Mod.TG]

The infected pigs were tested during research in the State Fair's
swine barn, between 26 Aug and 1 Sep [2009]. The US Department of
Agriculture said the animals "showed no signs of illness and were
apparently healthy."

State officials suspect the pigs caught the virus from fairgoers,
although they can't be sure. The animals each had a different owner
and were tested on different days. [In other countries where a pig
has become infected with H1N1, it has been from a human being, so
this approach is logical based on preceding evidence. - Mod.TG]

Because the tests were confidential, not even the farmers have been
notified which animals were infected, said Jeff Bender of the
University of Minnesota Center for Animal Health and Food Safety.

The swine research involved the U [University of Minnesota], the
University of Iowa, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, it seems likely the infected animals were sent to slaughter,
the typical pattern, said Gene Hugoson, Minnesota's commissioner of
agriculture. When asked whether the public should be concerned about
that, Hugoson said: "Not to my way of thinking." He added, "There is
absolutely no food safety risk from eating any kind of pork that has
been contaminated with H1N1. ... Any pig that would exhibit any kind
of health indications would not be accepted for slaughter."

During the Fair, a group of 4-H students became ill with the H1N1
flu, but the USDA said Friday [16 Oct 2009] that "information
available at this time would suggest the children were not sickened
by contact with the Fair pigs."

The students were mostly involved in the performing arts and
ambassador program -- not the livestock programs. Fair officials
ordered more than 100 teens to return home early after 4 of them had
confirmed infections and several others reported flu-like symptoms.

The USDA is awaiting confirmation of the Minnesota swine tests and
should get results "within the next few days," the department said.
"Like people, swine routinely get sick or contract influenza
viruses," Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said. He, too, noted that
the virus couldn't be spread by eating pork.

The new strain of H1N1 has been linked to 7 deaths and nearly 500
hospitalizations in Minnesota since it emerged in the spring [2009].

While human health has been the paramount concern during the H1N1
outbreak, the illness's early moniker of "swine flu" has hurt the
pork industry. A number of global trading partners have refused to
buy US pork products, which has especially hurt Minnesota, the
nation's no. 3 pork-producing state.

[It seems probable that this will be confirmed. It also seems likely
that these pigs acquired the infection from a person. Based upon the
Canadian and others experience with this disease the swine recover
without any deaths or ill effects. It is likely these animals would
have been allowed to recover without any treatment. However this
article indicates these animals may have passed antemortem inspection
and been passed into the food chain. The article correctly states
that the animals would not have been slaughtered if there were signs
of illness. - Mod.TG]
