The review panel on new SARS case and biosafety
---------------------------------------------
An 11-member Review Panel, comprising local and external experts, was
tasked by the Ministry of Health to review (a) epidemiologic data of
the recent SARS case and (b) the biosafety requirements and practices
at Singapore's BSL3 laboratories. It was led by Dr Antony
Della-Porta, a WHO biosafety expert. The Panel has completed its
investigation and submitted its Report to the Ministry.
Epidemiologic Investigation
From the results of its investigations, the Panel has concluded that
the patient most likely acquired the infection in the Environmental
Health Institute (EHI) laboratory where he had worked.
Inappropriate laboratory procedures and a cross-contamination of West
Nile virus samples with SARS coronavirus in the laboratory led to the
infection of the doctoral student. No evidence could be found of any
other source of infection.
The Panel's conclusion is further supported by the results of the
genome sequencings on the laboratory strain of SARS coronavirus and
that of the patient's. Both genome sequences were found to be closely
related.
The Panel also established that there is no evidence of secondary
transmission and this is an isolated case of SARS.
Biosafety Standards
The Panel also reviewed the 3 existing BSL3 laboratories and found a
large range of biosafety structures and practices.
The Panel recommended that we take the opportunity to put in place a
national legislative framework for ensuring international standards
in biosafety in our laboratories. Where gaps in biosafety standards
were identified, the Panel has made specific recommendations to
rectify them. The details are in their Report.
In particular, the Panel highlighted the need for laboratory
certification covering both structural integrity and operating
procedures. A regular audit process should also be put in place for
all BSL3 facilities. Competency based training in biological safety
should also be adopted and all personnel involved in BSL3 facilities
be properly trained.
Follow Up
The Ministry thanks the Panel for their thorough investigation and
comprehensive recommendations. The Ministry will work with the
relevant agencies to follow up on the recommendations.
This case of accidental laboratory contamination has provided us with
the opportunity to improve our laboratory practices and to raise our
biosafety standards in all our laboratories.

[For those who are interested, we highly recommend reading the
original report in its entirety. In addition to an in-depth
discussion of possible breaches in BSL3 laboratory procedures, along
with recommendations for correction, there is mention that the case
in fact did have a clinical illness consistent with SARS, including
fever, dry cough, and both conventional x-ray and CT-documented
pneumonia. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-associated coronavirus
(Co-V) included stool and sputum specimens positive by reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed by 2 other
laboratories. Serial serum samples also documented seroconversion to
the SARS Co-V.
The report presents the following analysis:
Transmission Hypotheses
1) Patient acquired infection a while ago and carried it latently.
Evidence against:
a) Patient has recent documentation of seroconversion that coincides
with clinical infection.
b) Patient denies contact with any known SARS case or travel to
previously SARS affected areas.
2) Patient recently acquired infection from someone
Evidence against:
a) One work contact had recent illness, but clinical picture was not
consistent with SARS (nausea and vomiting; no fever). This person did
not work with live SARS coronavirus. Serum taken from this person 27
days after illness onset was negative for antibodies to the SARS
coronavirus.
b) Patient denies contact with any other ill person. Interviews with
family and work colleagues support this assertion.
3) Patient acquired infection through laboratory contamination
Evidence for:
a) Patient worked in BSL-3 laboratory 3.5 days before his illness
onset. This is consistent with the expected incubation period for
SARS. Although the patient reported working only on West Nile virus,
the laboratory was doing live SARS work around that time.
b) Poor record keeping makes it difficult to ascertain whether there
was live virus in the BSL-3 laboratory on the day of his visit, but
we do know it was there 2 days before.
c) Procedures for laboratory safety differed widely between
laboratory personnel at EHI and were not always appropriate.
d) Testing of the frozen specimen that patient worked with on 23 Aug
2003 was positive by RT-PCR for the SARS coronavirus and West Nile
virus, suggesting contamination.
e) The laboratory works on only one strain of the SARS coronavirus,
so the laboratory strain and patient strain were sequenced for
comparison. Approximately 91 percent of the genome was sequenced from
patient and found to be most closely related to the sequence of the
laboratory strain. Minor differences observed are likely the results
of the natural mutation rate for the virus.
To date there have been no secondary cases. The recommendation was
made to retest all laboratory personnel and contacts of this patient
at 28 days following exposure to ensure no secondary transmission.
An interesting and sobering report. - Mod.MPP]
