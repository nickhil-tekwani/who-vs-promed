Cholera has broken out in Ndeema area of Namwala district where 3
people have been admitted to 2 treatment centers. Namwala district
commissioner Eunice Nawa confirmed the outbreak yesterday, 10 Apr
2006, but said there had been no deaths so far.
Nawa said 2 cholera patients were admitted to Ichila health center
while 1 was receiving treatment at Chitongo health center. She said
all the 3 patients were in stable condition. Nawa said the Ministry
of Health in Namwala had established the source of the disease as
Bweengwa. She said 5 people from Ndeema area in chief Muchila
travelled to Bweengwa for a funeral where they are suspected to have
contracted the disease.
"After attending the funeral in Bweengwa, they got back to their
homes where they fell ill," she explained.
Nawa said health personnel had since disinfected the affected 70
houses in Ndeema area.
Nawa said her office was making frantic efforts to alert Monze
district commissioner Joyce Nondo on the prevalence of cholera in
Bweengwa area.

[2] Cholera - Angola

As the outbreak of cholera is rapidly spreading in Angola's capital
Luanda and into other parts of the country, the international
humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) urges the
Angolan authorities to officially declare the outbreak and
immediately take all the necessary measures needed for controlling it.
Today, 13 Apr 2006, the total number of confirmed cases of cholera
stands at 8930, with 413 people reported to have died from cholera.
At the end of last week, almost 250 new patients were arriving daily
in the cholera treatment centres of MSF. This week that number has
doubled to 500 new cases per day.
"We are afraid the outbreak is out of control," says Richard Veerman,
MSF's Head of Mission in Angola. "Cholera was already spreading at a
very fast rate. Yesterday it started raining, which will only make it
more difficult to stop the epidemic."
Since the beginning of the outbreak, almost 5000 people have been
treated by MSF in its 5 cholera centers in Luanda. MSF is currently
stepping up its activities in response to the outbreak by sending
additional medical staff and materials to the provinces of Bengo,
Benguela, Cuanza Norte and Malanga. In Bengo MSF opened a cholera
centre yesterday, 12 Apr 2006.
"So far we have been able to treat all cholera-infected people that
came to our centers," says Luis Encinas, Medical Emergency
Coordinator. "But the current trend of the epidemic suggests that we
will see many more cases in the coming days and weeks. Our cholera
centres are running at maximum capacity. Without a dramatically
increased effort from others, starting with the authorities, we will
probably see many more people fall ill and die."

A cholera outbreak hitting Angola since mid-Feb 2006 has worsened and
killed some 326 people since then, health officials said. The
outbreak, which started in the Angolan capital of Luanda, had spread
to 3 other provinces.
"The situation is worsening and it is worrying us," Health Minister
Sebastiao Veloso said.
Some 6782 cases had been registered countrywide in the provinces of
Luanda, Bengela, Bengo and North Kuanza, which had the highest
mortality rate with 66 dead in 770 people diagnosed with the disease,
an official report said.
The Boavista neighborhood in Luanda was still the center of the
epidemic. About 4 million people live in Luanda, where public
infrastructure crumbled during a 2-decade civil war that ended in
2002.
