[As mentioned in a previous report, since October 2020 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by H5 subtype viruses, has been affecting several countries in Europe.

The following information comes from a scientific report (page 37) providing an avian influenza overview in the EU/EEA and UK published on 29 Sep 2021, which is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-overview-september-2021.pdf:

"The 2020-2021 HPAI A(H5) epidemic with a total of 1298 HPAI outbreaks in poultry, 22.9 million birds affected, 85 detections in captive birds, and 2394 HPAI events in wild birds in 31 European countries represents one of the largest and long-lasting HPAI epidemics that has ever occurred in Europe. The epidemiological data presented in this report indicate that the virus is still circulating in domestic and wild bird populations in some European countries and that the epidemic is not over yet. During the summer months, HPAI A(H5) viruses were detected at lower levels than in winter and spring in resident wild bird populations, mainly in northern Europe. HPAI outbreaks also occurred in poultry and captive birds in a few EU countries. Based on these observations, it appears that the persistence of HPAI A(H5) in Europe continues to pose a risk of further virus incursions in domestic bird populations.

"The HPAI detections in wild birds in the reporting period indicated that the virus is able to persist in wild birds breeding in the EU/EEA, even after a large number of wintering waterbirds (including barnacle geese, greylag geese, Eurasian wigeons, and mallards) have gone away. The persistence of HPAI in wild birds during the 2021 summer (opposite to what occurred in previous years, when HPAI disappeared in spring) suggests that the virus may be adapting to maintenance in wild birds. In coming months, many wild waterbirds, including young birds that hatched in 2021, will again arrive at their wintering areas in the EU/EEA. Because these young birds have never been exposed to HPAI, their presence may result in an increased prevalence of the still present HPAI virus, thereby increasing the risk of incursion into poultry farms." - Mod.CRD
