A health ministry official said Wed 26 Aug 2015, 8 people have died of pneumonic plague in 2 days on the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar which is hit by deadly outbreaks almost every year.

Pneumonic plague is rare and more vicious than the commonly-known bubonic strain as it gives antimicrobials little time to act and can kill within 24 hours.

"12 cases of pneumonic plague have been identified," out of which 8 people have died in 2 days, Maherisoa Ratsitorahina, the health ministry's chief epidemiologist, told AFP. He said the disease was confined to Antsahatsihanarina village, which is less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city of Moramanga [Alaotra-Mangoro region, Toamasina province] in the east of the island.

Plague is endemic in Madagascar where outbreaks have resurfaced often since 1980 and are blamed mainly on rats and flea infestation due to unbridled deforestation. Pneumonic plague can be spread from person to person through coughing.

The WHO warned early in 2015 that the number of plague cases has steadily increased over the last 3 years, making Madagascar the world's most affected country. In 2013, the country registered 86 cases and 39 deaths while between September 2014 to February 2015, a total of 263 people were infected cases and at least 71 killed.

[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, which in Madagascar is carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages.

The following paragraph of this posting is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627662/pdf/9452403.pdf:
Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) [pop. 22.92 million, 2013] has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the "Black Plague" and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-80; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear if this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread.

Moramanga (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moramanga) is a city in Madagascar between the capital city Antananarivo and the east coast. The name Mora-manga literally means "easy to beautify". The city of Moramanga has an important place in the history of Madagascar. It was in Moramanga, on the night of 29 Mar 1947 that the Malagasy Uprising against French colonial rule started. Moramanga is also the capital city of the Bezanozano people (one of the 18 Ethnic groups of Madagascar. Moramanga is in the Alaotra-Mangoro region.
