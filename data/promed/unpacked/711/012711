[As noted in the report above, ASF had been reported as absent since 2012. Based on the OIE Annual Report submitted by Kenya that year, 4 outbreaks were reported: 2 in Central Province, one in Nyanza Province, and one in Western Province. See http://tinyurl.com/phermlj.

ASF is also present in countries bordering with Kenya http://tinyurl.com/o9eo3da (Click on southern Africa, zoom in. Note: choose the disease and a list of countries by disease to reveal the situation).

In endemic areas of Africa, the most important factors to help control the spread of the disease is to control the natural tick vectors and wild pig reservoirs and limit their contact with domestic pigs.

During disease outbreaks, the rapid and efficient slaughtering of all pigs and the proper disposal of carcasses and all waste material are critical. In addition, cleaning and disinfecting affected farms, designating infected areas, conducting surveillance, and increasing the control of animal movements will help control spread. In the presence of any suspicious haemorrhagic pig disease, a differential laboratory diagnosis should be undertaken, as low virulent ASF strains do not produce significant lesions (http://www.au-ibar.org/african-swine-fever).

Rapid communication of an outbreak is key to helping prevent the spread of the disease. This particular case was confirmed back on 17 Jul 2015 and has only now been officially reported to the OIE, a month and a half following its confirmation.

ASF is not a zoonotic disease and does not affect [human] public health.
