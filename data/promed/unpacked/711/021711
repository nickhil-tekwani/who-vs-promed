A 46-year-old tanker driver of Malian nationality, from Niger where a cholera epidemic is currently raging was admitted to the Health and Social Promotion Center (CSPS) in Tanwalbougou, [Gourma province] where he was quickly taken care of by the team that suspected cholera and transmitted the information to the various levels of the health system.

The diagnostic and support system was immediately implemented. Patient contacts have been identified for surveillance purposes.

Confirmation of cholera was made by the National Public Health Laboratory (LNSP) which identified _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa from the same serogroup and serotype as that which is rife in Niger. The patient is currently in hospital at the CSPS in Tanwalbougou and his clinical condition is stable.

The Ministry of Health invites the populations to respect prevention, hygiene and sanitation measures, particularly during this rainy season: consume drinking water, wash fruits and vegetables with soap or bleach before consuming them, avoid self-medication, and go to a health facility in case of doubt.

Cholera has so far killed 39 people in the last 3 weeks in 18 out of the 23 local government areas of Sokoto State, a top government official has confirmed. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Ali Inname disclosed this to reporters on [15 Aug 2021] in Sokoto while giving an update on the epidemic ravaging the state. According to Inname, 23 out of the casualties were recorded in the 1st 2 weeks of the epidemic, while the remaining 16 deaths were recorded in the past week.

He stated that Yabo, Dange/Shuni and Gwadabawa local government areas have continued to record active cases of the disease. The Commissioner further disclosed that his ministry has constituted 3 rapid response teams that were already fully operational. Inname also said the state government had stockpiled adequate intravenous fluids, drugs, and other related medicaments which were being distributed to all the affected local government areas. He also said the ministry was conducting a statewide immunization against cholera as part of efforts to stem the tide of the disease.

He added: "Scientifically, this problem may not completely abate until the current rainy season subsides. So, there is the need for the people to continue to ensure personal and environmental hygiene as well as heed to all medical advice issued by health professionals."

In a related development, cholera cases have risen to 63 in Adamawa State, the state Ministry of Health and Human Service said, adding that the numbers are increasing every day.

The Kaduna state government says it recorded 1665 cases of cholera between April and August [2021]. Amina Mohammed-Baloni, the state commissioner for health, disclosed this on [Thu 19 Aug 2021], during a press briefing. The commissioner said the cases were recorded in 19 of the 23 LGAs [local government areas] in the state.

She identified the affected LGAs as Soba, Makarfi, Giwa, Chikun, Sabon Gari, Zaria, Kaduna North, Kachia, Jaba, Kubau, Lere, Sanga, Birnin-Gwari, Kaduna South, Kadan, Igabi, and Kajuru.

The commissioner attributed the outbreak to poor hygiene and sanitation. She said the state has been monitoring the situation and is currently recording fewer active cases. "In April 2021, we were informed of cases of vomiting and diarrhea in some local government areas where we sent our response teams and took samples for testing and it returned positive for cholera," Mohammed-Baloni said. "Since then, we have been monitoring them. We treated 842 and discharged them while we still have 14 active cases now on treatment."

Mohammed-Baloni said there are secondary health facilities in the LGAs for management of the disease and added that the ministry has distributed drugs for management and chlorine for purification of water. "We know that cholera is seasonal and occurs mostly during rainy seasons, I urge residents to avoid building latrines close to their wells and observe good hygiene and sanitation," she said.

Last week [week of 9 Aug 2021], the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said more than 30 000 suspected cases of cholera have been reported in 22 states and the federal capital territory (FCT). Chikwe Ihekweazu, director-general of the NCDC, said more than 800 deaths were also recorded in the last 7 months.

No fewer than 40 persons have died out of about 1000 people reported to have been diagnosed with cholera in 17 local government areas of Niger State. A Deputy Director in the State Ministry of Health and Hospital Services, Dr Patrick Gimba confirmed this to the Nigerian Tribune during an exclusive interview on [Tue 17 Aug 2021] in Minna. He said: "Yes, we are experiencing an outbreak of cholera, while some people called it gastroenteritis."

Speaking further, he explained that the state is "doing a lot of things and one of the things is that as soon as there is an outbreak, be it cholera or COVID-19, or anything in form of an outbreak, first of all, we have to open Public Health Emergency Operation Centre.

"This is where we communicate with all the various local government areas (LGAs) because in each LGA, we have what we called the rapid response team in each of the LGAs.

"And luckily for us, the LGAs affected with this outbreak are just 17 LGAs in the state out of the 25 LGAs in Niger State. And we are in touch with the disease response team in which the Disease Surveillance Officer is a very strategic member of that team."

Dr Gimba explained that every year there is an outbreak of cholera because of the rainy season, pointing out that cholera is typically a water-borne disease.

"So, we have had over 1000 cases. I told you they were 17 local governments but at the moment in some local government areas where there has not been community transmission or that the transmission has stopped. I can tell you that for a while or for about 2 weeks now, there has not been any case from Gurara, Tafa, Magama, and Lapai local government areas," he said.

After 340 cases of diarrhea surfaced in Baltana [Mohali, Punjab] over the past 3 days, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) confirmed a cholera outbreak in the area.

Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with _Vibrio cholerae_ bacteria. The infection is often mild or without symptoms but can sometimes be severe and life-threatening. The cases have been reported from Ekta Vihar, Ravindra Enclave, Harmilap Nagar, and Modern enclave. On [Wed 11 Aug 2021] 50 fresh cases were reported from Modern Enclave.

On [Mon 16 Aug 2021] the authorities claimed to have found the source of contamination and even plugged it. Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, "We had sent the samples to the microbiology laboratory at PGIMER, Chandigarh, which has now confirmed a cholera outbreak. Medical camps are being held in all the colonies and we will intensify sampling. Medical teams and ambulances have been stationed in the area and free medicines are being provided to the affected people."

Zirakpur municipal council's executive officer Girish Verma said, "Though we have plugged the leakage, we are checking other pipes as well. We will be stopping the fresh water supply in these areas for the time being." 2 persons -- a 3-year-old girl and a 30-year-old man -- have died of the infection in the last 3 days.
