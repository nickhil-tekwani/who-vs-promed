Update number 357 (based on data up to 8 Dec 2019)
-------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
------------
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity continued to increase in most countries.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza activity was low overall, except for Cuba, where increased detections of influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses were reported. In tropical South American countries, influenza activity remained low.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity remained elevated in some countries of Middle and Western Africa.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries, but was reported at high levels in the Islamic Republic of Iran in recent weeks.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity continued to be reported in Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Philippines.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 112 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 25 Nov 2019 to 8 Dec 2019 (data as of 19 Dec 2019 11:04:16 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 86 210 specimens during that period. 9438 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 7067 (74.9%) were typed as influenza A and 2371 (25.1%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 1216 (30.2%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2809 (69.8%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 25 (5.2%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 458 (94.8%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Prison officials in Nebraska have canceled Christmas Eve visits due to the flu. In an alert posted to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services website, officials said visitation was canceled at the Nebraska State Penitentiary for Tue 24 Dec 2019 and that if visitation at other facilities were impacted due to illness, an update would be provided.

According to a news release sent on Sun 22 Dec 2019, nearly 4 dozen cases of the flu have been confirmed, with more cases suspected across 5 prison facilities, according to the Associated Press.

Nebraska is currently experiencing widespread flu activity, according to the state's health department, with 381 hospitalizations and at least one death so far this season. Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that at least 2.6 million cases of the flu have been reported, with at least 23 000 hospitalizations and 1300 deaths.

Nebraska is among several states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington to have "high" flu activity levels.

Prisons director Scott Frakes said the decision was made out of concern for protecting the public. "Obviously, the cancellation of visits (will) be an inconvenience, but we recognize the need to protect members of the public as well," Frakes said, according to the Associated Press.

A Pierce County child under the age of 5 died from flu-related complications according to the Tacoma Pierce Health Department, and doctors say it's the same strain of virus that led to the death of a child in King County last week.

The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department noted the child who died there also suffered from underlying health conditions.

"Sadly, flu strains currently in circulation this season [2019-2020] have hit the young very hard," said Nigel Turner, division director for the Communicable Disease Control Division.

AP told KIRO-7 that her grandson SP, 12, was diagnosed with influenza at an urgent care clinic -- because his doctor was booked up with appointments -- for flu symptoms.

"They said you have the flu, but they caught this flu early," SP said. "I'm going to be OK, because they gave me some medicine, and I'm going to be better."

Doctors in Pierce County say a B-strain of the flu virus was the cause of death for the child there, and they say it's the same strain which also lead to the death of a King County child last week. It was the 1st child flu-related death there in 10 years.

"This is the 2nd pediatric influenza death, and we are seeing a lot of influenza in children, which is unusual this time of year and reflects the strain of influenza that we're seeing in the community this season," said Turner.

Doctors say getting the flu shot should protect you against the new flu strain. They say the vaccine widens the circle of protection for those around you.

"I got the flu shot because I've got 3 beautiful babies, so we have to make sure they're happy, healthy, and well," said Bradley Below of Federal Way. "My wife convinced me to get it."

Four Cork hospitals have been forced to put visiting restrictions in place after a high volume of patients were confirmed with the flu.

Cork University Hospital, Bantry General Hospital, Mallow General Hospital, and Mercy University Hospital have all been affected by the outbreak.

They are asking patients with flu symptoms to see their local GP instead of heading straight to the emergency department.

The situation is currently being monitored, and the hospitals will release further updates in the coming days.

A spokesperson for the hospitals said: "Due to a high volume of patients confirmed with influenza in Cork University Hospital, Bantry General Hospital, Mallow General Hospital, and Mercy University Hospital, strict visiting restrictions have been put in place. The hospital would also like to remind the public of the importance of performing hand hygiene when visiting hospitals and would like to thank the public for their cooperation. It is also important to note that it is not too late to get the flu vaccine, and it is provided free of charge for people in at risk groups, which include everyone aged 65 years and over, pregnant women, anyone over 6 months of age with a long term illness requiring regular medical follow-up such as chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or those with lower immunity due to disease or treatment."

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/swine-flu-death-toll-across-maharashtra-climbs-to-244/articleshow/72930426.cms


The state's [Maharashtra] swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] death toll has surged to 244 between [1 Jan 2019 and 20 Dec 2019], with another 4 casualties recorded recently. Pune [district in Maharashtra state] has recorded the maximum number of deaths at 56, the state health department's latest report revealed.

The [influenza A/H1N1] virus transmission, experts say, is likely to rise further as the winter chill has led to a drop in temperature, providing a conducive atmosphere for the virus to grow and spread.

"The 4 [influenza A/H1N1] casualties occurred in Nagpur and Pune [districts in the state]. These deaths occurred in October [2019] but the state's death audit committee confirmed their cause of death as [influenza A/H1N1] in December [2019]. Hence, the number has risen. However, these are not recent deaths," said state surveillance officer Pradip Awate.

He further underlined that compared to last year [2018], the H1N1 casualties have seen a decline. "There were 462 H1N1 casualties in 2018. People with associated illnesses like diabetes and hypertension should be extra careful and treat any influenza-like illness without delay. They should avoid self-medication," Awate said.

[Influenza A/H1N1] virus has become endemic in India. However, state health officials have not lowered their guard. "We have been screening patients with influenza-like illness for [influenza A/H1N1]. A suspected patient is administered oseltamivir tablets, better known as Tamiflu or Fluvir. Mainly those with comorbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and others are screened for [influenza A/H1N1] at most state-run and municipal corporation-run hospitals and dispensaries," said another state health official.

In total, 31.83 lakh [3 183 000] persons with influenza-like illness have been screened for swine flu in Maharashtra so far, this year [2019]. "Of them, we have administered oseltamivir to 46 986 patients as they were suspected to have contracted the contagion," the official added.

[Influenza A/H1N1], like any other flu, is a respiratory infection. It exploits a weakened immune system to attack major organs, particularly the lungs. When the infection gets into the lungs, it can lead to pneumonia, which can be fatal. The flu can also cause secondary infections to the body, any of which can lead to failure of vital organs and eventually death.

The symptoms of [influenza A/H1N1] are similar to those of regular seasonal influenza and include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, and coughing. Some people with [influenza A/H1N1] have also reported a runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.
