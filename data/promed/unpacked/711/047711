Ministry calls for urgent response to rice diseases
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has urged
provincial authorities in the Hong (Red) River Delta to stamp out
ragged stunt and yellow black stunt, which hinder rice growth in the
region.

In Thai Binh Province, around 10 000 ha [24 710 acres] of
winter-spring crop at 7 out of 8 districts in the province were
infected with the diseases. The agriculture departments have guided
farmers to eliminate infected rice plants, spray fields with
agro-chemicals and keep them clean and replace current crops with
shorter-term rice crops.

Local authorities also asked farmers to take steps to stamp out brown
plant-hoppers, the pests that brought the diseases, with proper
spraying. In Nam Dinh Province, the pest infestation and the
resulting rice disease had occurred during the winter-spring rice
crop in 3 districts.

The provincial People's Committee will support farmers to
re-cultivate their crops and spray chemicals to avoid the diseases'
recurrence. The ministry has thus far provided 14 tonnes of anti-pest
chemicals to local farmers. The minister asked provincial authorities
to completely stamp out the diseases, as they could get difficult to
control if left untreated.

[_Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_) is known from a
number of countries in Asia with reported yield losses of up to 90
percent. Symptoms include ragged appearance of plants, twisted
leaves, vein swelling, unfilled grains, and severe stunting of
plants. Its only way of spread is vector transmission by brown
planthoppers (_Nilaparvata lugens_). Insects carrying RRSV remain
infectious for life and can be transported on air currents to spread
the virus quickly over long distances. Besides rice (_Oryza sativa_),
other species in the genus can also be affected.

The term "yellow black stunt" used above may refer to black streaked
dwarf disease. _Rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus
_Fijivirus_) is spread by several planthopper species (_Laodelphax
striatellus_, _Unkanodes_ spp.). Symptoms include darkening and
distortion of leaves, black streaked tumours along leaf veins, and
severe stunting of plants. It also affects some other graminaceous
hosts including maize, wheat, oat and barley. Recently, a new but
apparently related virus, Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus
(SRBSDV) was reported from the region (ProMED-mail post
20091217.4263). Symptoms are similar to RBSDV, but it has a different
vector, the white-backed planthopper (_Sogatella furcifera_).

Disease management for rice viruses includes cultural practices,
vector control, and use of cultivars with reduced sensitivity or
resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. Cultivars resistant to
the vectors tend to have low disease incidence, but insect adaptation
overcoming hopper resistance has been a problem. The application of
insecticides to migratory planthoppers is being used in some areas to
reduce disease incidence.
