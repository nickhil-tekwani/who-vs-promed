Summary of outbreaks
New outbreaks (5)
[The report includes details of 5 outbreaks of Surra located in the departments of Artigas (4) and Rivera (1), Uruguay. Their respective dates, affected population description, locations, statistics, and an interactive map are available at the source URL above. - Mod.CRD]

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Equidae / 612 / 11 / 0 / - / - / 0

Affected population: horses on farms

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Within the framework of serological surveillance activities aimed at detecting the presence or absence of _Trypanosoma evansi_ in the equine species, positive equines without clinical symptoms were detected. Surveillance covered departments in the North and West coast of the country. The epidemiological survey conducted in the establishments determined that they had no history of symptomatology compatible with the disease. The clinical inspection carried out by the official service in each establishment did not detect any symptoms compatible with Surra either. The samples were processed in the official laboratory using the card agglutination technique of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp (Belgium), the OIE Reference Center for Surra. As a primary measure, the movement of animals from these farms was restricted. As a next measure, surveillance will be established in the positive farms, where animals will be re-sampled for additional tests. Sampling continues as part of the surveillance program.

Control measures applied in domestic: movement control inside the country

Control measures to be applied in domestic: screening

"_Trypanosoma evansi_ causes a trypanosomosis known as 'surra'. It affects a large number of wild and domesticated animal species in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. The principal host species varies geographically, but camels, horses, buffalos and cattle are particularly affected, although other animals, including wildlife, are also susceptible. It is an arthropod-borne disease; several species of haematophagous flies, including Tabanids and Stomoxes, are implicated in transferring infection from host to host, acting as mechanical vectors. In Brazil, vampire bats are also implicated in a unique type of biological transmission.

"No vaccines are available for the disease.

"_Trypanosoma evansi_ is not known to have a zoonotic potential".

Abstract
"_Trypanosoma evansi_, the causal agent of Surra, is a salivarian African trypanosoma introduced in America during the 15th century. In this study we report the first case of African trypanosomiasis in Uruguay. We describe clinical signs and the evolution of the disease on a Uruguayan Cimarron dog, as well as the isolation and molecular characterization of the _Trypanosoma evansi_ reported strain. This constitutes the first case of Surra in Uruguay, showing the expansion of the parasite to the south of the American continent. Future work is needed to identify the vector and possible reservoirs in order to avoid the spread of the disease. The epidemiological relevance of the findings is discussed". - Mod.CRD
