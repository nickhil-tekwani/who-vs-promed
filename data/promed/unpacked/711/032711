Today is the beginning of bear hunting season in Minnesota and the
Department of Natural Resources is warning hunters about the risk of eating
bears which have fed on infected cattle.

[I believe that all the dead affected cattle on the 2 farms were burned.
However in that there may be other cases elsewhere unreported or unobserved
this warning is not out of place. In the outbreak in Northern Alberta an
affected bear was found; a similar situation applied in the 1993 outbreak
in the MacKenzie Bison Sanctuary. It is not the good hunters that I worry
about but their rifle challenged colleagues, with or without the aid of
alcohol, who stumble on a (sick) bear that is too slow to evade them and
thus gets shot, skinned and maybe eaten. There may be some Darwinian
justice in this though. - MHJ
