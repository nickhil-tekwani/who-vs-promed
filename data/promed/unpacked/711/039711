Madagascar: 4 people die from food poisoning in the Diana region (North)
----------------------------------------
In a fishing village in the Diana region, 27 people suffered from food poisoning after eating sea turtle meat. The newspaper L'Express de Madagascar related the event taking place in a fishing village in the Diana region. According to the mayor of the town, residents found a sea turtle that had just laid eggs by the sea the week before. After killing her, they shared the meat of the protected animal. A total of 27 people suffered from food poisoning. Four of them did not survive, including 3 children.

Since Tuesday [19 Oct 2021], 17 patients have been admitted to Ambanja hospital, and 3 adults are still in serious condition, according to information from the head of the fishing department Fiarema. The latter explained that these victims made a long trip by speedboat, then by bush taxi before arriving at the hospital. The mayor of the town said that those in charge do not cease to sensitize the villagers to not eat the flesh of turtles, especially during this period. "But they are stubborn," he blasted.

Each year, food poisoning kills several people in Malagasy coastal areas, especially in the Diana region. Health authorities advise against consuming many species at this time of year. The newspaper reported that sea turtles are on their way to extinction and must not be fished, sold or consumed.

[Earlier this year (Foodborne illness - Madagascar: sea turtle meat, fatal 20210320.8259449), ProMED reported that 19 people, 9 of them children, had died from foodborne illness in Madagascar after eating a turtle in Vatomandry, on the east of the island.

Episodes of sea turtle poisoning can be found in the literature. An example of one episode was posted in the Sea Turtle List-serve (http://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0101&L=CTURTLE&P=R14884) by a marine conservation officer in the Solomon Islands:

". . . 28 people (20 children and 8 adults) of Niniveh Village in Marovo Lagoon, western province, Solomon Islands, suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, needles and pins, and general weakness after eating turtle meat (which turtle species is yet to be confirmed) on the evening of Tue 16 Jan 2001. The symptoms described occurred 4-6 hours after consumption of turtle meat. The said people consumed only turtle meat (no other protein source consumed). Those who did not consume turtle meat did not experience the symptoms.

"Six people (all children between 3 months and 11 years old) out of the 28 people died [within 5 days]. Observers reported that the turtle, when caught, was weak; upon being butchered, it was reported to have gut contents smaller than usual; there was a strong smell of urea/urine in the gut, and the meat was unusually soft."

"From the meat of a turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, implicated in fatal intoxication, lyngbyatoxin A was identified . . . As turtles feed on sea grass, contaminating blue-green algae belonging to genus _Lyngbya_ were deduced to be the source of the toxin."

"Abstract
--------
In December 1994, a mass food poisoning through ingestion of turtle affected about 60 persons on the northeastern coast of Madagascar. The prevailing clinical signs were digestive (nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, acute stomatitis) and might persist during several weeks. The poisoning attack rate was 48% with a lethality of 7.7%. Such [an] accident, even if rare in Madagascar, requires a structured organization to control sea products poisoning and to set up adequate prevention measures."

Turtle poisoning (chelonitoxication) appears to be caused by eating the flesh of certain marine turtles (green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, leatherback turtle). Turtle meat is considered a delicacy in many countries. Hawksbills carry a toxin in their skin called chelonitoxin, which may be accumulated through the food chain as noted above. People who eat the skin and/or meat of the turtle can experience nausea; a burning sensation of the lips, tongue, and mouth; difficulty in swallowing; a tightness in the chest; skin rash; enlargement of the liver; or even coma and death.

Diana is a region in Madagascar on the northeast part of the island. It borders the regions of Sava to the southeast and Sofia to the southwest. The regional capital is Antsiranana (previously known as Diego Suarez) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Region). - Mod.LL
