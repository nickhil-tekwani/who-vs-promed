The provincial task force on African swine fever [ASF] in Northern Samar is on alert for unusual swine deaths after reporting its 1st ASF case in Lope de Vega town on Tuesday [30 Mar 2021].

Provincial veterinarian Jose Luis Acompanado, vice chairman of the ASF task force in the province, said they would continue blood sample collection within 7 km [4.3 mi] of the affected area in Barangay Bonifacio.

"Active surveillance is crucial in determining the extent of ASF outbreak in Lope de Vega to prevent further spread of the virus," Acompanado said.

He said animal quarantine checkpoints were put up in strategic areas, adding that disinfection of hog farms would continue.

Authorities said 200 pigs within the 500 m [0.3 mi] radius of the 1st confirmed case would be culled.

Northern Samar is the 2nd province in Eastern Visayas affected by ASF.

Leyte recorded its 1st case in Abuyog town on 14 Jan [2021]. Eleven other areas in Leyte -- Javier, Dulag, La Paz, Burauen, MacArthur, Palo, Pastrana, Tanauan, Tacloban City, Mayorga, and Jaro -- were hit by the swine disease.

Around 16 000 pigs were depopulated in Leyte in the past 2 months.

Investigation showed that ASF could have been transmitted to local farms through an infected boar used for natural mating.

Swill feeding was also blamed for the spread of the disease.
