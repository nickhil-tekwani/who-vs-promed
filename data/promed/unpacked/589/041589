During the past week in Taiwan, 6 new indigenous dengue fever cases were reported bringing the country's total for 2015 to 108. Of the 6 cases detected, 5 were confirmed in Nanzih District, Kaohsiung City.

The Taiwan CDC says according to the epidemiological investigation, the 5 cases had all visited the same market, while the other new case resides in Cianjhen District, Kaohsiung City.

Taiwan CDC stresses that we have entered the dengue season and there is currently no effective vaccine or cure for dengue fever. As dengue fever is transmitted by vector mosquitoes, including _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, in Taiwan, besides taking personal precautions against mosquito bites, the public is urged to regularly remove vector-breeding sites, ensure the cleanliness of the environment as well as recycle all unwanted containers in and around the residence in order to prevent the breeding of the vector mosquito.

In addition, if symptoms such as fever, headache, retroorbital pain, myalgia, arthragia, and rash develop after returning to Taiwan from an area at high risk for dengue fever, please seek immediate medical attention and inform the doctor of any relevant medical history, recent travel history and activity to facilitate prompt diagnosis and case reporting.

Physicians are advised to be vigilant for suspected cases, inquire about such patients' travel history, and notify any suspected cases to the health authority immediately to facilitate implementation of subsequent measures that prevent further transmission of the disease.

[Dengue is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the 4 dengue virus serotypes. It is a febrile illness that affects infants, young children and adults with symptoms appearing 3-14 days after the infective bite.

Dengue is not transmitted directly from person-to-person, and symptoms range from mild fever, to incapacitating high fever, with severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. There is no vaccine or any specific medicine to treat dengue. People who have dengue fever should rest, drink plenty of fluids and reduce the fever using paracetamol or see a doctor.

Severe dengue (also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever) is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding and breathing difficulty and is a potentially lethal complication, affecting mainly children. Early clinical diagnosis and careful clinical management by trained physicians and nurses increase survival. (see http://www.who.int/topics/dengue/en/)

It is of paramount importance to timely seek medical attention and timely refer dengue patients for appropriate case management, as most patients believe they may be better when the fever subsides while entering the critical period of 3-7 days after disease onset.
