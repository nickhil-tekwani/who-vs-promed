New York City Revises Strategy for Mosquito Control
---------------------------------------------------
[New York city mobilized its first line of defense in its war on West Nile
virus-carrying mosquitoes this morning, with workers scheduled to start
placing larvicide in catch basins, city Health Department officials
announced yesterday.
Workers will take about a week to bait the city's 145 000 catch basins with
small pellets designed to wipe out mosquito eggs, said Deputy Health
Commissioner Sandra Mullin. The pellets require monthly replacement. The
baiting of the basins marks a shift in the city's mosquito prevention
policy, which has relied on pesticide spraying. The city rejected the only
bid it received this year for spraying when the contractor was cited for
worker safety violations. This year, city officials say they will require a
higher threshold of evidence before launching wide-scale spraying on adult
mosquitoes, which have an 8 to 10 day life cycle. Instead, the city plans to
primarily rely on sewer and basin traps, bug-eating fish, larvae treatments
and surveillance, Mullin said. Any spraying will be limited to a 1-mile
radius of an infected area.
Environmental groups still denounced the plan, calling it too vague and
saying it leaves open the possibility of using pesticides. Mullin said the
pesticide the city uses, Anvil, is risk-free when used properly.
Dr. Philip Landrigan, director of the Center for Children's Health and the
Environment at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, praised the city for devising
"a very simple and sensible plan...in confronting a virus we know can kill
people." Mosquitoes contract the potentially deadly West Nile virus by
feeding on infected birds. Last summer, 14 city residents tested positive
for the virus, including one in Queens. One victim, an 87-year-old Brooklyn
woman, died.
