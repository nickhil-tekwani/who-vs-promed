[According to the information provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), for the 2013 transmission season (through 12 Sep 2013), 139 human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the EU and another 361 cases in neighbouring countries. During the past week, 33 new cases were detected in the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina reported its 1st case of the year (2013) from the canton of Tuzlansko-podrinjski. Additional information and maps are available at http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/west_nile_fever/West-Nile-fever-maps/Pages/index.aspx

The Hungarian National Association of Radio Distress-Signaling and Info communications (RSOE) which operates the Emergency and Disaster Information Service (EDIS) reported that 'an elderly man (84) from Tuzla was admitted to hospital in Tuzla after doctors discovered he was infected by the West Nile virus.' The report also indicated that the human case was reported at a time when a number of birds were found dead around the city and when an increase in the mosquito population was being noted. Health authorities expect more human cases to be reported (http://hisz.rsoe.hu/alertmap/site/?pageid=event_desc&edis_id=BH-20130910-40869-BIH).

The canton of Tuzlansko-podrinjski (Tuzla) is located about 80 km (50 mi) from the canton of Sarajevo where a case in a hooded crow was recently reported (http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_Distance_Calculator.asp).

The WAHID disease time series analysis shows that between January 2012 to September 2013, 32 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE: 11 in Croatia, 20 in Greece 20, and one in Bosnia and Herzegovina (see via http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries).

The global status of WNV can be obtained from the most recent semi-annual report of the OIE at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.
