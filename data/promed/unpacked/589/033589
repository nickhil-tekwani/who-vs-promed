[5] WHO Update

On 30 Apr 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 18 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in mainland China.

Details of the cases:
Onset dates ranged from 6 to 23 Apr 2017. Of these 18 cases, 8 were female. The median age was 58 years old (age range among the cases is 4 to 74 years old). The cases were reported from Beijing (2), Chongqing (1), Fujian (1), Gansu (1), Guangdong (2), Henan (1), Hunan (1), Jiangsu (1), Jilin (1), Shandong (2), and Sichuan (5).

At the time of notification, there were 3 deaths, 14 cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (4) or severe pneumonia (10), and one case was diagnosed as mild. 17 cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry markets. One was reported to have had no known poultry exposure.

To date, a total of 1439 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.

Public health response:
Considering the increase in the number of human cases since December 2016, the Chinese government at national and local levels is taking further measures, which include:

- Strengthening risk assessment and guidance on prevention and control for northern provinces, which are reporting increasing cases. On 24 Apr 2017, the NHFPC convened a videoconference on avian influenza A(H7N9) prevention and control for 11 northern provinces.
- Continuing to strengthen control measures with focus on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation.
- Conducting detailed source investigation to inform targeted prevention and control measures.
- Continuing to detect and treat cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) early to reduce mortality.
- Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection.
- Strengthening virology surveillance to better understand virus contamination levels and mutations in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.

WHO risk assessment
--------------
The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the 5th epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 Oct 2016) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves.

Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.

Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.

[6] Human to human transmission
Date: 9 May 2017

Abstract:
Since throat swab specimens obtained from 3 adult Chinese patients were confirmed as an avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) virus by local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2013,[1] many confirmed cases have been reported in Mainland of China. Although family and hospital clusters with confirmed or suspected avian H7N9 virus infection were previously reported, and person-to-person transmission was put forward, human infection of H7N9 appears to be associated with exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments [2], and no clear evidence has proved that it could transmit from person to person. Here, we report a case confirmed with H7N9 after intimate contact with his H7N9 ward mate; it may be the 1st case infected between ward mates in a ward, so we report it here.

[The report by Zhang et al is based on transmission of infection from a confirmed case of influenza A/H7N9 infection to another patient as a result of cohabitation in the same room for nearly 20 hours.

Other studies have shown that nearly 68 percent of infected cases have a history of visiting the live poultry market or exposure to market poultry, even without direct (touching) or indirect (within one meter) contact. [Liu B, Havers F, Chen E, Yuan Z, Yuan H, Ou J, et al. Risk factors for influenza A (H7N9) disease - China, 2013. Clin Infect Dis 2014;59:787-94. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciu423>].

Even though human-to-human transmission has rarely been confirmed, there have been some case reports of clusters in many cities of China. In this report, the authors state that "the 2nd case in this report had physical contact with the index case when assisting the index case to the bathroom (it lasted for 10 min) and had no history of exposure to live poultry or LPMs before the illness onset." How long (duration) and what direct physical contact would constitute serious risk? - Mod.UBA]

[7] Biological characterisation of A(H7N9) viruses in humans

With no or low virulence in poultry, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus has caused severe infections in humans. In the current 5th epidemic wave, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 virus emerged. The insertion of 4 amino acids (KRTA) at the haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site enabled trypsin-independent infectivity of this virus. Although maintaining dual receptor-binding preference, its HA antigenicity was distinct from low-pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9). The neuraminidase substitution R292K conferred a multidrug resistance phenotype.

[The article by Zhu et al describes some key features of influenza A/H7N9 viruses, including:

- low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A/H7N9 poses a higher risk for humans than highly pathogenic (HPAI) H5N1 because LPAI H7N9 can bind sialic acid alpha-2,6 human-type receptors, while HPAI H5N1 could not.
- The study data show the HPAI H7N9 viruses retain dual receptor binding properties, with slightly increased binding preference for both [human and avian] receptors compared with LPAI H7N9 viruses.
- It is well known that human upper respiratory tissues and trachea contain mainly alpha-2,6 receptors while lung tissue possesses mixtures of avian type alpha-2,3 and human type alpha-2,6 receptors [DOI: 10.1038/nbt1375 PMID: 18176555].
- The persisting preference for both avian- and human-type receptors of HPAI H7N9 viruses may result in their circulation in poultry and possible transmission among humans.

It has already been observed that the number of human cases of influenza A/H7N9 has increased in the current wave with more opportunities for the virus to evolve and potentially develop better transmission fitness. - Mod.UBA
