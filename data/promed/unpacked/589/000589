Abstract
--------
In March 2014, a 20-year-old man was diagnosed with cutaneous diphtheria at St. Olavs University Hospital in Trondheim, Norway on his return from Africa. The man had been in Mozambique since autumn 2013 and had experienced persistent skin ulcer infections. His was in good general health. Toxin-producing _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ was grown from a wound specimen. He had completed the national childhood vaccination programme and received a diphtheria vaccine booster dose in 2005. Screening of close contacts revealed an asymptomatic person colonised with non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_.

Case report and laboratory diagnosis
------------------------------------
On 23 Mar 2014, one week after his arrival from Mozambique to Norway, a 20-year-old man presented at the Municipal Emergency Department in Trondheim with a history of skin ulcer, located on the right big toe, that had lasted since approximately 5 to 6 weeks. He had been working in an orphanage in Mozambique with 3 other schoolmates from Norway since autumn in the previous year. The patient recalled having had similar leg ulcers lasting for several weeks from October 2013, acquired after his arrival at the orphanage. He could remember some insect bites, as well as minor trauma after he had played football in open toe sandals during his stay there. These ulcers healed after he had received amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid orally for one week, prescribed by a local physician in Mozambique.

At the Emergency Department in Trondheim, the examining physician suspected an infection caused by pyogenic bacteria and a wound specimen was requested for aerobic culture and screening for methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA). A treatment consisting of oral dicloxacillin tablets 500 mg 4 times daily was initiated.

After 24 hours of incubation on blood agar and chocolate agar, abundant growth of almost pure culture of small, 1-2 mm in diameter, white, non-haemolytic colonies. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) on a Microflex LT mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) with BioTyper 3.2 software database, the isolate was identified as _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_.

On Tinsdale selective medium, the isolate displayed characteristic deep brown colonies with halos after 24 hours of incubation.

Laboratory investigation at the National Reference Laboratory
-------------------------------------------------------------
Diphtheria toxin tox gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [1] on 28 Mar [2014]. Diphtheria toxin production was analysed by modified Elek test [2] and reported positive on 29 Mar [2014]. The strain was identified as _C. diphtheriae_ biotype mitis by API Coryne v3 system.

Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for benzylpenicillin was 0.125 mg/L determined by Epsilometer (E) test on a blood agar plate. The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) have no species specific breakpoints for _C. diphtheriae_, but the strain can be categorised as susceptible to benzylpenicillin according the EUCAST recommendations for non-species related clinical breakpoints [3].

Patient follow-up
-----------------
He received intravenous benzylpenicillin treatment 1 million IU x 4, during the 24 hours hospitalisation and oral phenoxymethylpenicillin 660 mg 2 tablets 3 times daily for 2 weeks after discharge.

Control measures and contact tracing
------------------------------------
After discharge, he was isolated in his home until 2 control cultures (throat, nasal and wound swab) taken on 9 Apr [2014] and on 10 Apr [2014] and cultivated on Tinsdale selective medium, were negative on 15 Apr [2014].

Tracing of close contacts was initiated on 25 Mar [2014] and oral erythromycin capsules 500 mg 2 times daily for 7 days were given prophylactically. A booster diphtheria vaccine dose was offered to all contacts who received the last diphtheria vaccine dose more than 5 years prior and complete vaccination to those who had not been vaccinated in the primary childhood programme. Observation of close contacts in their homes (for fever, throat pain) in the following 7 days after they had been exposed to the index patient was recommended. Throat and nasal specimens were also collected from these close contacts, which included 11 close family members, 4 friends and the primary examining physician. The specimens were cultivated, as well as patient control samples, on Tinsdale selective medium at St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim; all were found negative for _C. diphtheriae_.

The index patient was attending the boarding school in Hurdal (located 70 km [about 43 miles] north of Oslo), and on his arrival to Norway, before he visited his family, the boarding school was the accommodation where he spent the 1st week of his vacation. During this week, the index patient and other schoolmates had eaten together in the kitchen of the boarding school and some of them had shared the bathrooms and sleeping rooms. Three other schoolmates, who had been working in Mozambique at the same time as the index patient, had also arrived to the boarding school. Taking this into consideration and according information obtained by local Medical Community Officer in Hurdal, throat and nasal specimens from 53 close contacts: 28 schoolmates and 25 other contacts -- employees in the school and close contacts out of the boarding school, were collected and sent to Akershus University Hospital in Oslo. All samples were cultivated on Tinsdale selective agar media (Tinsdale agar base, Oxoid product nr.CM 0487) and were found negative, except one throat swab from one of his schoolmates, a travel companion in Mozambique. This isolate was sent to NIPH and identified as _C. diphtheriae_ biotype mitis by API Coryne v3 system (BioMerieux, France, code: 1010324) and supplementary tests. The isolate had the same biotype as the isolate from the index case, but differed by being lactose positive and toxin negative (both with tox gene PCR and modified Elek test).

This schoolmate, who had been working in Mozambique at the same orphanage as the index patient, may also have been infected during his stay there with another strain of _C. diphtheriae_, the non-toxigenic one, but was asymptomatic and discovered by screening. Molecular diagnostic that is planned in the near future, the genome sequencing of both isolates, should reveal if it was the identical strain infected by lysogenic tox phage in the index patient or 2 different strains.

After diagnosing _C. diphtheriae_ throat colonisation, the vaccination history of the contact patient was reviewed; he had received a booster diphtheria vaccine dose in 2012 and was not offered a new one. He received the oral erythromycin capsules 500 mg 2 times daily for 7 days and was isolated in the boarding school (separate room and bathroom), until 2 control throat specimens sampled at different times were negative. The vaccination history of the other 52 persons included in screening in Hurdal was reviewed and 29 close contacts who had been vaccinated more than 5 years prior received a booster diphtheria vaccine dose. All close contacts were given the oral erythromycin capsules 500 mg 2 times daily for 7 days, with some exceptions (one pregnant woman and one child).

One of the schoolmates, who had also been working in Mozambique at the same time as others, had noticed skin ulcer on his leg, but in his case, the ulcer healed spontaneously and at the time of screening, the wound swab taken from the scar area was negative for _C. diphtheriae_.

Background and epidemiological situation
----------------------------------------
Diphtheria is caused by toxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_. It can result in an acute bacterial toxic infection of the upper respiratory tract or in cutaneous infection, which is generally a milder variant of the disease.

Cutaneous diphtheria is usually described as a chronic ulcer, often following insect bites or minor trauma. The incubation period is on average 2 to 4 days for respiratory tract diphtheria but is not so well defined for cutaneous infection. Immunised persons seldom develop systemic toxic manifestations and the slow absorption of toxin from skin lesions induces production of high antibody levels [5]. Isolation of _C. diphtheriae_ by culture may be difficult due to normal throat or skin flora and other pathogens present; therefore selective media should be employed when diphtheria is suspected.

In reports from several European countries [6-9], isolates causing cutaneous diphtheria were mainly imported and toxigenic. Epidemiological control and vaccination are important measures in reducing the possibility of establishment of a reservoir for secondary transmission of both cutaneous and respiratory diphtheria [10].

Diphtheria is rarely diagnosed in Norway due to high vaccine coverage. During the period from 1975 to 2013 only 5 cases of throat diphtheria or colonisation have been reported to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable diseases (MSIS). In 1992, a young man from the county of Finnmark was infected after contact with a person from Russia. In 2008, a mother and her child were diagnosed with throat diphtheria after visiting Latvia. After their return to Norway, the father and one other child were infected [11,12].

A brief report of the present case has been covered in the bulletins of NIPH on 2 Apr 2014 as the 1st diagnosed toxigenic cutaneous diphtheria in Norway [13].

Discussion
----------
Cutaneous diphtheria is endemic in some eastern European countries (Latvia, Russia) and many parts of the world (Brazil, Eastern Mediterranean region, Haiti, the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, Nigeria and Philippines) [5] and physicians should be aware of the possibility of diphtheria in patients returning from visits/travel in endemic areas. _C. diphtheriae_ can survive up to 3 months in floor dust [14] and in endemic areas with tropical climate this can be a likely source of infection/transmission.

The report illustrates the importance of diagnosing diphtheria cases as soon as possible, given the amount of resources needed for subsequent contact-tracing and control measures, which is likely to increase when detection of an initial case is delayed.

Non-toxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_ are recently recognised as emerging pathogens across Europe [17]. Such strains, however, can convert to toxigenicity by infection with lysogenic tox phage [18,19]. The circulation of resident non-toxigenic strains in the community thus can represent an ongoing risk by conversion to highly virulent strains following lysogenisation.

[_Corynebacterium diphtheriae__ is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus with 3 biotypes -- gravis, intermedius, and mitis. _C. diphtheriae_ causes respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected (lysogenized) by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The toxin is responsible for the major complications -- myocarditis (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (e.g., paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ can also harbor diphtheria toxin genes and cause zoonotic infection in humans.

Either toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_ can cause cutaneous diphtheria. Cutaneous diphtheria due to toxigenic strains is endemic in tropical countries and has been responsible for infections in travelers to these countries, even in those who are vaccinated. In the United States, cutaneous diphtheria has been most often associated with homeless persons and the organisms isolated from recent cases were nontoxigenic (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Cutaneous diphtheria is characterized by skin ulcers, which are usually chronic and may become coinfected with other pathogens such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus pyogenes_. Cutaneous diphtheria is uncommonly complicated by toxic cardiac or neurologic manifestations.

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding. The organisms can survive in dust and clothing for up to 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Shedding from cutaneous lesions can cause respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts.

Cutaneous diphtheria is treated with erythromycin or penicillin for 14 days. The disease is usually not contagious 48 hours after starting antibiotics. Elimination of the organism should be documented by 2 consecutive negative cultures after therapy is completed. Management of contacts of cutaneous diphtheria should include screening for possible respiratory or cutaneous diphtheria and obtaining nasopharyngeal cultures for _C. diphtheriae_. For close contacts, especially household contacts, a diphtheria booster, appropriate for age, is given. Contacts should also receive antibiotics -- benzathine penicillin G or a 7- to 10-day course of oral erythromycin. Identified carriers in the community should also receive antibiotics. However, if the strain is shown to be nontoxigenic, the CDC recommends that investigation of contacts can be discontinued (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Since 1980, cutaneous diphtheria is not a nationally reportable disease (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt01-dip.html). - Mod.ML
