There are 5 members of the Herpesviridae that infect the horse. EHV1 and
EHV4 are most common. Nomenclature of these viruses is frequently
confusing, particularly in common parlance. Classically, EHV1 ("equine
abortion virus" in older literature) is responsible for late-term abortion
and occasionally myeloencephalopathy (neurological disease), while EHV4
(often referred to as "equine rhinopneumonitis virus") is considered
responsible for respiratory disease primarily. A type-specific ELISA can
differentiate between EHV1 and EHV4.
Current EHV1/4 vaccines are not fully protective against disease, though
clinical signs, duration of shedding, and quantity of virus shed can be
reduced. The risk of abortion and respiratory disease outbreaks are also
reduced. Importantly, vaccination does not offer protection against
neurological manifestations of disease.
