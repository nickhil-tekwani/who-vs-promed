Otter tests positive for rabies
-------------------------------
The Vermont State Department of Health says an otter captured after
attacking a Guilford, VT, teenager has tested positive for rabies. The
animal was tested after an incident last weekend [6-7 Dec 2008] in which
the high school student, who lives near a pond, got out of her car at her
home and the animal circled around her before jumping on her leg. The girl
got a few scratches trying to get it off, but she wasn't bitten in the
Saturday {6 Dec 2008} incident. Typically, rabies is transmitted by a
direct bite.

On Tuesday [9 Dec 2008], the state confirmed that the animal -- which was
euthanized -- had rabies.

[Cases of human contact with rabid otters are rare but not unknown in
eastern states (see ProMED-mail references below). In the current incident
the victim of the attack was not bitten and provided there was no exposure
of her scratched skin to saliva, transmission of rabies virus is unlikely.
It is presumed that the unfortunate girl was offered post exposure
prophylactic treatment.

Potter and colleagues (Wilderness Environ Med 2007; 18(1): 41-4) have
reported that as a result of successful restoration and conservation
programs deployed by state and federal agencies, populations of the North
American river otter (_Lontra canadensis_) are increasing in many states.
Recreational activities such as swimming, boating, and fishing increase the
likelihood of human interactions with this mustelid. Otters tend to avoid
areas of high human activity, and occur at low population densities.
Therefore, interactions with humans are rare, and aggressive encounters by
otters are even less frequent.

Overall rabies infection of river otters is likely to be rare. Kimber et
al, (J Zoo Wildl Med 2000; 31(2): 168-75) in a serological survey of blood
samples collected in 1995/6 from 64 wild North American river otters had a
low prevalence of antibodies to most canine viruses and none to rabies virus.
