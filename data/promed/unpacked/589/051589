UNHELPFUL CRITICISM
*******************
Date: Wed, 23 July 1997
From: C.H. Calisher <ccalisher@vines.colostate.edu>
As Moderator-of-the-Day, I received this message from Jack Woodall as a
courtesy, for information only.
>I may have been impressed by your slick format, but two weeks into a
>sleeping sickness outbreak in the Sudan and two deaths of hantavirus in WA.
>have not recieved a note. sorry you guys havn't been up. bye
We also get these sorts of messages from time to time, from people who swim
in the shallow end of the gene pool. Rather than hit the Delete key, I
decided to post it; I find it instructive. Seems this person ("an
unregistered user") logged onto another network service and didn't find
anything on a supposed sleeping sickness outbreak in Sudan or human
hantavirus infection in the State of Washington and sent a nasty note, rather
than report some details. This is not helpful. Jack Woodall has asked Angie
Lee, one of our very active correspondents, to check into the rumor about
sleeping sickness in Sudan. She will get back to us ASAP, I am sure.
Meanwhile, if anyone out there knows anything about a sleeping sickness
outbreak in Sudan, please let us know. We have already posted the hantavirus
cases on ProMED-mail.
BTW: "sorry" and "bye" should have been capitalized, there should have been
no period after "WA", "recieved" and "havn't" were mispelled, and "death of
hantavirus" is greatly exaggerated.
