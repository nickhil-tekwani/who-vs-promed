Newcastle disease confirmed in pheasants
----------------------------------------
An outbreak of Newcastle disease [NCD], a notifiable disease affecting poultry,
has been confirmed in a number of pheasants intended for shooting in Surrey.
The Health Protection Agency has confirmed that NCD does not pose a significant
threat to human health.
All the pheasants, which were being bred for shooting, are to be culled as part
of a system of strict control measures aimed at swiftly containing any outbreak
required under EU law.
The premises are not close to any significant poultry production units. The
birds will be killed humanely.
Immediate action is being taken to track the movements of other pheasant
consignments which may have come from same original source to eliminate any
risk of the disease spreading.
Although NCD is infectious to other birds, the potential threat to a major part
of the UK egg and poultry industry is minimal, as large-scale producers
routinely vaccinate their birds against the disease and any vulnerable birds
could be vaccinated within a week.
We have suspended issue of export health certificates to non-EU countries where
they require freedom from NCD.
However, Defra vets are working closely with colleagues in the poultry
industry, the NFU [National Farmers Union], game shooting bodies and others, to
ensure any threat to smaller-scale keepers, and others who may not routinely
vaccinate, is minimised.
State Veterinary Service are tracing all known contacts connected with the
original consignment from France and checking for any clinical symptoms of the
disease. No other suspect cases have been identified so far. Restrictions have
been imposed upon the farm where the disease has been confirmed, which includes
movement restrictions and biosecurity measures. In addition, a Declaratory
Order has been made declaring an infected area and establishing a surveillance
zone of 10 km around the infected premises to impose restriction to prevent the
spread of disease.
Chief veterinary officer Debby Reynolds, said: "All keepers of birds should
ensure they maintain high standards of biosecurity, consider whether they wish
to vaccinate, consult their vet advisors and report any suspicion of disease to
the State Veterinary Service".
"I would like to make it clear this is not avian flu".
Editorial notes:
Newcastle disease symptoms
--------------------------
The clinical signs in birds affected with NCD can be very variable. The disease
can be present in a very acute form with sudden onset and high mortality or as
a mild disease with respiratory distress or a drop in egg production as the
only detectable clinical signs. A sub-clinical (asymptomatic) form of NCD and
many intermediate forms of the disease can also occur. The clinical signs
include depression, lack of appetite, respiratory distress with beak gaping,
coughing, sneezing, snicking, gurgling and rattling, yellowish green diarrhoea
and nervous signs. In laying flocks a sudden drop in egg production with a high
proportion of eggs laid with abnormal (soft) shells is often an early sign of
disease. Young birds are particularly susceptible and mortality can be heavy,
with survivors often exhibiting permanent nervous signs.
How is it contracted?
---------------------
The disease is spread by:
- direct contact with secretions and excretions, especially faeces, from
infected birds.
- contaminated feed, water, implements, premises, human clothing, etc.
Why is it notifiable (why is this significant)?
-----------------------------------------------
NCD is a highly infectious disease of birds caused by a paramyxovirus. Birds
affected by this disease are fowls, turkeys, geese, ducks, pheasants, guinea
fowl and other wild and captive birds, including ratites such [as] ostriches,
emus and rhea.
How many cases have there been in Britain?
------------------------------------------
In Great Britain, isolated cases of this disease were first reported in the
1930s. From 1947 outbreaks occurred here over the next 30 years, and there were
further isolated cases in 1984 and 1996-7. Information on outbreak statistics
is available on the Defra website.
This disease does however remain a problem worldwide. Recent serious outbreaks
of NCD occurred in Denmark in 2002, and in California in 2003 [see refs.

[According to DEFRA's ststistics, the last outbreaks of NCD in the UK occurred
in 1997, involving fowls and turkeys in 11 foci situated in 6 counties; see
