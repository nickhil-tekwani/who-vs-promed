The Southwest Utah Public Health Department [SWUPHD] has confirmed a case of hantavirus infection in Kane County. Hantavirus incidents are rare in the 5-county region, with the last case being reported 4 years ago in Iron County. The virus is found in the droppings, urine, and saliva of rodents, usually deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_).

"This time of year, a lot of people start spring cleaning in places where rodent droppings are found, such as sheds, barns, and cabins," Dr David Blodgett, SWUPHD health officer, said. "If hantavirus is present, it can be inhaled and cause respiratory illness within a few weeks."

Hantavirus infection, called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS], starts with flu-like symptoms followed by difficulty breathing, and can be life-threatening. Treatment includes intensive hospital care to deal with the respiratory distress. [Sin Nombre] hantavirus is not known to spread person-to-person.

Hantavirus infection can be prevented by avoiding contact with rodents, including nests and droppings.

- seal openings in structures and set mouse traps
- allow an infested area to air out for at least 30 minutes before cleaning
- clean droppings by spraying with disinfectant (1 part bleach to 10 parts water works well), then wipe up with disposable paper towels
- wear gloves while cleaning or when handling nests or dead mice

[Although not stated in the above report, the virus involved in this HPS case was most likely Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is endemic in deer mice including in Utah. Contact with the Southwest Utah Public Health Department indicated that the patient is an adult from Kane County, Utah. The infection was most likely acquired by contact with SNV-contaminated rodent droppings. Kane County, Utah, is not far from the area where the 1st cases of SNV HPS were recognized in 1993.
