691 dengue fever cases have been reported so far this year [2009] in
Jeddah alone, despite concerted efforts by the government to contain
the disease, Al-Madinah newspaper said in a report published yesterday
[16 Jun 2009]. Dr Hussein Al-Bar, head of the Environment and Health
Committee at the Municipal Council, said from January until May
[2009], 691 dengue fever cases were reported in different parts of the
city. "At this rate we expect the cases to reach 950 this year,"
Al-Bar said, emphasizing the need to take intensive measures by
municipal and health authorities to contain the disease. He added
that 30 new cases were reported in Thuwal.

Al-Bar warned the public against laxity in taking precautions. He
said sewage lakes in streets breed mosquitoes that spread the
disease. Overflowing septic tanks are common in many residential
districts of south Jeddah. Residents of the area have complained
about the worsening situation and called for quick intervention by
the authorities. "The field teams of the Jeddah municipality are not
doing what is required to correct the situation," one citizen said,
while calling for immediate action. A resident of Ghulail said the
district has been suffering from overflowing septic tanks for long.
"Many people have contacted the municipality's operation room to
remove sewage from streets but they have failed to take any action,"
he said. [Another man] said many people in his neighborhood have been
affected and are receiving treatment in hospitals.

Muhammad Al-Yami, public relations manager at the municipality, said
his organization has launched a systematic campaign against dengue
fever. "We are focusing on exterminating mosquitoes from residential
areas by spraying insecticides," he said. Al-Yami said the
municipality has published pamphlets in 5 languages to enlighten the
public, including expatriates.

The largest number of 1308 dengue fever cases was reported in 2006,
the paper said. The number of cases then fell to 243 in 2007 but went
up again to 811 in 2008. An average of 200 cases are now reported a
month in Jeddah. During the last 2 months 80 new cases were reported
in the holy city of Makka.

[Although overflowing septic tanks and sewage in the streets may
provide breeding areas for mosquitoes, these are not the breeding
sites for _Aedes aegypti_, the dengue virus vector, which breeds in
water catchments and storage containers in and immediately around
houses. Spraying will provide only temporary reduction of _Ae.
aegypti_ adult populations. Elimination or treatment of breeding
sites is required for effective control of this vector.

Espirito Santo has 288 reported dengue cases per day in 2009
------------------------------------------------------------
According to the data from the Environmental Surveillance Nucleus of
the state Secretariat of Health (SESA), Espirito Santo has registered
43 536 reported cases of dengue since the beginning of the year
[2009] up to 1 Jun [2009]. Given that the period covers 151
consecutive days, there have been about 288 dengue cases reported per
day in the state. The municipalities with the greatest number of
cases reported are, in order, Serra, Vila Velha, Vitoria, Nova
Venecia, and Cariacica.

As of Friday, 12 [Jun 2009], there have been 1490 suspected serious
dengue cases registered that have recovered. Of these, 278 were
confirmed as dengue with complications, 138 as DHF, and 22 were
negative and discarded as dengue [cases]. The other [cases] are under
investigation.

in 2009 there have been 33 [dengue] deaths confirmed by SESA and 21
are under investigation by the Secretariat Committee to Investigate
Deaths. Of these 33 deaths, 17 were due to DHF and registered in the
municipalities of Serra, Linhares, Colatina, Vila Velha, Guarapari,
Nova Venecia, Conceicao da Barra, and Vitoria. The other 16 deaths,
classified as dengue with complications, occurred in Vila Velha,
Cariacica, Baixo Guandu, Nova Venecia, Vitoria, and Serra.

Dengue with complications is any case that does not fit the criteria
for classification as DHF and the diagnosis of classical dengue is
unsatisfactory given the severity of the clinical and laboratory
picture. In this situation, any one of the signs that are
characteristic of symptoms [atypical for dengue] include neurological
disorders, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, liver failure, and
gastrointestinal bleeding, for example. The analyses of cases under
investigation are completed within 90 days, starting at the date of
death.

Over 21 000 dengue fever cases reported
---------------------------------------
More than 21 000 people in Viet Nam have contracted dengue fever so
far this year [2009], and 20 have died, according to reports from the
National Institute of Epidemiology and Pasteur institutes across the
country.

The figures show a 46.7 percent increase year-on-year, and the number
of people dying of the mosquito-borne illness is 4 more than the same
period last year [2008]. [According to PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet
Nam (05) 20080612.1865 from 12 Jun 2008, at that time there was
mention of 11 deaths attributable to dengue during the 1st 5 months of
2008, and in a follow up posting on 25 Jun 2008 Dengue - Viet Nam (06)
20080625.1962 there was mention of 20 deaths attributable to dengue as
of 25 Jun 2008. - Mod.MPP]

According to the Hanoi Healthcare Preventative Center, the capital
city is facing a potential outbreak of the disease with 80 cases
reported so far this year [2009].

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health said the epidemic will continue in
the south, as rain combined with hot, humid weather creates
conditions for mosquitoes to flourish.
