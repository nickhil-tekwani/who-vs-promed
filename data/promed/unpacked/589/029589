[1] Vaccine matching results for FMDV 'O/ME-SA/Ind-2001' strain
Date: Fri 29 Aug 2014
From: Donald King <donald.king@pirbright.ac.uk> [edited]


Table of the latest FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] vaccine matching results for 'O/ME-SA/Ind-2001' viruses currently circulating in North Africa, West EurAsia and South Asia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following in-vitro vaccine matching results for the FMDV strain 'O/ME-SA/Ind-2001' have been kindly obtained from the WRLFMD, The Pirbright Institute, pertaining to 9 recent isolates from 4 countries and 5 vaccine strains:

Field isolate // O-3039 // O Manisa // O BFS // O-TAW-98 // O-TUR-5-09
--------------------------------------------------------------------
LIB 17/2013 // yes // no // no // no // yes
LIB 22/2013 // yes // yes // - // yes // yes
NEP 13/2012 // yes // Brdl // - // yes // yes
NEP 21/2013 // no // no // - // yes // yes
NEP 18/2013 // yes // no // - // yes // yes
NEP 1/2014 // yes // no // yes // yes // yes
SAU 1/2014 // yes // no // - // yes // yes
UAE 1/2014 // yes // Brdl // Brdl // yes // yes
UAE 2/2014 // yes // Brdl // - // yes // yes

Key for results: yes = match; no = no match; Brdl = Borderline results; - = not done.

[We are most grateful to the Pirbright Institute and to Drs King and Ludi for their exemplary response to the ProMED-mail request for information on the vaccine matching results referring to the invasive foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 Lineage. This virus is known to have spread from the Indian sub-continent (India, Bhutan, Nepal) into West Eurasia and North Africa (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria). It spread in the latter 2 countries in spite of previous vaccinations.

From the presented results, it appears that the vaccine strain 'O/TUR/5/09', and, to a somewhat lesser extent, 'O-3039' and 'O/TAW/98', match the addressed Indian strain, while 'O BFS' matching is questionable and 'O Manissa' seems not to match. These results are helpful in explaining the current situation in Tunisia and Algeria, where none of the 3 matching vaccine strains has been included in earlier vaccinations (see also item 2 further). The results are also of significance to other countries in the region, particularly Morocco which is currently facing the risk of FMD spread from neighbouring Algeria, and to Middle Eastern countries, as well as for the policy makers of European vaccine banks. - Mod.AS]

Planned delivery to the place of destination: 21 or 22 Aug [2014].

2. (Slide 27): Delivery of FMD vaccine to Algeria
100 000 doses of trivalent vaccine (O1-BFS 1860/ A Iran 05/ SAT2 ERI Africa) from the EU antigen and vaccine bank (Merial)
Delivered to the place of destination on 19 Aug [2014].

900 000 doses of bivalent vaccine (O/TUR, A/TUR) by MSD in cooperation with Dutch veterinary services
Planned delivery date to the place of destination not yet confirmed.

[According to the above presentation, considerable quantities of a vaccine including the 'O1-BFS 1860' vaccine strain, which -- according to the vaccine matching results -- does not seem to be a recommended match for 'O/ME-SA/Ind-2001', are being currently applied in Tunisia. In case this information is accurate, a clarification will help. Small quantities of the same vaccine have been supplied to Algeria as well, but the larger quantity recently received there includes the matching 'O/TUR' vaccine strain. However, as reported earlier (see commentary in posting 20140811.2680392), a large quantity (probably 1.6 million doses) of a bivalent O/A vaccine applied earlier during 2014 in Algeria, included the vaccine strain 'O1 Manisa'. This vaccine strain does not seem to match the circulating Indian strain.

It will be interesting to note which vaccine strain is included in the vaccine(s) currently applied in the preventive vaccination campaign in Morocco. The authorities there seem to have taken early notice of the epidemiological situation in the other Maghreb countries. According to a recent (29 Aug 2014) media report, the Moroccan preventive campaign of anti-FMD vaccination in the fully susceptible cattle population reached 40 percent of its target, exceeding 85 percent in the border provinces (Oujda, Berkane, Jerrada, Figuig and Errachidia). Additional information on the Moroccan campaign, launched 18 Aug 2014, can be found (in French) at http://www.lematin.ma/exclusif/2014/sante_la-campagne-de-vaccination-anti-fievre-aphteuse-atteint-40--de-son-objectif/208150.html. It would also be interesting to note if small ruminants, at least on the eastern front, are included in the vaccination campaign - Mod.AS
