The El Paso County Health Department has confirmed several prairie
dog sites are infected with plague. The sites are at Schriever Air
Force Base and on neighboring property, in eastern El Paso County.
Plague is commonly found in the Western US in small ground animals
that have been bitten by fleas.
Human cases aren't common, but plague can be transmitted to people
from infected animals. Since 1941, there have been 55 cases statewide
of human plague.
According to the Health Department, take the following precautions to
prevent infection:
* Avoid contact with sick or dead prairie dogs and rabbits.
* Keep a close eye on pets, and make sure they are treated for fleas
and properly secured when outdoors.
* Do not linger in areas populated by prairie dogs, rabbits, or
similar animals. Also do not attempt to catch, feed, or play with them.
* Treat pants, socks, shoe tops, arms, and legs with insect repellent
when engaged in outdoor activities, such as hiking or jogging.
* Be aware of dead animal smells or heavy fly populations indicating
animal "die-offs," which are a key sign of plague. Report such areas
to the Health Department.

Black-tailed prairie dogs (_Cynomys ludovicianus_) are numerous in Colorado.
The causative bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is transmitted to people
through fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when
infected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable. Rock squirrels
(_Spermophilus variegates_) are closely related to California ground
squirrels and are the most significant plague host in Colorado. Their
principal flea _Diamanus montanus_ is an aggressive parasite and will
readily bite other animals and people. Domestic cats and dogs can
also contract plague by infective fleas. They may carry infected
fleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a
direct source of infection.
In humans, the incubation period (interval between exposure and
appearance of symptoms) is usually 2-6 days. Typical symptoms include
sudden onset of fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches,
nausea, vomiting, and a general feeling of systemic illness. Extreme
pain and swelling in a lymph node draining the infection site is a
suggestive symptom of bubonic plague. (The swollen, painful node is
called a "bubo"). Other forms of the disease include septicemic
illness with no bubo developing, and pneumonic plague in which the
lungs are involved. The septicemic and pneumonic forms are the most
serious. In addition, pneumonic plague can be spread by inhalation of
infective droplets expelled by another human or animal with plague pneumonia.
Treatment with antibiotics is effective during the early stages of
disease. If diagnosis and appropriate treatment are delayed,
life-threatening complications may follow. A doctor or hospital
emergency room should be consulted as soon as symptoms appear and a
history of exposure to potentially infected animals is very important
in evaluating the risk from plague. Anti-plague vaccine is not
readily available. It may be advantageous for researchers or people
working with plague-infected animals to be vaccinated but it is not
indicated for the general public.
It is an opportune time to remember to treat your pets, cats, and
dogs with appropriate flea control. There are many excellent choices
of products to rid your pet of fleas. Be sure to consult your
veterinarian as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and
puppies, even resulting in fatalities.
According to
<http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=vpcfour>:
One human case was reported in conjunction with a previous outbreak
of plague among urban populations of fox squirrels (_Scirus niger_)
in Denver during 1968.
El Paso County is south of Denver and can be located on the map of Colorado at
