In southern India, the Nipah virus has made 3 new victims in recent days. The epidemic, which is currently limited to part of Kerala, worries the health authorities of the state that thought to have had it mastered. This virus, spread by a frugivorous bat, has already killed 16 people in Kerala since mid-May [2018].

The Kerala government is again on high alert after 3 more deaths since [Thu 31 May 2018] from people infected with the Nipah virus and 6 new patients were admitted [Fri Jun 1 2018] in a hospital in Kozhikode, a city in northern Kerala recognized as the epicenter of this epidemic. Authorities now fear a 2nd wave of infections, as the spread of the virus seemed to be under control early this week.

Nearly 1300 people, who have been in contact with people infected with the virus, are under observation.

If these 6 admitted patients are infected with Nipah virus, one hopes that the precautionary measures are now in place and effective. Unfortunately, early in this outbreak, a nurse was infected when caring for Nipah virus infected patients, so the risk of nosocomial transmission is real.
