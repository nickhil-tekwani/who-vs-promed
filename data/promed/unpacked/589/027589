Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 50 / 0 / 0 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: In one of his two houses, the owner observed a drop-in egg production from 85 per cent to 65 per cent over 2 weeks.

Control measures
Measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping-out, zoning, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, official destruction of animal products.

Diagnostic test results:
National Reference Centre for Diseases of Poultry and Rabbits, University of Zurich (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result

[Newcastle disease virus (NDv) is very versatile. Airborne aerosol infection occurs. Vaccinated birds can appear to be healthy while shedding virus, granted significantly less than unvaccinated infected birds; thus, you can have virus contaminated recycled-poultry meals; faecal contaminated containers, transport, and vacated poultry housing inadequately cleaned and disinfected ready to infect the incoming birds.

Back in the early 1970s Bill Allan and I with colleagues from Porton Down (Wiltshire, England) caught NDv 90 m downwind of infected housed poultry. Later with a different team we showed that the 1972 ND epizootic in county Antrim (Northern Ireland) came from feed stored in a warehouse in Rotterdam port (Netherlands), presumably from infected wild birds roosting in the warehouse. Tracing the probable source of outbreaks is important so as to maintain control, and proactively vaccinate.
