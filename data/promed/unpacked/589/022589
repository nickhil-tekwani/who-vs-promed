So far in 2015, 9 new [Zika virus infection] cases have occurred in Sincelejo and 3 possible infections in Barranquilla city. The arrival of Zika virus has begun to worry health authorities on the Caribbean Coast. In Sincelejo, there are now 9 officially reported cases. "[Zika virus infections] are peculiar in that a person could be infected and there are no [clinical] manifestations that permit [a conclusive diagnosis], " said Nayibe Padilla, Health Secretariat in Sucre.

According to the Secretariat of Health in Barranquilla, which is supporting preventive work, the virus is contracted more frequently in hot regions. In most of the cases, the symptoms are so mild that they could be confused with those of influenza.

"The most important thing is that the citizens who present with symptoms go to the doctor. The only way to control increases in [the population of vector] mosquitoes is to eliminate breeding sites in homes," Alma Solano, Secretariat of Health in Barranquilla stated.

Some infected patients state that the symptoms are similar to those of chikungunya [virus infections]. The Ministry of Health In Colombia indicated that there are 129 confirmed cases of Zika [virus infection].

[Zika virus infections have become increasingly widespread in Colombia in a relatively brief period of time. The 28 Oct 2015 ProMED-mail post indicated that the Colombian National Institute of Health confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the departments of Bolivar, Cordoba, Norte de Santander, San Andres and Sucre. The municipalities where the virus is present are Arjona, Cartagena, Cordoba, Santa Rosa, Turbaco, Monteria, San Cayetano, San Andres and Sincelejo (archive no. 20151030.3756619). Unfortunately, there are no epidemiological barriers to halt the spread of Zika virus either in the country, or to neighboring countries, in areas where chikungunya and dengue viruses are transmitted -- because vector mosquitoes are abundant.
